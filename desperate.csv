Speaker,Line
Bree,"There we go. Feel better? Lynette, you were saying?"
Bree,"Paul, Zachary."
Bree,"It was no trouble at all. Now the basket with the red ribbon is just for you and Zachary. It's got rolls, muffins, breakfast type things."
Bree,"Well, the least I could do is make sure you boys had a decent meal to look forward to in the morning. I know you're out of your minds with grief."
Bree,"Of course, I will need the baskets back once you're done."
Bree,"Oh yes, page one of the philanderer's handbook."
Bree,"This is half the reason I joined the NRA. Well, when Rex started going to those medical conferences, I wanted at the back of his mind that he had a loving wife at home, with a loaded Smith and Wesson."
Bree,"So Susan, is he going to stop seeing that woman?"
Bree,"Susan? Susan. I was just saying Paul wants us to go over on Friday. He needs us to go through Mary Alice's closet, and help pack up her things. He says he can't face doing it by himself."
Bree,Are you OK?
Bree,"Danielle, there is nothing abnormal about basil puree."
Bree,"First of all, your father can't eat onions, he's deadly allergic. And I won't even dignify your navy bean suggestion. So. How's the osso bucco?"
Bree,"It's OK? Andrew, I spent 3 hours cooking this meal. How do you think it makes me feel when you say it's OK, in that sullen tone?"
Bree,Excuse me?
Bree,You'd rather I serve pork and beans?
Bree,Are you doing drugs?
Bree,That certainly would explain why you're always locked in the bathroom.
Bree,"Rex. Seeing as you're the head of this household, I would really appreciate you saying something."
Bree,"Andrew, Danielle, napkins?"
Bree,Andrew. This is family time. I think we should all--
Bree,"I know that you think I'm angry about coming here, but I'm not. I mean, the kids wanted a change of pace, something fun. I get it. Probably will want something healthier tomorrow night though, I'm thinking about chicken?"
Bree,Um. Think I'll go get your salad for you.
Bree,"Okay, well, I got you the honey mustard dressing; the ranch looked just a little bit suspect."
Bree,"If you think I'm gonna discuss the dissolution of my marriage in a place where the restrooms are labeled ""chicks"" and ""dudes "", you're out of your mind."
Bree,What do you mean what's in this? It's salad.
Bree,What?
Bree,Oh wait?
Bree,"Yes, well, I feel badly about that. I told you, Mrs. Huber came over and I got distracted. It was a mistake."
Bree,What's that supposed to mean?
Bree,These need water.
Bree,"Susan, are you alright? You look awful."
Bree,We all do.
Bree,"It's a letter, addressed to Mary Alice."
Bree,"Oh my god, she got it the day she died."
Bree,"It's a letter, addressed to Mary Alice."
Bree,"Well, we could do it gently. We could tell him about it over coffee and pastry."
Bree,"Well if it was a joke, it was in very poor taste."
Bree,"It's the age-old question, isn't it? How much do we really wanna know about our neighbours?"
Bree,Good. I have a question for you.
Bree,Do you remember when you proposed?
Bree,"We sat on Skyline Drive and drank a bottle of apple wine. And when we finished it, you turned to me and you said, If you marry me, Bree Mason, I promise to love you for the rest of my life. And even though I was engaged to Ty Grant, and even though my father didn't like you, I said yes."
Bree,"You're gonna cancel the meeting with that divorce lawyer, and we're gonna find ourselves a marriage counsellor."
Bree,You promised.
Bree,"Good, I'm gonna go make myself some, uh, warm milk. Would you like something to drink?"
Bree,"Hi, I'm Bree, and this is my husband Rex. And I brought you some homemade pot pourri."
Bree,"And so, there's just the four of us. My oldest son Andrew is 16, Danielle is 15, and?"
Bree,"Oh, have I?"
Bree,"Um, Doc,um?"
Bree,What? I-I'm sorry.
Bree,"Oh, I.."
Bree,Of course not.
Bree,"Oh. Well, I wish he had called me."
Bree,"What? Oh, oh, oh no, thank you. I have some things that I, I need to do today."
Bree,"Uh, yeah, I'm sure."
Bree,Dr. Goldfine. There is something you can do for me.
Bree,Take off your coat.
Bree,"Oh, who cares what he thinks? I took psychology in college, we learned all about Freud. A miserable human being."
Bree,"Well, think about it. He grew up in the late 1800's, there were no appliances back then. His mother had to do everything by hand, just backbreaking work from sunup to sundown. Not to mention the countless other sacrifices she probably had to make to take care of her family. And what does he do? He grows up and becomes famous, peddling a theory that the problems of most adults can be traced back to something awful their mother has done. There you go."
Bree,Good.
Bree,"That is not true, Rex."
Bree,"Yes, well, I feel badly about that."
Bree,How much do we really wanna know about our neighbours?
Bree,Bye.
Bree,"Rex, wasn't that a lovely?"
Bree,"Rex, Rex! You need to get up!"
Bree,"Please hurry, if the kids see you sleeping down here, they're gonna start asking questions."
Bree,"Well, I care. They don't need to be burdened with our marital problems, and if we're working things out, the least we could do is try to keep up appearances."
Bree,"Oh Rex, you look so tired."
Bree,"Well, why don't you move back upstairs and sleep in our bed?"
Bree,It's just-I miss you.
Bree,"Lynette, these cards are sticky."
Bree,I think it's a great idea.
Bree,Works for me. Should we all make something?
Bree,Lynette!
Bree,Really? Wouldn't that be in poor taste?
Bree,"Well, good, because I have some new flatbread that I've just been dying to show off."
Bree,I'll make braised lamb shanks.
Bree,So how many will I be cooking for?
Bree,Is there somebody you'd like to invite?
Bree,"Well, given that we're hosting it, I say so. By the way, you won't be drinking at this party."
Bree,"Because when you drink, you get chatty. No one needs to know that we're seeing Dr. Goldfine."
Bree,Not a drop!
Bree,"Well, the nurses at your office may start wondering why you're disappearing three times a week. Tennis lessons are a plausible alibi."
Bree,"My backhand's improving immensely, but you're still having problems with your serve."
Bree,"Private sessions? I don't understand, why do we need private sessions?"
Bree,"Oh, well I don't have any personal issues. My only issue is that my husband wants to leave me, and how can I work on that if he's not in the room?"
Bree,"Why? I'm your wife, you can say anything in front of me. All we need is a few more sessions, and I'm sure we can."
Bree,"Fine. Oh, and Doctor. If what he's about to discuss has anything to do with adultery, prostitution or internet pornography, I would really appreciate you taking a moral hardline."
Bree,Hello Zach! I hope this isn't a bad time.
Bree,"Well, I wanted to invite you and your father to a dinner party tomorrow night."
Bree,"Oh. Well, I'm sorry it's such late notice, but well, we weren't sure whether you and your father were ready for any kind of social engagement yet. But, well, we're, we're sort of throwing it in your mother's honour."
Bree,"Yes, it's just gonna be a casual night with the gang. We're going to eat, and tell fun stories about your mum. Zach, are-are you okay?"
Bree,"Oh hi, Paul, I was just?"
Bree,"Oh. That's too bad. Well, I should go."
Bree,"For what, Zach?"
Bree,"Hey, where've you been?"
Bree,If everybody would please take your seats. Dinner is served.
Bree,Rex cries after he ejaculates.
Bree,"So, uh, where are you going?"
Bree,"Hotel by the interstate has better rates, and, uh, it's closer to your work."
Bree,"I'm packing your swimsuit. There's a pool there, and I know how swimming relaxes you."
Bree,"Umm, I can tell them that you went to tennis camp. That was a joke."
Bree,"There. Obviously, if you've forgotten anything, you can, um, come right back and get it."
Bree,"Rex. In college, when we first started dating, people were so jealous of us. We were the golden couple. Everybody knew we were gonna have this wonderful life. Why is this happening?"
Bree,Dr. Goldfine.
Bree,I didn't have time to make an appointment. Rex moved out today.
Bree,"I don't need much time, it just seems that you have more insight into my situation than I do. And I just think that-"
Bree,"If you would just tell me what he told you, then I could fix the problem."
Bree,"Well, why can't you?"
Bree,"Dr. Goldfine, please?"
Bree,8 o'clock. Sorry to interrupt. Bye.
Bree,Just some more about her nightmares and this girl she was afraid of.
Bree,"Well, it's now or never. I saw what he's asking for the place it's going to sell really quickly."
Bree,Gabby!!
Bree,"That being said, I do love what he've done with that lawn."
Bree,Dinner is on the table.
Bree,He got a last minute call to speak at a medical conference in Philadelphia. Take your seats.
Bree,Andrew?!
Bree,Open the door please.
Bree,Can I come in?
Bree,"Well, I want to talk to you."
Bree,Where were you last night?
Bree,I spoke to Brian's mother. Now tell me again where you were last night and this time don't lie to me.
Bree,"Andrew, don't change the subject."
Bree,"Well, it's just temporary and-I thought it would upset you, so I was protecting you."
Bree,"Andrew, just because I chose not to share my marital problems with you does not give you the right to be rude."
Bree,If the school and the paediatrician both think that the twins could stand to be medicated-then what's the problem?
Bree,"Lynette, you are a great mother. But let's face it, your kids are a challenge."
Bree,It's a tough call.
Bree,You know it's leaking.
Bree,And we think that you should have it.
Bree,It's nine thirty at night. What is your brother thinking?
Bree,I am perfectly capable of handling this without your father.
Bree,Where's your cell phone?
Bree,Call Andrew and find out where he is.
Bree,"No, he won't. Just act normal."
Bree,He hung up on me.
Bree,Keith. Ian. Andrew.
Bree,"You think that's bad? Tomorrow morning I'm cleaning it! oh, by the way Keith, I didn't get the chance to tell you, that was a lovely solo last week in church."
Bree,I hope it wasn't anything I said.
Bree,"So Andrew, shall we?"
Bree,Fine.
Bree,"I'm staying for the show. I'm dying to see what all the fuss is about. excuse me, waitress, I'll have a glass of your house chardonnay."
Bree,"I'm curious, Andrew, as you fantasise about this woman, do you ever stop and think how she came to be on this runway?"
Bree,That's someone's little girl. And that someone probably had a lot of dreams for her.Dreams that did not include a thong and a pole.
Bree,"God only knows what she's had to deal with in her life-abject poverty,Drugs, Domestic violence. Maybe even molestation."
Bree,"And-now she treats herself the way that other mean treat her. Like an object, a piece of meat."
Bree,So what's your strategy? Are you just never going to speak to me again?
Bree,I suppose I do owe you an apology.
Bree,I shouldn't have lied to you about your father. You and your sister are old enough to handle the truth and I'm sorry.
Bree,"If you think I'm going to apologise for taking you out of a strip club, you're wrong! I consider it one of my finest moments."
Bree,"Andrew, I know you blame me for what's happening with your father, but it's not entirely my fault and I need you to understand that."
Bree,Neither do I.
Bree,Yeah?
Bree,Three months.
Bree,"But, wait, what about the tape? She did say that her name was Angela."
Bree,"Well, my father was a prosecutor and he always said that the simplest explanation was usually the right one."
Bree,Are you okay?
Bree,"Oh,please! I would have hosted it myself, only the kids are going away to the mountains tomorrow and there's camping equipment everywhere."
Bree,Yes.
Bree,"Oh,you want me to recommend the twins?"
Bree,So you want me to lie?
Bree,"It's just that I'm very well respected at Barcliff, and my word won't be good there anymore."
Bree,"Well,I had hoped someday to get my grandchildren into Barcliff. But I suppose that doesn't matter to you, does it?"
Bree,Just because you didn't hear them fighting doesn't mean they were happy.
Bree,Hi.
Bree,Almost. Thanks again for driving them to the bus.
Bree,Did you hear there was a break in at Mrs Fome's the other night?
Bree,"Well,that doesn't make it any less frightening. I mean, he could have been a sexual predator."
Bree,"Oh,Rex! That's not the point."
Bree,"The point is I don't feel safe here, and I was wondering if you would spend the night."
Bree,"Rex, the truth is, with the kids gone I'll be all by myself in this house for the first time in seventeen years."
Bree,You're right. That was hard to hear.
Bree,That is for the kids' trip.
Bree,"Honey, the marriage counselling might not work out, you need to get used to bad cooking."
Bree,Paul?
Bree,"Oh, hi,Zachery. I'm sorry. The door was open and-"
Bree,Is your father here? We were scheduled to do a patrol today.
Bree,"Oh.Well,, I guess I can do it by myself."
Bree,"Wow,this place is just immaculate."
Bree,"Zach,she would be very proud of you. What happened to your varnish?"
Bree,Oh.
Bree,"Zach,do you have any plans for dinner?"
Bree,"I'm serving it this year for Christmas. I like to try out new recipes before the actual holiday. That way, if the cook book has gotten it wrong, I can fix it."
Bree,I adore the holidays. I never get depressed if there's a beautifully decorated tree to look at.
Bree,"Oh,Zach. You know, my mother died when I was young. She was hit by a car."
Bree,"It was right before Christmas as a matter of fact. We were all singing carols and the dog was howling, because everyone in my family sings off-key except for me.Anyway, it was just a terrible ruckus.So no-one noticed when my mother wenta cross the street to give the neighbour their gift. The next thing we heard were brakes screeching."
Bree,"Most of my family went to the hospital, but I stayed home because I was so young.When I looked out the window I saw all my mother's blood on the street and nobody was doing anything about it. So I got a hose and I washed it off. And once it was clean, I felt so much better."
Bree,I've never told anyone that story before.
Bree,"Yes,you're probably right."
Bree,Ooooh.
Bree,You do?
Bree,What did you do??? Zach? Sweetheart?
Bree,"Zach,calm down."
Bree,"Zach,I won't tell your father."
Bree,"Zachery, it's alright!"
Bree,Nothing.That's it. Just that Mary Alice killed herself because of something he had done.
Bree,"Oh, I tried. But he was so nervous he actually started shaking and then he just left."
Bree,"And tell them what? We don't even have the note anymore, we gave it to Paul."
Bree,"Girls,you don't understand. This poor kid is scared out of his mind."
Bree,But how?
Bree,"Hello,Zachery. Are you free for dinner tonight?"
Bree,"Oh,good, because last night you put me in such a holiday mood, so I'm going to make roast turkey and canned yams and egg nog. Have you ever had real old-fashioned egg nog?"
Bree,Oh! You are going to love it! It has quite a kick..
Bree,Hello?
Bree,"Oh, hi,Rex. How are you? Is something wrong?"
Bree,Uh?
Bree,"Oh,sweetie, I was just coming over to talk to you. I'm so sorry, but something really important came up and I have to cancel."
Bree,"We will do it again. We'll have our impromptu holiday dinner, I promise. Bye."
Bree,What is it?
Bree,"Zach,why did you do this?"
Bree,Take off those handcuffs please.
Bree,This is not up for discussion.
Bree,"Hi,Zach. I just wanted to see if everything was alright."
Bree,Are you sure?
Bree,"Oh,well, okay. I'll see you tomorrow then."
Bree,"Zach, why did you do this?"
Bree,"Zach said Mary Alice killed herself because of something that he had done, something bad. Is there anyone else who'd know what he was talking about?"
Bree,It just doesn't make any sense. Zach is such a sweet kid. I can't imagine him doing anything that terrible.
Bree,"I must say, I'm jealous of how much time you two spend together. My mother-in-law would never want to hang out with me all day."
Bree,"Oh, hey there, you two!"
Bree,Have fun.
Bree,"Oh no, I don't worry about John. Both he and Danielle are in the abstinence club."
Bree,"Thank you, I feel really good about it."
Bree,"Oh, really. Like what?"
Bree,Connected?
Bree,And what would this sexual surrogate person do?
Bree,She!
Bree,"Oh. So she would be in the room with us, while we make love?"
Bree,"Just one. How much longer is your midlife crisis going to last, because it is really starting to tick me off!"
Bree,"So how is it going with Mike, Susan?"
Bree,"Oh, I take it you've met Maisy Gibbons."
Bree,"Oh, dear."
Bree,"Oh, Maisy does love to rule her little kingdom."
Bree,You play poker?
Bree,Dr. Goldfine.
Bree,You're dining alone?
Bree,"Well, what a coincidence. So am I. It seems a shame for us to eat by ourselves. Shall I, pull up a chair?"
Bree,"Oh,"" ""I suppose it can wait."
Bree,"Of course, that's fine. Shall I include the meal?"
Bree,"No, I don't."
Bree,Is that how you see me? As some sort of prude who just lays there like a cold fish? I love sex.
Bree,"""I love everything about it. The sensations, the smells. I especially love the feel of a man. All that muscle and sinew pressed against my body. And then, when you add friction. Mmm -- The tactile sensation of running my tongue over a man's nipple ever so gently. And then there's the act itself - two bodies becoming one in that final eruption of pleasure. To be honest, the only thing I don't like about sex is the scrotum. I mean, obviously it has its practical applications, but I'm just not a fan."" "
Bree,The man at the desk said there were no vacant rooms. Mind if I bunk with you?
Bree,"It's a little chilly out here, do you mind if we discuss this inside?"
Bree,It sure is nice and toasty in here.
Bree,"Thanks. I was hoping you'd notice."" ""Well, it certainly isn't the Ritz, but it has all the essentials."
Bree,Then perhaps you shouldn't say anything.
Bree,"Oh, Rex, oh baby, stop, I just need a minute."
Bree,"Okay, baby, where were we?"
Bree,"Sorry. I just - ah, come on, are you going to make a big deal about this?"
Bree,I'm repairing a chipped mug.
Bree,Because I think it is better to fix what you already have.
Bree,"You humiliated me, Rex. For no good reason."
Bree,I was there. I was willing. Normal men don't say no to that.
Bree,"""See, but I don't think that's the reason. After I left the motel, I um, did some thinking about us and our sex life, and I realized there has been a disconnect, but it's coming from you."
Bree,"How many years have we been making love, and you've started to ask me something, but then you stop?"
Bree,"You are unhappy with our sex life because you're not getting something from me, but you're simply too afraid to ask."
Bree,"Well, then, if that is the case, then take me, right here, right now. The house is spotless. There aren't any burritos lying around to pull my focus--"
Bree,"Why not? We haven't had sex for months, Rex. Most normal, red-blooded men would be climbing the walls by now."
Bree,"Rex, whatever you want, I'll go there with you. I will go there with you, you just have to say it out loud. Tell me, what do you want? What do you need?"
Bree,Why?
Bree,"No, I don't. I sound like a woman whose husband won't touch her. Rex, after Mary Alice killed herself, it all hit me. We all have our secrets, and I think it's time for you to tell me yours."
Bree,What happened?
Bree,"More wine? So, uh, Reba, Emma and Lori-- Why don't you girls come to the kitchen and help me with the snacks?"
Bree,I will be right in.
Bree,"God, I couldn't wait to get rid of them! So, Lynette said that you found Zack."
Bree,This was the Johnson boy?
Bree,"Rex, this was practically assault."
Bree,Is that relevant?
Bree,"If Andrew is angry about you moving out of the house, then perhaps he should shove your head into a locker!"
Bree,"And so does Andrew! Blaming his actions on our problems--"" ""--does not help him."
Bree,"Mrs. Stark, you handle this however you see fit."
Bree,You went to an attorney?
Bree,"Well, he better be good, because when I'm finished with you, you won't have a cent to your name!"
Bree,"But whatever problems your father and I have, it doesn't change the fact that we love you very, very much,"
Bree,Go ahead sweetheart. Ask whatever you want.
Bree,"Is, is that what you would prefer, Danielle? To live with your father."
Bree,"Um, all this, um, wine is, uh, giving me a headache."
Bree,"Rex, what's this about?"
Bree,Wait a minute. What's all this about a modeling academy?
Bree,"Oh, is she now! And when you were planning on telling me?"
Bree,Don't you two see what he is doing? He's trying to get you on his side. He's trying to buy your love.
Bree,"A car? A modeling academy? You should have discussed these gifts with me first. I'm sorry kids, but we cannot accept them."
Bree,I said no.
Bree,Did you offer to help Danielle get into modeling school?
Bree,"Yes. Gabrielle, did you, or did you not offer to sponsor her?"
Bree,"It's in New York, for God's sakes, why on earth would you suggest that?"
Bree,"No, and in the future I would appreciate you keeping your ridiculous ideas to yourself!"
Bree,"Oh, I'm throwing you out. I've separated all your things into two sides. One side is yours, Danielle, and the other one is Andrews."
Bree,"Darned if I know. Uh, Danielle, everything in the north quadrant of your side is clothes and books and such, and the south side are miscellaneous items."
Bree,"That's a smart idea, because you're probably going to have to sleep in it for a while."
Bree,"Oh, no? That's Mr. Conlan, the locksmith. He's been very helpful today. Of course, I could give you the new keys, which would mean you'd have to adhere to my rules, which would include giving back your father's gifts."
Bree,"Oh my god, thank god you're here. Will you go take care of Gabrielle? I have to go home for a minute."
Bree,"Oh, Andrew, thank god you're back. I need your help, honey. There's been an accident. Andrew?"
Bree,Andrew--
Bree,"Rex, you need to come home. Something's happened, and we need you."
Bree,"Oh, Andrew, I need your help, honey."
Bree,"We have to get rid of the car. But we can't sell it. The police might find it, and there could be DNA. We take the car to a bad part of town. We'll leave the keys in the ignition and the doors unlocked. If the police don't find it, we'll get the insurance money, and if they do, it wasn't in our possession. Anyone could have hit Mrs. Solis."
Bree,Our son could spent the rest of his life in jail. I won't allow that.
Bree,"Well, everybody should, uh, go wash up. We're having pancakes for breakfast."
Bree,"It has to be, I don't want Gabrielle and Carlos coming home to this ugly reminder in front of their house."
Bree,How is Juanita doing?
Bree,We can only hope.
Bree,Don't you think that's a little bit extreme?
Bree,"This is the most impoverished neighborhood in the city. Trust me, somebody will steal the car."
Bree,Because I have faith in the poor.
Bree,"I had just been--thinking about the kids. They sure grew up quickly, didn't they?"
Bree,I remember telling them when they were babies that they weren't allowed to get any bigger because they were so adorable. And we were so happy.
Bree,They sure didn't turn out like we expected them to.
Bree,We could have been better parents.
Bree,"We still have so much to teach them. For starters, we need to get across to Andrew the enormity of what he's done."
Bree,"All right, then what's the appropriate punishment for a child who drives over a woman?"
Bree,"""You know, no matter how the kids turn out, I still love them.''"
Bree,But I'll never forgive them for growing up so quickly.
Bree,Are the lady fingers okay?
Bree,We just want you to know how much we care.
Bree,"Well, more importantly, is there any good news about Juanita?"
Bree,"Well, when did you decide this?"
Bree,I see.
Bree,We should probably be going.
Bree,Thank you so much.
Bree,I feel awful for Carlos. That talk about children was obviously coming from his grief.
Bree,"Andrew, um, I know the last few days have been stressful, and, uh, you know, if you ever need to talk to anybody--"
Bree,"Actually, I was thinking we could arrange for you to talk to a professional."
Bree,"Of course not. It's just that the accident probably stirred up a lot of emotions, and it would be normal for you to be feeling confused or depressed or ashamed--"
Bree,"Honey, you put a woman into a coma. Surely that arouses some kind of emotion!"
Bree,"No, I won't, not until you tell me."
Bree,Because I need to know that you're not a monster!
Bree,Yeah.
Bree,"Andrew, you almost killed another human being."
Bree,"What I'm worried about, Andrew, is that you don't seem to have a soul. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't call the police!"
Bree,"There's Lynette's car, she's gotta be close."
Bree,She'll be fine. What do you think's happening with Lynette?
Bree,Lynette? Honey?
Bree,"Lynette, you're a great mother."
Bree,"You've got four kids. That's a lot of stress. Honey, you need some help."
Bree,I used to get so upset when Andrew and Danielle were little. I used their nap times to cry.
Bree,"Oh, baby. Nobody likes to admit that they can't handle the pressure."
Bree,You put a woman into a coma.Surely that arouses some kind of emotion.
Bree,"So, why isn't Mrs. Huber here?"
Bree,It's just not right.
Bree,"A woman is in a coma, because of Andrew. And there he is, happy as a clam!"
Bree,I think we should make him quit the swim team.
Bree,"Well, maybe if we take it away from him, then he'll start to understand what he did! He has not shown an ounce of remorse since the accident."
Bree,"Well, he's doing a fabulous job!"
Bree,"Well, if it insures he grows up with some trace of humanity, then that's a risk I'm willing to take!"
Bree,"Well, that's because you just don't love him as much as I do!"
Bree,It's just a fact. I'm his mother. He lived inside of me.
Bree,How many nannies did you interview?
Bree,"Oh, good nannies are so hard to find."
Bree,"Oh Lord, what do you want me to do?"
Bree,Why?
Bree,Lynette--
Bree,"I understand that good help is hard to find, but stealing a family's nanny is so--unseemly."
Bree,"Andrew, can I come in?"
Bree,Why are you smiling?
Bree,Oh. What was it about?
Bree,"Charming. What I was wondering was if you've bothered to spend any time reflecting on the reasons that you've been grounded, and all the pain that you've caused the Solis family."
Bree,Really?
Bree,"No, I don't."
Bree,What's that smell? Have you been smoking marijuana?
Bree,You are strung out!
Bree,"Excuse me,"
Bree,It's the container you'll be urinating into.
Bree,Your son's urine.
Bree,"I think Andrew has been smoking marijuana, so I want you to take this and get it tested right away."
Bree,Because I want you to pull him from the swim team and I don't think you'll allow it without proof.
Bree,"Yes, I am."
Bree,"Not all of us! Rex, I thought you moved back home to try and straighten Andrew out! To, to teach him the consequences of his actions. I don't understand why you're fighting me on this."
Bree,I never pushed you around. We always made our decisions together.
Bree,Rex!
Bree,The same thing you just did to every memory I have of our marriage.
Bree,Why did Carlos have to back out?
Bree,"Oh, Susan, you look so gorgeous."" ""Doesn't she, Edie?"
Bree,"Gabrielle, you have to change the lineup. Susan has to go last. Nothing is going to top this."
Bree,"Hi, Danielle, how was school?"
Bree,Good. Where does Andrew keep his marijuana?
Bree,"Hello? Yes, this is she-- Marijuana in his locker? Oh, I'm just--horrified. There must be some sort of terrible mistake. Um, yeah, okay. Well, I will be right down."
Bree,I take it you've met Maisy Gibbons.
Bree,Maisy does love to rule her little kingdom.
Bree,"You are unhappy with our sex life.You're not getting something from me,but you're simply too afraid to ask."
Bree,Hello.
Bree,I could ask you the same question.
Bree,"Were you with a woman? Did you tell her that you have a wife, or does that hinder your pick-up style?"
Bree,"Options! I'm not a mutual fund, Rex!"
Bree,Meet someone. I'm raising your children.
Bree,"Oh, okay. I tell you what then. Why don't you just call up your mystery woman and invite her over. I'll pull out the sofa bed and you can take her right there. Andrew! Danielle! Daddy's gonna fornicate for us!"
Bree,"Why, are you feeling ashamed?"
Bree,"Lynette, for the first time in years you finally have some free time, and you're wasting it obsessing about the kids."
Bree,"You know, if you really have that many doubts, you should go buy a hidden camera."
Bree,Yeah. People do terrible things when they think no one is watching them.
Bree,Trust is overrated.
Bree,Fine. Why do you ask?
Bree,"Uh, the situation is, um, fluid. I'm not certain what his plans are yet."
Bree,Because I have faith that he'll come back. And that he'll do the right thing.
Bree,Yeah. But I['d still buy that camera.
Bree,"Oh, hi Gabrielle! What have you got there?"
Bree,"Oh! Well, that's um, very thoughtful of you."
Bree,"Sure! Why don't you, uh, come by tomorrow?"
Bree,"Hello. This is she. Yes, he's my husband."
Bree,"Um, excuse me, I'm here to see Rex Van de Kamp. Apparently, he had a heart attack. I'm not sure when -"
Bree,Could I at least poke my head in? I'm his wife.
Bree,Yes. Why?
Bree,"Well, that depends. Are you having an affair with my husband?"
Bree,He said that?
Bree,Then why is he so unhappy?
Bree,"Needs. Like, sexual needs?"
Bree,And have you fulfilled those needs?
Bree,"I see."" ""You know, you are pretty brazen for a woman who just admitted, however tacitly, that she just slept with my husband. If I told anyone in this neighborhood, they would never speak to you again."
Bree,"Oh, I don't hate you, Maisy. I pity you."
Bree,Hey.
Bree,They sure did.
Bree,It went well. The surgeon says you're going to be as good as new.
Bree,I have. I was so afraid you were gonna die. There were so many things I haven't had a chance to tell you.
Bree,"That's okay. How are you now, Rex? Are you strong enough to listen to the things I need to tell you?"
Bree,I know you still love me. Maisy told me.
Bree,"And I am so thrilled to know that you still love me. Because I want what's about to happen to you, to hurt as much is as humanly possible. I'm so glad you didn't die before I got a chance to tell you that."
Bree,Are you having an affair with my husband?
Bree,"I'm here to see Rex Van De Kamp.Apparently, he had a heart attack."
Bree,"Well, then he can go to a motel because he's not allowed back in my house."
Bree,That's - between your father and me.
Bree,"I'm sorry to disappoint you, Andrew, but my plan is to have an embolism and to die young!"
Bree,Andrew!
Bree,You wouldn't be saying that if you knew what -
Bree,"Fine. I will see him through this, but after that, your father can rot in hell for all I care!"
Bree,"Oh, I don't need your gratitude. You're only here because your children are master extortionists."
Bree,Your adultery? No. I decided to keep that little gem all to myself.
Bree,"Yes, it is. The doctor said you could be here for weeks."
Bree,"Yes, it would--if I still felt anything for you. But as it stands, the place you used to occupy in my heart is very much empty now."
Bree,And why do you think that?
Bree,"Do me a favor, Rex. Please don't mistake my anal retentiveness for actual affection."
Bree,"Hello, George."
Bree,You always say the nicest things.
Bree,"Listen, I have a prescription here for Rex. I don't know if you heard, but he had a heart attack."
Bree,"Oh yes, he'll, he'll live. But the doctor said he's at risk for something called pericarditis. Do you know anything about that?"
Bree,So I hear.
Bree,George? Would you go out to dinner with me?
Bree,"Yes, I think it would be fun."
Bree,"Oh, him. Well, we're separated."
Bree,I'm keeping my eyes on the horizon. Please tell me if I'm about to step on a body part.
Bree,Can we talk about something else - something less depressing?
Bree,"Not that it's any of your business, but, I have a date."
Bree,"Rex, I don't want to say anything that might upset you. The doctor says any undue stress could cause another heart attack."
Bree,"It's a romantic date with a single attractive man, and I intend to french the hell out of him."
Bree,"Oh, right on time!"
Bree,Hi.
Bree,"Oh, my, they're exquisite. Compost and eggshells?"
Bree,"Oh! Come on in. George, you remember Rex?"
Bree,"Oh, we are, emotionally. Physically, he just lives here because his mistress refuses to care for him. Would you like a drink?"
Bree,"Rex, say hello to George!"
Bree,"I'm going to go put these in water. George, why don't you have a seat, and I'll be right back."
Bree,"Oh, these flowers are stunning. They're the best ones I've ever gotten."
Bree,Ah. Shall we?
Bree,"Thank you, George. That was a lovely evening."
Bree,"Well, I guess I should go inside."
Bree,"Me, too."
Bree,"Andrew, where did you come from?"
Bree,"Oh, uh, you remember Mr. Williams, our pharmacist?"
Bree,"Well, we're just, um, talking. Mr. Williams took me out to dinner."
Bree,"Well, um--"
Bree,Yes.
Bree,"Andrew, your father and I are separated and you know it."
Bree,The only reason he is still in the house is because you insisted I care for him.
Bree,"No, we are not going to have sex!"
Bree,"Because I don't commit adultery like your father."" ""That's right. Your father had an affair. I found out about it, and I'm just trying to move on with my life."
Bree,I'm packing up your father's things for when he eventually moves out.
Bree,"Andrew, I'm so sorry that I said anything."
Bree,There comes this point in every boy's life--
Bree,No. That his father's only human.
Bree,"That's sweet, but I'm taking care of him because it's the right thing to do."
Bree,"Andrew, you will not speak that way about your father in front of me."
Bree,"Yes, I'm angry with him. I am going to divorce him. I may even marry someone else, but make no mistake about it, your father is, and always will be, the love of my life. He gave me the best eighteen-year marriage that I could have ever hoped for. For that, you will respect him."
Bree,"George, hi, it's me, Bree. I was wondering, are you free next Saturday?"
Bree,"You are? Oh, that's wonderful."
Bree,"George, would you go out to dinner with me?"
Bree,Thank you. I did too.
Bree,Sorry I can't invite you in for coffee.
Bree,"Yeah, and I would rather cut off my hand than hurt his feelings."
Bree,"It'll, um, it'll be a lot easier once he gets well enough to move out."
Bree,I'd love to.
Bree,Pick me up at one and we'll do something fun.
Bree,"Oh, packages! Thank you."
Bree,"Hello! Oh, hi, Lynette! What?"
Bree,"I mean, what are the odds? First Mary Alice and then Mrs. Huber? I mean, it's shocking."
Bree,I'm gonna miss her.
Bree,"Damn, I have to take Rex to his angiogram."
Bree,"I was so afraid when I suggested a picnic, that you'd make fun of me, but I just think it's such a lovely, old-fashioned way to spend an afternoon."
Bree,"Oh, and we got so lucky with the weather, it's just absolutely -"
Bree,"You know, your lunch hour is almost up. We should probably be getting you back to the pharmacy."
Bree,"Another gift? I hope it's not another orchid, they're so expensive."
Bree,"George, you shouldn't have."
Bree,This is a 9-mm Luger PO8!
Bree,"I can't accept this, George! This is an antique. It's too valuable."
Bree,"It's so lovely. I mean, look at the handle. Is that mother of pearl?"
Bree,"Oh, absolutely. George, this is just so much better than an orchid."
Bree,The memory of this night will stay with you forever.
Bree,"Oh, yeah. You always remember your first time. God, I hope I brought enough bullets."
Bree,"Well, we sure have had some fun."
Bree,"Oh, George, that's so sweet. Now come on, let's go shoot something!"
Bree,"Now before I fire a handgun, I like to go over a few of the basics just to make sure I'm ready. Okay? So, number one, a strong stance."
Bree,"Two, high hand grasp. Three, hard grip. Four, front sight. Five, release the safety, and then squeeze the trigger slowly."
Bree,Here. Take the gun.
Bree,"Okay. Now when you're firing a semi-automatic, you want the web of your hand all the way up against the edge of the back strap."
Bree,"Uh, I'm not wearing perfume."
Bree,"Oh, I was making macaroons before I left the house."
Bree,"Okay, now I want you to hold the gun like you're holding a beautiful white dove. Hold it firmly enough that it can't get away, but not so firmly that you can kill it. Got it?"
Bree," Okay, now all you have to do is take a deep breath--"
Bree,#NAME?
Bree,"Hey. Hi, George. I'm so sorry you lost your toe. The doctor said it's your middle one so your balance shouldn't be affected. I mean, this really won't change your life one little bit. Please say something."
Bree,I was just caught off guard.
Bree,"I'm still married to Rex. I mean, we're not even legally separated yet."
Bree,You shouldn't listen to a woman who's just had her heart broken. We tend to lie.
Bree,Oh George! What - what a surprise!
Bree,And-?
Bree,I don't think that would be wise.
Bree,"Well, I mean, wouldn't you keep hoping that in time I would feel the same way about you as you feel about me?"
Bree,"Oh, George."
Bree,I don't think you're pathetic. It's just that--I can't.
Bree,"Oh, George, please don't go!"
Bree,"Why can't we talk this over? George, I -"
Bree,"Oh my God! George, here."
Bree,You can lean on me.
Bree,Were you with a woman?
Bree,You shouldn't listen to a woman who's just had her heart broken.
Bree,I don't think that would be wise.
Bree,I want to keep the club membership. Rex is terrible at tennis. And he hates buffets.
Bree,I'm not speaking to you.
Bree,You only demanded the good china because you know I love it.
Bree,Hardly? How about never!
Bree,"You know what? At our next settlement talks, I plan on asking for your golf clubs!"
Bree,It's time for your heart medication.
Bree,"Sweetie, I think it's too late."
Bree,Because you were unfaithful.
Bree,Would that hurt you Rex? If I slept with another man?
Bree,Here you go.
Bree,Rex. Time to take your medicine.
Bree,Hi! Wha-What are you doing here?
Bree,"I'm not. The coffee is just dreadful. Well, it's late, and I needed to get out of the house, and it was the only place still open."
Bree,"George, would you like to join me for a dreadful cup of coffee?"
Bree,"It was my first week in college, and I went to a meeting of the young Republicans where Rex gave a speech, and I went up to him afterward and introduced myself, and I told him that I agreed with his stance on the death penalty. He took me out to a diner, and we, uh, stayed up till two in the morning talking about big government, gun control and illegal immigration. Ah. It was just--it was just such a magical night, and I knew, by the time he got me back to my dorm, that one day I was going to be Mrs. Rex Van de Kamp."
Bree,"And even now, you know, after the betrayal, I, I know that we're supposed to be together. But I don't know how I can be with someone I don't trust."
Bree,That I don't know. What do you think I should do?
Bree,"Oh, I should not have done that. I am--"
Bree,"No, George, it's not okay. It was insensitive. I know how you feel about me, and I--"
Bree,Thank you.
Bree,Yes.
Bree,"Aside from the adultery, yes."
Bree,"You are such a special man, George Williams. And you deserve such a special woman."
Bree,"Oh, he's chaperoning. He called a couple of hours ago and volunteered."
Bree,"Why, what's wrong?"
Bree,Maybe he's just trying to be supportive.
Bree,"If you could just tell me what he told you,then I could fix the problem."
Bree,"Well, it must've been some sort of accident. I mean little boys don't just kill their baby sisters."
Bree,Look at the guilt that she must've lived with.
Bree,All I know is this: Mary Alice loved Zach more than anything in the world. When you love a child that much--
Bree,Yeah.
Bree,Rex and I are hosting a dinner party for ten next week. We're using our best china and serving duck.
Bree,"Yes. You know that's one of the things I hated most about our separation. Not being able to throw dinner parties. There's just something so civilized and elegant about them, don't you think?"
Bree,Let's just say that I put them in an imaginary box and don't plan on looking at them for a while.
Bree,"Well, it won't be easy at first. There'll be a lot of forced smiles and perfunctory love making, but after a few decades whiz by I'm sure I'll find a way to forgive him."
Bree,"I do want to forgive him Doctor Goldfine, but, there's something he's still not telling me."
Bree,I think it has something to do with why he had the affair.
Bree,"Once, and you should've seen the look in his eyes. He was terrified that I'll figure it out. You know what it is, don't you?"
Bree,"I realize that. This thing that he's hiding, is it bad?"
Bree,"Oh, okay, um, maybe it's better that I don't know."
Bree,"We're, um, WASPs, Doctor Goldfine. Not acknowledging the elephant in the room is what we do best."
Bree,And the dinner parties. Don't forget the dinner parties.
Bree,Valentine's Day is tomorrow.
Bree,Roses and English toffee?
Bree,"Yes. And I suppose we'll make love tomorrow night, too."
Bree,Good. I'm looking forward to it. Are you looking forward to it?
Bree,"Well, it's just that I know that I don't please you sexually, so I was wondering if you really were looking forward to being with me."
Bree,"I'm sorry, Rex. I thought I could pretend that this doesn't upset me anymore, but I can't."
Bree,You had an affair. You went to another woman for sex to give you something I couldn't. At least have the decency to tell me what that something is.
Bree,"Why not? Rex, please tell me. Let me prove to you how much I love you."
Bree,Huh?
Bree,Huh?
Bree,"Rex, please, I want to understand."
Bree,What the hell did your mother do to you?
Bree,"Well, come on, this just reeks of unresolved childhood trauma."
Bree,It's a perversion.
Bree,What do you want me to say? My husband likes to wear metal clamps around his nipples. Hooray?
Bree,Try what? Hurting you? You actually want me to hurt you?
Bree,Fine.
Bree,So? Was it good for you too?
Bree,Good night.
Bree,"So, it's like we're in a little play."
Bree,Okay. So what's our control word?
Bree,"Well, it's just that my Aunt Fern lives in Philadelphia and I don't want to be thinking about her while I'm spanking you with a leather strap."
Bree,"Um, how about Boise?"
Bree,What's the matter with Boise?
Bree,Hmm. How about Palestine?
Bree,"So I guess we should, uh, get started. What do you want me to do?"
Bree,I do. Would you mind if I ran these through the dishwasher once?
Bree,"You promised the cheating had stopped, Rex. You promised."
Bree,I want you out of the house!
Bree,"Well, then, whose is it? It didn't just magically appear in my laundry basket."
Bree,No.
Bree,Andrew is still a child.
Bree,"Honey, you have to talk to him."
Bree,Tell him that we found his condom and that he is forbidden from - y'know.
Bree,"Well, then the least we can do is go search his room and if we find any more of these, we'll confiscate them."
Bree,"Well, if we take away his condoms, maybe--"
Bree,"Well, we can't put it back in his room. I mean that would be like we're condoning him having pre-marital sex."
Bree,"So what are you saying, that the twins murdered Martha?"
Bree,"Well, you know what? If he is innocent, this should be a simple matter to clear up."
Bree,So should I just dial nine one one?
Bree,"Well, not recently, and I'd prefer not to tie up the line."
Bree,What is wrong with nice invitations?
Bree,Is Lisa your friend with the pierced navel?
Bree,"You've been spending a lot of time together lately, haven't you?"
Bree,"Oh, uh, Andrew, I'm gonna want you home by eleven on Saturday."
Bree,You may be able to abdicate all your parental responsibility but I cannot.
Bree,"As a matter of fact it does, and just so we're clear, if you get Lisa pregnant, you will marry her."
Bree,"Andrew, this is not funny."
Bree,So obviously we need to talk.
Bree,"Well, good. But why on earth would you need a condom?"
Bree,"Danielle, you are president of the Abstinence Club."
Bree,Who were you planning on having sex with?
Bree,John Rowland? I thought you broke up with him.
Bree,"Well, if that's the type of boy he is, then good riddance."
Bree,"Oh, sweetheart, just because you give a boy sex doesn't mean you'll get love in return."
Bree,"Honey, I am looking out for your happiness. Now, I understand what it's like to be young and feel urges, but I waited until I got married, as did your father, and it was so much better."
Bree,Yes. Well -
Bree,Why would you say that?
Bree,Oh.
Bree,"Hello, John. I'm sorry to drop by on you, unannounced. Do you have a moment?"
Bree,"Well, I'll tell you. My daughter is planning on giving you her virginity and I would consider it a personal favor if you wouldn't take it."
Bree,She said that you broke up with her because she refused to have sex.
Bree,Really?
Bree,"Well, she feels very passionately about you."
Bree,"Oh, are you going steady?"
Bree,"Oh, I see."
Bree,"Uh, actually, I would prefer if you didn't."
Bree,"I know my daughter. She's very determined, and unless you're really firm with her, she's going to continue to think that there's hope."
Bree,"Better still, be brutal."
Bree,Are you having an affair with my husband?
Bree,"Ida! Ida Greenberg,that is not your paper!"
Bree,"What's wrong, Rex? Didn't you enjoy your golf game with Dr. Wallace?"
Bree,Still? Did you talk to him about that?
Bree,I can see that Tisha is making the rounds. She must have some juicy new anecdote.
Bree,"Tisha. Tisha. Oh, I can tell by that look on your face you've got something good. Now, come on, don't be selfish."
Bree,No.
Bree,"No, I can't."
Bree,"Well, you heard your funny story, Rex. Why aren't you laughing?"
Bree,"Uh, what just happened?"
Bree,"Yes, yes, they were. I fold."
Bree,"Hello, Maisy."
Bree,I need a favor.
Bree,"I heard that there is a, um, little black book with the names of your clients in it."
Bree,"I was wondering if, perhaps, you could remove Rex's name from that little book."
Bree,I have some money that I've been putting aside for emergencies. It can be all yours if you just--
Bree,Continue to be discreet.
Bree,I don't think it's asking that much. All you need to do is remove one little name.
Bree,"Maisy, please. I mean, we used to be good friends."
Bree,"Maisy, I didn't mention it when you were having financial troubles because I thought it would embarrass you."
Bree,I have fourteen thousand dollars in that account. It can all be yours.
Bree,"Oh, sweetie. They didn't abandon you because you're a whore. They abandoned you because you weren't all that nice to begin with."
Bree,Thank you.
Bree,"Serena, hi. How are you?"
Bree,Oh?
Bree,"Rex, this might sound silly, but are people staring at us?"
Bree,"Well, I could be wrong, but I suspect that Maisy Gibbons' client list has been released."
Bree,"No, I think they're laughing at you. I think they feel sorry for me, which is just as mortifying."
Bree,"Oh. We're gonna act like nothing is happening, and then, when we finish eating, we're going to walk out of here with all the dignity that we can muster."
Bree,"Oh, no. I refuse to give them this kind of satisfaction. Open your menu."
Bree,"Well, you should have thought of that before you left a personal check on Maisy Gibbons' nightstand."
Bree,"Rex. If you walk out of this restaurant, I will scream."
Bree,"I will scream about your cruelty. Then I will scream about your infidelity. And then, just to make sure it really hurts, I will scream about your distasteful sexual habits. You want to know what true humiliation is, you just take one step."
Bree,"So, what are you having? The veal looks good."
Bree,"Gabrielle, is everything okay?"
Bree,"Well, it's just that you've been acting kind of odd lately."
Bree,"Well, you keep coming up with excuses to use everyone's bathroom, and then two days ago, Mr. Cowley looked into your back yard and saw you and Carlos doing your laundry in the jacuzzi."
Bree,"Are you and Carlos having some sort of money trouble? Gabby, it's okay if you are."
Bree,"Yes, and, and to tell you the truth, I'm a little insulted. I am a good friend. Why would you feel like you have to hide that from me?"
Bree,That is obviously different.
Bree,"Well, then, good luck on your remodel."
Bree,Hi.
Bree,"Well, um, I've been doing some thinking. Rex and I have been members of the Fairview Country Club for years, and, well, lately, it seems to have lost some of its exclusivity, and so I've decided not to renew our membership. I'd rather see the money go to someone I care about."
Bree,"Gabby, this is the way I see it -- good friends offer to help in a crisis. Great friends don't take no for an answer."
Bree,Take your time.
Bree,"Andrew, you almost killed another human being!"
Bree,You know we are just lucky that that security guard did not press charges.
Bree,"Well, glad that you asked."
Bree,They're brochures for youth detention centers.
Bree,They've been in the drawer for a few months. I had a feeling we might be needing them.
Bree,We have to admit that we need help. If we can't get through to Andrew then we have to find someone who can.
Bree,"Oh come on, don't be so dramatic. Some of these places actually look fun. Look. Camp Hennessey."" ""Camp Hennessey teaches kids respect for authority and boundaries in a summer camp-like atmosphere."
Bree,"""Well, you have to admit that's an efficient way to teach respect for boundaries. Okay, how about this one. It's perfect for Andrew. It's a ranch in Montana. It has lots of fresh air and plenty of open spaces and daily classes in anger management."" "
Bree,"All right, what about this one. It's in the desert and it's very reasonable. Barracks are a little bit bleak, but that recidivism rate is to die for!"
Bree,"It's easy for you, isn't it? You're not the one he's openly rude to. You're not the one he challenges every day. You're not the one he hates."
Bree,You talk to him all you want. I'm gonna check out the place with the electrified fence.
Bree,"Well, does it?"
Bree,"Well, you should assume that it is."
Bree,"Well, think about how good men are at lying on the spot. I mean, God forbid, you should give them time and a pen!"
Bree,"So, Susan, what are you gonna do with the letter?"
Bree,"Andrew, I need you to take out the trash."
Bree,"Now, not five hours from now."
Bree,No!
Bree,You no longer get an allowance.
Bree,"What I want, what I have always wanted is for you to be happy. And you're not. And I have no idea how to help you."
Bree,I will not. We're gonna talk about this now.
Bree,You have to hand it to Gabby and Carlos. They do grieve better than anyone.
Bree,"I don't know. I mean, maybe it's part of the ritual."
Bree,"All right, people. We're going to follow the body. This way please."
Bree,Come along.
Bree,"Sweetheart, it's been clear to us for sometime now that you've been unhappy. All this acting out--"
Bree,It just isn't you. And we feel that you need to spend some quality time thinking about the goals in your life and what kind of person you want to be.
Bree,There's this place called Camp Hennessey. It's designed for teenagers like yourself who have lost their way and--
Bree,"Hopefully, you won't have to be there for more than a few weeks."
Bree,"Sorry, honey, but you don't have a choice."
Bree,"Honey, it's going to be okay, I promise."
Bree,"Stop it. Honey, no matter what you say or do, I will always love you."
Bree,For being here. For standing by me through this.
Bree,"You don't know what it means to me, Rex. It's been a long time since I felt I had a real partner. And it really helps, especially on a horrible morning like this."
Bree,There's this place called Camp Hennessy.
Bree,You don't have a choice.
Bree,"Rex, I'm not going and that's all there is to it."
Bree,Nowhere in their brochure did it say that we were expected to attend.
Bree,"Well, I'm making him this care package. I mean he'll know I'm thinking about him."
Bree,"Well, I don't understand why."
Bree,"Fine, I won't send them but I think it's a stupid rule."
Bree,No.
Bree,"Because the minute I get there, Andrew will start attacking me for abandoning him and I don't want to hear it."
Bree,I don't feel guilty.
Bree,Hi. What's going on?
Bree,"Oh Lynette, I'm so swamped today. My house is a mess and I've got millions of errands to run."
Bree,If it were any other day.
Bree,Bring them in.
Bree,"Porter, honey, those cookies are hot. Just wait a few minutes and I'll give you one when they're cool, okay."
Bree,You know pictures are prettier if you colour inside the lines.
Bree,"Well, art is subjective."
Bree,"Porter, what did I tell you?"
Bree,"Well, then I will fix you a very nice bowl of peaches and cottage cheese."
Bree,"Don't be common, young man. Now come on, if you play around with those cookies one more time I'll have to spank you."
Bree,Really?!
Bree,"Well, I'm not your mommy and if you mess around in my house you will get spanked. Now be good."
Bree,"Porter, I warned you."
Bree,Those cookies were made from scratch. Your fate is sealed. Come here.
Bree,"Oh no, we had a wonderful time. Although I think Porter had a little less fun. Okay, I'll bet."
Bree,"Well, Porter was misbehaving so I had to punish him."
Bree,"Oh, I had to spank him. Alright I will re-raise."
Bree,"Lynnette, is there a problem?"
Bree,"Sorry, I didn't know. It won't happen again. Of course, I'm a somewhat surprised you don't hit them, I mean everyone knows they're a little bit out of control."
Bree,I never said I was perfect.
Bree,If you will excuse me.
Bree,I wanted to wear Andrew's favourite colour. Then I realised that I don't know what it is.
Bree,Yours is blue. Danielle loves pink. And I have no idea what my own son's favourite colour is.
Bree,How can you say that it doesn't matter? Of course it matters.
Bree,"That is what makes a good mother. Someone who knows their child inside and out, so that if they get into trouble they'll know what to do. I don't know him well enough."
Bree,Brown or green?
Bree,"Green. I'll go with green, everybody loves green."
Bree,"Yes, is it our turn?"
Bree,No.
Bree,"He blames me for his being here. He blames me for everything, and he's probably right."
Bree,"One of us should go talk to him, see how he is."
Bree,Yeah.
Bree,"Don't get up. I'll be quick. Andrew, all any parent can do is try to provide their child with the tools to succeed in life. Education, love, a good, clean safe home. Well, I have given you those things and I'm through feeling guilty. So if you want to piss your life away and blame it on how horrible things are at home, then go ahead. But I want it stated for the record that I am a good mother. Do you hear me? I am a good mother."
Bree,What?
Bree,"Well, he was right. I'll be waiting in the car."
Bree,"Lynette, don't. The fact that you just crossed that street means the world to me. And if anyone should apologise here, it's me."
Bree,I would love to.
Bree,"We made our decision, let's just stick to it."
Bree,"Our son has just told us that he might be gay. There are two hundred other boys in this Kamp. Now I could explain to you what might happen if we left him here, but I'm a lady and I don't use that kind of language."
Bree,"Exactly. So we'll get him home, we'll get him into Christian counselling so it won't become a lifestyle."
Bree,I may be freaked out. But that doesn't change how I feel about him.
Bree,I can be just as cool as you can.
Bree,"Andrew, I would love you even if you were a murderer."
Bree,It'll be fine.
Bree,It's for his own good. You'll see.
Bree,I'm making homemade bratwurst with sweet and sour cabbage. It's a recipe I found in an old German cook book.
Bree,"I'll get the door. Honey, you pour the wine."
Bree,"Andrew, you remember Reverend Sykes, don't you?"
Bree,"Reverend, why don't you have a seat and I will get some refreshments."
Bree,Would you like some water? I have flat or bubbly.
Bree,"Well, that's just too bad because this needs to be discussed."
Bree,"Reverend, I don't mean to criticise. But it sounds like you're giving up."
Bree,"Then what are we supposed to do? Just stand by while he starts dating boys? And by the way, the correct word is not gay, it's sodomy."
Bree,So?
Bree,How you can sit there and be so casual is beyond me?
Bree,"Well, at least I'm trying to be proactive."
Bree,I'm upset because there is a problem here and no one seems to notice it but me.
Bree,Your father is into S&M.
Bree,He makes me beat him with a riding crop and I let him. It's no wonder you're perverted. Look at who your parents are.
Bree,"Andrew, come here, I want you to see this."
Bree,Your baby pictures. Look at that one.
Bree,"About four weeks old. I never told you this, but when I gave birth to you, there were complications. The umbilical chord wrapped around your neck and you stopped breathing. The room got very quiet, and I knew you were in trouble. So I turned to the doctor and I very calmly said that he was not to worry about me, that his job was to save your life. When I say I would die for you, that's not just an expression. I mean it."
Bree,"Andrew, please just go and talk to Reverend Sykes."
Bree,"Please, he can counsel you. It can help."
Bree,Because if you don't change who you are then you won't go to heaven.
Bree,"No, I don't. And I need you there. I would be so lonely without you."
Bree,"Oh, Andrew. Thank you. You don't know how much that means to me."
Bree,"Thank you for a wonderful service, reverend."
Bree,"Oh, my heavenly days. Rex, look, it's George."
Bree,The doctor upped his dosage twice and it's still not helping.
Bree,I would love to. Rex?
Bree,"Well, why don't we just go by ourselves then?"
Bree,What thing? We don't have a thing.
Bree,"Rex, are you still jealous?"
Bree,"It's true that we dated during the separation, but George and I are just friends now, aren't we?"
Bree,"Good, then it's a date."
Bree,"Do you know, I've finally convinced Rex to buy his first orchid."
Bree,George. What about him?
Bree,Please don't be this way. He's the only friend I have who is interested in cultural things.
Bree,No. He just wants to be friends. He told me so.
Bree,He does not seem desperate to me.
Bree,They did?
Bree,I don't remember that.
Bree,"Well, I certainly don't want to hurt him,again."
Bree,"Really? Well, okay. You know what I'm going to miss most about him? George always has a way of making me feel good about myself."
Bree,"Honey, do your hands still tremble when they touch me?"
Bree,"Yes, we have. . And you still don't know when I need you to lie."
Bree,"George, as it turns out I won't be able to go with you to the bonsai expo."
Bree,I think it would be a mistake for us to spend too much time together.
Bree,It doesn't matter.
Bree,He said you're still in love with me.
Bree,Ginger? The stock girl?
Bree,Why didn't you tell me?
Bree,"Oh my goodness, well, this changes everything. A friend of mine is having a barbeque for her husband on Saturday and I think you should come."
Bree,Yes. And bring Ginger.
Bree,"Well, you have to bring Ginger, because if Rex sees the two of you together, then he'll relax."
Bree,What is going on here?
Bree,"It's okay. George has a girlfriend. You brought her, didn't you?"
Bree,See? You were worried for nothing.
Bree,"Come on, Rex, you owe George some sort of a gesture."
Bree,"Rex, have you lost your mind?"
Bree,"Hi. You left the party so quickly I didn't have the chance to apologise to you for what Rex did. Oh, George, I'm so sorry he humiliated you in front of all those people. I don't know what got into him."
Bree,"No, he doesn't hate you. He hardly knows you, and you don't even really know him."
Bree,"Well, that's not his choice to make."
Bree,"Well, I decide who I need in my life, and I've decided that I need you. And that's all there is to it."
Bree,Who says he has to know how I spend my free time?
Bree,"Mmmh! Oh, George, you have got to taste this. It's a little messy but.."
Bree,I don't know. But anything that good has got to be sinful.
Bree,Rex just hates these cooks tours. He likes to stay at home with the same old spaghetti and mug of root beer.
Bree,"I've had one better, in Italy."
Bree,"Yes. Rex and I took a vacation there, right before the kids were born. We had so much fun in those first few years. I guess it was easier to be happy back then. I can't believe I just said that- no more wine for me. "
Bree,What?
Bree,"I can't go on a trip with you, George."
Bree,Because I'm married! People would talk.
Bree,"Oh, don't worry about it. Here I want you to try one of these clams. I bet they're as good as the marinara sauce."
Bree,"But honey, we socialise with them. What am I going to say to Helen?"
Bree,I um. I have to talk to Edie.
Bree,"Oh, it'll just take a second. I need to um, to get a recipe."
Bree,Edie! Hi.
Bree,I saw you at Alfredo's yesterday.
Bree,I beg your pardon?
Bree,"Okay, this is exactly what I was afraid of. George and I are just friends."
Bree,You've got the wrong idea. That man is my pharmacist!
Bree,"I am not having an affair! George and I-we just talk. He's a very good listener and I share my hopes and dreams with him and my innermost thoughts. And that's all there is to it, and you have to believe me."
Bree,Thank you. I'm glad we cleared this up. I know that it must have looked strange and I didn't want you to think that I was cheating on my husband.
Bree,Excuse me?
Bree,"Oh. Oh, I mean, everybody needs someone to talk to."
Bree,"What do you think, Rex? I chose green so that it will work whether Gabrielle has a boy or a girl."
Bree,What's the matter? You've been mopy all day.
Bree,"Oh, honey."
Bree,"No, not at all. I think that we should talk about it. In fact I think maybe we don't talk enough."
Bree,"Why don't we start doing things again, as a couple?"
Bree,"I think that as soon as you're well enough we should go on a vacation. Take a trip, go somewhere fun. Remember our trip to Italy?"
Bree,Sort of? Don't you remember the glorious food and the gorgeous scenery?
Bree,It doesn't matter. You decide.
Bree,"Well, let's see I've beaten you to bridge, and mahjong and hearts. This is your last chance to redeem yourself."
Bree,"Okay, okay, I'll be good."
Bree,"Miss it, miss it, miss it."
Bree,"Come on, I'm allowed to psych you out."
Bree,"Okay, time's up. Take your best shot."
Bree,Hurry up. There're people waiting.
Bree,"Come on, take your best -"
Bree,"George, do you have an erection?"
Bree,What on earth?
Bree,I was teasing you.
Bree,You have got to get rid of it. There are children present.
Bree,"I don't know. Um, um, think of something unpleasant."
Bree,"Like famine, or disease, or hobos. Whatever. Just hurry."
Bree,"I kept this friendship going because I though Rex's dislike of you was paranoid, but you had feelings for me all along. God, this is just such a betrayal."
Bree,"Well, you shouldn't be doing that. In case you've forgotten I'm married."
Bree,I told you in confidence. How dare you throw it back in my face.
Bree,What is that supposed to mean?
Bree,"George, I do love you as a friend. I wish you could love me the same way back, but since you can't, goodbye."
Bree,"Already? Wow, good for her."
Bree,"Yeah, good point."
Bree,"No, and I know guns and that wound was not self-inflicted."
Bree,"Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt to sit her down and share our concerns."
Bree,"Edie, do you want to be a part of it?"
Bree,"I don't know why, but I have this overwhelming feeling that you're gonna be just fine. I really do."
Bree,Don't say that.
Bree,So could I.
Bree,I could walk across a street tomorrow and be hit by a car.
Bree,"All I'm saying is that we're both gonna die eventually, and in the time that we have left, whether it's two days or two decades, I think that we should be nice to each other."
Bree,George. Hi. What are you doing here?
Bree,Why are you shopping here? You live on the other side of town.
Bree,"Oh, well, that's very nice of you."
Bree,Well?
Bree,I'm sorry?
Bree,Wait a minute. What in the world are you talking about?
Bree,You heard that?
Bree,I see.
Bree,"Well, thank you for telling me, but I think, um, I've got to go."
Bree,"Couldn't sleep, so I was just sitting here thinking."
Bree,You really want to know?
Bree,I was thinking that the biggest mistake of my entire life was agreeing to marry you.
Bree,"Forcing me to share in your depraved pasttime wasn't bad enough, you had to share my humiliation with your co-workers?"
Bree,"Rex, everybody is talking about our sex life. Every sordid little detail right down to that box of perversions you keep in your closet."
Bree,You're a liar.
Bree,It doesn't matter.
Bree,"Well, then how do people know because we both know that I wouldn't say anything."
Bree,"I don't know, Rex. Maybe you were bragging or maybe you just subconsciously wanted to hurt me. Well, congratulations, you did it. I am officially destroyed."
Bree,I don't believe you.
Bree,Rex? What is it?
Bree,"No, you're not."
Bree,"Um, all right. You, uh, go downstairs and I will be, I'll be right there."
Bree,I know. I'm gonna take him to the hospital.
Bree,When I finish making the bed.
Bree,I never leave the house with an unmade bed. You know that.
Bree,There. Now we can go.
Bree,Hi. What are you doing here?
Bree,"Um, he's stable, but, um, they have to put in a pacemaker, so they're gonna need to operate. How did you guys know?"
Bree,"We were having a fight when he had the heart attack, and I'm just feeling really guilty, because I should have gotten him here sooner and -"
Bree,"You know what? I am so happy that you guys came here, I really am, but I am trying really hard to be strong, so if you keep comforting me--"
Bree,Mm-hmm.
Bree,Thank you.
Bree,"Oh, I was just, um, thinking that I need to start, uh, spring cleaning."
Bree,"No, and I need to clean out our rain gutters, and, uh, beneath the refrigerator, and I can't tell you how long it's been since I've replaced the shelf liner, so--"
Bree,How did you know that?
Bree,And do you know why I save it for last?
Bree,"Because it makes me think of my Aunt Fern. On the day we got married, I told her how happy I was, and she told me that even during bad times to always remember that the best was yet to come. And so as I polish it, I think about you and the kids and our life and how right she was."
Bree,I know.
Bree,"Rex, you don't have to say anything."
Bree,"It doesn't matter. From here on in, can we just say that we're even?"
Bree,Thanks.
Bree,"And for the record, you are gonna come through this operation just fine."
Bree,Because I told you: the best is yet to come.
Bree,Hello?
Bree,Oh?
Bree,"But his operation, it's not until tomorrow."
Bree,"Yes, of course you did. Thank you very much for calling."
Bree,You are gonna come through this operation just fine.
Bree,Hello?
Bree,"Lynette, hi, it's Bree. I do hope I's not calling too early. Hmm? Oh, of course you can borrow that scarf. I'll press it for you. Um, I have, uh, some news. Rex died."
Bree,"Oh, I'm just waiting for, uh, Rex's mother. She's gonna be here any second."
Bree,"Oh, do one of you drink soy milk? I was cleaning out the fridge this morning, and Rex is the only one who drinks it. I just bought it on Friday. I'd hate to throw it away."
Bree,What a waste.
Bree,"No. No, I can't afford to fall apart right now."
Bree,You're about to find out.
Bree,"Yes, that is Rex's mother."
Bree,"Here's your tea, Phyllis."
Bree,"Phyllis, that's an orange tie."
Bree,"Well, um, he's being buried in a blue suit."
Bree,"I don't think so, but thank you, though."
Bree,"Mrs. Applewhite, hi. I am Bree Van de Kamp, and this is my daughter Danielle."
Bree,"Hi. I would have been over sooner to introduce myself, but I'm afraid there's been a death in my family."
Bree,"Anyway, I'm afraid that my visit has an ulterior motive. The organist at our church is on vacation, and Edie Britt mentioned that you used to be a concert pianist, and -"
Bree,"Thank you. That's just a huge weight off my shoulders. Oh, these are for you."
Bree,Bye.
Bree,"Oh. Well, um, what kind of input?"
Bree,"Phyllis, these are all things that happened to Rex before he went to college."
Bree,"Well, don't you think it'd be nice if Reverend devoted part of the eulogy to his life after he was married?"
Bree,"He's going to do more than mention it. That's the part he'll focus on. In fact, I think three anecdotes from Rex's childhood is more than enough."
Bree,"Reverend, if you don't call her on that incredibly insensitive comment, I'm gonna lose it."
Bree,The happiest time in Rex's life was not his childhood. He loved being a husband and he loved being a father.
Bree,"Phyllis, is there something you'd like to say?"
Bree,You are no longer invited to the funeral.
Bree,"Oh, yes, I am. I am going to hire security, and those security men are going to have sticks and if you so much as set foot in that sanctuary, they will be instructed to beat you with those sticks"
Bree,"Reverend, if you don't back me up on this, so help me, I will pull the funeral out of your church."
Bree,"I am not kidding. I will go nondenominational so fast, it will make your head spin."
Bree,"No, I don't. If you heard the things that she said to me-"
Bree,She went out of her way to be cruel to me. I don't want her at the funeral.
Bree,"It's true Rex and I did not have the perfect marriage, but for eighteen years I tried my very best, and for that I am entitled to your respect."
Bree,"Well, then why did you say those things to me?"
Bree,I do want you to come to the funeral.
Bree,"I left him an hour ago, and he was wearing Ralph Lauren."
Bree,Wait!
Bree,Do not close that coffin.
Bree,Give me your tie.
Bree,Give me your tie!
Bree,You look magnificent.
Bree,--we don't really care what happens behind closed doors.
Bree,""" hyllis, we've only been waiting here for two minutes."" \"
Bree,No. In theory.
Bree,Thank you.
Bree,That's very sweet of you. Thank you.
Bree,"Well, Mr. Pashmutti -"
Bree,"I'm sorry. This is, uh, Rex's mother, Phyllis."
Bree,"Come on, Phyllis. Let's get you something to eat."
Bree,"Phyllis, there are people waiting, so--"
Bree,Who was that?
Bree,My electrician? Why were you on the phone sobbing to my electrician?
Bree,Then why didn't you put me on?
Bree,"For God sakes, Phyllis, don't you ever worry about dehydration?"
Bree,I'm saying that even Italians take a break now and again.
Bree,"So am I, but no one would ever know it with your incessant caterwauling."
Bree,"People want to know how I'm doing, but the minute they ask, you, you jump into the spotlight, and they forget all about me. I need consoling, too, Phyllis. Have you ever thought of that?"
Bree,Thank you.
Bree,Excuse me?
Bree,"I am not cold. I just, well, I don't like public displays of emotion."
Bree,People have said that?
Bree,"This is my third phone call, Mr. Flannery. And if someone doesn't call me back soon, I'm going to be irritated."
Bree,"That darn insurance company is dragging its heels on paying Rex's policy, and I don't understand why."
Bree,Probably.
Bree,"Hi. Oh, hi, Lynette."
Bree,"No, no, not at all."
Bree,"Um, I'm all right."
Bree,Do I?
Bree,Phyllis? You're going to have to stop that.
Bree,"Um, yeah. Sure. Hold on a second."
Bree,That's all right. It was really sweet of you to stop by.
Bree,"So, uh, are we ready to order, or do you need a little more time?"
Bree,George. What are you doing here?
Bree,What?
Bree,"I, I, I don't know how to bowl."
Bree,"Um, thank you, but I just couldn't."
Bree,"I do. I'm just, I'm just not ready yet. But it was very sweet of you to think of me."
Bree,And I appreciate that.
Bree,"I'm, uh, I'm going to see Rex's lawyer. We're going to go over some details involving Rex's will. Phyllis, obviously, I'm just mortified over slapping you. I, I've just been in a weird place since Rex's death, but, that's no excuse. I'm very, very sorry."
Bree,Really?
Bree,This is Rex's mother Phyllis.
Bree,It's right down this row.
Bree,So have you given any thought to when you might be ending your visit? What?
Bree,I was simply asking when you were planning to leave. There was no agenda behind the question.
Bree,"Yes, let's."
Bree,"Oh, my god. What happened?"
Bree,"Well, I got that, but why? Why would they do that?"
Bree,Unless what?
Bree,Insurance investigator?
Bree,"I don't know what you're talking about, Phyllis."
Bree,Suspicious?
Bree,"An autopsy? Detective, Rex died of a heart attack."
Bree,Anomalies? What anomalies?
Bree,Am I a suspect?
Bree,"Well, if I am, you're wasting your time. I loved Rex and anyone who knows me will tell you that I was incapable of hurting him."
Bree,You talked to Phyllis.
Bree,She's my mother-in-law. Of course she said horrible things about me.
Bree,She blamed me for every problem that Rex and I ever had.
Bree,"Well, it was a marriage. Of course there were problems."
Bree,"No, you may not record this."
Bree,"I'm not refusing anything. All I'm saying is stay away from Phyllis. She's a, she's a raving loon."
Bree,"You want a statement? Fine, I'll give you a statement."
Bree,"My husband died of a heart attack. I loved him very deeply, and your mother did a lousy job."
Bree,Get her out of here.
Bree,"At the risk of ruining a lovely evening, I have some unpleasant news. The police dug up your father today."
Bree,"Well, apparently, they want to do an autopsy. They don't think that he had a heart attack. They think that somebody was poisoning him."
Bree,"Well, apparently, I'm a suspect. Well, they always look at spouses first. It has something to with statistics. It's just a formality. I'll be cleared in no time. Would you two please stop looking at me like that? Obviously, I did not kill your father. I loved him deeply."
Bree,"Yes, we had issues, but I would never have hurt him."
Bree,"I was in shock, Danielle. You know that. Andrew, surely you don't think I murdered your father."
Bree,Thank you.
Bree,I would like to submit myself to a lie detector test to eliminate any uncertainty about what happened with my husband.
Bree,I'll waive all that. My only stipulation is that I want my children to be able to see me answer the questions.
Bree,Yes.
Bree,Yes.
Bree,Yes.
Bree,Yes.
Bree,What does that have to do with anything?
Bree,"Well, I'm not gonna respond to something that's none of your business."
Bree,Yes.
Bree,What?
Bree,No.
Bree,"Um, I, I was thinking of something else just then, so why don't you ask me the question again?"
Bree,No.
Bree,"Well, for starters, you can help me prove to the police that we didn't conspire to kill my husband."
Bree,"So because of the anomalies in Rex's blood, the police started to wonder if I'd been poisoning Rex."
Bree,"Well, that's why I took the polygraph, to prove to them that I was innocent."
Bree,"Sort of. Well, I think the police now have a different theory, which is if I wasn't poisoning Rex on my own, then maybe you were helping me."
Bree,"No, that's why I need you to take the polygraph, too."
Bree,It's the quickest way to prove to the police that they're wrong.
Bree,"Um, um, during the test, they asked me some questions about you and, um, us and whether we had a relationship and I said yes, because it's true. And then they asked me something else, something I hadn't considered."
Bree,They asked me if I loved you.
Bree,I said no.
Bree,"But according to the polygraph, that wasn't exactly true."
Bree,"I think perhaps the machine picked up on something, something that I wasn't aware of."
Bree,"That's why I need you to take the test and answer the detective's questions, because I'm not going to know exactly how I feel until we put this behind us, but then, once we do--"
Bree,No.
Bree,I think the machine picked up on something that i wasn't aware of.
Bree,"George, you're a very special friend, you are, but Rex hasn't been dead four weeks so I think kissing on the lips is-"
Bree,Exactly. I hope you don't mind.
Bree,Andrew. What are you doing?
Bree,Of course. You remember Mr. Williams.
Bree,"Ah, wel,l it's getting late, so-"
Bree,"You know, we've been eating out a lot lately. Why don't you come over Friday for a home-cooked meal. Wouldn't that be nice?"
Bree,"Andrew, that wasn't a hint."
Bree,"Actually, it is getting late, and I am tired, so--"
Bree,Andrew!
Bree,Andrew!
Bree,George.
Bree,"Stop it, the two of you, this instant! This was a perfectly lovely evening and now the both of you have ruined it. I will not tolerate this kind of behavior. Do you understand?"
Bree,"All right then. George, we'll see you Friday for dinner. I'll be serving fish."
Bree,Andrew! You are not leaving the house dressed like that.
Bree,"I don't care. Here, put this on. Every time you leave this house, you represent this family. And the least you can do is not humiliate us."
Bree,Yes. A bad one. I hope you haven't made plans for tomorrow night.
Bree,Part of the reason I'm having him over is so that you can get to know him.
Bree,"Honey, the feelings that you're having are perfectly normal, but George isn't trying to take your father's place. He's, well, he's just a friend."
Bree,"You know, I haven't even thought about it."
Bree,I'll be serving dinner tomorrow at seven. Please don't be late.
Bree,"Andrew, don't you have a meet at the swim club?"
Bree,Doesn't it require a large entrance fee? One that you can't afford by yourself?
Bree,"Oh, you don't know the lengths I'd go to for even seating."
Bree,I can't believe how well those two are getting along.
Bree,Andrew is being polite and engaging. He's even laughing at George's jokes.
Bree,"Okay, time for cobbler. Sorry, one of the dessert plates doesn't match. I tried to replace it but it's Spode Florence. It's a rare pattern. Belonged to my grandmother, but hopefully, once you taste the dessert, you'll forget all about it."
Bree,"George, you have to have this. It's absolutely scrumptious."" ""Ummm, ummm!"
Bree,George.
Bree,Well. What did he say?
Bree,"George, I can't allow you to discipline my child if you won't even tell me what he did."
Bree,George! George!
Bree,I'm still recovering from Mike is Zach's real father.
Bree,"Well, I think given everything that's happened, um, it's perfectly justified that you'd be frightened of Zach."
Bree,"But, Zach is Mary Alice's son. He grew up playing in our yards. If he has any hope of surviving, I have to believe he's better off here than on the street."
Bree,"Because. Ever since I found out what Andrew said, I've been doing some soul searching and I realize that everything that's happened is completely my fault."
Bree,"No, it's not. All the things that Andrew's been saying, the way he's been acting, it's all connected to his father's death and it's clear to me that I need to spend more time focusing on him and his needs."
Bree,"Thank you, George, for being so understanding."
Bree,But I only sent him there because his behavior at the time was so completely out of bounds.
Bree,"I just think if I spend a lot of time with him, it'll really help."
Bree,"What he said to you was horribly rude. That camp, it's extreme and unless I felt like Andrew was getting really out of control, then-"
Bree,"Oh George, really?"
Bree,"George, what are you doing here?"
Bree,"Thank you, George."
Bree,Oh.
Bree,"George, it's my pattern. Where did you find it?"
Bree,I love it. Thank you.
Bree,George.
Bree,George. George. George!
Bree,"Andrew, what are you doing?"
Bree,Andrew! Andrew!
Bree,Stop it!
Bree,"The police dug up your father today.They think that somebody was poisoning him.Apparently,I'm a suspect."
Bree,"He is not a corpse. He is a man named Rex Van de Kamp. He was a loving husband, a devoted father, and a successful doctor. So successful, in fact, that he left me enough money to sue the city, this precinct, and you two gentlemen personally just for the fun of it."
Bree,"Thank you. So, uh, what will happen now?"
Bree,"Yes, and I'm sure you will bury him with all the dignity of a dead hamster. No, I want Rex released to me and I will make all the arrangements."
Bree,"Detective Barton, you are clearly a gentleman."
Bree,"Well, I have some good news. The police are finally releasing Rex's body."
Bree,"You know, mostly I'm annoyed that the whole thing happened in the first place. I mean how in the world can anyone accuse me of murder?"
Bree,"Anyway, I was hoping that you were all free Friday morning because that's when I'll be hosting the re-burial."
Bree,"Look, I know it's an imposition, but Danielle is away on a class trip and Andrew is back at Camp Hennessey for a little refresher course. Well, it's just gonna be a very brief and, and dignified ceremony and I was hoping that you could say a few words and, um, I'm gonna read a poem."
Bree,Thank you. You don't know how much this means to me. I've realized looking back that I was still in shock during Rex's first funeral. I don't think it had quite hit me yet what had happened so that's why this small ceremony means so much to me. Because I realize now that this is the last chance I'm gonna have to say goodbye.
Bree,"Thank you. Ah, the hearse is right outside, so if you'll just follow me."
Bree,That's all right. I'll wait.
Bree,"I'm here, sweetheart, and I'm gonna take care of everything. But you knew that, didn't you? You've always known that you can count on me."
Bree,Detective Barton. What are you doing here?
Bree,"Yes. This is Rex. I, I want to thank you again for what you did. It was so refreshing to be treated with kindness after weeks of just ludicrous accusations."
Bree,"Well, I know, but Rex died in his care. Of course he'd like to blame someone else."
Bree,"Oh, please don't talk to me about tests. Rex was not poisoned and no one I know believes that he was."
Bree,What?
Bree,How would you know that?
Bree,Where did you get this?
Bree,How can he have believed this?
Bree,"I'm sorry, but I, I have to go. I have some things that I need to take care of."
Bree,"Detective, I know exactly what my husband deserves. Now would you be a dear?"
Bree,Thank you.
Bree,I'm sorry. I was just attending to some last minute details. Right this way.
Bree,To Rex's grave site.
Bree,I'm changing it.
Bree,"Well, he did something to upset me and I want him gone!"
Bree,"You know, it's so unpleasant I'd rather not get into it. Have you seen these gravestones? Some are from the eighteen hundreds. Just fascinating."
Bree,"My husband, the man I spent my life with for eighteen years, died thinking that I murdered him!"
Bree,"Yes, the cardiologist shared this moronic theory with Rex and Rex believed him!"
Bree,"Yes, because he left a note. And it said, and I quote, ""Bree, I understand and I forgive you."" I spent eighteen years of my life with this man. How could he not know me?"
Bree,"I have done nothing to be forgiven for! I was a fantastic wife! When he was sick, I nursed him. When we were low on money, I stayed within a budget. I cooked his meals, I mended his clothes. For the love of god, I used to check his back for acne. And that miserable son of a bitch has the nerve to understand and forgive me! Well, the joke's on him because I do not understand and I do not forgive!"
Bree,Right this way.
Bree,"If you think I'm gonna lay next to someone for eternity who thinks I'm a murderer, you're crazy. As far as I'm concerned, let him decompose with strangers."
Bree,My husband died thinking that I murdered him.
Bree,Hi. The kids are gone. We have the house all to ourselves tonight.
Bree,"I thought the duck turned out well. Although the sauce was a little bit thick, but judging by how many helpings you had, I think I got away with it. What are you thinking about?"
Bree,"Uh, no, go ahead."
Bree,That better?
Bree,That was nice.
Bree,"Well, I thought we were going to let the duck digest a bit more, but what the heck."
Bree,Oh!
Bree,I don't know. I felt something weird.
Bree,"No, no, no, it wasn't your kiss. I felt something weird on my neck."
Bree,I don't know. I'm just really starting to itch.
Bree,What is it?
Bree,"Oh, ah, ah, it's starting to spread to my face."
Bree,"Oh, I don't think so. I've made duck, l ate a thousand times."
Bree,"I'm sorry, George, but you have to go."
Bree,"How are we going to do that, George? You have just given me hives."
Bree,"Yes, it was the strangest thing. And so inconvenient. To be honest, I think we were about the make love for the first time."
Bree,"Actually, I have not considered that because that's idiotic!"
Bree,Why should I feel guilty?
Bree,"Dr. Goldfine, Rex is dead. You can't cheat on a corpse."
Bree,"Oh so you uh, think I'm crazy?"
Bree,"You can think whatever you want, but to be honest, I don't believe in the subconscious."
Bree,I don't believe him. He is so brazen.
Bree,"Well, Susan did say that he murdered Mrs. Huber, so my vote would be yes."
Bree,I think so.
Bree,"Paul, we've called the police."
Bree,"Hi, it's Bree."
Bree,"Well, great. Um, how would you feel about the two of us checking into a romantic hotel tomorrow?"
Bree,I will let you make all the arrangements. Something out of town would be nice. Good night.
Bree,"I don't know. I thought maybe we could go antiquing."" ""I hear you have some lovely museums nearby. Do you have any brochures?"
Bree,"George, I can't."
Bree,I can't stay in a hotel room with you.
Bree,Because I am starting to get that rash again.
Bree,"Oh, please. it's not gonna help. George, clearly, this is psychosomatic. We need to go home."
Bree,"I know, and you have every right to be mad, but, George, I am really starting to itch."
Bree,George--
Bree,"Please. I mean, clearly, you didn't come here to shop."
Bree,Really? You mean that? You wouldn't mind?
Bree,"You know what, George? We're gonna have a great time, because there's tons of fun stuff we can do that doesn't involve sex."
Bree,Okay.
Bree,"George, you won't believe it. I just stopped itching."
Bree,"So I was talking to one of the bellmen, and he said there's a place not far from here where we could go horseback riding. Doesn't that sound like fun? George?"
Bree,I was saying I think we should go horseback riding.
Bree,What's wrong?
Bree,"Well, I'm not gonna get another rash just by holding your hand."
Bree,"Oh. Well, okay."
Bree,"Oh, well, I'm drinking wine. I don't think you're supposed to mix pills with alcohol."
Bree,"Well, you're the pharmacist. If you think it's okay--"
Bree,I know.
Bree,"Oh, okay. Have you been sitting there all this time?"
Bree,Did I do anything embarrassing? Sometimes I snore.
Bree,Guilty?
Bree,That chair looks so uncomfortable. Why didn't you sleep next to me?
Bree,"George. I know what you want from me, and I, I thought I wanted the same thing, but I keep getting those rashes because I still feel married."
Bree,Can't you just be patient? Can't you wait just a little bit longer?
Bree,Mmm.
Bree,"George, wait. Please don't go. Stay here with me."
Bree,"Well, I'll just have to get over it, won't I?"
Bree,"Well,I'll just have to get over it,won't I?"
Bree,"Honey, you need to put that in a frame or something."
Bree,"Oh, come on, that's a picture of your baby. You can't tell me you're not a little bit excited."
Bree,"Well, I think Mike will calm down in a couple of days and come to his senses."
Bree,Exactly. You're a mother trying to protect her child. It's a natural impulse.
Bree,"Okay, I'm starting to get the feeling that we are not going to a yard sale."
Bree,Um hmm.
Bree,"Oh. George, this is just, uh, an empty house. Why is this a surprise?"
Bree,"Oh, my god! Congratulations. Oh George, I didn't even know you were looking."
Bree,Hi.
Bree,"Uh, I do, I really do."
Bree,Huh?
Bree,"George, Rex hasn't even been dead for two months."
Bree,"See, I thought we were going to a yard sale."
Bree,"See, George, um, the thing is--"
Bree,#NAME?
Bree,Okay.
Bree,"It was just awful. George had a ring. His mother and her friend were there with champagne. If I had said no, it would have devastated him."
Bree,"Well, obviously there's a downside to having good manners."
Bree,"That's why I wanted to talk to you. I mean, part of me just keeps thinking maybe I should just do it."
Bree,"Well, I know it sounds rash, but, well, there's something comfortable about George. We share the same tastes and interests. Oh, and best of all, he loves the opera."
Bree,"Yes, we saw Aida last week and we both cried buckets. It was fun. George loves art, poetry, and music. It would be nice to be married to someone who looks for beauty in the world like I do. I don't know. That's why I'm here. I don't know what to do, Dr. Goldfine."
Bree,"No. True love is great, but at this point in my life, I think I'd rather just go to the opera."
Bree,Hey. We'd better hurry. The movie starts in twenty minutes.
Bree,"Uh, no, I, I guess not."
Bree,Hi.
Bree,Hello.
Bree,What happens in nine months?
Bree,"If you'll excuse me, I, uh, I have to go."
Bree,"I am taking my champagne and my aging eggs, and I'm going home."
Bree,"George, I'm starting to think that we made a mistake rushing into this engagement."
Bree,And I'm not the only one who thinks that. Other people have said the same thing.
Bree,"No. Dr. Goldfine, my therapist."
Bree,"Well, he knows me, and certainly better than you do."
Bree,"Well, for starters, he knows the last thing I'd ever want to do is have more children."
Bree,But you should know that. That's the kind of thing that people who are engaged are supposed to know about each other.
Bree,"It's not just that, George. Dr. Goldfine has other concerns about us being together, and I'm starting to think he's right."
Bree,Really?
Bree,I'll talk to Dr. Goldfine about it tomorrow.
Bree,"Oh, dear. What's wrong?"
Bree,Do you really want to know my secret?
Bree,"Horse manure. I have it delivered. Susan makes fun of me, but the proof is in the pudding."
Bree,"Gaby, if I make it any tighter, you won't be able to sit down."
Bree,Do you actually think they're gonna make fun of you?
Bree,"But why? I mean, surely they have friends who have children."
Bree,"Well, maybe they'll just be happy for you."
Bree,Do you ever think you might like it?
Bree,Motherhood.
Bree,"Oh, come on. You don't think you're gonna love your own baby?"
Bree,"Well, I'm just smiling because I think a few months from now you are gonna come to me and tell me how madly in love you are with your new little baby, and I'm gonna have to resist the urge to say 'I told you so.'"
Bree,There you go. All done.
Bree,Positively glowing.
Bree,"Honey, it's open. Come on in."
Bree,How was your little reunion?
Bree,Weird?
Bree,"You know, honey, people change."
Bree,"Well, maybe Susan, Lynette, and I have had a good influence on you."
Bree,"Come on. When I finish up here, I will come over with my sewing kit and cut you out of that."
Bree,"Well, I know a store that carries maternity clothes with designer labels."
Bree,Huh?
Bree,"Hi, honey."
Bree,How are you?
Bree,"So we're gonna go to my house. I made banana bread, and we'll put on a fresh pot, and just talk about anything."
Bree,"Okay, well, uh, I will call you tonight and we'll figure out a time later in the week."
Bree,"Oh, honey, there's no reason why you and Carlos can't try again."
Bree,How did this get in the paper?
Bree,We discussed this. We agreed to go slowly.
Bree,Rex has only been dead for seven weeks.
Bree,"So, I don't want every woman in this town talking about me behind my back."
Bree,"Well, fortunately, people only read the announcements when there's nothing in the front page, and the headline today was about some catastrophic flood in Sri Lanka."
Bree,"Yes, we did. Now, when the time comes to go public with our relationship, I need you to discuss it with me first. I'm the bride, after all. It's only appropriate."
Bree,The ring?
Bree,It's in my purse.
Bree,But if people see it--
Bree,"Maybe, but why risk it?"
Bree,"Uh, yes, I think so, Mr. Williams."
Bree,"Uh, yes, I am."
Bree,Can I help you?
Bree,"Oh, well, that announcement was a bit premature."
Bree,Yes.
Bree,"Well, I don't know what to say."
Bree,"Yes, it is. To have a complete stranger come into my home, drink my tea, and then try to turn me against one of the sweetest men I have ever known."
Bree,I think it's time for you to leave.
Bree,"I say, given your overall demeanor and your freewheeling use of epithets, I'm willing to bet that he was provoked."
Bree,George.
Bree,"I'm sorry to drop by unannounced, but I just had this disturbing visit from an old friend of yours. A Leila Mitzman."
Bree,"Well, she did, and she said some pretty horrible things about you."
Bree,"That's what I thought, at first, but then having had time to think about it, I can't understand why she'd go to so much trouble. I mean, what would her motive be?"
Bree,No.
Bree,"Fluoxetine, one hundred milligrams. Risperidone, two fifty milli-- I'm sorry. What is this?"
Bree,"Well, then why did you date her in the first place?"
Bree,"That's true, in the beginning."
Bree,"Yeah, of course we are."
Bree,"No, no, I'm just tired, that's all."
Bree,"I don't think so. But thank you, though."
Bree,"Oh, um, the, the stone is loose. So I'm gonna take it to the jewelers. But don't worry, it's safe."
Bree,"No. No. It's like I told you, the stone could just pop off at any second."
Bree,What?
Bree,"Well, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to."
Bree,"Because I don't feel like it. And this is the last time we're gonna talk about this, okay?"
Bree,"Ty! Ty Grant. Oh, hi! What are you doing in town?"
Bree,"Oh, my goodness. Oh, George, this is Ty Grant. We used to date in college. Ty, this is George, um, he's a good friend of mine."
Bree,"Ty, would you like to dance?"
Bree,Let me take your coat.
Bree,"George, would you please sit down? You're being rude."
Bree,"No. George, I don't want to."
Bree,"George, stop it."
Bree,"See, the thing is, I don't think we are anymore."
Bree,"Please, you should go."
Bree,Dr. Goldfine has concerns about us being together and I'm starting to thinking he's right
Bree,"George, I don't want to!"
Bree,I don't think we are any more.
Bree,"Ah, I'm not sure."
Bree,If you'll excuse me for just one minute.
Bree,George! I have guests! What do you think you are doing?
Bree,It was not a tiff! We broke up! It's over!
Bree,"I am not kidding. If you do not knock it off, I'm going to call the police!"
Bree,"Why don't you all take your seats? Uh, dessert is about to be served."
Bree,"Don't lie to me, George. You've been riding up and down this street for the last hour."
Bree,So stalking me is plan B?
Bree,"I do know that, but I'm just not sure you're a good one, either."
Bree,All ready?
Bree,You know this gainful employment thing is really starting to cut into our social life.
Bree,"I just hope you don't expect too much from this relationship. I mean aside from DNA, you might find that you don't have that much in common."
Bree,"Good, good. Seeing friends. I just started co-chairing a charity event for the Junior League and um, and I broke up with George."
Bree,"Dr. Goldfine, do you ever really cure people, I mean, even though they're really crazy?"
Bree,"Well, when I broke up with George, I saw something in his eyes. It was a kind of malevolence, and it just didn't seem to me to be the sort of thing you could cure."
Bree,How can you not believe in evil? A man just threw you off a bridge for no reason.
Bree,Did you say a blue bike?
Bree,"George, I know what you did to Dr. Goldfine. And I can see now just how sick you really are, so please just turn yourself in and that way you can get the help that you really need. George!"
Bree,Yes.
Bree,"Oh, thank you."
Bree,"Hello, Detective Barton. This is Bree Van de Kamp. I need to talk to you about George Williams."
Bree,What?
Bree,"Hey. What were you thinking, taking the pills?"
Bree,George. George!
Bree,Why are you telling me this?
Bree,And then we'll call an ambulance and they'll pump your stomach.
Bree,"I want to help you, but in order to do that, I need to forgive you, and, I can't do that until you admit what you've done."
Bree,"Yes, you did. But that's not what I'm talking about. You killed Rex. But I know it wasn't totally your fault because you're not well. So, if you'll just be honest with me, I can forgive you. It'll be the hardest thing I've ever done, but I'll do it. But you have to, you have to tell me the truth."
Bree,Not until you admit what you've done.
Bree,I called them while you were asleep. They're already on their way.
Bree,''Thank you very much.''
Bree,''So what's happened?Have you had any luck finding George?''
Bree,"'Oh,um--well,um,it was very good of you to tell me in person,truly.''"
Bree,''More?''
Bree,'Those are my panties.How did you--''
Bree,''Where did you find them?''
Bree,"'""Unsavory items'?Well,what does that mean?''"
Bree,''What is that?''
Bree,"''No,wait!Is that supposed to be me?''"
Bree,"''I don't understand. I mean what would George be doing with a life-size doll?Oh,dear lord.''"
Bree,"Oh, hold it. What are you gonna do with that?"
Bree,"Don't you worry about me, Detective Barton. I will be just fine."
Bree,"Well, it turns out he wasn't so sweet after all. Anyway, uh, there's a chance that some of this may wind up in the paper, so I wanted you to hear it from me first."
Bree,"Well, we'll never know."
Bree,That's Andrew back from Camp Hennessey. I've got to go.
Bree,He hasn't got a clue.
Bree,Yeah. They found data in George's personal computer and also records at his pharmacy that pretty much proves that he was poisoning your father.
Bree,"Well, the detective seems to think he was trying to get your father out of the way so he could marry me. Honey, please use your coaster. That's gonna leave a ring."
Bree,"Andrew, that is not fair."
Bree,"Andrew, George Williams fooled a lot of people."
Bree,"Andrew, I'm not trying to minimize my part in this. Believe me, I, I hate myself for what's happened."
Bree,Justin? Is he a friend of yours from school or church? What kind of friend is he?
Bree,"Andrew, it is inappropriate for you to have somebody over. You just got home."
Bree,"Andrew, I made an appointment with a therapist for you, me, and Danielle."
Bree,"This pain that you're feeling is completely natural, but it's not gonna go away until you deal with it. Andrew, I want us to heal. I want us to be a family again."
Bree,"Well, the good news is he's, he's dead."
Bree,"So, are you saying if he were executed, that it would be easier for you to get past this?"
Bree,"George didn't intend to commit suicide. He was trying to manipulate me into taking him back and he swallowed those pills hoping that I'd feel sorry for him. He just assumed that I would call an ambulance. When I got there, he was already slipping away. I tried to get him to accept responsibility for what he'd done, but he wouldn't."
Bree,Nothing. I just sat there and let him die.
Bree,"He didn't die on his terms, Andrew. He paid for what he did to your father."
Bree,George paid for what he did to your father.
Bree,What kind of friend is he?
Bree,What'd you play?
Bree,I did.Betty never RSVP'd.
Bree,Very--interesting.
Bree,"Not exactly, anyway."
Bree,"Yeah, but to be fair to Lynette, you are an ex-model.And surely it must have dawned on you that some women might prefer it if you didn't kiss their husbands."
Bree,"Oh.Bye, sweetie."
Bree,Get over here.Now.
Bree,I saw what you did with your friend.
Bree,"This is not a joke,Andrew.What if the neighbors had seen you?"
Bree,"I may not be able to control what you do outside of this home,but while you are under this roof,you will not mock my values.If you so much as smile at that boy,so help me, I will ship you off to Camp Hennessey and I will not pick you up again until you are 18.Do I make myself clear?"
Bree,Hi!
Bree,"Oh, I just wanted to pick up some fresh croissants for breakfast."
Bree,"To be honest, I don't think I would've liked it, either."
Bree,"No, I wouldn't be so hard on yourself, given her history."
Bree,"You know, the affair."
Bree,You didn't know?
Bree,"I thought everybody knew.Oh, I feel awful.Oh, Ida Greenberg's behind you."
Bree,I shouldn't have said anything.
Bree,Her gardener.
Bree,"No, no, not him.Helen Rowland's son, John."
Bree,Absolutely not.I think the best thing to do is just smile and pretend you don't know anything.
Bree,"Wake up, sleepyhead.I brought fresh croissants for breakfast!"
Bree,Andrew--I want you downstair-- now.
Bree,"Okay, first of all, I want you to march back upstairs and tell your friend he is no longer welcome in this house."
Bree,"I am serious, Andrew.You tell him to get out of here this second or I will call the police, and I will have him removed!"
Bree,"Oh, you think I won't?"
Bree,I didn't kill George.
Bree,Andrew--
Bree,You would actually let the police arrest your own mother?
Bree,"Hi, Karl. Oh!Oh, um, quick question--when someone discusses a sensitive situation with a lawyer such as yourself,when does attorney/client confidentiality kick in?"
Bree,"Here's a check for $100.That's enough for a retainer, right?"
Bree,My son is trying to blackmail me.And I want you to stop the little SOBDo you think you could do that?
Bree,Andrew?Would you mind turning off your video game?My lawyer would like to have a little chat with you.
Bree,"If you wanna lie to the police,go right ahead.But please know that I will sue you."
Bree,"Oh, don't worry.I won't start garnishing your wages until you turn 18."
Bree,How'd it go?
Bree,"Yeah, it seems obvious."
Bree,What noises?
Bree,Do we even know who he is?
Bree,I don't think I can do that.
Bree,"Well,once he stopped suspecting me of murdering Rex he was delightful,but,um--I don't really know him."
Bree,Bye.
Bree,"Oh,hi."
Bree,"Oh,it was no trouble at all."
Bree,"Oh,well,where does she live?"
Bree,Is it serious?
Bree,"Oh,Betty,if there's anything I can do,anything at all--"
Bree,"Oh,you mean your having suspected me of murdering my husband?Detective,that is all water under the bridge now."
Bree,"Although,I have to confess,I do have an ulterior motive.I need to ask you a favor."
Bree,"We have these,um,new neighbors--the Applewhites.It's a mother and her son. They just moved here from Chicago.And they seem very nice.But there's--there's something about them that's--off.They're--odd."
Bree,"Yeah,they're secretive and watchful.And there was a dead body found in front of their house."
Bree,"Yeah,why?"
Bree,"Uh,no.I just wanted to ask you a favor."
Bree,"Are you sure that you can't check on the Applewhites?I mean,I just know that there's something there.And,you know,I have a sixth sense about people."
Bree,"No,no,no,I think given the misunderstanding that I should get the bill."
Bree,"All right,we'll split it."
Bree,"Detective Barton,is this some sort of high school ploy to get me back to your place?"
Bree,I had two glasses of wine.
Bree,"You know what?I politely rejected you,and now you're getting your revenge by embarrassing me."
Bree,I am not giving you anything.Except the bill.
Bree,What do you think you're doing?
Bree,"Oh,you can't be serious."
Bree,"Detective,I am not drunk,and I am not stupid.I know exactly what this is all about."
Bree,"A sobriety test? I'm not taking any sobriety--test.This behavior stems from the hurt feelings of a man with very low self-esteem.The world is a big place,and I'm sure there is a woman out there somewhere who'll respond to your macho posturing."
Bree,I'd rather you didn't.
Bree,Started?
Bree,I beg your pardon?
Bree,"I am not sure,but I think there was a compliment in there somewhere,so thank you.But I am not an escort."
Bree,"Look,I'm--$5,000."
Bree,"Well,how am I supposed to get home? I don't have any money."
Bree,I have been through enough humiliation for one day.I hope you have a better suggestion than that.
Bree,"Oh,for goodness sakes!"
Bree,"Oh,oh,I'm fine.I just,um,had a flat tire."
Bree,"You know,thank you,but I think it's actually something more mechanical.My car has been making just a terrible noise."
Bree,"Actually,my car has been impounded by the police."
Bree,"Thanks,Betty,and,um--I'd appreciate it if you could keep this little incident to yourself."
Bree,"Well,that's good to hear,because most people on this street couldn't keep a secret if their lives depended on it."
Bree,"Yes,but the difference is most of those people were actually drunk when they were arrested.I was not."
Bree,"You know,you sound like you don't believe me."
Bree,"I'm sorry,but since when do you know so much about my personal life?"
Bree,Except for you.You're really good at it.
Bree,"Well,you moved into your house in the middle of the night.God knows what you moved in that you didn't want anybody to see.People hear sounds coming at all hours from there.And,oh,what was the last one?Oh,right--they found a dead body in front of your home.Everybody talks about the Applewhites,but nobody can figure out exactly what you people are hiding.So congratulations.Your secrets are safe--for now."
Bree,"Andrew,give me one good reason why shouldn't call the police."
Bree,"Danielle?Honey, are you in there?"
Bree,Really? Because I'm holding your backpack with all your schoolbooks.
Bree,"Oh, while I'm here I might as well grab some of your laundry."
Bree,"Honey, stop complaining.One day you'll wish that someone were offering to do your laundry."
Bree,"Danielle, question?Is there a black man hiding under your bed?"
Bree,"I just thought you should know that I came home to find your son hiding underneath my daughter's bed,and it just seems to me that--"
Bree,"Oh, honey."
Bree,"Oh, honey, what happened wasn't my fault.There's no way I could've predicted how Betty would react."
Bree,"Oh, honey,why would I want that?"
Bree,"Danielle, that's ridiculous,sweetheart."
Bree,Danielle--
Bree,All I ever wanted was for you to be happy.
Bree,"Danielle,I don't feel much like cooking tonight.I'm thinking of ordering a pizza."
Bree,All right.
Bree,"Hi, Betty."
Bree,I wanted to talk to you about what happened the other day with the kids.
Bree,"Well, my fear is that if we keep them apart,they'll try that much harder to be together.I mean, you know how teenagers can be,and, well, a lot can happen in a couple of weeks."
Bree,"Well, how about some old-fashioned chaperoning?That way they can, um,still see each other,and we won't have to be the villains."
Bree,"Now that you mention it,I guess I do.I have to go. I have some,um, muffins in the oven."
Bree,It's the Applewhites. I don't want you to go near them.
Bree,Do you remember the man they arrested--the one that broke into Gabrielle's and escaped from the mental hospital?He's there.I saw him in their window.They're hiding him.
Bree,"No, I'm not.And I forbid you to go over there."
Bree,"Lynette, hi, it's Bree.Uh, listen,call me when you get this message,and please come to poker tonight.I have some big news about the Applewhites."
Bree,Betty.What a surprise.
Bree,"Uh, now is actually not a good time for me."
Bree,I don't know what you mean.
Bree,He's your son?
Bree,"But, Betty, the police are looking for him.He escaped from that facility they sent him to."
Bree,What are you talking about?
Bree,Hi. Come on in.
Bree,"Um, about that-- um--"
Bree,"Well, perhaps I got more excited than I should have,but I recently found out that Betty Applewhite is quite the poker player,and so, uh, I have invited her to join our weekly game."
Bree,I'll raise you.
Bree,"Maxine, once again,this entire lunch was just out of this world. I just have to get the number of your caterer."
Bree,"Oh, come on. do you honestly expect us to believe that you had the time to prepare a 6-course meal for 10 women?Even I couldn't make this and I have time to get ready for a party"
Bree,I have the same recipe for English plum pudding.It takes six hours to prepare.How would she have time to make all of this and everything else that we ate today?This is not the pudding of an honest woman.
Bree,what on earth?
Bree,"Well, I'm not sure,but I think Maxine had a slave."
Bree,Oh! what is it?
Bree,Excuse me?
Bree,Can we talk about this later?I-I have ice cream in here.
Bree,Who told you that?
Bree,"When it comes to Betty Applewhite,I know what I'm doing,and you two are just gonna have to trust me.and if you can't do that,then perhaps I've overestimated the depth of our friendship.Now,if you'll excuse me--"
Bree,Don't brush your hair at the table.
Bree,"Why should I?You betrayed this family,and you're not even sorry."
Bree,"If the Applewhites go to the police and tell them that your brother ran over Mrs. Solis,he could go to prison.How can you not understand that?"
Bree,"What did this caleb do,exactly?And why on earth are they hiding him?"
Bree,"Is that what you really think, Danielle?I should go to Mrs. Applewhite, be nice,and then she'll hand over all her secrets?"
Bree,"When I was young, my stepmother told me that I was very lucky.I possessed beauty,wit, cunning and insight.These were weapons all women needed to survive in the world."
Bree,"So take good care of your looks, Danielle.you don't have any other weapons at your disposal."
Bree,Caleb? Is that you?
Bree,Hi.I'm Bree.I live down the street.I'm a friend of your mother's.
Bree,I know. Um--I came to see you.
Bree,"Yes.Your mother told me all about you and I thought it it might be nice if, um,we had a little visit.I brought you some homemade cobbler."
Bree,"So, Caleb,besides your mother and brother,does anybody else know that you're here?"
Bree,Thank you.That's very sweet.So where have you been living this whole time? Upstairs?
Bree,Downstairs?
Bree,"Caleb, have you been down here all these months?"
Bree,Did your mother make you wear those?
Bree,"Oh, my god!Sweetheart,I don't understand.Why in the world would your mother treat you that way?"
Bree,A girl?
Bree,Oh.
Bree,"Come on in, Betty.Get you a drink?"
Bree,"Caleb and I had, uh,a very lovely chat. Yes."
Bree,"Aren't you gonna ask me what we talked about?The name, um--Melanie Foster came up.I'm gonna pour you a drink now, Betty,because we're about to have a very honest discussion,and I think you're gonna need a little help getting through it."
Bree,"Yes, I did.I also noticed that you had him chained in the basement."
Bree,Your crime?
Bree,Tony?Do you have to rush off?I thought maybe we could just chat for a minute.
Bree,"Well,I didn't wanna come here because I was afraid it would drudge up memories of my husband.You know,this was our place.Rex passed away recently.He was,um,murdered by our pharmacist."
Bree,I didn't have to.He committed suicide.
Bree,"Oh,no,no,no,no.I'm okay."
Bree,"Well,okay.Tony?How many more arias is he gonna sing?"
Bree,"Oh. In that case,why don't you bring me another bottle of the Pinot Grigio?And please hurry."
Bree,"I do not have a hangover,Andrew,because I was not drunk."
Bree,"Look,for the record,I had an allergic reactionto my antihistamine medication,so I would appreciate just a little bit of sympathy."
Bree,"For god sakes,it was an honest mistake.I thought I could have just a little bit of wine with dinner,but, apparently,my body couldn't handle it.Fine!If it makes everybody happy,I will just suffer through my sneezing fits and my hives on my own."
Bree,There. Is that better?
Bree,Boys--can you just keep it down just a little bit?Because I have a very--special type of grown-up headache.
Bree,"Honey,you can't.They're at work."
Bree,"Sure.Just--just a moment,okay?"
Bree,"All right,boys,let's have it."
Bree,Boys?Boys?
Bree,"Okay,we're done playing hide-and-seek!Boys?!"
Bree,Porter! Preston!This isn't funny!
Bree,"Mrs. Mccluskey,hi.Have you seen the Scavo boys?"
Bree,I have something to tell them.
Bree,"Oh,thank god! I'm so sorry.I don't know what happened.I was in the kitchen cleaning up after making cookies,and I looked in the living room,and they were gone."
Bree,I most certainly was not.
Bree,No--no harm done.
Bree,"Oh,truthfully,I haven't been able to get my mind off it.What a scare,huh?"
Bree,"Well,you know how boys are at the age.They're escape artists."
Bree,Penny?
Bree,"You know,I think,um,I must have been cleaning the kitchen,and I-I just didn't hear them because of the noise from the dishwasher."
Bree,"No!Ah,you know,I may have had just the tiniest little bit of chardonnay."
Bree,"Lynette,if I close my eyes even for a moment,it's because of these antihistamines I've been taking."
Bree,"Now that you're speaking to me in a fairly accusatory tone,may I remind you that I was doing you a favor?"
Bree,"No!The only problem I have is with your children.They're incorrigible because you let them run amok.And if I hadn't drifted off,they would have waited until I was in the bathroom or stuck on the phone or upstairs doing laundry."
Bree,I will not be spoken to like that.I just won't.
Bree,"I'm really well.Um,I just saw you all talking before Lynette went off to work.What were you all talking about?"
Bree,Oh. Good for you.Did Lynette mention the little tiff we had?
Bree,"Because what happened was,I accidentally mixed my antihistamine medication with,you know, a little glass of wine I was having, and I-I fell asleep, you know,while I was--watching her kids.I mean,I like a little wine with dinner,I mean,now and then. You know,who doesn't?But,uh,I mean,you know, to trash my entire reputation--"
Bree,"Well,good. I mean,I just--I really wouldn't want you to get the wrong impression.Well,I'm--I'm going to the mall.They're having a white sale today.I think I'm gonna get a new bath mat.Oh,does anyone need one?"
Bree,"Okay,take care."
Bree,Hmm?
Bree,"Oh,I wasn't hiding anything.I was simply--enjoying the day.What you want?"
Bree,"Oh,well,if you need a ride to school, I'm happy to drive you."
Bree,"Well,then I suggest you get a job."
Bree,"Andrew,we're not touching your trust fund."
Bree,"Not until you're 21.And if I had my way, you wouldn't get your hands on it until you're 50.I mean,we both know you're gonna waste every penny of it."
Bree,"Because,sweetheart,it is my job to teach you about responsibility,setting goals,delayed gratification."
Bree,"You know,on second thought, I won't be driving you to school.The walk will do you good."
Bree,The answer is no.
Bree,"Andrew,did I hear the bell?Oh,hello."
Bree,"Oh,okay.Are you a friend of Andrew's?"
Bree,"His lawyer? Well,why on earth would Andrew need a lawyer?"
Bree,"Honey,what happened to-- to your face?"
Bree,"For the record,I did not punch my son.I slapped him with an open palm."
Bree,This is ridiculous.Can't you see this is a performance?
Bree,And what might that be?
Bree,Emancipated?
Bree,"Well,that's the silliest thingI've ever heard of.How would he support himself?"
Bree,So that's what this is about--your trust fund?
Bree,"Uh,Mr. Bormanis,I'll need a little time to think about this."
Bree,"Your lawyer left a message on my machine.It seems we have a hearing in four weeks,and I wanna be ready."
Bree,"Oh,there's no pretending.I am going to my first A.A. Meeting tomorrow.Of course,I picked one in the worst part of town so I won't run into anybody I know,which,of course,means I will."
Bree,"Perception is reality,Andrew.And if people perceive me to have a drinking problem,then I do.And I certainly don't want some idiotic judge using my hobby as an excuse to make you rich.So I'm simply going to give up my wine and become a recovering alcoholic."
Bree,"Oh,Andrew,you don't think I love you enough to give up alcohol?"
Bree,"Because I'm not done with you yet.It's my job to teach you,and you are not half the manI know you can be."
Bree,"If I really thought that,I'd get a gun right now and kill us both."
Bree,I'm sorry.I didn't quite catch that.
Bree,"You know,the opposite of love isn't hate.It's indifference.And if you hate me,that means you still care,and we're still connected,and I still have a chance to set you right."
Bree,"My name is Bree,and I am an Alcoholic."
Bree,"Perception is reality, Andrew."
Bree,"My name is Bree, and I am an alcoholic."
Bree,"Oh! Um, I couldn't possibly top that.Thank you, though."
Bree,"Hi.Before coming to these meetings,I never realized how messy substance abusers can be."
Bree,You're awful.
Bree,"Gosh, um--I'm not exactly sure."
Bree,Now why would you say that?
Bree,"Okay, you got me.I'm not really an alcoholic."
Bree,"It's true. I'm coming here because of my son.You see, he's--he's trying to take me to court to become an emancipated minor,and he's planning on lying to the judge and telling him that I am some sort of dreadful lush."
Bree,Exactly.
Bree,"I know you think I'm kidding myself,but I'm not.I'm nothing like you people.I just don't have a compulsive personality."
Bree,Is this Libby's real hair color?
Bree,"Did he just call her ""baby""?"
Bree,"Well,you know,before Mike came along,I always just assumed they'd get back together."
Bree,"You didn't know them during the good times.I mean,there was such a spark between them,so much passion."
Bree,Hello there!I thought you and your friend might like some snacks.
Bree,"Well,I'm still appalled that you're helping my son with this ridiculous emancipation scheme,but you are a guest in my house,and guests get sandwiches."
Bree,"Andrew,there may be a judge out there stupid enough to emancipate you,but until you find him,I retain all my parental rights,one of which is to ground your sorry behind until kingdom come.Mr Bormanis,nice to see you again.And,um,please don't get crumbs on my carpet."
Bree,"Oh,no,thank you.I have to run. Just the check.I have a charity event this weekend,and I have to find a cocktail dress before the store closes.But everything was just yummy."
Bree,What do you think you're doing?You're supposed to be grounded.
Bree,With what?You don't have any money.
Bree,You took that out of my purse.
Bree,We are going home. Wait tillI tell the judge about you stealing my credit cards and sneaking off.It's gonna do wonders for your little emancipation case.
Bree,"Oh,and why is that?"
Bree,So? You had one of the loveliest childhoods I've ever known.
Bree,"Andrew,the judge is not seriously gonna believe that I beat you."
Bree,You can't be serious.
Bree,No one is ever gonna believe a word of that.
Bree,"On second thought,I will have another glass of wine.You can leave the bottle."
Bree,"Hi,it's Bree Van de Kamp.I didn't know who else to call,and,well,I'm in a bit of a situation."
Bree,I would rather not discuss it right now.
Bree,I'd prefer if you--didn't.
Bree,You sound like you're impressed.
Bree,"I'm raising a monster,is what I'm raising.It's no wonder I drink.I don't know why I said that."
Bree,"No,it makes it sound like I think I have a problem,and I don't."
Bree,"Tonight was a very unusual situation.I wish you could've known me when--Rex was alive and my kids were young,and everything was--the way it was supposed to be.I think you really would've liked me-- so much."
Bree,Really?Because I don't.
Bree,"I'm curious,Peter.What is the easiest way to overcome addiction?"
Bree,I don't know.I guess I'm just impatient to get on with my life.
Bree,I was just giving you a little kiss.
Bree,"Well,it's just my way of saying thank you for everything you've done for me over the past few weeks.What's-- wrong?"
Bree,And that's a--a real thing?
Bree,It was just a peck on the cheek.
Bree,So-- how long has it been since you--
Bree,So how are you doing?
Bree,Oh.
Bree,See?I think you can handle affection better than you give yourself credit for.
Bree,What?
Bree,Really?Peter! But--but--you forgot your shirt!
Bree,Hello.
Bree,"Uh,sure. Help yourself.There's also frosted glasses in the freezer."
Bree,"I know that you're still angry with me,and,I wanted to tell you that I have,joined a recovery program.A.A.I just wanted you to know that--and to tell you I'm sorry.You are--a real friend,and I value your honesty."
Bree,"Thanks,but I'm not really out of the woods yet.I still have this whole court case hanging over my head."
Bree,"Yes,and his lawyer is taking depositions now to see if I am a fit parent.And considering that mishap that I had with your kids,I,uh,I imagine he'll be anxious to talk to you."
Bree,Do you have any idea what you might say?
Bree,"I could not ask for anything more.Thanks.See you around,I hope."
Bree,What do you mean?
Bree,"Of course not.I just want you to understand something.Andrew is making accusations--false accusations,saying that I abused him,all because I wouldn't let him have his trust fund early so he could buy a car.I mean,can you blame me for wanting to know if I have your support?"
Bree,I actually don't want anything of the sort.
Bree,"I got,uh,your message that you wanted to see me before the meeting started."
Bree,Hi.
Bree,"I,um,I don't want a new sponsor.I'm-- I'm very comfortable working with you."
Bree,"Peter,all we did was kiss."
Bree,"It's not a good time for change in my life,Peter.Terrible things are happening.I'm headed to court.I need your support now more than ever."
Bree,"But,Peter--"
Bree,Hmm. Some muffins?
Bree,"Oh!Well,good for you."
Bree,"Um,Donna--I-I really appreciate everything that you've been doing for me,but I think I was really making some progress with Peter as my sponsor.And I was thinking--"
Bree,"Well,I just really feel likeI'm jeopardizing my recovery by switching--"
Bree,Come on?Where are we going?
Bree,"Peter. Hi,it's Bree."
Bree,"No! No,I-I don't feel like I'm gonna drink.And if I did,I certainly would call Donna.I mean,she and I are just--we're just really clicking."
Bree,"I know it's really late notice,but a friend of mine,uh,got engagedand she's throwing a party,and I thought,um,maybe you'd like to come."
Bree,"Well,you're not my sponsor anymore,so I assume this is allowable.I mean,it's just a casual get-together."
Bree,"Okay,Peter,I just really--need us to be friends.When I'm with you,I'm not myself,which is a good thing."
Bree,"Oh,hello."
Bree,"Hi. Um,I need some advice from a professional.I'd like to get stinking drunk.Do you have anything that can accomplish that in a hurry?"
Bree,I don't need Donna.I need you.
Bree,Eleanor!
Bree,What are you doing here?
Bree,It's a recent development. Where's dad?
Bree,What?! Why?
Bree,"Dad,you don't understand.This has gotten really ugly."
Bree,She's so adorable and I just love the name Lily
Bree,"Yeah.Okay,bye."
Bree,That's your solution?
Bree,"Um,I'm sorry,dad,but I think my relationship with Andrew is just a bit more complicated than--"
Bree,"Fine!Yes,um--so,um,who goes first?"
Bree,"Andrew,I forgive you."
Bree,"I slapped him once,and he deserved it."
Bree,"Andrew,I find your concern ironic,given how tanked you were when you ran over our neighbor's mother with your car."
Bree,She's dead!
Bree,Andrew falsely accused me of molestation--in a mall!
Bree,"Eleanor,I thought you'd gone to bed."
Bree,Really?And whose idea was that?
Bree,Absolutely not.
Bree,"Do you really think that I am enjoying airing my dirty laundry in public?This whole situation is mortifying.But I can't back down because he is my son,and I need more time to get through to him."
Bree,"My mother didn't think they were awful.When I made those same cookies for her,she loved them."
Bree,"Oh,but not you.With you,I had to work for every kind word I ever got."
Bree,No.I resented you because those were kick-ass peanut butter cookies.
Bree,"Eleanor,please--"
Bree,Do you really think that I am a failure as a parent?
Bree,"Justin,what happened?"
Bree,I'm so sorry. I know that you're good friends.
Bree,Oh.Why?
Bree,Yes.I'd be curious to know just what it is you see in him.
Bree,"You know,it never ceases to amaze me how people can turn their backs on their own family.I mean--but it happens every day,doesn't it?"
Bree,"You know,Justin,if you would be willing to help,I'm pretty sure that I could find a way to keep Andrew from moving.What do you say?"
Bree,"Oh,honey,it's all right.I mean,with the new baby at home, I'm surprisedyou made it at all."
Bree,"So tell me,how are you doing?I mean,your entire world must be turned upside down.You must be exhausted."
Bree,"I just got a massage at Misty Spring.Things have been a little tense at home, and I needed an hour to relax."
Bree,"Oh,by the way,while I was there, I saw your,uh,your housekeeper.Xiao-mei?"
Bree,Are you sure? I was talking to her in the steam room for about 20 minutes.
Bree,"Yeah,apparently you gave her a gift certificate."
Bree,"All right,here we go.This is the last of Andrew's things.Once we tape up these boxes,we can start loading the car."
Bree,"Well,I have to admit,I was a bit upset at first.But then it hit me.You're his grandparents. You should bond,get to know the real Andrew."
Bree,"Oh,dad,I-I forgot to warn you.These are some of Andrew's adult videos.I don't approve,but boys will be boys."
Bree,"Oh,shoot! I wish you hadn't gone through that.Now we have to have an unpleasant conversation,and we were having such a nice time."
Bree,"Oh,dad,Andrew hates labels.I'm sure it's just a phase."
Bree,"Maybe not,but it's no longer my concern now that he'll be living with you."
Bree,"Oh,they,uh,they already left."
Bree,"Uh,yeah,they wrote you a letter.It seems they came across some personal items of yours that, um,upset them."
Bree,"Well,actually they can.I mean,it's their money to dispense with as they see fit.I know it doesn't seem fair,but--"
Bree,"Well,now that you can't afford to become emancipated,I guess you're gonna have to stay here with me."
Bree,"Oh,I,um,had a chance to have a nice chat with Justin the other day.He really seems very sweet.I've invited him over for dinner tonight. I hope you don't mind."
Bree,I think you'd love the opera.The music and the voices--it's just all so-- passionate.
Bree,You making fun of me?Huh?
Bree,Yes?
Bree,"I'm sorry, Peter,but, uh, who is this?"
Bree,"Oh, your A.A. sponsor?"
Bree,Oh.
Bree,"Um, excuse me.I don't know what that means,but could you please stop saying it?"
Bree,"Yeah, apparently,he was seeing someone."
Bree,"No, he did not say."
Bree,Edie!
Bree,"Yeah! you know, they're always coming up with these excuses to justify being a home-wrecker."
Bree,"No, I'm not."
Bree,"Look, you don't have to worry about Peter,not while he's with me."
Bree,"Because when it comes to sex,I have an unwavering moral compass.Truly. A man could beg and plead all day long,and it wouldn't make any difference.So since I have such strong self-control,there's really no reason for us to end our friendship."
Bree,"Well,I am sorry,but the Peter I know has a little more sense--"
Bree,"Well, aren't you the renaissance man."
Bree,"Not yet.You obviously have an encyclopedic grasp of everything deaved.But clearly, you don't have the slightest idea about the power of a loving relationship."
Bree,"Well,I think Peter is a better man than you do,and I am not gonna let you keep us apart."
Bree,Excuse me.Excuse me.May I ask you something?
Bree,"If a citizen,an ordinary citizen like myself,knew of someone holding a significant amount of drugs,what would my responsibilities be,you know, under the law?"
Bree,"It's just awful, isn't it?I mean, you never know what people are doing behind your back.Would you like some milk with your cookies?"
Bree,"Well, I have been doing some thinking and--here's a thought--why don't I be your sponsor?"
Bree,"Well,cravings are cravings,and all you really need is a friend to call when you start having inappropriate thoughts,and I can be that friend."
Bree,"Well, if you were in trouble,I could handle it."
Bree,Because I can be very strong for those people that I really care about.
Bree,"Yes, and in that time,I've come to learn that you're good and kind and smart.And, yes,you have a little problem that you need some help with,but I'm willing to be there for you.So what's the big deal?"
Bree,"Peter,let me be your rock.Taking care of people is what I do best.Drink your milk."
Bree,Hello?
Bree,"Hi,I'm--I'm looking for,um, Peter Mcmillan."
Bree,"No, no, I'm--I'm good.I'm just, um, here to pick up my friend Peter.He's locked himself in your bathroom,and I'm here to take him home."
Bree,"Yes, it is."
Bree,"Yes,I'm aware of that."
Bree,"Peter?Peter, it's Bree.Are you in there?"
Bree,What are you doing here?
Bree,You can't possibly be turned on by what's going on out there.
Bree,Yes.Why would you wanna come to a place like this?
Bree,"Well, that's not your life anymore."
Bree,Peter--
Bree,"Rex said he'd always be faithful.George said he'd never hurt me.And as it turned out,they were both liars.So as long as you're honest with me,you'd be amazed at what I can put up with.Now let's go home."
Bree,"Get away from her!Danielle,I want you to pick up the phone and call the police."
Bree,What?
Bree,I don't care.
Bree,"If I hadn't been in the house,he could've raped her--or worse."
Bree,"Needless to say,the agreement between us is off.Caleb is dangerous,and I want him put away.If he is not gone by tomorrow,I am calling the police."
Bree,"Yes.Betty,I am serious.Either you do something,or I will."
Bree,We ask God to grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change--
Bree,--the courage to change the things we can--
Bree,#NAME?
Bree,"Honey,you've got to eat something."
Bree,"Gaby,you can't promise her that."
Bree,"Andrew,I am having Peter over for dinner tomorrow night,and I was wondering if you would like to invite Justin?"
Bree,Out of the question.
Bree,"Until they lock Caleb up,I don't want you anywhere near that family."
Bree,"Your brother and I had a talk,and we've come to a detente of sorts."
Bree,"Well,he did falsely accuse me of child abuse.I would say we're even.Wouldn't you,Andrew?"
Bree,"Peter,I don't think I'm being unreasonable here."
Bree,"Listen,I don't expect you to lie about the alcoholism.I mean,they know that's how we met.It's just--you know,the other thing."
Bree,"They're just getting to know you,and so I want them to focus on your good qualities.I just don't know how they'll react if they find out that you're a sex addict."
Bree,"Sorry,I don't know what's taking Danielle so long to get dressed."
Bree,"Honey,what are you wearing?"
Bree,"Yes,I just--I'm worried you might be a little cold."
Bree,"Right. Good. Um,sorry.Everybody,dig in."
Bree,"Isn't this wonderful?Good food,pleasant conversation--this really is a very special night."
Bree,"Oh,my god,are you okay?"
Bree,"Well,I guess that's important,so--"
Bree,What a shame.I really wanted him to have a chance to get to know you guys.
Bree,"Andrew?Honey,where are you?I got your message.What's the emergency?Andrew?Andrew?"
Bree,"Andrew?Honey,what are you doing in my bed?"
Bree,Did you forget that we're supposed to take that tour of Perkins College today?
Bree,Consider me a cheerleader for anything that expedites me getting you out from under my roof.
Bree,"There's so many things I wanna say to you,Andrew.But mostly,I just want you to know how sorry I am."
Bree,"Every child deserves to be loved unconditionally,and I thought that was the kind of love that I had for you.Maybe if I had,it would've been different."
Bree,"I packed up some of your things.There's also,um,an envelope in here with some money,and that should tide you over until you get a job."
Bree,I noticed a bus stop about a mile back.You can go anywhere you want.
Bree,I have to.I can't be around you anymore.I'm just not strong enough.
Bree,You win?
Bree,"Well,good for you."
Bree,I can't be around you anymore.I'm just not strong enough.
Bree,"Absolutely not.Just give me an hour or two to straighten up Andrew's room,and then you can bring your-- selves over."
Bree,I think it's gonna be a kick having Susan and Julie stay with us.It'll be like living in a sorority.We'll stay up late and we'll gossip and make s'mores.Doesn't that sound like fun?
Bree,I don't want to talk about it.
Bree,"You know what? Maybe Andrew leaving will be good for us.You are all I have left,and I am gonna be the best mother that I can be."
Bree,What?
Bree,"Oh, my god, Danielle.I am so sorry."
Bree,"Honey, you've gotta let me make it up to you.I-I'm gonna throw you a birthday party with all your friends, okay?"
Bree,Name it. It's yours.
Bree,"But, sweetheart, this is--this is his room."
Bree,"Honey, where am I gonna put all of his things?And, you know, he might come back at some point."
Bree,Surprise!
Bree,"Isn't it darling?I made it for your party.It's a big ""1""and a big ""7""--for ""17."""
Bree,"Yeah. I just wasn't tired.Oh, I wanna show you what else I've planned.I think you're gonna love it."
Bree,"No, relax.He's a very hip juggler.He only performs to Beatles songs,and I saw the video,and it's absolutely thrilling."
Bree,"Danielle, I just want you to have the best party you have ever had in your entire life."
Bree,Oh.Okay.
Bree,"Honey, I can't possibly put it in the garbage as is."
Bree,"Oh, Susan,did I wake you?"
Bree,"Well,I'm sorry about the noise.It's just that Danielle doesn't want balloons,and I'm kind of pressed for time."
Bree,She said she doesn't want balloons.I'm fine.
Bree,I'm fine. Why?
Bree,"Well,I just keep messing it up.I don't know what's wrong with me."
Bree,It just keeps coming out too thick.
Bree,"People care about details.Someday when Danielle looks back,I want her to remember just how perfect her cake looked and how hard her mother worked to make her happy.This cake is a symbolof my love."
Bree,"Stop!One of the candles went out.Um, we're gonna have to do this all over again.I'm sorry. I'll be right back."
Bree,"Sweetheart,this is your special day.All of your candless should be lit.It'll just take me two seconds."
Bree,All righty.
Bree,Who touched this?
Bree,"Somebody ruined your cake,and I wanna know who could be that thoughtless."
Bree,Was it you? Or you?!Who was it?
Bree,You!
Bree,You look like a girl who enjoys her frosting.
Bree,"It's just a cake, for god sakes.Will you please just cut it?"
Bree,Open your mouth.I wanna smell your breath.
Bree,Barbie!
Bree,What the hell is wrong with you?!Now it's ruined!Everything is ruined!
Bree,"Um,you can just--leave that there,and I'll, um--clean it up later."
Bree,Yeah.
Bree,"Oh, that's okay.I can't sleep anyway."
Bree,I take it you heard what happened.
Bree,"It was the oddest sensation.I was fine,and everything was fine,and then suddenly I was on the outside of my body watching a woman who looked like me becoming a raving maniac."
Bree,"Oh, no, I'm fine.I'm just tired, that's all.I just need a long rest,and then I'm gonna be as good as new."
Bree,"Because, um, I can't sleep just yet."
Bree,"Because when I sleep,I dream,and when I dream,I keep seeing Andrew's face in that rearview mirror."
Bree,"Andrew, didn't run away.I, dropped him off in the middle of nowhere,told him that I couldn't be around him anymore,and then--I drove off.So I just need a little time to forget what I've done,and then I can sleep again."
Bree,That would be nice.
Bree,"Hello.My name is Bree Van de Kamp,and I'd like to admit myself for psychiatric observation."
Bree,I think I'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
Bree,I'd like to admit myself for psychiatric observation.I'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
Bree,"Hello. I'm Bree Van de Kamp, your new neighbor.Is this your frog?"
Bree,"Well, it seems that my son stole it from your yard."
Bree,"Well, don't tell him that.If he doesn't feel guilty he'll never learn shame."
Bree,Please don't make excuses for him.That is exactly what his father does. Rex!
Bree,This is my husband Rex.
Bree,And this is my son--the criminal. Go on.
Bree,"Well, is there anything you'd like to say to my son?"
Bree,"Well, now that we've finished with all this unpleasantness, I want to assure you that we are going to be good neighbors, and I hope in time, great friends."
Bree,Come on.
Bree,What?
Bree,Do I know you?
Bree,Oh. I'm so sorry.I didn't recognize you.
Bree,"Yes. uh, excruciatingly so."
Bree,What are you doing here?
Bree,"Oh, I just thought it would be a lovely place to take a nice, long rest."
Bree,"Um, listen, I told my friends that I was, um, I was at a spa, so if you run into Susan,I--"
Bree,And seriously-- I am not like these other people.
Bree,"Well, that was-- very sweet."
Bree,"You, too?"
Bree,"You know that, um, that woman in the wheelchair?What's her story?"
Bree,Why would you assume that?
Bree,"Is that what you're doing, asking me all those ridiculous questions about my childhood, trying to get to know me? Well, here's a clue. I'm not crazy.I just have a few issues."
Bree,"Honestly, I was hoping that you'd medicate the hell out of me."
Bree,I have aspirin at home that packs more of a punch.
Bree,"Oh, they're fine.Andrew is backpacking through Europe, and Danielle is away at cheerleading camp."
Bree,What do you mean?
Bree,"You know, I really don't have time for this nonsense.Are you going to give me some serious drugs or not?"
Bree,Fine. Then I'm going back to my room.
Bree,And how are you going to do that?
Bree,I committed myself voluntarily.
Bree,"I don't need that much help, because I am not like your other patients."
Bree,"Um, but we could come back later."
Bree,"Um, we, uh, just came over to introduce ourselves, but we can, um, do that at another time."
Bree,Hello?
Bree,You let go of me right now!
Bree,"I am trying to leave, and these morons won't let me.Do you know that you can be arrested for kidnapping,for detaining someone?!"
Bree,Because my daughter is in danger.
Bree,"Okay, there's no camp. That was a fib on my part.I found out that she ran away with a boy and the boy is a murderer."
Bree,I can tell by your tone that you don't believe me.
Bree,"I don't have time for therapy, you quack!Now let me out of here!Let go of me!You idiot. Let go of me!"
Bree,"If anything happens to my daughter, so help me, god--"
Bree,Have they rung up your prescription yet?
Bree,"Good, add that on."
Bree,"Oh, it's not for me, it's for Danielle. That hair is going back to the color god intended."
Bree,"Oh, I will tie her down if necessary.I'm also thinking of checking her body for piercings while I'm at it."
Bree,"They also get pregnant and become drug addicts, and that color hair is the gateway.Would you please, uh, add that to our bill?"
Bree,"I am trying to ensure that they turn into responsible adults.Trust me, Rex, in the end, we will be rewarded."
Bree,"Why is my certainty a flaw? I know what I'm about,I know my values, and I know what's right.Why shouldn't I stay the course? Am I right, Mr. Williams?"
Bree,"Exactly, and look how well you turned out."
Bree,Excuse me.Do you have the time?
Bree,"Oh, I was afraid of that."
Bree,"Well, I'm only supposed to be restrained until 7.You see, I have a problem with sleepwalking.They just tie me up so that I don't wander off and hurt myself."
Bree,"One can only hope.Of course, if a doctor gets here first and sees that someone forgot to release me, I'm sure they'd get in a lot of trouble."
Bree,"Oh, well, I certainly would not want that to happen.What's your name?"
Bree,"Oh! Does anybody ever call you ""Alfie""?"
Bree,"And why should they? So, um, Alfred, I was wondering if you could maybe loosen my restraints. They're incredibly tight, and I'm sure there are no rules against making me more comfortable."
Bree,I beg your pardon?
Bree,"Well, there's nothing like being tied to a bed to change a girl's mind."
Bree,"Anything at all.As you said, I--I have a lot of issues."
Bree,"Saw right through that, did ya?"
Bree,"Well, I'm glad that you're having fun."
Bree,"Things were falling apart at home, and I just--I just needed a place to rest, that's all."
Bree,Do you?
Bree,Probably because I'm ashamed.
Bree,"My children were my life.They were the reason that I got up in the morning, so to have failed them as a parent--"
Bree,"Well, my son is a sociopath, and my daughter hates me enough to have run away from home. I'm certainly not gonna get ""mother of the year"" anytime soon."
Bree,"I would beg my son Andrew for forgiveness for having given up on him, and I would tell my daughter not to worry, that I have a plan to protect her."
Bree,"Danielle, I don't know what you're planning, but I need to talk to you right now."
Bree,I'm calling the police.
Bree,Do you remember that girl Melanie Foster?Matthew is the one who killed her.
Bree,His mother told me what happened. It's true.
Bree,"No.I gave up on your brother, and I'm not gonna make that mistake with you."
Bree,Danielle--I want you to get out of the house now.He's a killer.
Bree,"Danielle!I'm serious, go."
Bree,If that's what it takes-- to get my daughter--
Bree,--to see who you really are--
Bree,#NAME?
Bree,Do it.
Bree,"It's okay, baby."
Bree,Orson.
Bree,How sweet and-- unexpected.Do you wanna come in?
Bree,Do I know you?
Bree,That Rosotto was perfect.
Bree,Oh.
Bree,That is so adorable but I don't think I can eat another bite.
Bree,"Ah.This is a little sudden, isn't it?"
Bree,"No, no, um, I do.It just that I, um, can't help being cautious, since Rex I haven't been exactly lucky in love."
Bree,Yes.
Bree,"Yes, I will marry you, Orson."
Bree,"Hi, hi, hi, hi.I'm so sorry I'm late."
Bree,"Well, it's a very elegant club.You know Orson's been a member here for years. It will be even nicer when they finish the construction."
Bree,"Well, um, I wanted to invite you to a dinner that Orson and I are having this Saturday."
Bree,I'm not being coy.
Bree,"Oh, all right.I wanted to wait and make a proper announcement, but--"
Bree,Orson and I are engaged.
Bree,"I know it's quick but it's just feel so right.Orson is just the most warm, wonderful, generous man."
Bree,"Actually, no, we haven't had sex yet.We're waiting until we get married."
Bree,"Whatever you're alluding to, no."
Bree,"True, I have in the past, given myself away too freely.How charming of you to bring that up while I'm announcing my engagement.But I'd like to think that I've learned from my mistakes.So the dinner is at 8:00 and when we make the announcement, please, everyone look surprised."
Bree,"Wow, we certainly devoured that ice cream.Can I get you anything else?"
Bree,Hummm.Orson.
Bree,Ummm.Ummm.I thought we--Orson?
Bree,Does that change our core values?
Bree,"Well, I thought we agreed we wanted our wedding night to be perfect."
Bree,Hum.It will be better this way.Now can I get you some more ice cream?
Bree,"Okay, so we will see you Saturday and please pretend to be surprised.Bye."
Bree,"I just can't help it.I like telling people.Makes me feel, I don't know.Makes me feel like I'm starting over.Feels good."
Bree,You don't have to wash those.I already did them.
Bree,I've never heard that.
Bree,"Ahh, excuse me."
Bree,Did you lose something?
Bree,Oh!Um.I don't do that.
Bree,I'm a Republican!
Bree,But Orson!
Bree,Okay.
Bree,"Ah.Oh, no!"
Bree,I have to go.
Bree,"And then it was like something inside ruptured.Well, not so much a rupture as a spasm.Waves of this hot, clutching.I think I might have had a small stroke!"
Bree,"Well, that's the odd thing.I mean there was no pain, per se, in fact, it wasn't entirely unpleasant."
Bree,"I was, ah, with my fiance.We were lying down, resting."
Bree,Sort of.
Bree,"No, no, no.I've had orgasms before."
Bree,"Oh you know, that warm sensation, that tingling feeling of relief when it's over.No, no, this was much--"
Bree,Yes.
Bree,"Oh.Well, I'll be darn."
Bree,"Hi, can I help you?"
Bree,"Yes, and you are?"
Bree,"Oh well, come on in.Let's dry you off and get you a drink."
Bree,"Orson, what is she talking about?"
Bree,Please leave my house.
Bree,Your wife disappeared?
Bree,So are you still married?
Bree,"No, of course not.I love you."
Bree,"Orson, my hand."
Bree,The buffet is open.
Bree,So what do you think?
Bree,"Yeah, don't you think it will be gorgeous with my coloring?"
Bree,I mean I was lucky to find these. It's not easy putting a wedding together in two weeks.
Bree,"Well, Orson and I talked about it and we just feel at our age, it's silly to wait. And with your help, I'm sure we can get it all done."
Bree,"Oh, that reminds me. And don't worry Susan, I will think of a job for you."
Bree,And what mistake would that be?
Bree,"Orson, I moved the furniture back!"
Bree,Don't you want our first dance to be perfect?
Bree,There'll be two hundred people staring at us.
Bree,"Well, I don't pay attention to gossip."
Bree,"Well, no one who knows you could seriously believe that you could hurt a woman. Strangers may talk, but I know the truth."
Bree,"Men have lied to me before. Believe me, it'ill never happen again."
Bree,"Clearly, I do."
Bree,"That was close. The florist put three mums in my bridal bouquet. But not to worry, crisis averted."
Bree,He did not hack her up and dissolve the pieces in acid.
Bree,I don't have time for this. I'm getting married now.
Bree,I can't talk to Orson. It's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding!
Bree,"If the three of you don't drop this right now, I will never forgive you."
Bree,None whatsoever.
Bree,"Excuse me, could you give us just a second?"
Bree,I just need a moment.
Bree,"Before we do this, there's something I need to ask you."
Bree,Did you kill your wife? Susan talked to that Carolyn woman. Why didn't you tell me that the police searched your house?
Bree,Is that because you scrubbed the house so thoroughly?
Bree,Okay.
Bree,"Orson, you look so serious."
Bree,"You're upset, aren't you? You're still thinking about what I said at the church."
Bree,"I'm sorry, but I had to ask."
Bree,How do you know him?
Bree,Mm-mm.
Bree,Could you excuse me for a just a minute.
Bree,It's Hodge now.
Bree,We know what you think. Now would you please leave us alone?
Bree,He's kind and decent and nothing you could say will ever make me doubt him again. Now please go.
Bree,I hope to.
Bree,I'm fine. Let's just go back to our guests and forget any of this ever happened.
Bree,"Yes, Mr. Hodge."
Bree,"I don't need to be any happier than I am at this very second. Oh, my goodness, there's only fifteen minutes before our plane.If you want that Latte you should go now."
Bree,Oh my god.
Bree,A reporter just did a story on homeless teens and my son was one of them.
Bree,"Orson, you can't imagine that we are still going!"
Bree,My son is eating out of dumpsters!
Bree,"Orson! My child is in trouble.Don't make me choose between the two of you because believe me you will lose! Now please, get your ass in gear!"
Bree,So you can't tell me anything about my son's whereabouts?
Bree,Fine!
Bree,"Some reporter.All she could tell me is what neighborhood they found him in.They don't have any contact information, no phone number, no address."
Bree,You know you could show a little compassion.Your brother is out there on the streets struggling to survive!
Bree,"Ah, she's right.This is all my fault."
Bree,He didn't run away.I kicked him out.
Bree,I left him on the roadside with some money and his clothes.I didn't tell you because I was afraid of what you would think of me.
Bree,"There won't be, not anymore."
Bree,We'll talk in the car.
Bree,"Excuse me, ma'am? I mean-- Miss. I'm looking for someone. Uh, his name is Andrew. Have you seen him?"
Bree,"Yes, very, and I'm worried sick about him."
Bree,"Oh, thank you, Miss--"
Bree,How very saucy.
Bree,"Uh, excuse me. I'm looking for my son. Have you seen him? Have you seen him?"
Bree,"Excuse me, young man. Have you seen this boy?Andrew! Oh, my God, thank God!"
Bree,Looking for you. How did you get that bruise?
Bree,"Andrew, please!"
Bree,How did you find out that?
Bree,"Andrew, you have every right to be angry with me, but if you knew how sorry I am--"
Bree,"Andrew, please, can't we just talk about this? I'm your mother, for God sakes! You're my son."
Bree,"Andrew. Andrew! Andrew, please! Andrew!"
Bree,Thank you.
Bree,"Yeah, it's nice to know that I can raise some things correctly."
Bree,"No, I don't think he will. I failed him."
Bree,"And you're not being hard enough. Stop saying that what I did was understandable, I'm a mother who abandoned her child.That's-- unnatural."
Bree,"Because there is a bottle of Chardonnay in the refrigerator, and right now, this little chore is the only thing that's keeping me from going inside and drinking the whole damn thing."
Bree,"Yes, they are, aren't they?"
Bree,"A reporter just did a story on homeless teens, my son is one of them."
Bree,"Oh, I'm not talking about a lie--just a polite fiction to explain to everybody where you've been. I mean, we can't possibly tell them that you've been living on Skid Row, sleeping in a cardboard box."
Bree,"This is a family event, and we're all gonna enjoy it together. Now, Danielle, stop sniping and start thinking of an alibi for your brother."
Bree,"Well, that would certainly spare the family some embarrassment. Why not throw in a killing spree, too?"
Bree,We'll need a name for this drama camp.
Bree,Mr. Faladi.
Bree,I cannot thank you enough for getting Danielle interested in history. She has never worked so hard on a project before.
Bree,Drama camp. A very prestigious drama camp.
Bree,What were you and Andrew talking about today at the fair?
Bree,"Orson, I saw the two of you whispering right after Dr. Keck ran off. What happened?"
Bree,"Well, of course not. What is it?"
Bree,"Oh, good. I mean, I'd hate to think he had no work ethic at all."
Bree,Yard work?
Bree,"Orson, you're scaring me. Did he do something awful?"
Bree,I'll never forgive myself. It's all my fault for pushing him away.
Bree,"How does this Dr. Keck fit into all of this? I mean, is he treating Andrew for some awful disease?"
Bree,"Howard Keck? Oh, that's ridiculous. He's got a wife and a daughter. He plays on Tom Scavo's bowling team."
Bree,"This is a nightmare, an absolute nightmare."
Bree,Please don't cut into that pie. I made it for Mike.
Bree,Yes. I left you two messages. Didn't you check your voice mail? He woke up from his coma.
Bree,"I'm not telling who it is. I'm just asking the question. If you know a husband has been unfaithful, do you tell the wife?"
Bree,"Okay, that's what I was thinking."
Bree,She told me she got it from wearing someone else's bathing suit.
Bree,"Be that as it may, do we all agree that I should tell this man's wife?"
Bree,"Gaby, are you and Carlos getting back together?"
Bree,"Hello, Vera. I made you some of those, uh, shortbread biscuits that you like so much."
Bree,"Yes. Yes, we do."
Bree,"I know how painful this must be for you. It isn't easy for me either, considering Andrew's role in it."
Bree,Because I thought you'd want to know.
Bree,So you could do something.
Bree,"I'm sorry. I just felt that if it were me, I��_��_��_"
Bree,"Yes, absolutely."
Bree,Oh?
Bree,What is?
Bree,"Danielle! Danielle, he is your history teacher, and he is 35 years old!"
Bree,Don't you dare leave this house!
Bree,I am so tired of feeling like the worst mother who ever lived.
Bree,I just--I've tried so hard to set a good example. I've done the best I could to teach you kids right from wrong. Why isn't it taking?
Bree,Why?
Bree,You're awful.
Bree,"You know, we never discussed what it was like for you while you were-- away. I just want you to know, if you ever wanna talk about it, there's nothing you can't tell me."
Bree,Does she know you killed your wife?
Bree,Mr. Faladi--
Bree,"Good afternoon. I'm, uh, Bree Hodge, and you are?"
Bree,"Actually, Gus, um, I'm here to see one of your guests-- a gentleman named Faladi."
Bree,"No, no, no, no. I'd like you to take me to his room and unlock it so I can walk in unannounced."
Bree,"Yes, I know. She's my daughter. My 17-year-old daughter."
Bree,"Oh, Gus, I don't plan anything unpleasant. I'm simply going to inform Mr. Faladi what repercussions he faces if he continues this relationship and trust him to see reason."
Bree,"Oh, and, Gus, the carpet is beautiful."
Bree,"Thank you, dear. Danielle, you haven't touched your dinner."
Bree,"Well, that hardly bolsters his suitability. Danielle, please, eat something."
Bree,When you start acting like an adult.
Bree,Remind me to buy paper plates. We'll need them till a certain someone can be trusted with china again.
Bree,The oddest thing happened at the club today. Tish Atherton--
Bree,"Andrew, would you be a dear and make sure your sister's just breaking her own things? Anyway--hmm. Tish Atherton--"
Bree,"I'm telling you, it was a deliberate snub. I waved to her, and she looked right through me. True, I never bought her eldest daughter a gift--"
Bree,"Andrew, please don't interrupt me while I'm speaking.True, I never bought her eldest daughter a gift, but you know my policy: no husband, no baby gift. Now what is it, dear?"
Bree,How can you sit there playing that ridiculous game?!Your sister tried to kill herself.That doesn't upset you?
Bree,Is my daughter all right?
Bree,Of course. We'll get her all the help she needs.
Bree,Andrew!
Bree,Pump her.
Bree,They're sticking a tube down her throat. Do you still think this is funny?
Bree,"This was a cry for help, and if we don't listen, the next time she could do something even more dangerous."
Bree,"Orson's right. We need to support each other as a family. In fact, I say we all go for counseling."
Bree,I didn't call you that.
Bree,I have never in my life used the word retard.
Bree,Andrew! Not in front of the therapist.
Bree,"Danielle, how can you think I don't care about your feelings?"
Bree,"When I saw you in that tub, it was the worst moment of my life.The thought of losing you is more than I can bear."
Bree,Powerful?
Bree,Of course not. I already went through thinking I'd lost Andrew. I can't go through that again.
Bree,Danielle.
Bree,So--what do we owe you for all this progress?
Bree,Hello.
Bree,"Oh, Mr. Faladi, I'm not here to threaten you. I've come to give you my blessing."
Bree,"Yes, Danielle made it quite clear that I'm powerless to stop this relationship, and since she assures me that you love her. You do love her, don't you?"
Bree,Good.Then we're all set.Here are some of her clothes.I'll bring her CDs and her stuffed animals over tomorrow.
Bree,"Well, that hotel room was small, and you seemed happy enough there. Oh, and I trust you to be discreet. You wouldn't want your wife find out about this and use it against you in your divorce."
Bree,"Mr. Faladi, if you want to break my daughter's heart, I can't stop you, but I will not be an accomplice. You'll tell her yourself."
Bree,"And don't even think about blaming me,'cause if you so much as mention that we spoke,I'll phone the police."
Bree,"Oh, and one more thing--"
Bree,Danielle is applying to colleges. I do hope she can count on you for a glowing recommendation.
Bree,"Oh, Danielle, I thought you'd be with Mr. Faladi tonight."
Bree,He dumped you?
Bree,"I don't plan to. Well, I hope this doesn't make history class too awkward."
Bree,Yes. I wonder where she gets it.
Bree,Carolyn. This isn't a very good time. I'm baking.
Bree,It's a souffl��_��_. And timing is everything.
Bree,"Well, Orson tells me that the two of you were very close, and out of respect for that friendship, I'm all ears."
Bree,"Well, I can appreciate how difficult that must have been for you. Apology accepted."
Bree,That sounds lovely.
Bree,"Well, thank you, darling. But if you think for one second that I'm gonna break bread with that malicious, pill-popping shrew, you're out of your mind."
Bree,Two lemonades for the victors.
Bree,"Hello, Tish."
Bree,Did you see that? She just deliberately snubbed me.
Bree,"Rebecca, I just spoke to her. And call me paranoid, but Amy Griswold did the same thing to me on the golf course last week. What is going on?"
Bree,No! I have no idea. What?
Bree,Carolyn knows Tish?
Bree,"That is ridiculous.Orson did not kill alma.And besides,Carolyn just apologized to me for that yesterday."
Bree,"Oh, you don't believe any of that nonsense, do you? Do you?"
Bree,"Hello.I'd like to make a reservation for this evening under the names Hodge and Bigsby, and, um, we'll be needing a table in the center of the room."
Bree,"Oh, they are a regular barrel of--Tish!"
Bree,"Oh! Do you two know each other? Well, that saves me an introduction.Uh, Tish, you know, I was wondering if you need any help with the Christmas gala. Last year, I was on the decorating committee--"
Bree,That would be lovely. Thanks.
Bree,Nice to be seen.
Bree,"Oh, I'd love to."
Bree,I'm so happy we did this.
Bree,No. Why?
Bree,What is all this?
Bree,This is not possible.
Bree,Is this why you apologized?
Bree,"Well, somebody just bought her old house. Maybe that triggered something."
Bree,"Hey, is that the new neighbor?"
Bree,Edie said he's a bachelor--
Bree,#NAME?
Bree,Should we go introduce ourselves?
Bree,"Then again, he probably wants some time to unpack."
Bree,"Orson? If you have a moment, there's something I'd like your thoughts on."
Bree,"No, it's the police report from the night you beat your first wife. I'm still working on the menu."
Bree,"Oh, how did she fall?"
Bree,Why would she attack you?
Bree,Carolyn.
Bree,Harvey cheated?
Bree,"All right, I accept your explanation. I just wish there were fewer things for you to explain. By the way, to remove a red wine stain, you sprinkle salt to absorb it."
Bree,"Sorry, no. Turns out he has an explanation for the police report."
Bree,"I used to think that, too. Then I met you. Good day."
Bree,"Well, I guess that makes us neighbors."
Bree,It means you should stop worrying about my marriage and start worrying about your own.
Bree,Okay. Does the name Monique mean anything to you?
Bree,"Coffee's almost ready, and if you'd prefer to watch the coverage on channel 9, it's on in the den. Orson, Greta needs a coaster."
Bree,"Oh, it's just awful. Deviled egg?"
Bree,"Andrew, honey, would you please get the phone?"
Bree,"Uh, yes, um--I just-- ran into her this morning."
Bree,Is she all right?
Bree,"I'm fine. I just, I'm running out of food, and it's not as if I can go to the grocery store."
Bree,"Thank God I found this stale baguette so I can make Bruschetta, and there's shrimp in the freezer, so I'm gonna make my rice and seafood dish."
Bree,"I had to tell her. She hurt me, so I hurt her back. If anything should happen to Julie or Lynette--"
Bree,You can peel a clove of garlic.
Bree,"I'm sure she'll be back soon. Why don't we, uh, go have some cookies?"
Bree,I'm sure she won't mind. Come on. Let's go. Come on.
Bree,This is so sudden.
Bree,I'm starting my cards early this year. It puts me in the mood to spread holiday cheer.
Bree,"Andrew, it's etiquette. Nobody wants to read the truth at Christmas."
Bree,"Honey, would you put on another CD? Something with sleigh bells."
Bree,"Oh, by the way, Orson, I need your mother's address at the nursing home."
Bree,"Oh,don't be silly.I'm sending one to the man who reads our gas meter.I can certainly send one to your mother."
Bree,"Well, all the more reason to send her one. Let the nurses know that she has family at home who loves her--and who could drop by at any minute and slap them with a lawsuit."
Bree,"Orson, what's the big deal? It's just an address."
Bree,"Lakeview? Oh, you gave me the impression that she was back east."
Bree,"But if she's only thirty minutes away, why haven't you been visiting her?"
Bree,"But, Orson--"
Bree,Hi.
Bree,"Thank you. Well, hello there! How pretty you look today! It's wonderful that you're up and about! You must be enjoying these colorful balloons!"
Bree,"Oh, I'm--I'm so sorry. The nurse pointed me over here. I'm looking for Gloria Hodge."
Bree,"Well, I must say, I'm surprised at how lucid you are. Orson led me to believe--"
Bree,"Well, how can he feel that way? You're his mother."
Bree,"Well, how does he disappoint you?"
Bree,And--
Bree,And how do you disappoint him?
Bree,"Yes, I see. Well, surely this rift isn't irreparable."
Bree,"Well, I have a better idea. Why don't you tell him yourself?"
Bree,And I can't believe you told me that she was senile! You lied to me.
Bree,"Now you listen to me. That woman gave you life, and the Fifth Commandment tells us to honor our parents no matter how hideous or repellent they may be."
Bree,"Orson, it's implied! Now get out there and show her some respect!"
Bree,"Well, thank you! It did win me the blue ribbon at the gourmet county cook-off."
Bree,You'd never ask a magician how a trick is done.
Bree,"Orson, why does she have to have an ulterior motive?"
Bree,Okay! Maybe I will share my secret ingredient.
Bree,"Paprika! There, it's out!"
Bree,"Please, stay for dessert. I'll work on Orson, and we'll discuss this together."
Bree,"Well, then talk to me. I know you're upset, but don't shut me out. Please. Please, Gloria, let me in."
Bree,"Well, I didn't mean it literally, but okay. We'll, um, we'll sit together. And we'll talk."
Bree,What are you doing?
Bree,"Gloria, stop!"
Bree,Just for a few weeks till we find a place where she'll be happier. You should've heard her in the car. She's absolutely miserable in that nursing home.
Bree,How can you be so cold?
Bree,Why? What could she possibly have done to make you hate her so much?
Bree,"Orson, if there's something I should know."
Bree,Of course.
Bree,"Mother Hodge, your food will get cold!"
Bree,Because your doctor says people taking your medication shouldn't drink. A warning you've chosen to ignore if the--lipstick on the vodka bottle is any indication.
Bree,"Well, your doctor has you on a low fat, low sodium diet. Eight meals this week, eight times I've told you the same thing. So, who would like to say grace?"
Bree,I have done everything I can to make you happy and comfortable. What do you want from us?
Bree,"What did she mean by, you can't afford not to? Was she threatening you with something?"
Bree,"Yeah, and she'll take terrible care of herself and be dead in a year."
Bree,"Oh, look, a highly motivated cockroach."
Bree,"Right, from here I can see a bail bondsman and an adult bookshop."
Bree,Thank you.
Bree,You cannot let your mother move into this neighborhood. It's filled with junkies and who*es.
Bree,Of course she likes it. There's a 24-hour liquor store across the street.
Bree,"Orson, what if something should happen to her?"
Bree,Are you all right?
Bree,Is anything broken?
Bree,Are you insane? She obviously can't be on her own.
Bree,And what if you weren't? What if she had broken something and she was lying here for hours? You are coming home with us.
Bree,And I will not hear another word on the subject.
Bree,"It's just not right. Your mother skipped lunch, too."
Bree,"I know she's a handful, but she deserves some compassion. The woman watched a dream die yesterday. I'm taking her dinner up."
Bree,"Oh, no, I'd rather do it myself. I wanna talk to her."
Bree,"Gloria, I've been thinking and--"
Bree,Is that alcohol? Where did you get that?
Bree,Andrew!
Bree,I'll deal with you later.
Bree,Andrew brought her wine.
Bree,"Okay, look, I know you're upset, but don't blame Orson. It's not his fault."
Bree,What?
Bree,Monique Polier? I thought that was Harvey Bigsby's mistress.
Bree,We saw that woman at the morgue--on our wedding night. You pretended not to know her.
Bree,No. I'm done.
Bree,"There were two women in your life before me. One vanished, and the other was killed. That's all I need to understand. I've packed some of your things. I want you out of the house. Now."
Bree,I know--but it scares the hell out of me.
Bree,Monique Polier?
Bree,"Mother Hodge, I have your breakfast."""
Bree,What are you watching?
Bree,"It's fun looking back at the past, isn't it?"
Bree,We also have cable.
Bree,Decided?
Bree,I don't think that's any of your concern.
Bree,"Well, I will take that under advisement."
Bree,It's not that easy. I love him.
Bree,And yet you're cooking?
Bree,"Oh, no, no, these things practically build themselves."
Bree,Actually--I could probably use the distraction.
Bree,I asked Orson to move out last night.
Bree,I can't. Not yet. I need some time to think.
Bree,"I know it sounds suspicious, but in my heart of hearts, I just can't believe that Orson could do such a thing."
Bree,What in the world?
Bree,"Oh, thank God!"
Bree,"Orson, it's me again. Please call. We need to talk."""
Bree,"Oh, me, too. There's nothing more relaxing than an afternoon of finger food and girl talk."
Bree,"What?! No, I did not, and I don't plan to."
Bree,I said I had concerns. Concerns that have disappeared now that Mike has been arrested.
Bree,"They found Monique's blood on the wrench that Mike was trying to dispose of. I mean, that hardly screams innocence."
Bree,"We all have convictions, Susan. I believe Mike's last one was for manslaughter."
Bree,At his office. And what did you think you'd find there anyway?
Bree,"Well, needless to say, I won't be cooking dinner for Ian's parents."
Bree,Good. Let me know if there are any survivors.
Bree,"Well, that was incredibly awkward. I'm sorry you both had to sit through it. Was it me? Was I out of line?"
Bree,You're right--
Bree,Orson?
Bree,Orson. Why haven't you returned any of my calls?
Bree,"No, I wasn't. They arrested Mike for the murder of Monique Polier."
Bree,"The other night, you wanted a chance to explain everything. Well, here it is, and I want it all. If I find out you've left anything out, then I will ask for that divorce."
Bree,You had a child?
Bree,"Well, you could've left her."
Bree,So why couldn't you tell me this?
Bree,So you stayed in a loveless marriage because of your mother?
Bree,"Well, first you pack up your things and come home, and then we toss your mother out on her evil ass."
Bree,I am no longer interested in your opinion. I thought I made that clear.
Bree,"Oh, we've rented you a condo in a lovely retirement community. It's our Christmas gift to you."
Bree,That's our gift to them.
Bree,I just can't believe that Orson could do such a thing.
Bree,"Oh, thank god!"
Bree,So you're Alma. Where have you been all this time?
Bree,"Well, you should've told someone. People thought you were dead. Some even thought that Orson killed you."
Bree,So you deliberately framed Orson?
Bree,"Yes, I know--with Monique Polier."
Bree,So why have you come back?
Bree,"Um, actually,we have a guest."
Bree,Sour cream.
Bree,Why don't I wrap up a piece of this pound cake for you to enjoy later?
Bree,Thank you for clearing things up.
Bree,"Actually,there is. I'd love it if you could join us for dinner this weekend. There are some friends that I'm just dying for you to meet."
Bree,Susan. Hi. It's Bree.
Bree,"I just feel really awful about our fight, and I-I think it's time for an apology."
Bree,Would you join Orson and me for dinner tomorrow night?
Bree,Good. I'll see you at eight o'clock.
Bree,"Oh, Susan, you know, I feel exactly--"
Bree,"I'm so sorry to keep you waiting, but I don't want to introduce you until all my guests are here."
Bree,"By the way, when my friends ask you what happened--and they will--I don't think it's necessary to go into all that unpleasantness about Orson and Monique. All they need to know is that you're back and we're on good terms."
Bree,And Orson didn't kill you.
Bree,"Oh, okay, just one minute. That'll be Susan."
Bree,"Oh, you didn't have to do that."
Bree,"Well, when you're wrong, you're wrong."
Bree,"Now that we're all assembled, I'd like to introduce the guest of honor. I hope you'll all be as delighted to meet her as I was. You can come in now."
Bree,"Everyone, this is Alma Hodge, Orson's first wife."
Bree,"Oh, about that apology--any time you're ready."
Bree,"Amazing, isn't it, where some people's minds will go?"
Bree,Detective Ridley. Can I help you?
Bree,"Oh, well, I'm afraid he's not here, but I will be happy to tell him that you came by."
Bree,Can't this wait? We're having a dinner party.
Bree,Susan?
Bree,I don't believe this. You called the police?
Bree,I told you that in confidence.
Bree,"Right, just like you knew she was dead."
Bree,"Boy, when it comes to Mike there's no one you won't betray."
Bree,Please leave my house.
Bree,You heard me. Get out!
Bree,"Oh, make no mistake, our friendship is over."
Bree,"Alma! I-I didn't know that, uh, you knew Edie."
Bree,A house?
Bree,"Oh. Well, um--I don't want to keep you. I'm sure that Edie has lots of other houses to show you."
Bree,What?
Bree,"No! I mean--I mean, no, Alma, you can't buy this house."
Bree,"Well, are you aware of its history? The previous owner was harboring a murderer."
Bree,"They had a dungeon in the basement.I mean, people say they still hear groans coming from the house at night."
Bree,"Don't worry, Alma, I'm sure that, uh, Edie can find you a house that won't give you nightmares."
Bree,Don't I wish.
Bree,I will not have that woman as a neighbor. You have got to do something.
Bree,So what are you waiting for?
Bree,"Oh, so you're just gonna wait until she moves in?"
Bree,"How can I be calm?! For months, people thought you killed your first wife. No sooner does she show up and clear your name, than the police haul you off to ask you about another murder!"
Bree,Everybody has questions. Susan and I aren't even speaking because of it.
Bree,"I try to hold my head up and smile and just bake more pies for the church social. But now your ex is camped out on our doorstep like I am hosting some kind of Mormon slumber party, and I do not know how I am gonna bake my way out of this one!"
Bree,"Oh, you're a good husband."
Bree,Why not? And what the hell was that on the porch?!
Bree,"You went over there to read her the riot act. Instead, it looked like you were reading her a bedtime story."
Bree,This isn't a social call. We need to talk.
Bree,About what it's gonna take to get you to sell this house and move.
Bree,You're my husband's ex-wife. You disappeared so people would think he killed you.Does my discomfort really need any further explanation?
Bree,"Oh, please. Orson made it perfectly clear we don't want you here."
Bree,That's not true.
Bree,I'm so sorry. I br--broke a glass.
Bree,"Well, okay-- I have to go."
Bree,"Uh, yes, I need to speak to my husband. Yes, there is. Could you please ask him to come home as early as possible tonight? Thank you."
Bree,Fishy? It couldn't be more obvious. Alma killed Monique. That's why she disappeared. And I bet she pulled the teeth so people would suspect her dentist husband.
Bree,Who knows? She's probably gonna sneak in and plant them in our house.
Bree,Orson! Not on the duvet!
Bree,I don't care!I am not sleeping in a bed that had your dead mistress' teeth in it!Let's just take them to the police.
Bree,"Well, we have to do something."
Bree,What's a garden without a snake?
Bree,Thanks for the heads-up. Now off you go.
Bree,I wouldn't worry about Orson's soul. He won't be sleeping with Alma.
Bree,Excuse me?
Bree,Are those shoes suede?
Bree,No reason.
Bree,Hi. Sorry. My book club ran late. Didn't Orson make you dinner?
Bree,What the hell is this?!
Bree,"Not as sorry as you are gonna be! Orson, get up!"
Bree,"Orson, I have caught you cheating. At least have the courtesy to wake up! Oh, for God sakes. Orson! Orson? What have you done to him?!"
Bree,He's not sleeping. He's out cold.
Bree,"Oh, I knew it. These are sleeping pills, and these are--oh, my God. You raped my husband!"
Bree,Baby?!
Bree,Were you expecting this?
Bree,"Andrew, I need you to come over here right away--and, um--bring the wheelbarrow."
Bree,We have to do something.
Bree,You raped my husband.
Bree,"I'm sorry, but you've been out cold for ten hours, and we need to talk."
Bree,"Oh, dear. I'm not sure how to tell you this, but--after Alma knocked you out, she assaulted you."
Bree,Sexually. She had sex with you.
Bree,Your drink was laced with pills for--erectile dysfunction.
Bree,"No, dear, you were dead to the waist."
Bree,"Okay, this is no joke. She raped you, and your mother helped. Look, after we get dressed, we're going to the police."
Bree,"Orson, I know you're embarrassed, but what they did to you was a crime."
Bree,"Orson, your ex-wife is a homicidal rapist, and your mother is straight out of ""I, Claudius."" Why do you refuse to deal with them?"
Bree,"Please don't touch me.All this time,you've said you wanted the truth.That's before I knew what it was."
Bree,"Yeah, but you weren't just trying to protect me, were you?"
Bree,Exonerate Mike. How could you stand by and let an innocent man be dragged off to prison?
Bree,"And this, after he'd been in a coma because some lunatic ran him over."
Bree,"I don't care if you go to jail. You have done a horrible thing, and you have to make it right. I mean it, Orson. If you don't fix this, I will."
Bree,"No, you're not."
Bree,"Oh, thank god."
Bree,"Make no mistake,Our friendship is over."
Bree,"She raped you,and your mother helped."
Bree,Aah!
Bree,"Andrew, you're here. What happened to me?"
Bree,"Oh, that's right. Is Orson here?"
Bree,Suicide? No.Orson would never try to kill himself.The police are wrong.It must have been an accident.
Bree,But why?
Bree,For what?
Bree,And you think--
Bree,And you say he's just down the hall?
Bree,Susan.
Bree,"No, no. Come in."
Bree,"Susan, stop. Mike is innocent. He had nothing to do with Monique Polier's murder."
Bree,"Yes, and I intend to go to the police."
Bree,I can't tell you right now. You're just gonna have to trust me. Can you do that?
Bree,So we're back to being friends?
Bree,Gloria? What are you doing here?
Bree,I'm so sleepy.
Bree,Andrew? Danielle?
Bree,Your mother--she tried to kill me.
Bree,Alma?
Bree,What?
Bree,"I'd love that. What about your mother? After all the things she's done, she's just gonna get off scot-free?"
Bree,"Hello, ladies."
Bree,"Oh, I didn't."
Bree,"And miss Gaby's wedding? No, I'll be fine."
Bree,Yes.
Bree,"Oh, darling, I don't deserve you."
Bree,I'm so sorry to be putting you through this. I-I wouldn't blame you if you ran like hell and never looked back.
Bree,"I have missed you, sweetheart!"
Bree,"Well, hello there, Julie."
Bree,"Wow, somebody's--blonder."
Bree,"Well, um, while we were in Switzerland, she ran across this boarding school, and she fell in love with it and just insisted that we let her spend a year abroad."
Bree,"Well, I am gonna call her tonight and have a little talk with her about common courtesy, and I'm sure that you will get an e-mail first thing tomorrow morning. Well, we should go. I've got to get that bracelet to Gaby before the wedding."
Bree,This might not be as easy as we'd hoped.
Bree,There. Now you have something new.
Bree,"So we're in Zurich, and I was sick after breakfast for the third morning in a row. And I thought to myself, dear god, I hope I have not developed an allergy to chocolate brioche. Life just wouldn't be worth living."
Bree,"Oh, not until the early fall, but enough about me. This is your day--you and Victor--who, by the way, I have not met yet."
Bree,"It is so good to be back. I can't believe how much is happening. I mean, you and Gaby getting married, and I'm having a baby. What's going on with you, Lynette?"
Bree,Did you find him?
Bree,Andrew?
Bree,Do young people still say awesome?
Bree,Off the hook? That doesn't even make sense.
Bree,"Hello? Hodge residence. Oh, hi, Danielle. Listen, I am sending Julie Mayer an e-mail from you. Now would you say that your school was off the hook?"
Bree,"Look, if you're gonna start complaining, I'm going to hang up."
Bree,"Well, perhaps if some of those rules had been in place when you took up with Edie's nephew, you might not be in this little pickle."
Bree,"Look, I am gonna say this one last time. You are gonna stay put until that baby is born. Now don't forget, we're driving up this weekend, and I am bringing your favorite--lemon squares, and--"
Bree,That would be lovely.
Bree,"Oh, don't remind me."
Bree,"Yes,but the good news is she's gonna live."
Bree,"Oh,Andrew,I'm having problems with my strap.Could you help me?"
Bree,"Oh,for heaven's sakes.Orson,could you come help me,please?I'll remember this the next time you want money for leather pants."
Bree,"Well,not if we're careful."
Bree,"Look,this family's reputation is already hanging by a thread.I mean,first people thought that your stepfather was a wife killer,then your sister takes up with her history teacher,and now we're supposed to parade a little bastard up and down the street.We might as well sit on the porch and play banjos."
Bree,"Well,uh,dining chairs.There's a clue."
Bree,"No,I mean they're stickley.It means they have taste."
Bree,Yet another illustration of the fundamental selfishness of suicide.
Bree,That is so kind of you.
Bree,What a beautiful family.I feel so lucky to have you for a neighbor.
Bree,It's my pride and joy.
Bree,Excuse me?
Bree,"Oh,well,I'm--I'm sorry about your vegetables,but that pine shields my view of the Purcells' backyard,and if you had ever seen Mr.Purcell sunbathe,well,you'd know exactly what that tree means to me."
Bree,"The nice thing about this fake pregnancy is my feet don't swell.I mean,I'd never be able to squeeze into these sling-backs if I really was 8-12 months pregnant."
Bree,"Well,hello,Mrs.McKeever."
Bree,There's no need.The baby's just not kicking right now.
Bree,Perhaps I need to make my point a little more clearly.
Bree,"No,not at all!I'm just saying hello to a very dear friend of mine."
Bree,Are you gonna back off now?
Bree,Why must old ladies always do that?
Bree,Surely not over food.
Bree,That was Danielle.Now she wants us to send a DVD player for her room.
Bree,"You're missing the point! It's a convent,not the four seasons.You have mustard on your chin."
Bree,"I mean,it's one thing to forgive bad behavior. It's another thing to reward it.There are consequences for her mistakes."
Bree,"Oh! No,no,I'm fine!I'm fine!"
Bree,"No,no,no!It's just,uh--oh,it's a little barbecue sauce."
Bree,"No,it's nothing!"
Bree,Yes.
Bree,Ohh.
Bree,"Oh,my baby!"
Bree,He's such a scamp.
Bree,We are not throwing in the towel over a minor mishap.
Bree,We're already in too deep.
Bree,And then what would happen to the baby?
Bree,"You think Danielle could raise this child?Orson,you've seen her in action.She's--she's shallow,and she's--she's selfish!She would ruin this child's life!"
Bree,"Because I'm her mother.And I know what I've created,and that's the real humiliation.Orson.This child deserves better.And I know what to do now. Please,please let me try."
Bree,"Well,would that be so horrible?"
Bree,We're your friends. Why would you shut us out?
Bree,Absolutely.
Bree,No more secrets.
Bree,It's my pride and joy.
Bree,"So what did Julie say, exactly?"
Bree,"Well, maybe she blocked it out. Did something bad happen to her when she was young?"
Bree,What about her?
Bree,"Yeah, let's do it. Um, Gaby, why don't you bring your vegetable lasagna? Susan, you do beverages, and, uh, Katherine, why don't you bring a simple green salad?"
Bree,"Oh, no need, dear. I always bring dessert. Oh, I'm thinking my lemon meringue pie."
Bree,"Will not be needed. As I said, I always bring dessert."
Bree,"Do not move. We want to pamper you, so please let us."
Bree,"Well, thank you. I don't think I did anything differently."
Bree,This is not my pie.
Bree,What happened to the pie that I brought?
Bree,"Well, did we or did we not agree that I would bring the dessert?"
Bree,"Well, clearly no tips are needed. As my friends said, ""best pie ever made."""
Bree,"Well, I would be more than happy to go with you."
Bree,I'm not. That despicable woman was just supposed to bring a simple green salad. She not only brought a pie--she hid mine and served hers.
Bree,"Oh, it gets worse. Her pie was better than mine."
Bree,"It's true. Everyone thought so. Even me. Oh, and that simple green salad--mache and baby arugula with duck confit and candied walnuts!"
Bree,"I have been here for hours trying to replicate her recipe, and nothing has even come close!"
Bree,That's hers!
Bree,"Orson, what am I gonna do?"
Bree,What? Surrender? Debase myself?
Bree,She will have stolen my entire identity.
Bree,"No, it's true. The only thing about me that's special is what I can do in the kitchen. You're right. I have got to get that recipe--by any means necessary."
Bree,I hope this isn't a bad time. I just wanted to bring you a housewarming gift. It's the recipe for my special mincemeat pie. It wouldn't be thanksgiving at my house without it.
Bree,"Well, as long as we're swapping pie recipes, I would love the one for your fabulous lemon meringue."
Bree,Excuse me?
Bree,Which is what? Vanilla? Nutmeg? Cardamom?
Bree,"Well, that, um, hardly seems neighborly. After all, I just gave you the recipe for my mincemeat pie."
Bree,That recipe is not from a book. That recipe was handed down to me from my mother.
Bree,"No. No, I am not upset. I'm just confused as to why you seem so determined to get off on the wrong foot. First you bring a pie to Lynette's, when I clearly assigned you the salad--"
Bree,"Well, it's tradition. I always organize our little get-togethers, and I always bring dessert."
Bree,Just--give me the recipe!
Bree,"Well, you've certainly mastered that, dear."
Bree,"I was doing a little baking, and I was wondering if I could borrow something."
Bree,I just let myself into Katherine's house to get that recipe.
Bree,"Yes, and it has nothing to do with pie."
Bree,"Hey, it's our chemo party, and we'll laugh if we want to."
Bree,"Well, I stopped by Katherine's last night just to get a recipe, and you'll never believe what I overheard."
Bree,"Yes, and get this--when Adam said Dylan was just going to keep asking questions, Katherine said-- and I quote--""Well, we're just gonna have to find better lies."" Oh, hang on. I've got another call."
Bree,Another one? It's time for an anonymous letter.
Bree,"Well, I doubt a woman like Katherine is gonna spill her secrets just - because she's had a little win"
Bree,"Well, none that I recall."
Bree,Point well taken. I'll bring the wine.
Bree,Of course! I love your charades parties. And I hope you're inviting that delightful Katherine Mayfair.
Bree,"God,it's getting harder and harder to keep her at arm's length. I never knew she was such a hugger."
Bree,"I'm getting good at props. No,no."
Bree,"Hey, Susan! What's up?"
Bree,I thought you were using Dr. Mayfair.
Bree,But you don't mind Orson being your dentist.
Bree,"You know, my O.B. is all the way across town. You just do not want to drive that far."
Bree,"It does sound fun, but I don't think my doctor's taking on any new patients."
Bree,"I, um--don't remember."
Bree,"No. You know, I usually just call him ""doctor""."
Bree,"Ooh. Here you go, but please don't mention my name. As I said, you know, he's overbooked, and I just don't want to get on his bad side."
Bree,Ah-choo!
Bree,"Oh! Sorry, probably just allergies, but, you know, you don't want to take any chances."
Bree,What is it?
Bree,You're 8 1/2 months pregnant! What in heaven's name were you doing roller-blading?
Bree,"In your condition, that's what you should be doing. And where on earth did you get skates in a convent?"
Bree,"Danielle, what if your reckless behavior had hurt the baby?"
Bree,"Yes, and it is going to stay that way because I have instructed Sister Theresa to keep you sequestered in your room until the baby is born."
Bree,"Well, I was hoping that you could use these last few weeks for reflection and personal growth."
Bree,"Clearly, it would be time well spent."
Bree,She's not here?
Bree,It is?
Bree,We should help Mike with the food.
Bree,"Oh, good! Katherine, I was hoping we'd get a chance to chat. Open this now."
Bree,"Oh, hi, Gaby. Katherine and I were just talking about the old days. So when you were living with your aunt, was Dylan's father with you?"
Bree,"We, we certainly didn't mean to pry. Let me just tinge that up for you."
Bree,Some wine?
Bree,"Edie, is that an engagement ring?"
Bree,"Oh, Susan, I am so sorry, and, of course, I will pay for the slashed tire and the stolen cell phone."
Bree,I can't tell you.
Bree,It's private.
Bree,Itch. Itch.
Bree,Two mules for Sister Sara!
Bree,No talking.
Bree,Good idea.
Bree,Gaby!
Bree,"Orson, honey, where have you been?"
Bree,"Oh, my god."
Bree,I can't wait that long. I have to be with her.
Bree,Something's come up. We'll talk tomorrow.
Bree,"I said I was sorry. For god sakes, Susan, not everything is about you."
Bree,I have to bring this DVD player to Danielle.
Bree,It'll just take a few seconds. These damn cords--
Bree,It's the only thing she asked for.
Bree,"Oh, my god."
Bree,I am so sorry that I snapped at you tonight.
Bree,It's not about you. I've just been going through some things.
Bree,"Okay. Um--I haven't told anybody this, but--it's, uh, about the baby. There have been some complications."
Bree,"Yeah, everything's fine, but, uh, there was just a time where I thought I might lose it."
Bree,"No, you're pregnant, too. I'm not gonna tell you anything that's gonna worry you."
Bree,No. This early?
Bree,"This is what we get for having kids at our age--anxiety, terror."
Bree,Dead?
Bree,Mm.
Bree,It really is.
Bree,Oh!
Bree,That is so kind of you.
Bree,Yes?
Bree,"No, it's for Danielle. There you are. Thank you."
Bree,"I knew it! Phyllis--Rex's mother. Ever since he died, she's been trying to buy children's affection."
Bree,"Well, I'm not giving it to her. Can you think of a worse present for a pregnant girl?"
Bree,You know how I feel about 2-wheeled motorized vehicles. They're too dangerous. We'll donate it to the church.
Bree,Reverend Sikes said they're looking for items for the raffle.
Bree,"Well, it's better than you breaking your neck on it."
Bree,Not without a helmet.
Bree,"Uh, it's a lovely thought, but I really don't want a baby shower."
Bree,"Orson, I said be careful! I just think it's tacky to have a baby shower when it's not your first baby."
Bree,Excuse me?
Bree,I really don't want a shower.
Bree,"Orson, just five more minutes! That's all you're getting! I tell you what. Why don't we just skip the shower, and after the baby's born, I'll have a christening party? What do you say?"
Bree,"Oh, dear god."
Bree,"Oh, that's all right. I've got them, Mr. Knievel."
Bree,Nope.
Bree,It seems to me that you should go to the doctor again.
Bree,"Uh, guys--What did I tell you?"
Bree,Oh! So you're responsible--
Bree,Phyllis!
Bree,I have been awful. I wouldn't blame you if you stormed out right now.
Bree,"Well, I'm, uh, sorry if that offends you, Phyllis, but I didn't want Orson to feel uncomfortable in his new home."
Bree,He wasn't banished.
Bree,"She's, uh, at boarding school--in Switzerland."
Bree,I'm going to mingle.
Bree,"It's a surprise party, you daft woman! What makes you think I had a hand in the guest list?"
Bree,"Oh, for god sakes, Phyllis, it's not as if we got along when Rex was alive."
Bree,You hated your mother.
Bree,Then I'll give it back to you.
Bree,Where is she going?
Bree,And--and you told her?!
Bree,"Yes, and for the sake of her reputation, we've agreed to pretend that it's mine."
Bree,"She's not in Switzerland. She's at the sisters of Hope Convent. Look, Phyllis, I'm sorry. I know this is upsetting."
Bree,"Well, um--technically, yes."
Bree,"We're saying that the baby is mine and Orson's, and if you hover around like a grandmother, people will be suspicious."
Bree,You wouldn't. Think of Danielle!
Bree,You think I don't know I'm a failure as a parent? That's why this child means so much to me. It's my second chance.
Bree,Parenting tips from you? That's rich.
Bree,Then why did he always avoid you? Why were you barely ever here?
Bree,"Oh, he was happy to let you think that, but he was the one who dreaded your visits."
Bree,"Phyllis, wait!"
Bree,Thank you for the gift.
Bree,"Of a the gay men in the world, we have to get the two without taste."
Bree,"Well, it was Mary Alice, but as you may have heard--"
Bree,Why would you say that?
Bree,"Hi. Uh, we were just talking about your sculpture."
Bree,"It's just a little, uh--"
Bree,"Hi. It's, uh, Mrs. Hodge. May I please speak with Danielle?"
Bree,"What do you mean, she's gone? And you believed her? You idiot! I should sue your irresponsible ass off for this. Yeah, well, good day to you, too, reverend mother!"
Bree,"Those stupid nuns at the convent let Danielle's grandmother kidnap her. She claimed I'd given her permission for a weekend visit. Phyllis! It's me. You can screen your calls all you want to, but trust me, old woman, you are in a world of trouble. I know where you live, and I am coming for you."
Bree,"Cram it, Phyllis."
Bree,"Well, good. You can decide to pack, because we are taking you back to the convent."
Bree,What?
Bree,"""Emotionally unavailable."" Gosh, I wonder where she picked up that little phrase."
Bree,"You don't even know what that means, you petulant sock puppet!"
Bree,Buy a dictionary.
Bree,"I'm just so mad at myself. I should have realized that the maternal instinct is so strong, that even Danielle would develop it."
Bree,What's so funny?
Bree,Then why would she want the child?
Bree,Let him talk.
Bree,And a retirement village is fun?
Bree,"You know, Phyllis, we cannot thank you enough for accepting our apology."
Bree,"Oh, darn, I forgot the napkins."
Bree,"Seriously, we hadn't realized you'd matured enough to take on the burden of motherhood all by yourself."
Bree,"She'll do what she can, but you mustn't overtax her. Her heart is not very strong."
Bree,"Danielle, you should introduce yourself. These people are your new friends."
Bree,"Well, actually, we checked into the curriculum, and it's very strong, but no matter. You're be happier here."
Bree,"Well, we were gonna surprise you with one for your birthday, but since you're keeping the baby, you'll want a more practical gift."
Bree,"Oh, look, they have water aerobics. You should sign up."
Bree,But you can't raise this child in a Miami dorm room. You'll need to leave it with someone you can trust to take care of it properly.
Bree,Tell your stepfather I'll be right out.
Bree,"Oh, please, Phyllis. Even you have to agree that a girl who'd trade her baby for a convertible isn't ready for motherhood."
Bree,That's a nice picture of Rex.
Bree,"I know you're lonely, Phyllis, but I can't give up this child just to make you feel better."
Bree,"Orson and I go to our club almost every Saturday night, if you're-- interested in babysitting."
Bree,I'll say that you're broke and needed the money.
Bree,"I need something that will fly, Phyllis."
Bree,Hello.
Bree,"Oh, well, thank you. Orson and I would be delighted."
Bree,"Uh, no, my daughter is in Switzerland, at boarding school."
Bree,My son--trying on his costume. He's going to be Cher this year.
Bree,How many times have I told you to stay away from the windows?
Bree,"Oh, we've been invited to Bob and Lee 's for Halloween."
Bree,Are you insane?
Bree,"You are due in three weeks. Until then, no windows and no parties."
Bree,Sure! How familiar are you with pop icons from the '70s?
Bree,"Well, you certainly don't seem happy here, and I thought maybe you were missing the nuns and the other girls."
Bree,"You know, Danielle, I just want you to be aware that giving up this baby might be harder than you think."
Bree,"Well, you say that now, but once you've held your child and felt that rush of love, well--it can change you."
Bree,"I'm just saying, if I were you, I might be feeling--"
Bree,"You always say that like it's something to be proud of, but the day I see even a glimmer of myself in you is the day that I realize you've finally started-- to grow up."
Bree,"Lynette, I was just thinking about you. Did you get your test results yet?"
Bree,Ugh! I hate possums.
Bree,How can I help?
Bree,Really? I thought you were one of those liberal gun haters.
Bree,"Well, unfortunately, our bleeding-heart town council forbids us from using live ammo in our own backyards."
Bree,"I suggest you get an air rifle. It won't kill it, but it'll sting it enough to keep it away for good."
Bree,"Try, um, gun city on Route 6 by the Baptist church. Tell them I sent ya, And they'll give you a nice discount."
Bree,"Cher, the beloved pop diva."
Bree,I expressly forbade her from coming tonight. Who does she think she is?
Bree,"Oh, it's just a quick visit. She's driving back Tomorrow."
Bree,"Let's go get some cake, dear."
Bree,"That's not what I meant, and you know it, and as for your little imitation of me, I don't sound anything like that."
Bree,"Okay, you made your point.Now go home."
Bree,"Do not test me, young lady, or I will drag you out of here myself."
Bree,What's wrong?
Bree,"Oh, dear heavenly lord."
Bree,"Danielle! We agreed to save that till the end of the night. The best part of the costume, and she pops the water balloon when people aren't even looking. Orson! Andrew!"
Bree,"Okay, everybody, in the house now."
Bree,Not on the couch. I just had it reupholstered.
Bree,You're a dentist! What if there are complications?
Bree,A what?
Bree,How many rum punches did you have?
Bree,I am going back to get Adam.
Bree,"I need your services as a doctor, but before I tell you what's going on, I need you to promise that what you're about to learnmwill be kept in strictest confidence."
Bree,"Push, baby, push."
Bree,How are you feeling?
Bree,"Uh, yeah, and he promised that no one would ever know what happened here tonight."
Bree,"He's perfect. He's, um, he's all cleaned up now, If-- if you want to hold him."
Bree,He looks just like you did. Do you want to be alone with him? Do you want me to--to go? What should I do?
Bree,"Are you sure? Sweetheart, do you feel like you're making a mistake?"
Bree,"Okay, baby. It's okay, little one. Here we are. Here we go. Yes, here we go."
Bree,"Orson, you better take Benjamin to the other room before my friends run out of lies. Ah."
Bree,"Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh."
Bree,Wait. Did you have that final scan?
Bree,"Oh, she adores him. She just felt terrible that she had to leave for school so soon."
Bree,"I'd start saving your pennies. Bonny Briar's up to $10,000 a year."
Bree,"And you'd better apply now. Debbie Gottlieb had her baby the same day I did, and she could only get wait-listed at her first three choices. Oh, by the way, we were invited to her Bris this Saturday."
Bree,I thought you liked Debbie and Lou.
Bree,Circumcision's not mutilation. It's a simple surgery meant to promote lifelong masculine hygiene.
Bree,We know what it is.
Bree,"Oh, that's ridiculous."
Bree,That's why the procedure should be done on babies. They won't remember. Now can we please just drop this?
Bree,"So, Susan , you mentioned something about bringing dessert. What is it?"
Bree,"Oh, so you found the chocolate sauce?"
Bree,Is everything okay?
Bree,I hope Orson 's rant didn't give you a headache.
Bree,"Susan? Hi. It's, uh, Bree. I'm glad you're home. Uh, listen, I-I thought I might stop by for a little visit."
Bree,"Yes, um, can you tell me who I would talk to about having my baby circumcised?"
Bree,What do you mean you can't help me?
Bree,Please feel free to show her this letter and assure her of its wide distribution to hospitals and physicians across this and two neighboring states.
Bree,That you even felt such a thing was necessary.
Bree,What's that supposed to mean? You don't trust me?
Bree,I'm only thinking of Benjamin. Be reasonable.
Bree,They're-- unsightly. I do not want our son to be teased--for being different. Do you?
Bree,What is wrong with that? I thought we liked conformity.
Bree,I can tell you someone whose sexual pleasure is going to be reduced big-time!
Bree,Let me show you something. You see this breadmaker? This is where I hid a bottle of chardonnay after I told everyone I'd stopped drinking.
Bree,And this rotating spice rack? Those little airplane bottles of vodka fit perfectly in the back.
Bree,"Susan, addicts are experts at deception. My advice to you--Trust--but verify."
Bree,What a lovely ceremony. I'm Deborah's friend Bree. I have what may strike you as a very odd request.
Bree,"Do you think, while you're here, do could do a Bris for my baby, too?"
Bree,"I know it might seem tacky piggybacking on Deborah's Bris, but-- we could do it in the den very quietly."
Bree,"Yes, Bree Hodge--Born Rabinowitz."
Bree,I should only have a Nickel for every time I've heard that.
Bree,"I would love that, but my husband Orson --big, stubborn, goy. He says we should do nothing and let the child decide when he's grown. We don't pick our parents-- we should pick our religion?"
Bree,"Well, he's out of town, and--our Benjamin is 8 days old today. And if I don't do this, my grandma--Tzeitel--will never forgive me, may she rest in peace."
Bree,I swear to you before god that this child will be as devout a Jew as I am.
Bree,"Oh, we had a very busy day. We dropped off the dry cleaning, we deposited money into our Christmas account, and then we got circumcised."
Bree,It's just a little unsightly foreskin. He'll never miss it.
Bree,Orson.
Bree,"I gave them very serious consideration. But it's my blood running in his veins, which ultimately makes it my decision."
Bree,Of course not.
Bree,I know that.
Bree,"I know how much you love Benjamin. I guess--I guess I just have to remember that it's love that makes us a family and not blood. Your son would like you to hold him. By the way, his Hebrew name is Simcha. I'll explain later."
Bree,Addicts are experts at deception.
Bree,"No, he'll be sleeping with us."
Bree,"He's fine, but I've been doing so reading, and more and more people say that babies sleep better next to their parents. It's called the ""family bed""."
Bree,Partly. What's your point?
Bree,"This isn't just for me and Benjamin. This will help you bond with him, too."
Bree,"Darling, sex is the last thing women want right after they've given birth."
Bree,"Well, that doesn't make caring for an infant any less tiring. Can't we just give it a chance?"
Bree,Don't.
Bree,"Oh, hello, dear. Andrew, get Orson's plate from the oven."
Bree,All right. How was it?
Bree,So you'll replace it for free.
Bree,"Oh, give it some time. We're still adjusting, and Benjamin is sleeping so soundly."
Bree,"No, and I wish we had. If we did, he mightn't have turned out so--"
Bree,"I was going to say angry, and perhaps that anger began when we exiled you to the nursery. I'm just trying to learn from my mistakes."
Bree,Don't be so sensitive. We'll find something to help you sleep--maybe some warm milk.
Bree,"And if you're as tired as you say you are, then you're bound to sleep better tonight."
Bree,You're leaving our bed?
Bree,"Oh, thank you."
Bree,"No, thanks. I'm just dropping off Andrew's cell phone. He forgot it again."
Bree,"Um, Tom, may I ask you something? Did you and Lynette do the family bed when your children were babies?"
Bree,"So, um, not to pry, but, um, did that create any, uh, issues for you?"
Bree,"Apparently, ""not to pry"" wasn't necessary."
Bree,"Again, not to pry, but--"
Bree,"Okay. Thanks. Yes, um, we'll be going now."
Bree,"Oh, he just adores it. The three of us are such a happy little family. Aren't we?"
Bree,Bye.
Bree,"Hello, doctor."
Bree,"Mmm, yes, you do. I'm Mrs. Zimmerman."
Bree,I was in a very naughty mood when I left that.
Bree,"Hello, Adam."
Bree,"He's in the exam room, readjusting the chair."
Bree,"Hey, Andrew. What are you doing?"
Bree,You're moving out? But you can't afford an apartment.
Bree,I'm sorry. I don't--I don't understand. Why are you doing this?
Bree,"Is this about the other morning? Oh, for heaven sakes, you can't be serious."
Bree,Just a bit dizzy from holding my breath in your stairwell. May I come in?
Bree,"Well, I guess I'll just have to take my veal scaloppini and go home."
Bree,"Thank you. You know, I'd make it for every day if you'd move back home."
Bree,"Seriously, Andrew, you don't even have a bed."
Bree,"Oh, dear God. At least let me buy you some decent furniture."
Bree,"Andrew, I understand you're angry with me about what I said, but--I do have a good reason for wanting to raise Benjamin differently. I mean, let's be honest. You put me through hell."
Bree,"Well, I know that."
Bree,"Oh, Andrew."
Bree,"I just don't want us to part on bad terms again, like we did two years ago."
Bree,You forgive me?
Bree,Okay. Now I--I really am gonna cry.
Bree,And some of us gave you very expensive wedding gifts.
Bree,"Oh, my god. This is gonna kill Edie."
Bree,You're leaving Fairview?
Bree,I can't believe this.
Bree,And everything will be just the way it was.
Bree,Here. I brought you a few things in case there is a tornado.
Bree,An educated guess.
Bree,"Good, because I already--told him."
Bree,Last week. I was afraid that Mike might go to Orson for pills.
Bree,Did I do something wrong?
Bree,"Katherine, are you all right? I- I couldn't help noticing-"
Bree,"Hi there. I- I don't mean to intrude, but are you all right?"
Bree,Would you like a nice cup of tea?
Bree,"Well, I know Katherine, and believe me, you're not the only person I've seen her reduce to tears."
Bree,"Yes. That was unfortunate. If you need any antibacterial soap, I-"
Bree,"So, um, why on earth would Katherine treat you so dreadfully?"
Bree,Really?
Bree,"Well, you're only human."
Bree,"Well, they seem-- content."
Bree,It was just an observation.
Bree,"Okay. This has been-- lovely. We really should, um, do it again sometime."
Bree,"Be that as it may, I really think you should go now."
Bree,"Sylvia, where are you going? Sylvia, you need to come out of there."
Bree,"Well, Adam is not here, and there is a tornado coming. And as you may have gleaned from the batteries and bottled water, that bathroom is where we are planning on riding it out. So would you please be a dear and come on out?"
Bree,"Hi, Katherine. Could I borrow Adam for a second? I have a--situation on my hands."
Bree,"She's over there, First door on the left, and please hurry."
Bree,I saw her weeping. I wanted to help.
Bree,I can't help having a sympathetic face.
Bree,Just come out! I'll get rid of her!
Bree,That she had an affair with Adam.
Bree,"Oh, my god. What did you do?"
Bree,So this is why you moved back to Fairview?
Bree,"Well, Katherine, for what it's worth--I would've spit in her face, too."
Bree,We can't. There's a woman in there.
Bree,"No, no, no, she's barricaded herself in there."
Bree,Sylvia! Open the damn door!
Bree,We're giving you shelter. You could at least be gracious.
Bree,"Oh, so now it's my fault that that lunatic commandeered our safe room?"
Bree,I can only imagine. I had to listen to her babble for an hour.
Bree,"She said that she and Adam were lovers and she could prove it because he had a tattoo, and--"
Bree,"She said he had a tattoo on his shoulder, which I know isn't true because I've seen him at the pool, And I would've remembered 'cause tattooed people make me very uncomfortable."
Bree,Um-- A snake. What's the difference? He doesn't have one.
Bree,Oh. Sorry.
Bree,The fire captain said they have to go slowly. They don't want debris suddenly collapsing into the basement.
Bree,Thank god.
Bree,"Edie, if you say that to Lynette, so help me god, I will wring your neck."
Bree,"You know, maybe a moment of silence wouldn't be such a bad idea."
Bree,"Oh, and, uh, listen. Bob and lee introduced us to this wonderful contractor, so we won't be imposing for long."
Bree,"Hey, Susan, Orson likes to sleep with the window open. Do you mind if we rearrange the furniture?"
Bree,"Hello, boys. Bob, Lee, I baked you some muffins to thank you for introducing me to Walter here. And, Walter, I decided you're absolutely right. Dark shingles are the way to go. Why are you all staring at me?"
Bree,What?
Bree,"Walter, I can't find a contractor now. Everybody is booked for the next year."
Bree,"Walter. Walter. Walter, I'm begging you. Please. I'm living like a vagabond in a teenage girl's bedroom. I'm sleeping under a poster of Orlando bloom. You can't leave me."
Bree,This is a nightmare. What is going on?
Bree,"Oh, for god sakes. Tell him to put on his big boy pants and find another girl."
Bree,Walter's gay?
Bree,"Well, then you just have to fix him up with someone, give him back his will to work."
Bree,"Well, we'll just have to find him someone who's not good at gay math."
Bree,"Oh, hi, Susan. I hope you don't mind that I made dinner."
Bree,"You're funny. Now I need you to be honest about this recipe. It's a dry run for a small dinner party I'm having tomorrow night. Again, if you don't mind."
Bree,"Dinner will be ready shortly. Oh, and, Julie, I fixed the hem on that blue skirt of yours. It's on your bed."
Bree,"Oh, thank you so much for letting us take over your dining room."
Bree,"Oh, sure. Just, uh, leave your trays in the hall when you're ready."
Bree,Puff pastry?
Bree,"Yes, and a nice home-cooked meal. Trust me, there are absolutely no tricks up our sleeve."
Bree,Walter recently split up with his life partner Todd. They were gay.
Bree,Andrew is also an out-and-proud homosexual.
Bree,You know what else you two have in common? A love of boots.
Bree,"Oh, thanks, dear."
Bree,I'm just trying to stay out of the way of all those sparks that are flying.
Bree,"Yes, but he's also-- he's got a great sense of--Okay, do you know how hard it is to get a good contractor?"
Bree,"And poor Walter just had his heart broken, so if it takes you being nice to him to get our house fixed, then--"
Bree,And windows. And I am not pimping you out. I'm simply asking you to show some kindness to a lonely man who happens to be an excellent roofer.
Bree,"Watch your mouth. I would never suggest that. You can raise a man's hopes without satisfying them. I've done it all my life. Andrew, I have got to get back into my house, and you're my only hope."
Bree,Bless you.
Bree,"Fine, and if you can get him to come in on time and under budget, I'll throw in surround sound."
Bree,"Well, say no more. One slice coming right up."
Bree,All righty. Here you go.
Bree,Oh. You're going to eat that--here?
Bree,"Exactly, and now, um, his tastes have gone to the more mature, cultured types, like, uh, Walter here."
Bree,Susan.
Bree,"Oh, so why don't you take this piece of pie upstairs to Julie?"
Bree,"Well, he doesn't mind."
Bree,"Walter, wait!"
Bree,You. Sit.
Bree,Leave us.
Bree,Why? I-I thought you'd want your house back.
Bree,"Oh, sweetie, you're okay."
Bree,This is a conversation that could benefit from some homemade chocolate chip cookies.
Bree,I'll be right back.
Bree,We brought you muffins.
Bree,Susan!
Bree,"Susan! Look, I don't mean to pry, but given what I know about you and Adam, I'm surprised he was the one to do the leaving."
Bree,"I understand, but whatever you do, don't keep your feelings bottled up. You've got to let'em out."
Bree,"Orson, I don't want to be late."
Bree,"Yeah, but I'm sure Edna Fletcher has been there since 9:00, kissing up to Reverend Sykes."
Bree,Damn right.
Bree,"I am sorry, but I have to make sure that he doesn't let her chair that committee."
Bree,"Exactly, and all the while, where was Edna? Lounging around in Zimbabwe in the Peace Corps. She won't let any of us forget it."
Bree,"Oh, Lynette. Hi. you look pretty. What are you all dressed up for?"
Bree,I would love that. We're--we're leaving right now. you can follow us.
Bree,"Oh, don't go catholic. All that standing and kneeling and genuflecting--I go for worship, not a workout."
Bree,Presbyterian.
Bree,What are you doing?
Bree,What? No. put your hand down.
Bree,"Lynette, please, we don't do that here."
Bree,There. you have your answer. Now sit.
Bree,"Oh, lord."
Bree,Get the keys ready. We'll slip out the back.
Bree,"Wow, you bought a Bible."
Bree,"Oh, so you're--coming to Bible study."
Bree,"Lynette, I-I realize you don't have much experience with churches, so this really isn't your fault."
Bree,"Well, last Sunday, when you kept raising your hand--We don't really do that. The church isn't a place for questions. It's a place for answers."
Bree,"Well, typically, we sit there and let the preacher preach, and eventually, our questions are answered, and no one is humiliated."
Bree,"Well, it's just that in our church, people don't talk back to the minister."
Bree,"Well, then maybe you should explore other options. I mean, if you really enjoy talking ck to the pulpit, why don't you try that gospel church by the airport?"
Bree,"Or, uh, the Unitarians. From what I hear, those folks are ""anything goes."""
Bree,"Yes, I'm gonna run some errands, and Orson's gonna take Benjamin to the park."
Bree,Benjamin doesn't love Matisse. he loves purple. Oh. Please stop trying to turn our son into an intellectual.
Bree,"Oh! good morning, Reverend. I brought your favorite-- blueberry scones."
Bree,"Oh, is that happening now? I'd forgotten all about it."
Bree,Delightful? I thought she annoyed you.
Bree,"You don't say that. I've--I've never heard you say that, not once."
Bree,"Thank you, Reverend, and I'm--I'm sure the Scavos will be here soon."
Bree,Which is just down the street. I'll be right back.
Bree,Psst! Not you. Lynette.
Bree,I was gonna ask the same of you. Why are you in a catholic church?
Bree,"Oh, please. Mowing your lawn in a Notre dame sweatshirt doesn't make you catholic. You're Presbyterian now. Come on. Let's go."
Bree,"I meant sample, like a buffet. You take a little plate of everything, and then you sit down for the main course, which is across the street--at the presbyterian church."
Bree,"No, no problem. Just talking to my friend."
Bree,I am not! My friend's just a little confused. She forgot that she's Presbyterian and wandered into the wrong church.
Bree,"Lynette, please. Can't we just go outside and talk for a moment?"
Bree,"Well, I was at the service this morning, and it's just not the same without you."
Bree,"And I am-- up for the head of the Ladies' Auxiliary, and Reverend Sykes was so impressed that I brought a new family into church, so--if you don't come back, then--"
Bree,"Well, yes."
Bree,Lynette! You were the one who came to me. you sought me out.
Bree,Lynette--
Bree,It did. It did help me.
Bree,It just did.
Bree,"Lynette, why didn't you tell me?"
Bree,"Hey, Lynette."
Bree,"Just-- wanted to tell you that I'm out of the running for the Ladies' Auxiliary. I told Reverend Sykes to, uh, give it to Edna Fletcher. She was in the Peace Corps, you know."
Bree,I suppose. I just wanted to let you know that. And also to-- apologize.
Bree,"Yes, I do. you were right. Faith shouldn't be blind. You don't threaten it by asking questions. You make it stronger, and I lost sight of that."
Bree,"And it meant a lot that you came to me for guidance, and--I'm sorry that I wasn't there for you. I want you to have faith in me and our friendship."
Bree,"How's Catholicism going, by the way?"
Bree,"Well, if you ever wanna try us again--"
Bree,This is not my pie.
Bree,"Oh, and, listen, Bob and Lee introduced us to this wonderful contractor, so we won't be imposing for long."
Bree,"Oh, Gaby, I'm so glad you're here. I was just about to tell everyone to keep an eye out for their invitation to the founder's ball."
Bree,"It's a lot of work, exhausting and completely worth it."
Bree,That would be lovely.
Bree,"Yes, of course. Why wouldn't it?"
Bree,"I acknowledge that Katherine and I have had our differences, but we have all been through a lot recently."
Bree,Good morning. What's going on?
Bree,"Oh, I think I know what's going on. Somebody had a naughty dream."
Bree,You are such a scamp.
Bree,"You know, Susan, sometimes I climb into a warm bath with a romance novel. Just a thought."
Bree,"Oh, no, thank you. We have so much ground to cover. Now let's move on to the flowers. Uh, last year, we went with a cascade of pink and white roses. There it is."
Bree,"Well--if you have a different idea, I would love to hear that, too."
Bree,It's interesting. I can't really picture that though.
Bree,"Well, they're certainly--assertive. My only fear is--"
Bree,"Well, perhaps I could try something new. Let's go with the lisianthus."
Bree,Who put pear slices in the Waldorf salad?
Bree,"Katherine, a Waldorf salad is made with apples. It's tradition."
Bree,"""Take over""? What in god's name have you done with my French onion soup?"
Bree,Katherine--
Bree,"Oh, dear. Well, I should throw this dip out."
Bree,She's not my boss!
Bree,"Thank you, Mrs. Downing. Listen, when I present the founder's award tonight, I was wondering--"
Bree,About what?
Bree,No! That's--that's my job. I always do it.
Bree,"Oh, it's dip. The caterer just said that--"
Bree,Dig in.
Bree,Is everyone having fun?
Bree,You really should have more faith in people. Excuse me.
Bree,"Katherine, darling, are you okay?"
Bree,"Oh, no. No, dear. Just you. Maybe you should go home."
Bree,"Oh, no one would expect you to do that in your condition. You know what? Um, I could do it."
Bree,"Katherine, no one expects you to be a martyr. Why don't you go home?"
Bree,"Why not? I'm perfectly capable of presenting. I've done it for the last eight years. I mean, no one wants to accept an award from a woman who looks like she should be in line at the needle exchange."
Bree,"""I was honored when you--"" myeah, myeah, myeah, myeah."
Bree,Used to be. Not anymore. Things change.
Bree,"Ever since I started working with that obnoxious backstabber, she's done nothing but try to take the spotlight off of me and put it onto her."
Bree,"Well, uh, this has been an evening full of, um--surprises. I never would've imagined that, um, I would be recognized by this wonderful organization --"
Bree,"I certainly, uh, wasn't expecting it."
Bree,The photographer's asking if he can get shots of the two of us.
Bree,"I misunderstood the situation, that's all. Can we just leave it at that?"
Bree,"Here's the thing you need to understand about me and my friends. We each have our niche. Gabrielle's the glamorous one. Susan's the adorable one. Lynette's smart. Edie's--Edie. And I'm the domestic one, the organizer--the one who knows that there are three tines on a dessert fork. I'm the one who gets teased for that. That's who I am. And that's also who you are."
Bree,So--I don't really know how to be friends with you.
Bree,Who knew you were so insightful?
Bree,"That's everything, I guess."
Bree,"Oh, that's so sweet, but--our house is livable again - the downstairs anyway - and we have imposed long enough. Besides, Mike is coming home tonight, and you're gonna need the house to yourselves."
Bree,"Susan, I'm just going across the street. There's no need to act like a silent movie heroine."
Bree,"Well, um, as much as I appreciate this naked display of emotion, you know how this sort of thing makes me uncomfortable."
Bree,No. Never.
Bree,No. Never.
Bree,"Oh, sure, you can. Whenever I feel my emotions getting the best of me, I simply picture an empty box, and I take whatever I'm feeling and put that in the box, and then I picture myself putting the box away in a big, empty closet and closing the door. Then if I have time, I go back and open the box and deal with the emotion--in private, like a lady."
Bree,"Prove me wrong, sweetie. Prove me wrong."
Bree,"No, thanks. We're almost done."
Bree,"Oh, how sweet."
Bree,Hire us? But we're not a business.
Bree,"Katherine, need I remind you we nearly came to blows over floral choices?"
Bree,I think it's our creative friction that nearly caused me to poison you.
Bree,"I sympathize. I do, but I have a new baby, and it's really more work than I care to take on right now."
Bree,Excuse me?
Bree,"Yeah, sure. You know, I don't really think it's fair that you should profit from something that I designed."
Bree,That is a cherished recipe from my grandmother.
Bree,"Oh, I see what's going on here. This is shameless emotional blackmail."
Bree,And--it worked beautifully. I'm in.
Bree,Who could that be at this hour? Susan. What on earth?
Bree,What are you talking about?
Bree,Will someone please tell me what's going on?
Bree,What?
Bree,Susan ��_��_��_
Bree,I think it's admirable that you wanna forgive Orson--because I can't.
Bree,I assume you'll want the pewter cat.
Bree,"You adored it, as I recall. That's why I'm giving you the choice. And what about that Hummel from your aunt? It's ugly as sin, but she insists that it's valuable."
Bree,"I know, but I'm the one thing you can't have."
Bree,"Orson, every wife understands that her husband will make a few mistakes--a forgotten anniversary, the occasional harsh word, but we all have to draw the line somewhere, and I'm drawing mine at the attempted murder of my best friend's husband."
Bree,There is one thing.
Bree,Turn yourself in to the police.
Bree,And you'd probably go to prison.
Bree,"Exactly, and if you could muster that kind of moral courage, I think I could forgive you. Oh, come on. I promise I'll wait for you."
Bree,Very well. So do you want the cat or not?
Bree,"Orson, what are you doing here?"
Bree,"Yes, I can smell the thinking on your breath. Are you insane, driving in this condition?"
Bree,Except for the occasional hit-and-run.
Bree,You are?
Bree,"No, it's a pathetic fantasy fueled by cowardice and amaretto sours. You committed a crime, Orson. Face it."
Bree,"Edie, would you do me a favor and take Orson back to his apartment? I have to let my sitter go home."
Bree,"Hi, Edie, thanks again for helping me out last night."
Bree,"Orson's car is still parked at my house. Um, did he mention when he'd be coming back to pick it up?"
Bree,He spent the night here?
Bree,"Well, um, just so you know, in the future, I'm not comfortable with that. This can't happen again."
Bree,"Oh, I-I-I think you know."
Bree,"Oh, come on, Edie. You know, Carlos, Mike, Karl-- you do have a way at picking at other women's leftovers."
Bree,Edie!
Bree,"Come on, Edie. Think of our friendship."
Bree,"Actually, Karen, when I'm done here, I could go try to find Toby for you."
Bree,"I hope so. Truth is, I miss him. And I'll probably let him come home eventually. I just need to know he understands the gravity of what he did."
Bree,"Oh, hello, Dylan. You look lovely."
Bree,"Good night. Okay, back to business. How do you feel about Parker House rolls? I mean, personally, I think they're played out."
Bree,"Well, of course. Is everything all right?"
Bree,"Ah, the key is to keep one car between yours and hers at all times. Have fun."
Bree,I saw you kissing my husband.
Bree,"What were you thinking, Edie? We're supposed to be friends."
Bree,Hi!
Bree,I'm Bree Hodge.
Bree,So are you thinking of moving onto the lane?
Bree,"Oh, yes, the neighborhood's safe. I wish I could say the same for your real estate agent."
Bree,May I help you?
Bree,It's not really a good time.
Bree,"Well, that sounds boring. I know. Why don't you take him to Edie's house, And he can watch you give her a dental exam with your tongue?"
Bree,"Yes, eventually, with a big, dopey grin on your face."
Bree,"I don't think so. I'd hate for him to be around when you had another attack of delayed morality, either with Edie or behind the wheel of your car."
Bree,Not exactly.
Bree,"Strictly speaking, you're not even related to him. I mean, it was fine for you to masquerade as his father when we were together, but now that we're not--"
Bree,"I've already hired one. You'll be hearing from him shortly. Oh, and if you're in the mood for a carnival, why not call Edie? I hear you get three throws for a dollar with her, too."
Bree,What on earth could you possibly want?
Bree,"Well, good, when they drop by for their inspection, I'll just have to have a nice little chat with them, too."
Bree,Family?
Bree,How did you--
Bree,"Edie, if word got out, my whole family would be--humiliated."
Bree,What does that mean?
Bree,Edie--please.
Bree,Yeah.
Bree,"There's something I've been--keeping from all of you, and, um--we need to talk."
Bree,Yes.
Bree,Thank you.
Bree,"I told them everything, Edie, about Orson, Benjamin, everything."
Bree,Did you hear something?
Bree,Neither did I.
Bree,"I reject your peace, and I demand you stop stalking me."
Bree,"Really? So I just happen to run into you at the dry cleaner, the greengrocer,the post office?"
Bree,"Oh, please. I saw you at my nail salon."
Bree,"Orson, hear me when I say this. It's over. You have done unconscionable things for which I can never forgive you, and no amount of flitting about in my peripheral vision is going to change that."
Bree,I know no such thing. Now be quiet. I'm done talking to you.
Bree,And also with you. Do not give this man peace.
Bree,Wonderful! With a little goat cheese.
Bree,Those with roasted green beans as our side dishes. Nice tight grouping. You are not rusty at all.
Bree,"Although I always, uh, like a trip to the range, Is there any particular reason we came here for party planning?"
Bree,"It's funny how having a man in the house can make you feel safer, no matter how retiring or easily spooked he might be."
Bree,"You really want to be effective? Try hollow points. These rounds you've got punch straight though, but a hollow point blooms on impact, cuts the body to shreds from the inside."
Bree,So it's been two days now. Did you and Mike finally land on a name?
Bree,It has a very distinct ring.
Bree,"Well, then appeal to his sense of reason, because the name ""Maynard"" doesn't go with the name of ""Delfino"". One is German and the other is Italian, and we all know what happens when those folks get together."
Bree,"Come on. You have to do something. I mean, that name is practically abusive."
Bree,"Maybe not. We call Gabrielle ""Gaby."" I mean, perhaps there's a shortened version of ""Maynard"" you could live with."
Bree,"They'll love that. This is gonna be the best seniors' brunch ever. I'm so glad you're back. Between you and me, Reverend Sykes tended to pander to the congregation's progressive element. I prefer your more muscular brand of Christianity."
Bree,"I did, but, um, I'm afraid it hasn't worked out. It's been rough."
Bree,"I didn't know she left you. Yes, for our Korean grocer. I'll tell you, sometimes this merciful god of ours has one sick sense of humor."
Bree,"Oh, this is a bit awkward, but my soon-to-be ex just walked in. He's been following me everywhere."
Bree,"Would you mind terribly if I took your hand? Maybe that way, he'll finally get the idea that I've moved on."
Bree,"Ah, it worked. Thank you for that."
Bree,"Now, now. We mustn't play favorites, although I will take that as a compliment."
Bree,"Oh. How, um, colorfully put."
Bree,What does that mean?
Bree,Reverend Green!
Bree,"No, I told you. I was only trying to send a message to my ex."
Bree,No!
Bree,Ohh!
Bree,Oh! Aah! Oh.
Bree,Then let me send you a clear one. I am not attracted to you.
Bree,"Oh, Reverend Green, please don't be upset."
Bree,Aah!
Bree,They're a little late getting started.
Bree,I have no idea. Now if you'll please excuse me.
Bree,"Oh, dear lord."
Bree,Orson. Orson.
Bree,"Hi. I'm, uh, here to check on Orson Hodge. An ambulance brought him in less than an hour ago."
Bree,I'm his wife.
Bree,"No, that's all right. Let him rest. But please take excellent care of him. He's a good man."
Bree,"No, you don't."
Bree,"Ladies, I don't know what you're talking about. Katherine has all sorts of wonderful qualities."
Bree,"Well, I admit she plays her cards close to the vest, but some of you could benefit from that kind of quiet dignity, Miss I-chew-gum- like-a-1930s-gun-moll."
Bree,Hi! We were just talking about you.
Bree,Hey. What's going on?
Bree,"It's tomorrow! A hundred gay men are descending on this street, And they're expecting a fabulous party."
Bree,"Okay. Well, what's going on?"
Bree,"All right, you can all wipe those smug looks off your faces, because every one of you has just become my employee."
Bree,"So after the ceremony, we'll open up the buffet--"
Bree,"And dancing, roll out the cake, you leave for your honeymoon, and I will collapse in a tasteful heap."
Bree,"Oh! Yes, I'm sorry. One cherub delivered at 1:30."
Bree,"Uh, why don't I let you two work this out?"
Bree,"Why are you here? And don't say for the pizza, because I know you're lactose-intolerant."
Bree,"Oh, I get it. So I'm desperate and vulnerable, and you're gonna swoop in and save the day. Well, thank you very much. I'm fine."
Bree,Don't you dare throw your calligraphy skills in my face when you know I'm at a low point. Now go! And stop following me.
Bree,"All right, so I will call the ice sculptor and see if we can--"
Bree,"Okay, so you have another one of those in the truck? Thank you."
Bree,"Lynette, I wish I had time to be more tactful, but I don't. Your swan is pathetic, and I'm firing you from napkin duty."
Bree,"Yes? Oh, there you are! Where is my ice sculpture? No! No,6:00 is too late. I need it now. Oh, forget it. I'll pick it up myself."
Bree,"Why don't you fill water glasses? That's an important job, too."
Bree,"Andrew--Look, I'm on my way back, but it's imperative that you--Andrew?"
Bree,"Oh, dear god. Oh, no. Don't die on me now! Aah! Oh, dear god."
Bree,Aah! Help me! Help!
Bree,Ugh. What more can you do to me?
Bree,"Yes, and the ""Venus de Milo"" is missing two arms. What's your point?"
Bree,"Well, I suppose I should say thank you."
Bree,"Was I lucky, or were you following me?"
Bree,"And you were right. I did. You just think I'm being stubborn, don't you? Making you jump through hoops when it's so clear we belong together."
Bree,"But that's just it, Orson. If I forgive you, then I'm forgiving what you did to Mike. I can't do that. And-- and you wouldn't want me to. I mean, be honest with yourself. If I took you back now, I wouldn't be the woman you love."
Bree,I've already told you. Turn yourself in to the police and let justice run its course.
Bree,Well--so here we are.
Bree,I did not tell you to put mums in that arrangement! And don't point your finger at me or I'll snap it right off.
Bree,"No, I did a bang-up job. Katherine bailed on me and left town last night."
Bree,Katherine? It's Bree. We need to talk now!
Bree,It was an accident.
Bree,First we have to do something to stop that bleeding.
Bree,We don't have much time before the police get here. We need to talk.
Bree,Then he raised the gun and came toward us. Thank god Katherine grabbed his arm and got the gun away. That lunatic would've killed us all.
Bree,I'm home!
Bree,"Leave the galleys in my office and tell the woman from ""The Times"" to call me back in the morning. I'm gonna have a nice bubble bath with my husband. Coming, Orson!"
Bree,"Oh, for god sakes. What's wrong now?"
Bree,Why am I surprised?
Bree,"Well, that's no surprise. My pies are always perfect."
Bree,Mm. And I know this before I've tasted it?
Bree,"Andrew, dear, I'm going to take a little break. Would you please tell this gentleman that if he calls me ""sweetie"" one more time, I'm gonna grab his camera and take picture of his colon."
Bree,"Katherine, hi. What are you doing here?"
Bree,Oh. Sorry. Paid for what?
Bree,"Look, I'm sorry. I didn't know a photo shoot would take this long. I mean, who knew it'd be this hard to pose for a book cover?"
Bree,"Okay, Katherine. I know this book has been monopolizing my time, and you feel overworked and undervalued. But I do appreciate you. In fact, I have a gift for you. It's the galleys of my new book. Read page 2."
Bree,"Well, you make this all possible."
Bree,Andrew-- Do we have a backup pie?
Bree,Good.
Bree,So you're back?
Bree,"Well, it's certainly nice to meet you, Dave, and let us be the first to welcome you to Wisteria Lane."
Bree,"Katherine! Fantastic news. ""What's cookin' Fairview?"" is sending out a camera crew tomorrow to do a piece on me and the book."
Bree,You read it ready?
Bree,Really? What?
Bree,Excuse me?
Bree,"Oh, don't be silly. I may have based a few on your recipes, but I always changed something."
Bree,"Well, yours calls for minced curly leaf parsley. Mine calls for minced flat leaf."
Bree,Never heard anything so absurd.
Bree,"Really, Katherine. Just because I let you execute a few eye-catching garnishes that gratify your need to show off, doesn't mean that I can't do them just as well myself."
Bree,We are. That's why your name is on the dedication page.
Bree,"This is my kitchen, and this is my staff--The most gifted, hardworking team a cook could ever have hoped for. I cannot say enough good things about them."
Bree,"Katherine, I'm blushing."
Bree,"Ah! Oh, god. Are you All right?"
Bree,"Oh, you poor dear. Could someone please get some ice? Oh, no."
Bree,"Katherine, I'm sure your wrist is just fine."
Bree,The secret to spinning sugar is this special whisk that makes lovely gossamer threads.
Bree,I can see that.
Bree,Sorry. Oops!
Bree,"And now to finish, you simply transfer your spun sugar to the croquembouche and gracefully drape it around in a delicate swirl. Did I mention that you--probably shouldn't be wearing jewelry while working with spun sugar? Um--Well, there's no law that says it has to be a delicate veil. I mean, it could really just be a beautiful, um, little, uh, white--ribbon. Turn off the damn camera."
Bree,"Oh, I'm glad you're enjoying yourself."
Bree,"Well, I think what Gaby means is you were fairly awful to us right before you left, and this is our way of welcoming you back to hopefully not do it again."
Bree,"Please, Danielle. You have no right to take him."
Bree,"Danielle, we agreed I would raise him. We agreed it would be best!"
Bree,"Please, Danielle, we can have any arrangement you like. Please, just don't take him! For god sakes, Orson's gone. You kids are grown. Benjamin's all I have!"
Bree,The cooking show agreed to redo my segment. I wanna make sure it's perfect this Time.
Bree,"Yes, it is."
Bree,"Now it's just a mock-up, but this is what the book is going to look like."
Bree,"Thank you, dear. Orson, what do you think?"
Bree,"Well, you knew what the book was gonna be called."
Bree,"My company, which I formed when we were separated, is called Mrs. Van de Kamp's catering. It's how I'm known."
Bree,"Orson, I adore you, but your name-- our name-- it has no music. ""Van de Kamp"" trips off the tongue. ""Hodge"" sounds like the noise a plunger makes."
Bree,Listen--Van de Kamp--Hodge.
Bree,"See? The ship has already sailed. Oh, don't be hurt. It's my professional name. In this house, I will always be Mrs. Hodge. Now-- would it help if Mrs. Hodge cooked you your favorite pot roast tonight?"
Bree,"Oh, right. Um, tomorrow for sure, then."
Bree,Gaby--
Bree,"Well, um, Michelle Downing asked me to speak to you. I don't know if you heard, but I'm catering her birthday party��_��_��_"
Bree,You can't come. Sorry. I just had to rip the band-aid off.
Bree,It's not personal. You know how Carlos just started at the club?
Bree,"Oh, Gaby, it's just one party. I'll save you some cake."
Bree,"Oh, hon, I don't think that's gonna fly. He's already rubbed too many members."
Bree,"No, I'm good. How do I look?"
Bree,Oh. I'm a little bit nervous. This is my first national interview. And I am a huge fan of your cookbooks.
Bree,"Oh, you know Michelle?"
Bree,"Okay, now I'm terrified."
Bree,"Hi, Linda."
Bree,"Well, I think a lot of people miss the way life used to be--Back when women had more time to cook. It's always been important to me to have the family gather around the table every night for hot, lovingly prepared meals."
Bree,"No. Uh, Mr. Van de Kamp is deceased."
Bree,"But in regards to my husband, I should make one thing very clear--His passing had nothing to do with my cooking."
Bree,"Katherine, it is not too late to change tonight's menu. If Linda Flanagan likes my food, she might give me a quote for the book jacket. I have to knock her socks off, and I am not betting the farm on haddock. Argue with me all you like. I just bought 40 pounds of pork, so get your Tushie over here."
Bree,Orson! Did you get my message about Linda Flanagan?
Bree,Isn't it amazing?
Bree,What?
Bree,"And waste valuable airtime? The show was about my cookbook, not about my tortured marital history."
Bree,"Orson, I have 6 hours to prepare a meal for 80 people. We're not having this discussion now."
Bree,Should I be proud? Do you want me to go on the radio and boast that my husband served time for running someone over?
Bree,And because it was the right thing to do. I just didn't know then that I would be a public figure someday. But I am. I have a name now.
Bree,"Orson, please don't be hurt. I am under so much pressure and so terrified I'll fail that I don't even know what I'm saying half the Time. Just let me get through this. As soon as the plates go out tonight, I will come home and cook you that pot roast I promised. Okay?"
Bree,Hmm.
Bree,Chives! How could I forget chives?
Bree,Gaby?
Bree,What are you doing here? You were disinvited.
Bree,"Well, I know nothing. Just keep me out of it. What is Carlos doing?"
Bree,Gaby!
Bree,I would be happy to. I just want to make sure it's the kind you like.
Bree,You're still here? Dinner is about to be served. Whose seats are you in?
Bree,"Yes, and I'm pretty sure that elderly woman with him was his mother!"
Bree,You can fix this. Just tell them that you're at the wrong table and then slip out the side door.
Bree,"Yes, and he appears to be checking the guest list."
Bree,"Okay, you can fix this. Just explain you're going to a different party here at the club and that you got confused. Mrs. Downing never has to know."
Bree,"At this point, I would just run off screaming into the night."
Bree,"Orson, you're still up. Oh, I wish you could've been there. Linda Flanagan loved my food. She said I was ""god's gift to the table"" and that I could quote her on the book jacket. Are you all right?"
Bree,It's after midnight. Haven't you eaten?
Bree,"I am so sorry. I-I lost all track of time, and Linda had so many questions about the food. I'll make you that pot roast tomorrow, okay?"
Bree,Now?
Bree,"Orson, I've been cooking all day. I-- I'm so tired, I can barely stand up. You really want me to make you a pot roast now?"
Bree,"Please, just don't take him! Benjamin's all I have!"
Bree,"Here they come, finally."
Bree,I do not require lectures on tact.
Bree,"I'm aware of what's at stake, Orson."
Bree,I've already started. Danielle! What a delightfully ethnic ensemble.
Bree,"Lovely to meet you, Leo."
Bree,"Now we have you for the whole weekend, right?"
Bree,"""Danielle""? Did he just call you ""Danielle""?"
Bree,"Yes, I'm aware of that. I picked it. I'm just concerned people might view it as a sign of, um, disrespect."
Bree,"Um-- Let me be clear. I do no want him calling me ""Bree."""
Bree,"All right, Orson. Don't overexcite him on the upholstery. So, Danielle, what would you like me to make as a side dish for your welcome home party? I can do anything so long as it complements beef tenderloin."
Bree,Excuse me?
Bree,Oh. Well-- Since when?
Bree,Would it be more acceptable if I shopped for a suicidal pork loin?
Bree,This isn't about dinner. This is about her nutty liberal politics getting in the way of our grandson's nutrition.
Bree,"Well, this isn't just about nutrition. Do you want him to be teased at school every time he pulls tofu out of his lunchbox?"
Bree,Excuse me? You're teaching him?
Bree,"So instead of sending him to a proper school, you're gonna give him the benefit of your straight ""C"" average?"
Bree,"Well, what happens next year when he overtakes you?"
Bree,"I am sorry, but am I supposed to sit by while she degrades his body and his mind?"
Bree,"Oh, just some old pictures. Can you guess who that little girl is?"
Bree,That's your mom way back when she was your age.
Bree,"Oh! Uh, a hot dog."
Bree,"Oh, yes. Your mother loved hot dogs. Every day at lunchtime, she'd say to me, ""Mommy, I want hot dog."""
Bree,"Well, because she's all grown-up. You see, hot dogs and hamburgers are what make little boys and girls grow up to be big and strong. And now that she's grown-up, she doesn't need them anymore."
Bree,"I've been asking myself that all day. Maybe she's afraid if you get big, you'll leave home and go play for the Red Sox."
Bree,Oh. Well--In that case--
Bree,You have to promise not to tell your mommy.
Bree,"Well, what do you think?"
Bree,"Yes. Yes, it is."
Bree,"Isn't this nice? For the first time in years, my family is all here under the same roof."
Bree,Let's get you to the powder room.
Bree,"No, um, you take Benjy upstairs. I'll get it. Orson, could you get the mop, please?"
Bree,No! Of course not.
Bree,That is not meat.
Bree,"I gave him a hot dog, all right? He liked it so much, he asked for another."
Bree,"All right, I'll concede the second one was clearly a mistake."
Bree,"Well, I've apologized till I'm blue in the face, but they're still leaving in the morning. Now you're not speaking to me, either? They're just mad. Things will be better next time."
Bree,"Orson, I'm truly sorry. It's just, seeing--all these mistakes that she's making with Benjamin, it's just so hard for me."
Bree,And you think that's my fault?
Bree,"Orson, you weren't here. She came back. She was married to a lawyer. And don't forget, she is his mother! I tried to fight, but--"
Bree,"I was on my knees. I was sobbing. She said ""no"" and then ripped him out of my arms. You have no right to say that to me."
Bree,It's how I'm known.
Bree,"No, uh, Mr. Van de Kamp is deceased."
Bree,Hi! Come on in!
Bree,Here's my cookbook.
Bree,These are advanced copies. I wanted you to be the first to have them.
Bree,We don't have to read them out loud.
Bree,Mmm. Oh. Mmm. You have a good day.
Bree,"Yeah. Oh, I almost forgot."
Bree,"Isn't this nice? They're running it next month in ""Woman's Day."""
Bree,"They've come up with this whole marketing plan--radio, print, book signings."
Bree,"Thank you, Katherine. I will never become stuck-up and full of myself."
Bree,Very funny. I hardly think you have to worry about me becoming famous.
Bree,Why?
Bree,"Oh, right! Of course. I would, uh, love to hear your thoughts."
Bree,"Girls, you are making way too much of this. I am not a bit more fabulous than any one of you. Excuse me."
Bree,"What is it, Andrew?"
Bree,"Oh, my god! That is so amazing! The, uh, dry cleaner just, um--found my sweater."
Bree,"Orson, I have amazing news. The chamber of commerce just called."
Bree,I wanna buy you lunch and tell you in person. I will be at your office in two minutes.
Bree,"Well, I'll wait in reception until it's over."
Bree,What kind of meeting is it?
Bree,Where are you?
Bree,"Yes, you will."
Bree,I don't understand. You said the job was going so well.
Bree,So you've been pretending to go to work for three weeks?
Bree,Honey--I'm not angry. I'm hurt that you didn't feel like you could tell me.
Bree,"Orson, we're partners. We share everything. Any success I have is just as much yours as it is mine."
Bree,"Apparently, we've been named businesswoman of the year."
Bree,Looks like somebody's job interview went well.
Bree,Aw.
Bree,Oh. Who?
Bree,You wanna work here?
Bree,"Well, that's certainly an intriguing notion. But wouldn't it be awkward having me as your boss?"
Bree,Partners? Oh.
Bree,Just give me a sec.
Bree,I don't think we need to do that.
Bree,"Oh, well, I think the irises and the lilies could work together."
Bree,"Not a good time, Orson."
Bree,"Orson, you really don't wanna work with me. I mean, you only see me at home. But at work, when the pressure's on, I can be a bit of a handful. Katherine's seen how I get."
Bree,"He gets it, dear. Honey, you're my partner in life. But if we want to keep it that way, we shouldn't mix marriage and business."
Bree,"Well, you've only been looking for a few weeks. I mean, give it another-- Say, month or two, and you still haven't found anything, then we'll revisit the idea. Okay?"
Bree,"Goodness, Lynette. When you offered to share your thoughts on my campaign, I wasn't expecting anything quite so--elaborate."
Bree,"Um, I think ""understated"" was what they were going for."
Bree,Let Mrs. Van de Kamp turn your oven into a Time machine.
Bree,"Do you? Because I see children crawling into ovens, hoping to see dinosaurs."
Bree,"Oh, Lynette, I appreciate everything you've done. But I've actually approved the old campaign, and I can't just tell them I've changed my mind."
Bree,No.
Bree,"Sorry, but I prefer their campaign."
Bree,"Well, you're--entitled to think so, but I don't."
Bree,"Oh. Well, I'm familiar with that award. In fact, I'm this year's recipient."
Bree,"Yes. There's a luncheon on the 12th. I do hope you can make it. Oh. By the way, you're right about those colors. Very--jazzy."
Bree,"Orson, what are you doing in the guest bedroom?"
Bree,Me? Snoring?
Bree,"Honey, I don't snore."
Bree,"Oh, for heaven sakes, come back to bed."
Bree,"Hi, everybody! You having a good Time?"
Bree,"Um ,this is��_��_��_"
Bree,"Actually, Stu's company is doing all my advertising."
Bree,Where are you? It's after 2:00.
Bree,"Oh, that's not until 4:00."
Bree,"Oh, honey. Everybody's asking about you. I want you to be here. It's my big day."
Bree,Coupons?
Bree,"Would you excuse us, please?"
Bree,"Lynette, you're drunk."
Bree,"Lynette, I am really not able to deal with that right now."
Bree,I never said that.
Bree,You need to leave now.
Bree,Hi.
Bree,I'm not angry with you. I'm just sorry that you felt so--
Bree,You have nothing to be jealous of.
Bree,But that doesn't mean I look down on you.
Bree,"For god sakes, Lynette, stop calling me a success. There's nothing successful about me. My friends think I'm gonna drop them, my partner resents me, and my husband--has moved into the guest bedroom. Everything I gain comes at some horrible price, and I'm starting to wonder if any of it's even worth it."
Bree,Thanks.
Bree,Promise me you'll never leave our bed again.
Bree,"My name is Bree, and I am an alcoholic."
Bree,Who?
Bree,"Orson, please. you're putting me in an impossible position."
Bree,Aren't you dapper?
Bree,"Um, actually, dear--"
Bree,I'd rather you not talk about the job tonight.
Bree,"Well, it's just vulgar to discuss business at a party."
Bree,It's not that easy. You know she'll be furious.
Bree,It's-- complicated.
Bree,"Careful, dear. You don't want to be ill tomorrow."
Bree,"Uh, would anybody like some more frittata?"
Bree,"Andrew, please."
Bree,"Uh, yes. He's going to read a lot of classic books, maybe study a language."
Bree,"Andrew, really."
Bree,Go away. I don't feel well.
Bree,I'm too tired. Can you do it?
Bree,"When Orson left, I--began having a glass of white wine now and then. Then when Danielle took Benjamin, I didn't see any reason to stop at just one."
Bree,"I can't help myself, all right? My husband's gone. My son's gone. I have nothing left."
Bree,"Oh, Katherine, please."
Bree,He's gonna be so ashamed of me.
Bree,I don't know if I can make it this time.
Bree,You would do that?
Bree,And how is word going to spread?
Bree,And she'll be twice as mad at having been put in that position. I am not telling her tonight.
Bree,"No, you will not. I forbid it."
Bree,"Look, if we can't agree on something this basic, maybe we shouldn't work together."
Bree,"I'm saying, maybe you should reconsider joining the company."
Bree,Fine. You're fired.
Bree,"Orson, stop throwing jail in my face. You cellmate was a crooked C.P.A., who helped you form a bridge club. It wasn't exactly Attica."
Bree,"Orson, I should have never offered you that job. It wasn't fair to Katherine."
Bree,"Orson, please. You're putting me in an impossible position."
Bree,I hope you didn't mean what you said earlier. You just don't understand what I owe to Katherine.
Bree,"You know that--brunch we had for you right before you left for prison? I was very tense, and I was very unhappy. So I had--a glass of champagne."
Bree,You work here?
Bree,I don't recall ever hearing that name before.
Bree,80?!
Bree,"Orson! You are amazing! One week on the job, and he's already bringing in huge accounts."
Bree,"Oh. Well, it looks like we're all set until the morning then. Hey, why don't you, uh, take the afternoon off?"
Bree,"I don't know--read, relax, give yourself a pedicure."
Bree,What are you doing?
Bree,"No, it doesn't. And besides, I gave you the day off. Now go home."
Bree,Maryland?
Bree,You can't just up and move. You have a life here.
Bree,"Katherine, you are a vibrant, attractive woman. You--"
Bree,"When you're done with that, the oven could use a really good scrubbing."
Bree,Come in.
Bree,"Oh! Yes, of course. Uh, I'm his wife Bree. I'm afraid he's out running errands, but he's told me all about you."
Bree,Yes. He said you were roommates back in college.
Bree,Have a seat.
Bree,"What a thoughtful son you are. So, uh, have you given any thought to the venue?"
Bree,"My, that's a nice little terrace. We, we will throw you a party so special that you'll want us to cater your anniversary, too."
Bree,"Well, let's talk about food. With a new client, what I usually do is discuss possible menus, and then I have my very best chef prepare a sample dinner."
Bree,But this is Orson's college roommate. And--he's quite the catch!
Bree,"Well, that's what's so great about it. Technically, it's a business dinner. It has all the potential upside of a date while still being tax-deductible."
Bree,He came while Orson was out. I let him record a message on my phone.
Bree,"Oh, that's nice. Hey, was there a blue convertible parked in front of Katherine's?"
Bree,"My god, he's still there."
Bree,"Well, Katherine's been lonely, so I set her up with a client, and he's been there for over four hours, so you know it's going well!"
Bree,"Mmm. Ohh. Mwah. Well, you deserve some credit, too. I mean, you brought us Peter's business."
Bree,Yes.
Bree,Is that bad?
Bree,Is he gay? Ugh! I knew he had too much product in his hair.
Bree,"Well, where did you meet?"
Bree,"Peter's a felon? But he's so refined, so handsome."
Bree,"My god, Orson. What kind of criminal is he? A killer or a rapist?"
Bree,What?!
Bree,Are you telling me that I set Katherine up with a convicted graverobber?!
Bree,That is not funny! I have to go warn Katherine.
Bree,"Katherine, hi! Is everything all right over there?"
Bree,Then why are you whispering?
Bree,"Oh, my god. You slept with him?"
Bree,"Oh, I just really wish you'd taken things more slowly."
Bree,"No, I'm not."
Bree,"Well, if he tries, just promise you'll call."
Bree,"A Cosmopolitan. That's your favorite, isn't it?"
Bree,You will.
Bree,"Oh, I am so, so sorry."
Bree,You can't just move because of one bad date.
Bree,"And I'm not family? Katherine, all my life, I wanted a sister. And now I feel like I finally have one."
Bree,"Well, what could be more sisterly than that? I know I'm not the most--demonstrative--person, but I care about you deeply, and if you were to just walk out of my life, I would be very--very unhappy."
Bree,"Good. Well, now that that's settled--Let's make some pies."
Bree,No.
Bree,"You are a vibrant, attractive woman, you--"
Bree,Sit.
Bree,You don't feel you've been underpaid?
Bree,"Charlie, we wouldn't accuse you unless we had concrete evidence, and thanks to my diligent partner here, we do."
Bree,"You're more than ""like"" fired. You're fired. And, of course, we want our money back."
Bree,"Well, then I suggest you return your purchase. Do you have a receipt?"
Bree,Can you believe it? A thief and a pothead!
Bree,"Me, too. You go first."
Bree,"Oh. Well, are you sure she's trustworthy?"
Bree,"Well done, Orson!"
Bree,"Oh. ""The New Christian Reader"" just published an advance review of my cookbook. Listen! ""Mrs. Van de Kamp's colorful stories of her upbringing show her upstanding values, but her recipes are sinfully delicious."" They gave me four halos!"
Bree,"I have to admit, I had some reservations about us working together, but this has succeeded beyond my wildest dreams."
Bree,"Yeah, and the best part is we get to see each other all the time."
Bree,Orson! You can't be serious! Here?
Bree,"Ooh! Oh, this counter's hard on my head."
Bree,No. Get me an oven mitt.
Bree,"Oh, much better."
Bree,"I don't see why not. I mean, everything's, uh, pretty much done here. You can go now if you like."
Bree,That does it. We're pressing charges.
Bree,What?
Bree,How could this be happening?
Bree,"Before anything got serious, I made a point of turning the camera off."
Bree,I didn't see you do that.
Bree,"Obviously, you turned it back on."
Bree,"We need to, um, get that tape back."
Bree,"$2,000?!"
Bree,"Okay, this is not a joke. My book comes out next month--My old-fashioned, traditional cookbook! This could ruin me!"
Bree,"No! I-I refuse to pay blackmail to some hooligan who's stolen from us twice! Andrew--All my life, I have done my best to teach you to respect God and the law and never to harm another living thing. I want you to forget every one of those lessons if it'll help you get that tape back."
Bree,"Orson, don't cramp the boy's style."
Bree,Ha. You got the tape!
Bree,"Orson, we don't need to know."
Bree,"Oh, my."
Bree,Why? I'm embarrassed enough as it is.
Bree,You watched it?!
Bree,"Oh, dear god. I can't look. Really, Andrew."
Bree,"What? Well, who is it then?"
Bree,Katherine!
Bree,"Hello, Katherine. Um, I thought you might want this videota--from our surveillance camera."
Bree,"Yes, in the, uh, test kitchen."
Bree,"Mike. Yes, indeedy."
Bree,Let's not dwell on it.
Bree,I said..let's not dwell on it.
Bree,"Katherine, I'm sorry, but I just have to ask--Are you sure you know what you're doing?"
Bree,Meaning Susan is your oldest friend on this street.
Bree,"Because she's your friend, and we're women. We don't do that to each other."
Bree,Is that what I saw on the tape-- a relationship?
Bree,"Fair enough. But just be careful, I mean, this is very complicated. I'd hate to see it end badly."
Bree,"All right, then, we'll see you soon."
Bree,The reporter's almost here. I am so nervous.
Bree,"That was all local. This is ""The New York Dispatch."" If this goes well, my cookbook could be on the front page of their weekend style section. Katherine, what did you do to your hair? I've never seen it look so thick and lustrous."
Bree,Good. I can check that off my list.
Bree,"Any minute. Oh, my gosh, Andrew. Don't you look sharp today?"
Bree,Check and check.
Bree,"Only that her name is Sandra Birch. We just spoke, and she seemed very nice."
Bree,"""A deeper look suggests something darker, something more ominous, a woman whose perky surface conceals a deep, almost demonic thirst for power.��_��_"
Bree,You must be Sandra. What a sharp outfit. And look at that hair--so thick and lustrous.
Bree,"And this is my own little kitchen. I'm pretty sure my husband's here somewhere. Orson, dear, are you decent?"
Bree,Why would I pay someone to do work that gives me such joy? Now who wants a little snack?
Bree,You say that like it's a bad thing. I think that decade had a lot to recommend it.
Bree,"Of course they can. If they read my book, that is. Okay, truth be told--I'm far from perfect. Only yesterday, I burned a whole tray of biscotti."
Bree,"Andrew, please. The machine can get it. We never answer the phone while entertaining. So rude to one's guests."
Bree,"Now, um, may I pour you some more tea?"
Bree,Why were you talking to that woman?
Bree,What kind of rumors?
Bree,I cannot let this happen. I have to find her.
Bree,Why?
Bree,"Oh, dear god. This woman is determined to make my life sound ten times worse than it actually is."
Bree,Thank you.
Bree,"Spare me your ""darling,"" Sandra. I know you've been trying to dig up dirt on me."
Bree,"I wrote a cookbook, Sandra-- meatloaf, pot pies, peach cobbler. Why are you trying to crucify me?"
Bree,"But it isn't, Sandra, because I don't think I'm great. I have fallen down more times than I can count, just like so many other housewives out there, we're all just barely holding on, and we all think that we're alone. So maybe you're right. Maybe it isn't a cookbook. It's a lifeline from me to those other women, because I want them to know there's always a chance to get something right. Even if it's just a casserole."
Bree,"Hello, Dr. Cominis. How's my husband doing?"
Bree,Wonderful. The house was too quiet without him.
Bree,"Oh, that's all right. I can wait. Mmm, he looks so peaceful."
Bree,Goodness.
Bree,"Occasionally, but never quite this--"
Bree,Robustly.
Bree,"Well, if it's so simple, what are we waiting for?"
Bree,At least the house won't be quiet anymore.
Bree,"Yes, it is. Sit down. We need to talk."
Bree,"Orson, dear, because of the way your nose was broken during the fire, you now snore."
Bree,Good point. Snoring is too mild a word for what you're doing. Imagine a terrified elephant summoning his herd.
Bree,Not exactly true. The doctor said there's a very simple procedure--
Bree,Very routine and--and practically outpatient.
Bree,You don't have an uncle!
Bree,"This is absolutely necessary. I am going through a very stressful time. I have interviews, that cooking demonstration at the mall. If I don't get my rest, it could affect the launch of my book."
Bree,"Orson, if we can't share a bed, it's going to hurt the intimacy of our marriage."
Bree,"Oh, Orson, I can't help but take issue with your sarcastic tone."
Bree,"Oh, god, Susan. Can't this wait till after my nap?"
Bree,I didn't think it was my place. I thought Katherine should tell you.
Bree,I'm sorry.
Bree,"You want honesty? Fine. You didn't want to divorce Mike. You hit a really bad patch after the accident, but you never stopped loving him. And why would you? Your relationship didn't have a natural end. So face it. You're not mad at me or Mike or Katherine. You're mad at yourself for letting your marriage falls apart."
Bree,"Either tell Mike how you feel or move on, Because that's what he's trying to do, and it's not fair to stop him. You need to make a decision, Susan. And I need to get back to my nap."
Bree,No.
Bree,And how exactly are you gonna stop snoring?
Bree,That doesn't sound right.
Bree,Whatever.
Bree,"All right, but I think I'll be too tired to finish it. That pill I took really kicked in fast."
Bree,When you were downstairs.
Bree,Since when have you become such an expert on chamomile?
Bree,Fine. I just know I need my sleep tonight.
Bree,9:15? Huh? 9:15. I'm supposed to be at the mall. Did I forget to set the alarm?
Bree,I'm so thirsty.
Bree,That's all right. I'll just drink this tea.
Bree,What?
Bree,"Enough coffee. It's not working, anyway. It must be decaf."
Bree,I just don't understand why I feel so loopy.
Bree,"Of course I can. You are such a nervous Nellie, Rex."
Bree,Thank you for having me to your lovely home.
Bree,"Yes, my book is about food and families and how food brings families together when they make food. It's mothers teaching daughters how to cook. So I'm gonna cook pancakes with my daughter, only she's not here because she grew up and stole my baby. So--who wants to be my daughter?"
Bree,"Well, my husband has agreed to the procedure you suggested."
Bree,"Yes, that's the one. So anytime you wanna get in there and start hacking away, he's ready for you. Aren't you, love?"
Bree,"Well, Fridays are when Orson plays golf. So Friday's perfect. Right, Orson?"
Bree,"Oh, he's not apprehensive. He's terrified. And I don't care, because he owes me one--a big one. Don't you, darling?"
Bree,"Are you married, Dr. Cominis?"
Bree,"Well, over time, you'll learn that there's a balance of power in relationships, and if your beloved ever pulls a nasty trick on you, like say, drugging you into a stupor, then the balance of power shifts to you, and then you can demand they prove their love by, say, undergoing surgery. Do you understand?"
Bree,"You will. Come along, Orson."
Bree,My husband has agreed to the procedure you suggested.
Bree,"Oh, we feel the same way about you. You've been lovely."
Bree,Leaving the man a thank-you card.
Bree,He helped you through a very difficult time. The least we can do is let him know how much we appreciate--What the hell is this?
Bree,You're living with the man? Since when?
Bree,"Why the secrecy? Did you think I'd disapprove? The man's a doctor, for heaven sakes. You've done better than I did."
Bree,I'm just trying to understand how my son could keep a secret like this from his own mother.
Bree,Of course I have.
Bree,Well--
Bree,"Well, I want to know now, so that's why I'm having you and Alex over to dinner tomorrow night."
Bree,"Yes. If he's a part of your life, I want to get to know him. I think I'll serve fish."
Bree,Nice try. Tell Alex we dress for dinner.
Bree,"Andrew, you can't criticize my parenting and then deny me the chance to make up for it. Orson and I will expect you at 8:00."
Bree,"Oh, for god sakes, Orson. Let it go."
Bree,"Gaby, you never sell a man's autographed baseball."
Bree,"All right then, Alex. Oh, look at you two, sitting so far apart. Scootch over."
Bree,"Well, I just want you to know, if you need to scootch, Alex, I am okay with scootching and--the rest of it."
Bree,"Well, I just want you boys to know that I am comfortable with your lifestyle. Now who would like a strawberry daiquiri?"
Bree,"Well, Orson and I thought it would be nice to share this special occasion with some dear friends."
Bree,"Bob Hunter, Lee Mcdermott, I would like you to meet Andrew's new life partner, Dr. Alex Cominis."
Bree,He's a plastic surgeon.
Bree,I hear the gym is a popular meeting place.
Bree,You are so sweet.
Bree,Say anything about what?
Bree,"Oh, my goodness, are you two--"
Bree,I am gonna handle everything for this wedding.
Bree,"Well, if you'll excuse me, I am going to go get a pie that you are going to love. And you two are going to help me."
Bree,"All right, you two, what is going on?"
Bree,Don't give me that. You've been whispering to each other all night. You obviously know Alex. How?
Bree,"The man is going to marry my son. If there is something about him I should know, I want to hear it now, please."
Bree,"By ""adult,"" you mean complex and sophisticated?"
Bree,What?
Bree,"No, no, no. This can't possibly be true. The man is a doctor. Are you sure?"
Bree,Hey there. Do you have a second?
Bree,A video store I will never return to. Are you aware that one of the stars of this film is--
Bree,You do?
Bree,Why would he--
Bree,And you're okay with this?
Bree,So--he's the one?
Bree,"You're going to marry him. I thought he wasn't being honest with you. I wanted to protect you, so I��_��_��_"
Bree,Yes.
Bree,"Yes. Which reminds me, that needs to be back by 3:00.Could you?"
Bree,Just take it back.
Bree,"Oh, my goodness. Are you two--"
Bree,It's a pleasure to meet you.
Bree,"Oh, Alex mentioned that you were laid off from your job. I'm so sorry."
Bree,Really? They say that?
Bree,Thank you again for making the long drive down from Oakdale. It's high time our families got together.
Bree,What?
Bree,"Wait, wait, wait. This is not how we decide family get-togethers."
Bree,I'm a caterer. I oversee events on Thanksgiving. It's the one holiday that I don't need.
Bree,Stop that! You can't call all the major holidays.
Bree,I am not bidding on time with my son.
Bree,"Melina, this is childish!"
Bree,Fine! I call Easter.
Bree,"Look, I know it's very difficult for two families to negotiate the holidays, but I feel strongly that this is not the best way to handle it, and I'm sure that the boys would agree with me."
Bree,"Oh, Andrew thought it would be nice to have a formal dinner tomorrow night."
Bree,"For Melina? She'd probably blow her nose on it. No, I will not let that woman defile nana's lace."
Bree,"Well, at least Gloria had the good taste to have a paralyzing stroke so we don't have to deal with her."
Bree,I don't know if I have it in me. She's such a troglodyte.
Bree,"Mmm. You're sweet. Oh, all right. Get the lace tablecloth. I will pretend to like this woman. Just like I pretended to like nana."
Bree,Ah! Here you are.
Bree,"You know, we actually have some very comfortable patio furniture in the backyard--along with a place to put your recyclables."
Bree,Hi! What have you two been up to?
Bree,Did Edie show you the Adams house?
Bree,I'm sure they could. It's too bad your practice is all the way down here.
Bree,"Who, undoubtedly, already have doctors, just like your patients in fairview have you."
Bree,What are you doing?
Bree,"Uh, no help needed. Certainly nothing that would require your thumb."
Bree,"Actually, you're right on time. We're just about to eat. Shall we?"
Bree,"Hmm. Excuse--excuse me, Melina. That's my chair."
Bree,"Well, did it occur to you I might want to sit next to the boys?"
Bree,Guess who just called the burnt lamb chop?
Bree,"Uh, thinking about it. They're thinking about moving to Oakdale."
Bree,Yes. A good opportunity for Andrew to commute five hours to his job.
Bree,You're gonna have kids?
Bree,I bought you the Adams house!
Bree,"It was going to be a surprise, you know, for your wedding. Unfortunately, this whole silly Oakdale thing has forced me to show my hand."
Bree,"Oh, it's nothing you wouldn't do."
Bree,"Oh, and I love you, too. Orson, dear, would you pour Melina another glass of wine?"
Bree,You know it.
Bree,"Well, maybe they were only together a short time, and she didn't mean anything to him."
Bree,Yeah! Let's do that.
Bree,"Oh, don't worry about us. Jackson is so great. You are making the right choice."
Bree,"Of course this will require an updated irrigation system, which I'm happy to take care of."
Bree,Nonsense! It's a small price to pay to make your home more beautiful. I insist.
Bree,"Orson, take it easy!"
Bree,You think you're excited? Just imagine the salesman who overcharged you.
Bree,"He only thinks he got a good deal because the salesman threw in one of those ""kiss the cook"" hats."
Bree,Don't encourage him! Orson is a horrible negotiator. He's never met a sticker price he didn't like.
Bree,It's true. There's a reason the local car dealers send you a fruit basket every Christmas. Wow hush.
Bree,Do--do what?
Bree,"What exactly are you saying, Alex?"
Bree,"Well, we've got 15 minutes till the news is on. Why not? I still can't get over the way Alex behaved this morning. ""Emasculating."" I' never heard such nonsense. Don't you think so?"
Bree,But?
Bree,"""Tough""? That's not a word I would use to describe myself."
Bree,I don't think I do that.
Bree,"Hi, Mike."
Bree,Where's Katherine?
Bree,"Uh, yeah. In the test kitchen."
Bree,And bring some steak sauce.
Bree,Bring it.
Bree,"Oh, I really couldn't say."
Bree,No. I wouldn't want to upset anyone.
Bree,"Well, it's just that grilling is such a manly pastime. If I suggested that Orson somehow failed to produce the perfect steak, you might see it as another example emasculation."
Bree,"Well, for all I know, telling Orson his steak tastes like charcoal might be deballing him."
Bree,"You know what else would be nice, Alex? Showing gratitude when people have been generous with you."
Bree,I mean I bought you a house. You'd think you'd show me a little respect.
Bree,"Well, why not? It was a fairly grand gesture on my part."
Bree,"If by ""strings,"" you mean I won't let you be rude to me in my own house, then yes."
Bree,Orson burnt the steaks.
Bree,"Oh, good. You're back. Can we talk?"
Bree,"Fine. Then as my employee, I authorize a 5-minute break so we can talk about my son's boyfriend and his absurd overreaction this afternoon."
Bree,"Andrew, please. You were there. Alex started the whole thing. You need to tell him to stop criticizing me."
Bree,I tried. He won't listen to me.
Bree,"This won't take long. I don't want to fight anymore. Please, just take the house."
Bree,"Alex-- I'm gonna tell you something I haven't told anybody-- not Orson, not Andrew, just you. I know that I've changed since my business took off, but I didn't want to admit it. I've watched myself become selfish, impatient, rude. I was never the type to suffer fools gladly, but now I seem to find fools everywhere. And I don't want to be that way. I need someone who isn't afraid to speak out, to call me out when I cross those lines, and I would love it if you would be that person."
Bree,"Yes, I did."
Bree,We're ready! Come on.
Bree,"Oh, I think it's Saturday."
Bree,"I don't know. What do you think, Gaby? Gaby?"
Bree,"What does that mean, ""an entrance""?"
Bree,"No, we don't."
Bree,"And then there's church, of course."
Bree,Now that's how you make an entrance.
Bree,Gaby?
Bree,I'd be happy to. Any special requests?
Bree,"Great. Gaby, do you have your copy?"
Bree,You use my cookbook to balance your table?
Bree,I'm sorry if the frittata is a bit dry.
Bree,"Mine is so erratic. I'm not even sure what the real temperature is. Of course, if a certain doctor would loosen the purse strings--"
Bree,"If you would just take on a few more patients, we could afford it."
Bree,Such as?
Bree,I have a job. I'm a homemaker.
Bree,"And I think you would appreciate my value more if, for once, you had to cook your own food and wash your own clothes."
Bree,"I want a new stove, Rex, and if I need to get a job to pay for it, so be it."
Bree,"Oh, we're having leftovers. You can heat them up yourself if you want."
Bree,"Since I started writing my own cookbook. Remember how you told me I should start making my own money? Well, I've been going through all my old recipes, and I've got this great idea for a real home-style American cookbook."
Bree,Why wouldn't I be? People are always complimenting me on my cooking.
Bree,You think I'm just like every other housewife?
Bree,I'll learn. And I want it to be more than just a cookbook. I want to talk about traditional values and give helpful hints about homemaking.
Bree,"Thanks, Eli."
Bree,You were there?
Bree,"You mean, with my life? I don't know."
Bree,"I can't believe you saved this. Of course, I'm not really in the mood to write a cookbook right now."
Bree,"Thanks, but I know exactly what I'm gonna make."
Bree,That was a lovely service.
Bree,Wait. I wanted to fix something for Eli for a change.
Bree,Here's my cookbook.
Bree,I don't think I do that.
Bree,"Hello, ladies. What do you think?"
Bree,"My book just made the ""Times'"" best seller list. Now they're talking 3-book deal, so I got the urge to splurge. And look what just blew on my windshield at the stop sign! Life is good."
Bree,So how do you like my new car?
Bree,"Look, there's even a refrigerator. The Lexus dealer said there's just enough room for a split of champagne and two chilled glasses. And the best thing is, it's a hybrid so you can barely hear it. Let me show you."
Bree,"Was it just me, or was that a little abrupt?"
Bree,"Oh, dear. Is something wrong?"
Bree,"And here I am, rubbing my fabulous new car in her face. I feel awful."
Bree,Thank god I didn't show her how the car parks itself.
Bree,"Well, it is pretty amazing!"
Bree,A check. I understand you and Tom are going through some rough times.
Bree,"We just went to a second printing, and now they're talking a 3-book deal. So seriously, I am not gonna miss that money."
Bree,Why not? What's the point of success if you can't share it with the people you love?
Bree,"Then it's not a loan, it's a gift. Don't you have a birthday coming up?"
Bree,"Come on, Lynette. You can't tell me this money won't take the pressure off."
Bree,Okay.
Bree,What?
Bree,"Well, that's an intriguing offer."
Bree,We most certainly do--partner.
Bree,"Lynette, hi. Oh, I wish I had time for a chat, but I'm on my way to a meeting. I might design my own line of bakeware. Can you imagine?"
Bree,Okay.
Bree,"Oh, that sounds lovely."
Bree,"Oh, that sounds nice. Can we walk and talk?"
Bree,You know what might be even better? My publisher has been begging me to do a local launch for my book.
Bree,"Oh, you can just put that on a hanger in the back. What I want is to make this an opportunity for you. We can turn one of your dismal Thursday night seatings into a real event."
Bree,"Well, don't thank me. It was your idea."
Bree,"Well, technically, I'm she, but yes."
Bree,Certainly.
Bree,My food? What are you talking about?
Bree,They are?
Bree,"Well, you might have to. Excuse me."
Bree,Lynette. I understand you and your fellow chefs will be serving my four cheese pizza tonight.
Bree,But that's commercial parmesan.
Bree,So that's like the dust they sweep off the floor of a place that makes real cheese.
Bree,"Oh, perhaps you do, but my recipe specifies fresh grated."
Bree,"Uh, take your time. I'm sorry. We haven't been introduced. I'm Bree Hodge, part owner."
Bree,We'll chat later. Roll out some dough and show me where the basil is. We'll be serving three cheese pizza tonight.
Bree,"If this doesn't stop your mother-in-law from criticizing your cooking, I will give you a full refund."
Bree,Now? People are waiting.
Bree,Excuse me.
Bree,"Oh, dear. I was hoping to spare your feelings, but since you know, I wasn't comfortable having my recipe made with substandard ingredients."
Bree,"Hey, you made me partner. I can change 15%, and I chose the parmesan. And I don't know if you've heard, but people are raving about my pizza."
Bree,"Fine. I'll reimburse you, if that'll make things right."
Bree,What's that supposed to mean?
Bree,Caught a couple of breaks? I've worked my ass off to get where I am.
Bree,"Well, I've always believed that we create our own luck."
Bree,"Well, not completely, but let's face it. You do cut corners. I mean, one of the things I can teach you is the importance of the attention to detail."
Bree,"Well, I'm not the one who needed $20,000 to keep my business afloat."
Bree,Where are you going?
Bree,"Lynette, I-I-I don't understand why you're so upset."
Bree,My car!
Bree,What's that?
Bree,"Oh, Lynette, don't be silly. It's just the bumper. You don't need to do that."
Bree,"Lynette, stop. Wait. Please. Don't be this way. I don't want money to get in the way of our friendship."
Bree,Thank you for having us over. We are so honored to be the first guests in your new home.
Bree,"I knew. I just thought if they'd tasted mine, they might change the rules."
Bree,This is a delicious snack. Did you make this?
Bree,A tiny salary bump.
Bree,"Oh, look! There's pretzels and cereal. I can see why they call it ""party mix."" It's like a party in a bowl."
Bree,He's exaggerating. They're children. It just looks like a lot of money to them.
Bree,"Well, the chamber of commerce just called. They've added 40 people to their guest list."
Bree,"Oh, thank god."
Bree,I like the way you think. What would we do without him?
Bree,I'm not discussing Andrew's salary with you. It's none of your business.
Bree,Andrew moved into a new home. I simply gave him a cost of living increase.
Bree,"Honey, please don't do this."
Bree,"Orson, drop it. I am not telling you how much Andrew makes."
Bree,What's that?
Bree,"Orson, I'm preparing a buffet for 200. I don't have time to explore my hypothetical career in the adult film industry."
Bree,Coco Saugatuck. Happy now?
Bree,Of course it could just as easily be Munchy Cedarhurst.
Bree,Or Taffy Swallow. We moved around a lot and had three dogs.
Bree,"Well, I didn't really have a favorite. I loved them all equally."
Bree,"Orson, why are you being so morbid?"
Bree,"Okay, fine. If I had to pick a favorite, I guess it would be Munchy. She was a bit rambunctious. Father sent her to a farm so she'd have room to run. I cried for weeks and weeks."
Bree,Who told you that?
Bree,"That's why you wanted to know the names of my pets? Orson Hodge, you are shameful."
Bree,Andrew has been with me since I launched the company. He runs every aspect of the business. He deserves what he's making.
Bree,"Yes, Orson, we're all aware of how you got the job."
Bree,"No, you were a dentist. Now you're a caterer, and you're paid fairly based on your expertise and contribution."
Bree,"No, I'm just saying you're worth--less. I'm sorry, honey. I'm just being honest."
Bree,You're paid based on your contribution.
Bree,"No, I'm just saying you're worth--less."
Bree,"You know, Katherine, if you need any help, I would be happy to make my fam--"
Bree,And admirable.
Bree,"My, what an interesting coat hanger. It's shaped like a sofa. Please put it in the closet."
Bree,Orson? Why do you have a salt shaker from Scavo's pizzeria?
Bree,"Well, take it back now. They're liquidating, and they're gonna need every penny they can get."
Bree,No.
Bree,Really?
Bree,Tom has a lot on his mind. I'm sure he didn't mean it.
Bree,Don't be ridiculous. Tom's rudeness does not give you license to steal. Return it immediately.
Bree,I'm sorry you have to go through this. It must be so hard.
Bree,"Now that you brought it up, Lynette, I've been feeling just awful about the way I took over your restaurant and insulted you and--what can I say?"
Bree,How's Tom holding up?
Bree,Isn't it noon?
Bree,"Maybe I can help. My publisher is thinking about doing his advertising in-house, and he's been looking for someone."
Bree,Yeah.
Bree,"I tell you what. I will invite Bruce over for dinner, you and Tom can join us, and we'll turn it into a low pressure job interview."
Bree,Great. I'll call Bruce this afternoon.
Bree,"Well, look who's here. Somebody owes me $20."
Bree,"You know, there could be a perfectly innocent explanation."
Bree,See a perfectly innocent--bald-faced lie.
Bree,I hope you enjoyed that.
Bree,Bruce. Hello. Come on in. Thank you so much for joining us tonight. May I take your coat?
Bree,It's Orson.
Bree,"Oh, that's them. Wait till you meet Tom. You'll be so glad you had that tape recorder. He's just bursting with ideas."
Bree,"Lynette, Tom, hi. I'd like you to meet my publisher, Bruce."
Bree,"Well, I just wanted to get you together with tom here. I thought you two might hit it off."
Bree,"I'm going to put some coffee on. Orson, would you give me a hand? Let these three chat."
Bree,"Well, we're on pins and needles. How's it going?"
Bree,Maybe we should slice the tart in here. I don't want to bring a large knife in this.
Bree,This is not what I had in mind.
Bree,"Now, now. He's been very good to me."
Bree,Would anyone care for something sweet?
Bree,But what about the job?
Bree,I'll get your coat.
Bree,"Uh, Bruce, why don't I wrap up a piece of that tart to go?"
Bree,Give it.
Bree,Bruce's tape recorder.
Bree,You took it. I saw you.
Bree,What do you call this?
Bree,We will talk about this later.
Bree,Look what got brought in with the dirty napkins.
Bree,Do you know how embarrassed I would have bee if Bruce had seen you take it?
Bree,"So say something. Stand up to him. But stealing? Honestly, Orson, why would you do something like that?"
Bree,And you hope to earn it back through larceny?
Bree,"I don't need to walk in your shoes, Orson. What you did was embarrassing and childish, and it's never gonna happen again. Understood?"
Bree,Who are we dishing? I do hope it's not me.
Bree,"Oh, dear. What happened?"
Bree,"Yes, I, uh-- remember that."
Bree,I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere. Well--I'm off.
Bree,"Andrew, cancel my lunch. No, everything's fine. Your stepfather's just misplaced a few things, and I need to find them."
Bree,How about a confession? Sit down. Start talking.
Bree,"I want you to explain to me why this insanity is still going on. When you stole that tape recorder, you said it was a onetime thing, an impulsive act of revenge."
Bree,A thrill? Stealing a ceramic duck gives you a thrill?
Bree,"Well, maybe you'd feel more comfortable talking to a professional."
Bree,"You will do no such thing. From this moment on, you are forbidden from entering any of our friends' homes."
Bree,I'll take care of it.
Bree,"Ah, you're a lifesaver!"
Bree,"Yes, that would be lovely."
Bree,Close enough.
Bree,"Oh, that's all right. I'll just go to the store."
Bree,"I don't know, but it's awfully cute."
Bree,"Why are you, uh, calling Juanita?"
Bree,That's not yours?
Bree,"Uh, I don't know. But, you know, there it is."
Bree,"Gaby! Aren't you being a little harsh? I mean, perhaps she didn't take it."
Bree,"Juanita! Whenever my children stole, I sent them to bed without any supper. Just a thought."
Bree,Orson? Orson! Orson! Orson! Orson! No!
Bree,What were you doing at Bob and Lee's?
Bree,"After I told you to stay out of the neighbors' houses? You stole again, didn't you?"
Bree,What are you hiding behind your back?
Bree,"You're telling me you own a mug with a picture of Bernadette Peters in ""Gypsy""?"
Bree,"I had hoped that this compulsion to steal was something we could solve privately, but Orson seems unable��_��_��_or unwilling-- to control himself."
Bree,"You'll see when he leaves, and your lamp is missing."
Bree,"This isn't my problem, Dr. Bernstein. He's the sick one. Fix him."
Bree,"Well, maybe you'll feel comfortable talking to a professional."
Bree,"I'm sorry, but this is unacceptable. Do you at least know why he steals? If there were some sordid childhood trauma we could blame it on, it would really help me out with the neighbors."
Bree,"Really? And--and yet he keeps charging me. So, doctor, what's this ""revelation"" that you've been keeping from me for $200 an hour?"
Bree,Why would you want to hurt me?
Bree,Would you excuse us for moment? This just became a private conversation.
Bree,You wanna help? Why don't you go down to the pharmacy in the lobby and buy some aspirin? I'm gonna need it. I don't deserve this. I have been nothing but supportive of you since you got out of jail. I even gave you a job.
Bree,"So you decided to punish me by resorting to petty theft? For God sakes, Orson, I'm your wife."
Bree,That's not true!
Bree,All the while thinking I had your support.
Bree,"Yes, am I speaking to Mr. Dinsmore? Ah, this is Bree Van de Kamp. Yes, it's nice to talk to you, too. Well, as I'm sure you're aware, your company has made several offers to purchase mine. Yes, I know I said I wasn't interested, but some things have happened in my personal life and I think I'm ready to--finally make a deal. Really? Well, that's wonderful. Why don't you, uh, come to my office tomorrow and we'll talk? Good-bye, Mr. Dinsmore."
Bree,"Oh, Andrew. I didn't hear you come in."
Bree,"Thank you, dear."
Bree,"That's sweet, but I've decided to focus on other pursuits at the moment."
Bree,"Oh, shoot. I left them upstairs."
Bree,Andrew.
Bree,It was my idea. My work has been compromising my marriage. I didn't realize the toll it's been taking on Orson.
Bree,"Andrew, do you know why my book sold so well? Because it was authentic. I actually believe in the old-fashioned values I wrote about. I believe in men opening doors for ladies and children respecting their elders. I also believe that sometimes women need to make sacrifices for their husbands. I would be the worst kind of hypocrite if I preached these values and then didn't follow them myself."
Bree,"Mr. Dinsmore, would you mind if I speak to my husband for a moment?"
Bree,This is happening so fast.
Bree,"Well, I have a new idea. I'd like to wait."
Bree,"Just give me one year. That's not asking too much, is it?"
Bree,"Orson, think about how I built this company from nothing, how it brings me joy and pride and a sense of accomplishment. Is that really something you want me to give up?"
Bree,"Actually, no. I'm not selling."
Bree,Tell your wife I will be doing that second book after all.
Bree,"Steal what you must, my love. But it won't be my company."
Bree,"Orson, please come upstairs. I know what that couch does to your back."
Bree,"Know you're disappointed right now, but you have to know, I really do want to find some way for you to be happy."
Bree,So you've said.
Bree,"Well, I'm all for saying a few nice things--But you were never really friends. You and Edie clashed right from the start."
Bree,"Uh, Gaby, before we learn what Edie tastes like--"
Bree,I think a little more reverence for the dead is in order.
Bree,Wow. It sounds like she gave you just what you needed. Good for Edie.
Bree,Nice try.
Bree,"You know, Edie used to live around here when she moved away from Wisteria Lane."
Bree,"Um, I ran into her once, unexpectedly--in a place I never thought I'd be."
Bree,Is that the visitors' room?
Bree,"You don't happen to have a private room, do you?"
Bree,That would be lovely. Oh. You were being sarcastic.
Bree,"Oh, not, uh, just yet. It's not a bad idea, having an upgrade available. I bet that's a perk people would be willing to pay for."
Bree,"To be honest, I-I'm not feeling up to this. I'm gonna have to come back another day.Female guard: Fine. He's got another visitor scheduled anyway, so I don't even have to tell him you were here."
Bree,Another visitor? Who?
Bree,Every week? What's her name?
Bree,"If she's visiting my husband, I think I have a right to know"
Bree,Really? Because I would consider that a perk worth paying for.
Bree,I wanted to see you.
Bree,It isn't that kind of visit.
Bree,"I stopped by the prison today. The guard tells me you've been visiting Orson--Sometimes twice a week, she said."
Bree,"What are you up to, Edie?"
Bree,So you're not--trying to start up something?
Bree,Thank you for--checking in on him and for answering my question.
Bree,"Oh, well, my schedule is just unreal, what with the catering company and looking after Benjamin."
Bree,"That jail is--it's disgusting. All those men in cages, like animals. Even to step foot in that place is humiliating."
Bree,I do.
Bree,So--how are you doing?
Bree,You're right. I shouldn't have asked. I know it's horrible here.
Bree,You have every right to hate me.
Bree,"I meant for asking you to come here, for insisting you turn yourself in. Oh. Now that I see this place, I don't know what I were thinking."
Bree,I never told you about that because--I was embarrassed.
Bree,"My theory--Edie knew if she was buried, her true date of birth would be carved into a tombstone for all the world to see."
Bree,I think we're here.
Bree,I don't know. Can you ever be ready to tell a boy that his mother is dead?
Bree,We brought you some muffins. You can share them with your roommates or maybe a favorite teacher.
Bree,"A couple of days ago. We've been trying to get in touch with your dad, but he's still out of the country."
Bree,"If you'd like, we could give you a moment."
Bree,"Still, she was your mother."
Bree,We felt we owed it to your mom.
Bree,"Lord, Lynette. You nearly gave me a heart attack."
Bree,"Lynette, thank you again for driving."
Bree,Do we really need to do this tonight? They're ashes. It's not like they're gonna go bad.
Bree,"This was a wonderful idea, Karen."
Bree,Shouldn't we say something first?
Bree,I don't know. A few words describing how we felt about her?
Bree,Perceptive.
Bree,Do you at least know why he steals?
Bree,Really? That soon?
Bree,"Honey, I don't mean to be negative. It's just--what's gonna happen? Will you keep stealing and lying to me? I love you, but I just can't put up with that anymore."
Bree,How?
Bree,How can you just decide something like that?
Bree,Do you really mean that?
Bree,"I hope so, because I just cannot take any more lying."
Bree,He sounded very sincere.
Bree,I did not raise you to be bitchy.
Bree,"Well, save it for those karaoke parties at Bob and Lee's. I am not amused."
Bree,"Well, I can understand why you're a bit cynical, but I'm giving him another chance. He's my husband, and I still love him."
Bree,I know.
Bree,"Hello, my love."
Bree,Orson's not exactly the bar-fight type. He's more of a raised voices at-a-cheese-tasting type.
Bree,Great. Be back in a minute.
Bree,Katherine. Hi. What are you doing here?
Bree,"Oh, right. I heard she was here."
Bree,"I'm surprised. I knew she was a bit dotty, but didn't think it was that serious."
Bree,Death?
Bree,"Oh, dear."
Bree,"Well, that's odd."
Bree,A bat?
Bree,So did she get a good look at--death?
Bree,Wonderful.
Bree,"Well, it's wonderful to have you home. How's your head?"
Bree,"Well, that'll teach you to go out walking in the middle of the night. You know, I still don't know why you were out so late."
Bree,Oh. And then you bumped it on that nasty curb.
Bree,"Hmm. And that's all you were doing, just going out for a walk?"
Bree,"Oh, you know, I just remembered some business I have to discuss with Andrew."
Bree,Enjoy your tea.
Bree,Orson's lying to me again. So I think I have to divorce him.
Bree,Orson's lying to me again.
Bree,So I think I have to divorce him.
Bree,"My husband is a decent man, and I want to do right by him."
Bree,"Well, I like to think of myself as a good person."
Bree,Wait. I'm not planning on giving him half. It's my business.
Bree,I-I may have overstated things when I described my husband as a decent man. He actually has a wide variety of psychological problems.
Bree,"I want you to say that for $300 an hour, you have some lawyer tricks up your sleeve to help me protect my business."
Bree,"Well, clearly, I like to think of myself as a rich person even more."
Bree,Split the pot.
Bree,"Well, that's the rule. There's nothing you can do about it. So stop bitching."
Bree,Oh. Who--Who's that?
Bree,"Oh, right. Karl's a divorce lawyer."
Bree,But I thought you just split everything done the middle.
Bree,You don't say.
Bree,We--we should go.
Bree,"No, thanks, I don't drink."
Bree,"I'm bringing you business, Karl. Try not to insult me."
Bree,"Yes, I know that comes as a surprise."
Bree,"Karl, if we move forward, I will insist you handle our divorce with dignity."
Bree,I just want to protect what is rightfully mine. Can you help me?
Bree,Lovely. I'll make out a check.
Bree,"Well, what kind of a favor?"
Bree,So?
Bree,How would I go about doing that?
Bree,"I need your help, Karl. I really do, but I am not comfortable manipulating a 6-year-old."
Bree,Then again--M.J. does--love my macaroons.
Bree,"Well, hello there, M.J. I was baking this morning, and like an idiot, I made too many macaroons. Would you be willing to take one? I would hate to see them go to waste."
Bree,"Oh, really? What a delightful coincidence. You know, I could bake these for you every week, and all I'd need in return is just the tiniest of favors."
Bree,Invite Evan Mayer to your sleepover.
Bree,"Oh, no. Deep down, he's just a fragile little boy who wants to be liked."
Bree,"Now, M.J., we can find faults with all our friends if we nitpick. What do you say? Will you invite him? Would you like some ice cream with your macaroons? Because I could make that happen."
Bree,"M.J., there's someone in my life who hits me with a dead squirrel every single day. And you are the only one who can help me. Please, please invite Evan to your party."
Bree,"Thank you. Oh, thank you, sweetheart."
Bree,"I used to think of myself as a good person. If I had a choice, I would always choose the high road. Lately I've begun to realize that, um--I'm capable of doing whatever needs to be done."
Bree,What are you doing up so late?
Bree,Why not?
Bree,I'm capable of doing whatever needs to be done.
Bree,You want me to rob my own house?
Bree,"Absolutely not. I am all up for a little creative accounting and some secret bank accounts, but hiring some thug to stage a break-in?"
Bree,Wouldn't it be easier to just have him killed?
Bree,I was kidding!
Bree,"Well, I just never know with you. And don't call me ""freckles."""
Bree,"You are repugnant, and this conversation is over."
Bree,What? No!
Bree,Go on.
Bree,We should probably break a window to make it look more real.
Bree,Wipe your feet first. I just had the carpets cleaned. Just because we're thieves doesn't mean we need to be untidy.
Bree,"Uh, yes. As I recall, it's quite valuable."
Bree,"Oh, god, no. That's Orson's dental innovator of the year award. I've always hated that thing. Oh, here."
Bree,"I, uh, took some of my silver off the mantle, and it threw off the balance."
Bree,Was that necessary?
Bree,Fine! But do you have to do it with such relish?
Bree,That is none of your business.
Bree,"I do the bare minimum. No more, no less."
Bree,Must you be so crude?
Bree,"Yes, being a lady takes effort."
Bree,"You wanna be a Neanderthal, Karl? That's your choice. I prefer to behave with class and dignity. Now may we please finish robbing my home?"
Bree,"Oh, thank you."
Bree,"Orson, we've been robbed!"
Bree,"They're robbers, dear. Not personal shoppers."
Bree,"Well, I wonder if the victims of your kleptomania felt the same way."
Bree,What is that?
Bree,Wow.
Bree,Was it Florence?
Bree,"Oh, that's right."
Bree,Like I could finally take it off and be myself.
Bree,I can't believe you went to all that trouble.
Bree,"And I'm thinking I may have acted rashly. I mean, every marriage has its rough patches. Orson loves me, and deep down, he's a good man. If I stick with this, maybe we can make it work. Are you even listening to me?"
Bree,"Oh, really?"
Bree,"So I'm just like everyone else, and you know everything I'm going to say."
Bree,I doubt that.
Bree,In the ballpark.
Bree,"And do you say that to every woman, too?"
Bree,Charming.
Bree,Send me the papers when they're ready.
Bree,"Orson, we've been robbed."
Bree,"See, this is why I wanted to check on my things. You don't leave a valuable painting on the damn floor. You need to put something underneath it."
Bree,That is not a doormat. That is a handwoven Kurdish Kazak rug.
Bree,"Give me that. I'm so glad this divorce is almost over. An obnoxious, unpleasant man will be out of my life, and so will Orson."
Bree,"No, he thinks I filed it."
Bree,"Yes, and I'll be single again, and I can concentrate on my business, maybe do some traveling."
Bree,"Sadly, Karl, I always know what you are saying."
Bree,"Thanks, Karl. I'm not even divorced yet, and once I am, I don't think you'd be my first choice as a matchmaker."
Bree,"Ooh. Lynette, that's bad."
Bree,"No, she has a choice. It's entirely possible to get what you want without being perceived of as a nagging shrew."
Bree,"Well, the key is to not let them know what you're doing. This requires observation, cunning and manipulation."
Bree,So you wait for an opportunity that you can use to your advantage while at the same time appearing supportive.
Bree,"Orson, I'm home."
Bree,I want a divorce.
Bree,"My lawyer says you're entitled to half of everything we've acquired during the marriage, so I was trying to hide some of those things, since--let's face it-- I paid for them."
Bree,"Yes, but I'm tired of all the lying and the sneaking around, so I will inform him you can have whatever you like."
Bree,"Well, that part's non-negotiable."
Bree,"There's no point. So you should get a piece of paper, start to make a list of what it is you wish to take with you."
Bree,No. all I want is out.
Bree,What are you doing?
Bree,"I don't need any help. And besides, my Parisian salad doesn't call for any chives."
Bree,My salad has plenty of bite. So--when are you moving out?
Bree,Excuse me?
Bree,"Orson, I understand this is a shock, but you have to face facts. Our marriage is over."
Bree,"Well, if you're referring to the financial settlement, I already told you, I don't care anymore."
Bree,Jail?
Bree,"Ah, but I never filed insurance crime."
Bree,What?!
Bree,You would actually send your wife to prison?
Bree,That will never happen.
Bree,"Orson, please don't do this. I don't love you."
Bree,"I had to. He found the storage unit. He wanted an explanation. I was in such a state of shock, I couldn't think of anything else to say."
Bree,"You have no idea. Now he's saying if I try to divorce him, he can go to the police and report me."
Bree,"Filing a false insurance claim. He's the one who filed it, but he's gonna say that I told him to."
Bree,I told him I don't love him. He said he doesn't care. He wants us to work on our marriage.
Bree,A little? The man put chives in my Parisian salad! He should be in a straightjacket!
Bree,"Isn't it? I'm being blackmailed by a man I'm starting to despise, and if I don't pretend to love him, he can have me arrested."
Bree,What can we think of? He's holding all the cards.
Bree,Are you all right? What happened to your shirt?
Bree,You were assaulted?
Bree,I had nothing to do with that.
Bree,"I don't know. But I swear to you, we may have our differences, but I would never hire someone to attack you. You have to believe me."
Bree,What?
Bree,What were you thinking?
Bree,Don't be glib. Did you hire someone to attack Orson?
Bree,Are you insane? Your thug tried to strangle him.
Bree,Not by resorting to physical violence. I would never have given my permission for that.
Bree,"My beef is that from the minute I walked into this office, you have pulled me deeper and deeper into your moral cesspool. That is not why I hired you."
Bree,I wanted to protect what was mine. You have turned into someone I don't recognize.
Bree,"No, I haven't."
Bree,"What? Karl--if I have not been clear about how I feel about you, I apologize for any ambiguity. Understand this--I detest you."
Bree,You're fired.
Bree,My knees haven't buckled yet.
Bree ,"Andrew, this is your mother. I am rapidly reaching the end of my patience with you. where are you? Are you at a bar? Andrew? Andrew?"
Bree ,"Well, it's obvious you've never had to remove a cheese stain. Hmph!"
Bree ,What just happened?
Bree ,"As of this moment, Rex, I am no longer your wife. I am going to go out, and find the most vindictive lawyer I can find, and together, we are going to eviscerate you. I'm going to take away your money, your family, and your dignity. Do you hear me?"
Bree ,George!
Bree ,"You know what I really truly want? Revenge. I mean, if somehow we could level the playing field, then, um, maybe I could find a way to come back."
Bree ,"So, how does this domination thing work?"
Bree ,Andrew.
Bree ,Why would you say that to me?
Bree ,"Andrew, honey, hurry up. Dinner's ready."
Bree ,"Well, who says he has to know how I spend my free time?"
Bree ,What is he wearing?
Bree ,No.
Bree ,Oh my God. You're bleeding
Bree ,"George, I can't feel my legs."
Bree ,"I don't think it was the wine, George. I think it was the antihistamines."
Bree ,"Uh, she needs me to get something for her. I will be right back."
Bree ,"I'll get back to you, uh, later."
Bree ,Proceed.
Bree ,That's very sweet.
Bree ,"Oh, my--"
Gabrielle,The police.They called me.
Gabrielle,How do you think he'll react when we tell him?
Gabrielle,Ralph has a little crush.So?
Gabrielle,Why don't I just pin the receipt to my chest?
Gabrielle,"There's no way I can just work that in, Carlos."
Gabrielle,"I'm telling you, it came up in the context of the conversation."
Gabrielle,Absolutely. Wouldn't want them to think we're not happy.
Gabrielle,Hi Susan.
Gabrielle,Hmm.
Gabrielle,"What kind of problems could she have had? She was healthy, had a great home, a nice family. Her life was? -"
Gabrielle,"No, if Mary Alice was having some sort of crisis, we'd have known. She lives 50 feet away, for god's sakes."
Gabrielle,You can't order me around like I'm a child!
Gabrielle,"No. No, no, no, I'm not going."
Gabrielle,"Every time I'm around that man, he tries to grab my ass."
Gabrielle,I really hate the way you talk to me.
Gabrielle,John. We have bandages top shelf in the kitchen.
Gabrielle,Fine. I'll go. But I'm keeping my back pressed against the wall the entire time.
Gabrielle,Is your finger ok?
Gabrielle,Let me see.
Gabrielle,"This table is hand carved. Carlos had it imported from Italy. It cost him $23,000."
Gabrielle,Absolutely.
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"Well, he promised to give me everything I've ever wanted."
Gabrielle,Yes.
Gabrielle,Turns out I wanted all the wrong things.
Gabrielle,I do.
Gabrielle,Because I don't wanna wake up some morning with a sudden urge to blow my brains out.
Gabrielle,Absolutely not. You are much too young to smoke.
Gabrielle,"I found my earrings, we can go now."
Gabrielle,"Well, yeah."
Gabrielle,Why??
Gabrielle,It's dark; you just can't see that the lawn has been mowed.
Gabrielle,"I'm not feeling the grass! Let's just get going, come on! We're late!"
Gabrielle,"Oh, excuse me."
Gabrielle,You see that man who just walked away? Can you make sure he has a drink in his hand all Night long.
Gabrielle,What happened to him?
Gabrielle,"Oh, don't worry about Edie. She's a strong lady."
Gabrielle,Come on.
Gabrielle,To Mary Alice.
Gabrielle,"You guys check out Mary Alice's clothes? Size 8, hah! She always told me she was a size 6. Guess we found the skeleton in her closet."
Gabrielle,What's that?
Gabrielle,"It's open, what's the big deal?"
Gabrielle,Do you think this is why she--?
Gabrielle,"If Mary Alice was having some sort of crisis, we'd have known. She lives 50 feet away, for God's sakes."
Gabrielle,"Every time I'm around that man, he tries to grab my ass!"
Gabrielle,Turns out I wanted all the wrong things.
Gabrielle,What's that?
Gabrielle,Damn it!? Come on.
Gabrielle,"Come on, come on, hurry! Let's go, let's go!"
Gabrielle,"I'll find them, just get out!"
Gabrielle,Out the window.
Gabrielle,"Go, go!"
Gabrielle,"Hi honey, you're home early!"
Gabrielle,"I, uh, I just finished a workout."
Gabrielle,John?
Gabrielle,"He's still mourning, Susan, he'll probably freak out."
Gabrielle,We could always call the police.
Gabrielle,I know you're a jerk.
Gabrielle,"You know, Carlos, I didn't marry you so I could have dinner by myself 6 nights a week. You know how bored I was today? I came this close to actually cleaning the house."
Gabrielle,"Nope. No, no, no, no. you're not gonna buy your way outta this one."
Gabrielle,Is that white gold?
Gabrielle,"I'm not in the mood. But, we could stay up and talk."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, right."
Gabrielle,Let go of me.
Gabrielle,Stop.
Gabrielle,"It's not exciting anymore, Carlos."
Gabrielle,"I don't know. Be the way you used to be, surprise me, take my breath away."
Gabrielle,Hello Jonathan.
Gabrielle,"Oh, well, don't-- worry about it."
Gabrielle,"Oh yes, I heard that. Uh, John, we need to talk about what happened the other day."
Gabrielle,"No, no, he doesn't have a clue, God love him. It's just, I was thinking, that when you come over to garden, you might actually have to garden."
Gabrielle,"No, no, no, I'm not dumping you. Lately, you're been the only thing keeping me going. It's just, we can't do it at my house anymore."
Gabrielle,"Well, uh, what time does your mom get back from soccer practice?"
Gabrielle,"You better hurry, we don't have a lot of time."
Gabrielle,I'm glad I could help. Education is very important.
Gabrielle,"Oh, it's a rose."
Gabrielle,"Oh, John."
Gabrielle,"It's just beautiful. I, uh, I gotta go."
Gabrielle,So now you're taking Julie on your dinner date with Mike?
Gabrielle,I can't believe she wormed her way in. How did you let her do that?
Gabrielle,"Well, you know what you need to do. You need to get there early, spend a little time with Mike before little barracuda gets there."
Gabrielle,Attagirl. I'm just gonna take these upstairs.
Gabrielle,Okay.
Gabrielle,"Oh, John gave it to me."
Gabrielle,"Yes, I am having some new bushes planted outside, and he gave me that as a colour palette."
Gabrielle,"Yes, it is."
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god. Carlos, what have you done?"
Gabrielle,Carlos!
Gabrielle,"God, it's beautiful!"
Gabrielle,Absolutely!
Gabrielle,I really hate the way you talk to me.
Gabrielle,"Hi honey, you're home early."
Gabrielle,"Gorgeous, thankful we have 49 cards to play with."
Gabrielle,Mary Alice was so excited about it. So sad.
Gabrielle,We could all use a fun night.
Gabrielle,7. Three couples and Susan. Does that sound right?
Gabrielle,Awww.
Gabrielle,"No, you promise to be home every night this week."
Gabrielle,Says the prince as he rides off into the sunset. Boy did the movies ever get that wrong.
Gabrielle,Where are you?
Gabrielle,You free at 4?
Gabrielle,"Well, get here as fast as you can. My husband says I need to relax."
Gabrielle,If you would. Please.
Gabrielle,"Mum, it's no big deal. Carlos and I will drive in for the baptism. Problem solved. Hi, how was school?"
Gabrielle,"You did. Well, let's see what you've learned."
Gabrielle,I don't know. Hey! You!
Gabrielle,Hey! What's going on?
Gabrielle,"Oh, oh, no problem. Nice to meet you, Ashley."
Gabrielle,"Hi, Ashley. Remember me? We met earlier?"
Gabrielle,"Wow, aren't you the little artist. What are those, flamingos?"
Gabrielle,"Hey, Ash. I was at the mall, and I saw this. Thought you might like it. She's Hawaiian. Her name is Princess Kahaluia. And, and I think it means Little Waterfall- Or Big Pond-or something."
Gabrielle,Okay! So we're good. Right?
Gabrielle,"Okay. Well, you enjoy your new girlfriend. And if there's anything else you need, you just let me know."
Gabrielle,"Here you go. Top of the line, free speed, aluminium frame, handlebar ribbons, and a bell. And you'll notice it's royal blue to match your pretty little eyes."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, well, you'll be cruising so fast on this, no one will even notice. What? What's wrong?"
Gabrielle,"What? Well, then why did you ask for one?"
Gabrielle,"Sure, one of these days."
Gabrielle,"Don't look at your feet. Don't look at your feet, look at the road. Look at the road. Ow. Uh, okay, find your balance. Find your balance. Okay, it's all you. It's all you, you're doing great! Okay, stay to the right. Watch the car. Watch the car. Watch the car! Are you okay?"
Gabrielle,Oh honey. These heels don't have another block in them.
Gabrielle,"Well, you won't be around tomorrow, 'cause you have school."
Gabrielle,"Yes, I, I went jogging today, and I think I just pushed myself too hard."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, that thought did cross my mind."
Gabrielle,"Oh my god, when did this happen?"
Gabrielle,Well since we're doing true confessions. Carlos and I once broke a waterbed in Cancun.
Gabrielle,Oh he used to have a thing for spiked heels.
Gabrielle,It's so weird to hear Mary Alice.
Gabrielle,Her real name?
Gabrielle,"That doesn't make any sense. I've seen her driver's licence, it does not say Angela."
Gabrielle,So what the hell do we do now?
Gabrielle,Can I say something? I'm glad Paul's moving.
Gabrielle,"I'm sorry, he's just always given me the creeps. Haven't you guys notices that he's got this ""dark thing"" going on? There's something about him that just feels-"
Gabrielle,Yes!
Gabrielle,I love taking baths. Especially with you. It's like taking a vacation from the world.
Gabrielle,Relax! Carlos is at work and he doesn't ring the doorbell.
Gabrielle,It's the cable guy. He's three hours late.
Gabrielle,Use the side entrance.
Gabrielle,How long are you going to be?
Gabrielle,Try to hurry. I have stuff to do.
Gabrielle,The cable guy fell. He hit his head on the tub. He may have a concussion.
Gabrielle,He was late.
Gabrielle,Hi.
Gabrielle,That's a sock.
Gabrielle,"For god's sake, Carlos, it's Yeolin's."
Gabrielle,"No, she dusts with them."
Gabrielle,See? Socks. She uses them as rags.
Gabrielle,He's on his way over.
Gabrielle,"Remember when you asked us to pack her things? Well, when we did we found a note."
Gabrielle,"Yeah? Well I don't like your ironing, so there."
Gabrielle,Carlos found this under the bed.
Gabrielle,"It's okay. It was a close call, but I managed to cover. I got you these, so from now on, we can't let Carlos see you around the house wearing anything that resembles a gym sock."
Gabrielle,Mm-hmm.
Gabrielle,Imagine what you would lose if Carlos finds out you're trimming more than the hedges.Why are all your friends staring at me? did you tell them about us?
Gabrielle,Oh! Okay.
Gabrielle,It did cross our minds.
Gabrielle,Really?
Gabrielle,We had no idea.
Gabrielle,Yeah.
Gabrielle,Wow.
Gabrielle,I think he's lying.
Gabrielle,No.
Gabrielle,I think he's hiding something. I know it.
Gabrielle,I think he's hiding something.
Gabrielle,So why weren't you sitting with Mike tonight? I thought you two were becoming an item.
Gabrielle,"I'll tell you who wasn't giving mixed signals, was that sexy Officer Thompson.He was staring at you all night."
Gabrielle,"Honey, trust me. When they're not staring at me, I notice."
Gabrielle,Paul and Zach are fighting again.
Gabrielle,Mama Solis!
Gabrielle,What are you doing here?
Gabrielle,Does Carlos know you are coming?
Gabrielle,I'll be outside doing my yoga.
Gabrielle,"Hey! I'm not going to stop my life just because she decides to show up. Unannounced, I might add."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, well, whatever. It's rude."
Gabrielle,"Mama, I'll be right back. I'm going to the store."
Gabrielle,"You know, Juanita, I'm not going to the supermarket. I'm going to the lingerie store."
Gabrielle,I may be a while. And I may get a facial.
Gabrielle,Yeah.So?
Gabrielle,What's your point?
Gabrielle,Here we go.
Gabrielle,"You know, Juanita, this is so like you. I take you on a nice shopping trip and you find ways to upset me."
Gabrielle,NO.
Gabrielle,"And for the record, I am not one of those women who has a hole in her heart that can only be filled by a baby. I like my life. A lot. It's very fulfilling."
Gabrielle,I'm getting something to drink. Do you want something?
Gabrielle,Now don't be mad.
Gabrielle,It's not my fault. Juanita hasn't let me out of her sight since she got here.
Gabrielle,She's watching her Mexican soap opera. The reverend's virgin daughter is about to be seduced by the escaped desperado. So until she puts out Juanita won't even know that I'm gone.
Gabrielle,Come on! I said I was sorry.
Gabrielle,You can't be serious.
Gabrielle,"But I thought teenage girls bored you, John? I thought what we had was beyond that."
Gabrielle,So why do you want to go back to something you don't want?
Gabrielle,Maybe you're tired of me.
Gabrielle,So why are we arguing?
Gabrielle,Dammit! The virgin gave it up already?
Gabrielle,Tomorrow. Meet me at the front entrance of the mall after school.
Gabrielle,Don't worry. I'll think of something.
Gabrielle,Coming!
Gabrielle,"Okay, this is getting really weird. I think we should go to the police."
Gabrielle,"Oh, for god's sake, Bree, you're a woman. Manipulate him. It's what we do!"
Gabrielle,I don't know. How do you usually manipulate Rex?
Gabrielle,"Oh, Mama, you're in a rut! We need to spice up your wardrobe. Oooh, try this one on."
Gabrielle,"Go on, try it on."
Gabrielle,"Mama Solis, how're you doing in there?"
Gabrielle,"Yes, it's form-fitting. You're going to look great."
Gabrielle,"Well,maybe I made a mistake."
Gabrielle,While you get changed I'm going to run to the book store.
Gabrielle,"No,no, I'll just be a minute."
Gabrielle,"Yes, apparently they found a blouse in her bag-Oh, I don't know, Carlos. At some point older people just start to get confused. She probably thought she paid for it. No. No charges."
Gabrielle,"Mama Solis, Carlos is going to be late home for dinner. It's just the two of us.What would you like to eat?"
Gabrielle,"Okay, suit yourself."
Gabrielle,"Juanita,I had no idea."
Gabrielle,Carlos.
Gabrielle,What did you do?
Gabrielle,Carlos said that his father left for a waitress in El Passo.
Gabrielle,I don't know why you're telling me this.
Gabrielle,This is getting really weird.I think we should go to the police.
Gabrielle,Mama Solis. What are you doing here?
Gabrielle,"Thank you, Yoa Lin."
Gabrielle,It's a big house. I need help.
Gabrielle,I supervise.
Gabrielle,You expect me to take care of this place all by myself?
Gabrielle,You like that?
Gabrielle,"God, I'm gonna miss this, Carlos."
Gabrielle,"Well, since, I'm gonna have to be doing the cooking, and the cleaning, and all the shopping, like the other wives--"
Gabrielle,"--I'm going to be exhausted at night--just like all the other wives -- till I build up my stamina, of course, but that might take a couple years--"
Gabrielle,Did you find out where Zach is?
Gabrielle,"Well, he did break into your house. I mean, the kid is obviously troubled in some way."
Gabrielle,She sounds nice.
Gabrielle,"Hi, John."
Gabrielle,I wasn't aware you two were friends.
Gabrielle,Of course you do.
Gabrielle,"Doesn't it make you nervous, a boy alone upstairs with Danielle?"
Gabrielle,The coffee is a little hot.
Gabrielle,Are they having fun?
Gabrielle,Isn't it sexist of us to generalize like this?
Gabrielle,"Well, who am I to argue with sociologists? Wow this, uh, this guacamole has got a kick. I'm going to run to the little girls' room. You guys go ahead, I might be a while."
Gabrielle,Why haven't you returned any of my phone calls?
Gabrielle,"Yeah, I've seen who you've been busy with."
Gabrielle,"Well, before you get any friendlier, let me remind you, I can do things to you she can't even pronounce."
Gabrielle,"Oh, no, John, please don't say that. I have everything under control."
Gabrielle,Now give me a boost.
Gabrielle,Hey! So what did I miss?
Gabrielle,"No, Lynette, I'm sorry, Juanita's taking a bath. Well, how much did she win from you? Jeez,"" ""Yeah, I guess she'll take a check. Okay. All right. Bye."
Gabrielle,It turns out your mother is quite the card shark.
Gabrielle,"Not that long, why?"" ""Carlos, what is it?"
Gabrielle,Was this before we were married?
Gabrielle,"Honey, it was only a small neighborhood game."
Gabrielle,"She has a major weakness. Honey, oh,"" ""It's okay. You were right to tell me this."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I thought we would stop here for lunch first. This place has the best buffet in town. All you can eat crab legs. Oh no!"
Gabrielle,"I didn't realize how late it was. They're only holding the suede mini for me until two. If we stay, I'll never make it. We'll just have lunch at the mall."
Gabrielle,"Well, if the mall is crowded, it might take over an hour."
Gabrielle,Hi John. Motel. Ten minutes. Be there.
Gabrielle,"Juanita, what's wrong?"
Gabrielle,Juanita!
Gabrielle,"Well, how much did you have on you? It couldn't have been much."
Gabrielle,"Okay, well, how much did you charge?"
Gabrielle,"What do you mean, it stopped working. That thing has, like, a $15,000 credit limit."
Gabrielle,Oh.
Gabrielle,"This is what we'll do. I'll sell some old jewelry, pay off the credit card, and Carlos will never find out!"
Gabrielle,"Of course I would, why wouldn't I?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, that is overstating it -- a little. The bottom line is, no matter how much I dislike you, I love Carlos more. If Carlos finds out about the money, he'll be devastated. I don't want to see him hurt. You don't have to believe I'm a good person, but at least believe I care about my husband."
Gabrielle,"Fine, to heck with it. I'm not gonna risk my neck to protect you. I'm calling Carlos."
Gabrielle,"Mama Juanita, I'm going to the store. Do you need anything?"
Gabrielle,Who the hell's Dana?
Gabrielle,So who the hell is that?
Gabrielle,"It's me. Don't turn around, my mother-in-law can see you."
Gabrielle,So meet me at the motel in an hour? John?
Gabrielle,So cancel.
Gabrielle,That sounds like a date.
Gabrielle,"Well, I have a problem with you seeing other girls."
Gabrielle,"Hey, Danielle."
Gabrielle,"Oh, Danielle, remember when you said you wanted to be a model?"
Gabrielle,"Well, as it turns out, Pershing Modeling Academy has an opening for their summer program. Would you like me to sponsor you?"
Gabrielle,I sure would.
Gabrielle,"Oh, and I would so love to help you get there."
Gabrielle,"What? Uh, yes, no, um, is that how she heard it?"
Gabrielle,I just wanted to help out.
Gabrielle,"It's her dream, and don't you want her to be happy?"
Gabrielle,Bree--
Gabrielle,John--John--
Gabrielle,I'm not jealous. I just don't like to share.
Gabrielle,"Oh, don't be that way."
Gabrielle,I don't want us to end on a bad note. Carlos has this black tie thing tonight. I could slip--
Gabrielle,"John, please, what we had was so special. I think it deserves a proper goodbye."
Gabrielle,Of course!
Gabrielle,It's not those kind of cramps.
Gabrielle,Okay. Take good care of Carlos.
Gabrielle,I love long good byes.
Gabrielle,"Well, that's it then."
Gabrielle,"No, no, you go home. I'll take care of this. And you were never here. Go. Go."
Gabrielle,Do you have a cell phone?
Gabrielle,Call 911.
Gabrielle,"You should go home and get some rest, eat something. You have a ton of messages from work--Tanaka called; said it was urgent. Carlos, I can stay here with your mother."
Gabrielle,You can't go on like this. You have to take care of yourself.
Gabrielle,Don't say that! We need to stay positive.
Gabrielle,John!
Gabrielle,"Um, no, I think I will stay here with mama."
Gabrielle,Come again?
Gabrielle,I think I'll pass.
Gabrielle,"Oh, they're terrific. We just appreciate you all stopping by."
Gabrielle,"Not really. They'll be able to determine the make and model of the car, but without any eye witnesses, no one seems very optimistic."
Gabrielle,No change. All we can do is wait and hope for the best.
Gabrielle,"Oh, that's very sweet, Danielle, thank you."
Gabrielle,It's a fairly recent development.
Gabrielle,We'll talk about this later.
Gabrielle,"In case you've forgotten, before we got married, we made a deal. No kids."
Gabrielle,"Well, we're not negotiating my uterus."
Gabrielle,"I know, I've been watching. I came to talk to you."
Gabrielle,"Keep working! What were you thinking, showing up at the hospital?"
Gabrielle,You need to keep a low profile right now.
Gabrielle,Why would you say that?
Gabrielle,We weren't driving the car. We didn't chase Juanita into the street!
Gabrielle,"Oh, for God's sakes, between you and Carlos! Listen to me carefully, you didn't do anything wrong."
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,Have you lost your mind? What did you tell him?
Gabrielle,Including in the alley? Behind the truck stop?
Gabrielle,Damn you!
Gabrielle,"Father, I'm so glad you could come and pray for mama. Please, sit, sit."
Gabrielle,"Listen, since you're here, there's something I've always wondered about. That whole thing about priests not being allowed to repeat what they hear in confessions, is that a hard rule, or just a general guideline?"
Gabrielle,That's good to hear.
Gabrielle,"No, me? No, no. Confession is not really my thing."
Gabrielle,"Okay. You can stop condemning me with your eyes. Right now. I know you know, about the affair. But you know nothing about my life. Look, it's not even an issue anymore. John and I are finished."
Gabrielle,"Well, aren't you just a ball of fun. So, if I confess, it'll clean the slate, right?"
Gabrielle,"So what happens if I repent, later, like, say, when I'm 75?"
Gabrielle,"Well, let's say I don't die. I do yoga, I eat well. If I wait, does my repenting still count?"
Gabrielle,"Thank you, Father Crowley. You have been a tremendous comfort. Um, I will let you do your thing."
Gabrielle,What I want is to be happy.
Gabrielle,I know.
Gabrielle,Hmmm? What is?
Gabrielle,"Oh, no."
Gabrielle,My life. It hasn't turned out like I thought it would.
Gabrielle,"Oh, I know I shouldn't complain. It's just there's something missing, and I don't know what it is. Do you ever feel that way?"
Gabrielle,"""That must be a nice feeling.''"
Gabrielle,"Betty, listen to me."
Gabrielle,"Listen, Betty! Okay? You're not quitting on me now. We're going to find you a gown. It's going to be black, and slimming, and you're going to look great! I need you to be brave now."
Gabrielle,"Hi, Helen!"
Gabrielle,How's the dress fitting?
Gabrielle,"Sure, no problem. There you go."
Gabrielle,For what?
Gabrielle,"Believe me, it's been my pleasure. How's he doing?"
Gabrielle,I hear he's dating Danielle Van de Kamp?
Gabrielle,What's wrong?
Gabrielle,Vaguely.
Gabrielle,I don't know what his problem is. He's making money left and right. I just wish he'd relax.
Gabrielle,John!
Gabrielle,Oh! Finally got the charity bug?
Gabrielle,"No, not really. You were always a giver."
Gabrielle,Have a seat. You can start by helping us alphabetize the donation cards.
Gabrielle,So word on the street is you and Danielle might break up.
Gabrielle,Is that because of me?
Gabrielle,Have you been thinking about me?
Gabrielle,Really?
Gabrielle,Could have fooled me.
Gabrielle,"Susan, hi! Do you want to help with the seating cards?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, that! Uh-- He was helping me adjust the seam in my stocking, and from your angle, it must have looked a little weird."
Gabrielle,"Okay, yes, but you have to promise not to tell anybody."
Gabrielle,"It's just sex, it's totally harmless."
Gabrielle,This isn't about you.
Gabrielle,Whh--How can compare me to Karl? It's not fair. You have no idea what my life is like.
Gabrielle,"No, he doesn't adore me. He adores having me."
Gabrielle,"I have some not-so-awesome news, so you go first."
Gabrielle,"John, your timing is impeccable."
Gabrielle,"Susan Mayer saw us last night, and she knows everything."
Gabrielle,"Thank god, Tom could fill in at the last minute."
Gabrielle,Some work emergency. He wouldn't talk about it. Sometimes I could just kill him.
Gabrielle,"Okay, you're up first, followed by Lynette, uh, and then Edie--Edie. Where's Edie Britt?"
Gabrielle,"Edie, what did you do to that dress?"
Gabrielle,Yes!
Gabrielle,"You know, I think that's a great idea! Okay, let's go!"
Gabrielle,You really do look fantastic.
Gabrielle,"Tom, say something!"
Gabrielle,"Susan, I feel awful about what happened. Susan, talk to me!"
Gabrielle,I can't do that!
Gabrielle,"Because she'll tell Carlos, and he'll divorce me!"
Gabrielle,"I do love him! I do! It's just complicated! You know, there's, there's got to be another way to fix this."
Gabrielle,"Susan, don't be like this!"
Gabrielle,Helen! Do you have a minute?
Gabrielle,"No, it's okay, people didn't even notice."
Gabrielle,It wasn't Susan. It was me.
Gabrielle,I'm the one who was sleeping with your son. I'm so sorry.
Gabrielle,Almost a year. But it's over now.
Gabrielle,I think--
Gabrielle,"But Helen, you have to believe me. It's over now."
Gabrielle,Carlos.
Gabrielle,I uh.
Gabrielle,I'm going to bed.
Gabrielle,Carlos! Carlos! I am so sorry! I am so sorry!
Gabrielle,"Just know that whatever happens, I love you very, very much!"
Gabrielle,Huh?
Gabrielle,"Carlos, wait!"
Gabrielle,They took him away in handcuffs.
Gabrielle,"Yao Lin, listen to me. It's very important that we find Carlos' passport. I've already looked through his office, so I need you to search the bedroom."
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"Yao Lin, your kids are in their twenties. If it'll make you shut up--"
Gabrielle,Here. Three weeks in advance.
Gabrielle,"Yao Lin, don't be stupid. People don't become poor overnight."
Gabrielle,Huh? That's my car! Oh my god!
Gabrielle,Hey! Hey! What are you doing? Where are you taking my car?
Gabrielle,You call this a paint job?! I don't want to see it again until it's perfect!
Gabrielle,How am I supposed to live without a car?
Gabrielle,Why? What else could they take from us?
Gabrielle,"No, no, no. No! Some of this stuff is mine. When I modeled. Before I even met Carlos! See this, costa boda, bought it when I landed my first cover. This, I spent eight hours on a rock in a bikini for that painting!"
Gabrielle,"No, you don't understand. I have dug myself up from dirt to afford these things, and no one is going to take them away from me!"
Gabrielle,"My china. I know how you've always loved it, and I thought you might want to borrow it for a while."
Gabrielle,"Say, um, could I store some odds and ends in your garage?"
Gabrielle,Sooner is better than later!
Gabrielle,We're not into clutter.
Gabrielle,"Oh, I, I moved all our stuff, to keep it from the feds."
Gabrielle,It's not your fault. You didn't do anything wrong. I'll take care of everything until you're back to do it yourself. And you will be soon.
Gabrielle,"Oh, Carlos, I love you so much! I would give up a house full of expensive junk just to put this behind us, and have you home with me."
Gabrielle,I'm going to kiss my husband now!
Gabrielle,"Carlos, did you know what Tanaka was doing?"
Gabrielle,"She's a talented girl, our Edie."
Gabrielle,"Hey, how creepy is Mrs. Huber's sister?"
Gabrielle,You don't think she is--
Gabrielle,"I'm not saying it's your fault, I'm just saying, fix it!"
Gabrielle,"I'm running out of money. In a couple of weeks, I'm gonna be screwed."
Gabrielle,Don't you have a toilet to scrub?
Gabrielle,"I'm just so angry with Carlos. What was he thinking, exporting goods made from slave labor? Why couldn't he have embezzled like other white collar criminals?"
Gabrielle,But they won't release him on bail until they get the passport.
Gabrielle,I'm still searching.
Gabrielle,"Of course. I made ten thousand dollars a day. I don't expect to, to make that here."
Gabrielle,Yeah. So what do you got?
Gabrielle,"Uh, what else do you have?"
Gabrielle,"A warrior princess? Mr. Gibbs. I am a professional model. Look at this bone structure. This face is a cash cow, and if you don't have the vision to take advantage of that, then maybe I'm at the wrong agency."
Gabrielle,"This, um, Buick thing. Does it include lunch?"
Gabrielle,Ladies and Gentlemen. I present to you the fabulous Buick Lacrosse.
Gabrielle,"It, uh, it has an excellently crafted interior, peaceful quiet tuning, and ultrasonic rear parking assist. Observe the remote activation feature."
Gabrielle,"Uh, and it also has a lot of other exciting good, cool car things."
Gabrielle,Tom! Lynette! What are you doing here?
Gabrielle,"Just doing a little shopping, trying to get my mind off things."
Gabrielle,Uh! I guess I am.
Gabrielle,I guess I got too close to the turn table. I'm a sucker for these Buicks.
Gabrielle,"You know, with their perfectly crafted interior, and peaceful, quiet tuning."
Gabrielle,"Oh, uh, you know, I wanted to match the shoes to the dress. This is, uh, Sarah, my shopping buddy. We like to hit the boutiques together."
Gabrielle,Bye.
Gabrielle,Mr. Hartley. It's Gabrielle Solis. I need you to start working on releasing Carlos on bail. Mm hmm. I just remembered where I put his passport.
Gabrielle,"Hi, honey. Did the lawyer tell you the good news? You're gonna make bail. I found your passport."
Gabrielle,"Well, we're not negotiating my uterus."
Gabrielle,"Hi, honey! Welcome home!"
Gabrielle,"Come on, honey, let's celebrate! Sorry it's the cheap stuff. I had to economize. Now that you're back, we can restock the wine cellar. Let's toast."
Gabrielle,What's that?
Gabrielle,Tell me what?
Gabrielle,"Uh, no! No, he neglected to tell me that."
Gabrielle,"But, how are you gonna work?"
Gabrielle,"Uh, no! No, no! That's unreasonable. What do they expect us to do for money?"
Gabrielle,"Carlos, this is not like New York where I made thousands of dollars a day modeling haute couture. I'm doing boat shows. I spend eight hours a day doing this!"
Gabrielle,"Hello. Hi, Bree. What?"
Gabrielle,"Yeah, but this is different. Someone was actually murdered on our street."
Gabrielle,"You know, Edie, I'd love to go, but, um, I just got back into modeling, you know, just for fun, and I have a gig tomorrow. I can't leave 'em hanging."
Gabrielle,"Well, dig in. I am way too tired to eat."
Gabrielle,I worked ten hours today. I'll go by tomorrow. She doesn't even know when I'm there.
Gabrielle,"No, you promised, no babies!"
Gabrielle,"Yeah, I know. The Feds towed away my Maserati. My husband is, is a felon, and I spend my days getting groped by fat tracker salesmen at trade shows. I am well aware things change!"
Gabrielle,"And who is going to be changing the diapers when you're pumping iron in a Federal prison, huh? I like my lifestyle, and I don't want you to kill it."
Gabrielle,"Maybe. But having a baby, that, I can control. You, I can control."
Gabrielle,"Oh, really?"
Gabrielle,The man of the house?
Gabrielle,"I wouldn't go too much farther, you're going to end up back in prison."
Gabrielle,Mmm.
Gabrielle,"Mmm, it's perfect! Oh, mm, crispy and burnt on the outside but nice and steamy on the inside."
Gabrielle,"Uh, uh, uh! Mmmm. Mmmm. you're the man of the house? You can't even leave it!"
Gabrielle,"You know honey, tonight's the last night of the boat show. We'll be able to spend some time together before that home and garden thing next week. Carlos."
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"Don't talk like that. Everything is going to be fine. We're going to sort this mess out, and you're gonna be on top again."
Gabrielle,"Okay, Carlos -"
Gabrielle,I promise.
Gabrielle,I've gotta go.
Gabrielle,"I'm the one who was sleeping with your son.But, Helen, it's over now."
Gabrielle,I'm gonna go get the mail.
Gabrielle,"Helen, uh, what are you doing here?"
Gabrielle,Hi! So nice to meet you.
Gabrielle,"I haven't seen John in weeks. He's called and left messages, but I haven't returned any. It's over, I swear."
Gabrielle,"Oh, okay."
Gabrielle,"Well, why, uh, why would he do that?"
Gabrielle,What do you want me to do?
Gabrielle,John and I made a clean break. I think it's best if we just keep our distance.
Gabrielle,"I'm sorry. I, I'm so sorry, I just can't handle this right now. I have my own personal things going on. My life is falling apart."
Gabrielle,I'll see what I can do.
Gabrielle,"Hi, um, I don't know if I have the right address. Does John Rowland live here?"
Gabrielle,"Uh, yeah, I'm, I'm sorry I haven't returned any of your calls."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, well, you know me, I'll survive."
Gabrielle,"Oh, no. John. I, uh, I didn't come here for that."
Gabrielle,"Well, I heard that you're going full time with your gardening business. What happened to college?"
Gabrielle,Why?
Gabrielle,"John, what opportunity is more important than college?"
Gabrielle,"Hi, what are you doing here?"
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,John caught me off guard. Obviously I'm going to give back the ring.
Gabrielle,"Obviously, I'm not leaving my husband and marrying John."
Gabrielle,I'll talk to John tomorrow and give back the ring.
Gabrielle,"Hey, Bob! I get why she's so angry with me, but, what I don't get is, why you're so nice."
Gabrielle,"I guess. I understand if, uh, you hate me just a little."
Gabrielle,"That's sweet, you're, you're very sweet."
Gabrielle,"Please, calm down!"
Gabrielle,"Love is not enough. Where would we live, here with your roommates? The only decoration in the bathroom is a bong!"
Gabrielle,How? You're barely making minimum wage!
Gabrielle,I've tried poor but happy. Guess what. It wasn't that happy.
Gabrielle,"I don't know. You know, every once in a while, even I want to do the right thing."
Gabrielle,"Honestly, no. John, you're a toy. A sweet, dumb toy, so you might as well go to college, because you and me, no future!"
Gabrielle,"I'm running out of money.In a couple of weeks, I will be screwed."
Gabrielle,So Paul said that Zachary killed Dana?
Gabrielle,"You know, I never thought I'd say this but I kind of feel sorry for Paul."
Gabrielle,What do you mean?
Gabrielle,"No, Mikki, you're wrong. I wasn't acting like a diva. I left the boat show because that coordinator was making passes at me. It's not my fault."
Gabrielle,"Yao Lin? You missed a spot. No, spare me the lecture and just book me another job quick. Carlos and I are up to our asses in bills and we can't pay them. Fine. Bye."
Gabrielle,What did you say?
Gabrielle,Are you gonna clean that spot?
Gabrielle,The one I told you to clean.
Gabrielle,Clean it now.
Gabrielle,Because I said so.
Gabrielle,Fine. Please.
Gabrielle,Anything to get you back on your knees scrubbing where you belong.
Gabrielle,Excuse me?
Gabrielle,You are so fired.
Gabrielle,Mm.
Gabrielle,"Very impressive. So, where does the photographer want me for the shoot?"
Gabrielle,"Well, then what did you hire me for?"
Gabrielle,People keep coming and talking to me asking me questions. That is not my job.
Gabrielle,I am not a mattress sales person.
Gabrielle,"Honestly, yes. I am a model."
Gabrielle,I just met the woman today.
Gabrielle,"Oh no, no, no, wait, wait."
Gabrielle,No!
Gabrielle,"Oh, right. Oh, here. Here you go. Thank you. Come again."
Gabrielle,"Oh, god."
Gabrielle,"Hello, Yao Lin. How are you?"
Gabrielle,I wanted to call you. I felt terrible about how we left things.
Gabrielle,Okay but -
Gabrielle,"You must be loving this, huh? Having me serve you must be a dream come true."
Gabrielle,"That's the difference between you and me, Yao Lin, our dreams. Close your eyes, please. Thank you. You see I dreamed of pulling myself up from nothing, and I did. I dreamed about the things I wanted and I got them all: a high powered career, a handsome husband, an extravagant house. So, this is just a blip in the radar for me, because now, I know what I'm capable of and if I did it once, I can do it again. I'm never really down, Yao Lin, even when it looks like I am. So, enjoy this moment, enjoy your dream, because for you, it doesn't get any better than this. There. Don't you look beautiful."
Gabrielle,"John, you're a toy.You and me -- no future."
Gabrielle,He was shot? How could you not tell us about this?
Gabrielle,"We know that you want to trust Mike, but he had a dead woman's jewelry in his garage."
Gabrielle,"But, we will do whatever you want us to do."
Gabrielle,"Well, it's not really an emergency."
Gabrielle,I'm sorry. Do I know you?
Gabrielle,"Really, why?"
Gabrielle,What kind of favor?
Gabrielle,You want to mow my lawn for free?
Gabrielle,"That's very generous of you, but I don't think so."
Gabrielle,"Because my husband is home quite a lot these days. If any bush needs trimming, he takes care of it."
Gabrielle,"I'm flattered, but no, thank you."
Gabrielle,Did I mention why my husband's home a lot? He's under house arrest.
Gabrielle,He has a lot of anger toward the government right now and he's just dying to find someone to take it out on.
Gabrielle,Have you seen these? Five more past due notices.
Gabrielle,How? How are you handling it?
Gabrielle,Have you seen our checking account lately? We're broke. And then we have the mortgage payment coming up. We have property taxes..
Gabrielle,"No, it's not. We are seriously screwed, and I am freaking out that you're not freaking out."
Gabrielle,When?
Gabrielle,What is that?
Gabrielle,Carlos--
Gabrielle,"Justin, what are you doing up here?"
Gabrielle,I don't know. He's not here. He had a meeting with his lawyer.
Gabrielle,"No, that means I'm all alone. You're leaving."
Gabrielle,I don't think so.
Gabrielle,"Well, I'm not interested in becoming one of your friends. Get out of my bedroom."
Gabrielle,Do you know how easy it would be for me to call my husband and tell him what you just tried to do?
Gabrielle,"Hello, Justin."
Gabrielle,I am here to talk to your roommate.
Gabrielle,"Well, now we have something to talk about. You."
Gabrielle,"Yes, I'm gonna tell him how you're trying to blackmail me into sleeping with you. I wonder how he'll react."
Gabrielle,Think he'll get violent?
Gabrielle,"Oh, I can, and I will, you little worthless piece of crap."
Gabrielle,Then why did you?
Gabrielle,Why?
Gabrielle,Oh.
Gabrielle,"So, have you been acting on these feelings?"
Gabrielle,Wow.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, but why me? You're a good looking kid. Why don't you test drive someone your own age?"
Gabrielle,"Well, I guess that makes sense in a weird sort of way."
Gabrielle,We're all in denial about something. But you're finally facing the truth and I think that's sort of brave.
Gabrielle,I should probably go.
Gabrielle,Did you feel anything?
Gabrielle,Definitely gay.
Gabrielle,"Carlos, we can't afford to live here anymore."
Gabrielle,"Then what? Huh? Finish the sentence, Carlos. We've tons of legal bills, you've lost all your clients and even with our savings, we're screwed."
Gabrielle,"Honey, I know. I love this place, too. It's just, I think it's time for us to face the music."
Gabrielle,"You know, Carlos, I've been broke a lot of times in my life. But, I've never been poor, because poor is just a state of mind, and right now you and I are just--"
Gabrielle,Exactly.
Gabrielle,Who knows? It might even be fun.
Gabrielle,Bigger.
Gabrielle,What's that?
Gabrielle,How will you work?
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,I can't hear you!
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"So, uh, Mike. The suspense is killing us. Why don't you just tell us the bad news?"
Gabrielle,And how much is this gonna cost?
Gabrielle,"Okay, well, we'll let you know."
Gabrielle,"Oh, no, no, no, it's not the money. It's just, uh, Carlos and I are trying to prioritize some little things we need to do around the house."
Gabrielle,It's definitely on the short list.
Gabrielle,Why?
Gabrielle,Hope he's more innocent than you are.
Gabrielle,Ahem. Sorry.
Gabrielle,"Obviously, someone who's not getting it at home."
Gabrielle,I'm all in.
Gabrielle,"God, I have to go to the bathroom again."
Gabrielle,I've been to Bree's twice today.
Gabrielle,I hate Susan's. She has all these weird scented candles. Her house reeks of apricot. Hose.
Gabrielle,"No, you don't understand. I don't want to go to anybody's house anymore. I'm tired of knocking on doors and making up excuses as to why we haven't fixed our plumbing."
Gabrielle,Because it's your fault.
Gabrielle,"Yes. If you hadn't gotten yourself indicted, we would have pipes right now."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I'm materialistic? When the Johnson's bought their new 7-series, you were the one who went right in and traded in his car for something better."
Gabrielle,You know what? I don't have time to fight right now. I have laundry to do.
Gabrielle,Ta-da!
Gabrielle,"Carlos, I have to go."
Gabrielle,Why should I have to wait? It's my port-a-potty.
Gabrielle,I'm the one who stole it.
Gabrielle,"Thank you so much, Bree. Seeing your tile has really helped me make my decision. Next time I remodel, I am using limestone."
Gabrielle,Sure. Why?
Gabrielle,In what way?
Gabrielle,"Well, uh, there's a simple explanation for that. I, um--"
Gabrielle,Is that so?
Gabrielle,I don't know. Probably for the same reason you didn't tell me Rex was one of Maisy's clients.
Gabrielle,"Why? Because it happened to you? Bree, this is how I see it -- good friends support each other after they've been humiliated. Great friends pretend nothing happened in the first place."
Gabrielle,And please tell Rex I said hello.
Gabrielle,"Bree, hi."
Gabrielle,What's up?
Gabrielle,"Oh, Bree, I-I can't take that."
Gabrielle,We're gonna pay you back every cent. I promise.
Gabrielle,Who? Who blinked?
Gabrielle,And that's - good?
Gabrielle,"Oh my god! Honey, that means we can keep the house!"
Gabrielle,But I thought you said they offered a plea bargain.
Gabrielle,Put me down.
Gabrielle,I think that's pretty reasonable considering you're guilty as sin!
Gabrielle,That was before I knew we could trade a couple months in prison to keep it!
Gabrielle,"What? No, this is her daughter-in-law."
Gabrielle,"Ah, thank you, yes."
Gabrielle,"I'm sorry, Carlos."
Gabrielle,Don't you think that's a little over the top?
Gabrielle,"No, honey, these funeral homes make a fortune trying to convince people to overspend."
Gabrielle,"Well, I'm saying your mother was a sensible woman. She wouldn't be comfortable with all these bells and whistles. Maybe this one. Wood veneer!"
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"Well, it's awfully hard to like someone who actively hates your guts. She always thought you married beneath you and she let me know it."
Gabrielle,"She treated me like trash!"" ""God rest her soul."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, we're not exactly flush with cash right now. Let her be true to her roots. She was born humble and barefoot."
Gabrielle,"Hi, I'm Gabrielle Solis. You're Nurse Heissel?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, that's so thoughtful of you, but actually no."
Gabrielle,"No, you see my husband and I still don't have a clear account as to how Juanita passed."
Gabrielle,"Yes, did she die quietly in her sleep?"
Gabrielle,Pretty sure?
Gabrielle,"Uh huh. Was anyone with her? An orderly, candy striper, anyone?"
Gabrielle,Thank you so much. That's all I needed to hear.
Gabrielle,"Oh, you can just toss that!"
Gabrielle,"So, how much did that horse and buggy set us back?"
Gabrielle,Being poor? A little.
Gabrielle,"Eyes front, Padre."
Gabrielle,What's going on? Why are we slowing down?
Gabrielle,What is that?
Gabrielle,A crypt? You bought your mother a crypt?
Gabrielle,"Oh, that's it. I cannot be a part of this! I can't do it!"
Gabrielle,"Go to hell, Carlos!"
Gabrielle,"This is too much. The only reason I agreed to give up the house is because I thought I was gonna get a gorgeous little apartment. Now, I'm not even going to get that!"
Gabrielle,Take the plea!
Gabrielle,"Yeah! You did the crime, why should I have to pay the price? Just suck it up, be a man, and do the time."
Gabrielle,Am I? All I want is the same respect that you gave your dead mother.
Gabrielle,At least she's gonna have a roof over her head.
Gabrielle,Whatcha doing?
Gabrielle,Why?
Gabrielle,You are so brave.
Gabrielle,"Well, that's a ridiculous thing to say. I'm not going anywhere."
Gabrielle,Yeah. Of course.
Gabrielle,I promise.
Gabrielle,I love you.
Gabrielle,"Yes, hello, again."
Gabrielle,Okay.
Gabrielle,"Honey, are you okay?"
Gabrielle,Uh huh.
Gabrielle,Apparently.
Gabrielle,Monetary compensation? You're trying to buy us off?
Gabrielle,"Well, in that case, care away."
Gabrielle,"Mr. Hartley, I have a hypothetical question for you. I like to play the lottery and I - yes, I know what the odds are, but I just love those scratch-offs. Say I were to win, I don't know, a million six hundred thousand dollars. Would the government be able to take it? Like they took everything else?"
Gabrielle,"That's what I thought. The bastards. So, what if we won the lottery after Carlos went to jail? Could the government touch the money then? Hypothetically. I see. And we could keep the house."
Gabrielle,Are you trying to buy us off?
Gabrielle,"I'm so lucky to have you,"
Gabrielle,Because I don't want to have kids and you do.
Gabrielle,"Most men would leave over something like that, and you're still here. I'm grateful. I know the sacrifice you're making."
Gabrielle,Honey. It's not going to happen.
Gabrielle,"No, sometimes you do."
Gabrielle,"Hi honey, I'm back."
Gabrielle,"Oh, have we met?"
Gabrielle,Oh that. Mr Steinberg?.
Gabrielle,"Wait, just let me explain."
Gabrielle,Because I couldn't trust you to make the right decision.
Gabrielle,If you didn't take the plea deal the government would have seized the settlement.
Gabrielle,Exactly and then you would have blown all the money on the lawyers.
Gabrielle,You had Laotian convicts sewing casual wear for 2 cents an hour. Don't you think you deserve a time out?
Gabrielle,And when you get out we're going to have money to start over with. Thanks to me.
Gabrielle,"You know once you calm down, you're going to realise I did the right thing and when that happens, I'd appreciate an apology."
Gabrielle,What's that?
Gabrielle,"No, I know what a post-nup is, what is it doing on my coffee table?"
Gabrielle,"Hmm, so the post-nup changes the terms of the pre-nup so that-"
Gabrielle,You don't trust me?
Gabrielle,"Well, that's too bad. Cos I'm not signing that piece of paper."
Gabrielle,"So what do you expect to happen right now, Carlos? I sign the papers and jump into your arms."
Gabrielle,"Oh, but I'm not. I have flaws."
Gabrielle,"Uh huh. I'll even give you an example. Remember the time you were in jail and you told me about your secret compartment and you told me to burn the papers that I found in there. Well, me being pretty and therefore stupid, I forgot."
Gabrielle,Worse. I read them.
Gabrielle,You have some nerve talking about trust when you have a secret bank account in the Cayman Islands.
Gabrielle,I'll bet.
Gabrielle,"No, but I could. Hey, isn't that why the prosecution didn't have a case against you? They couldn't find the profits you made. So if I were you, Carlos, I wouldn't mention the words divorce, trust or post- nup ever again. You don't wanna piss me off."
Gabrielle,"I know baby, it hurts to lose."
Gabrielle,"So Sophie, Susan said you're going to the spa tomorrow. Is that an all day thing?"
Gabrielle,"Yeah, I'll do it."
Gabrielle,"Oh honey, nobody's blaming you."
Gabrielle,"Lynnette, will you go after her?"
Gabrielle,I told you I'm not signing this.
Gabrielle,Then I'll go to the police.
Gabrielle,"Huh, you moved the money?"
Gabrielle,"Well, that was risky, I mean the feds are watching you right now."
Gabrielle,"Oh, no. Stop, Carlos, stop it. Put me down. Put me down. Let me go. Argh! Stop, you're hurting me. Carlos!"
Gabrielle,Are your roommates here?
Gabrielle,Yeah.
Gabrielle,"That? Uh, oh Carlos just got a little rough, made me sign some papers."
Gabrielle,"John, what are you doing?"
Gabrielle,"No, you're not going to do anything."
Gabrielle,"If you really want to get back at him, Kiss me."
Gabrielle,"Because one day, when the time is right I'm gonna tell him how he drove me into your arms and that's going to kill him."
Gabrielle,"Tonight just, whatever you do-don't call me beautiful."
Gabrielle,I'm not signing this.
Gabrielle,"Stop, you're hurting me."
Gabrielle,What do you think you are doing?
Gabrielle,"Well, you might want to try a motel, because you're not coming back in here."
Gabrielle,Obviously a few more.
Gabrielle,If you want back in this bed you know what to do.
Gabrielle,Why not?
Gabrielle,"Well, then have fun at the motel."
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,What am I supposed to do for money?
Gabrielle,You want my respect? Then tear up the post nup!
Gabrielle,"One more thing. If you ever hurt me again, I will kill you."
Gabrielle,I feel trapped.
Gabrielle,"No, I'm talking about my life."
Gabrielle,"No no, keep going."
Gabrielle,"I'm unhappy. Carlos and my marriage. I don't have options and it's driving me crazy. Every time something went south in my life, I always had a plan B. now I feel like I have nothing."
Gabrielle,Dammit John! What is our new rule?
Gabrielle,Thank you.
Gabrielle,"No, 'cos if I leave then I'll be broke, and that would be awful. And if I stay he'll be in control and that's horrifying. And he cut up all my credit cards, which means I'm married to him and unable to shop, which is probably the worst of all possible worlds."
Gabrielle,"I'll figure something out. I'm sorry. I'm not much fun today, I'm going to go."
Gabrielle,What's this?
Gabrielle,With your student credit card?
Gabrielle,You mow lawns!
Gabrielle,I can't.
Gabrielle,I'll pay it off.
Gabrielle,"Well, far be it for me- to stand in the way of a young man's dream."
Gabrielle,"What? Oh, no. That's impossible. It's a new card, I just went shopping with it. Try it again."
Gabrielle,Of course you may. If you will just give me a moment.
Gabrielle,It's me.
Gabrielle,Because I'm in a lovely restaurant having a lovely meal that I now can't pay for!
Gabrielle,I ate already!
Gabrielle,I bought shoes!
Gabrielle,Why would they call your parents? It's your account.
Gabrielle,Return the shoes? I can't talk to you when you're being hysterical.
Gabrielle,Uh??
Gabrielle,Ha ha. I don't know. I'd watch your back.
Gabrielle,"Well, Sam, to tell the truth, I'm kind of in a relationship right now. I just wanted to be honest."
Gabrielle,"Oh no, you shouldn't."
Gabrielle,"Hi, honey, look at my new shoes."
Gabrielle,Aren't they gorgeous?
Gabrielle,Sorry.
Gabrielle,"Sh! We'll talk later, you're watching the game."
Gabrielle,"Oh, you've heard it all before. Girl meets boy. Boy buys girl nice things. Girl leaves happy."
Gabrielle,You know I forgot how generous men could be. I also forgot I have options. A whole bunch of them.
Gabrielle,"I don't need your credit cards, Carlos. And I don't need your money. But if our marriage is going to work, I need your respect."
Gabrielle,"Yes, you are. Because if you don't, I'm going to put on my new shoes and walk out that door."
Gabrielle,"No, I'm just pointing something out. I'm a pretty girl. And pretty girls are never lonely."
Gabrielle,We made a deal. No kids.
Gabrielle,"Yes, yes, I know. My husband and I went through a downsizing phase. But we've snapped out of it. Life is good. And this would make it so much better."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I would love to have this in my driveway by Saturday. I'm having a big barbeque and I want everyone to see it."
Gabrielle,I'm throwing my husband a going-away party.
Gabrielle,It's-it's a sort of- a government sponsored sabbatical-
Gabrielle,Eight months. Six with good behaviour.
Gabrielle,It is. Its is. It's just the smell is a little intense.
Gabrielle,"I am so sorry, it just hit me out of nowhere. It is so weird, smells have been making me nauseous lately."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, why has it been going around?"
Gabrielle,"What? Wait? You think I'm pregnant? No, I'm not pregnant."
Gabrielle,"Well, you assumed wrong."
Gabrielle,I'm on the pill for god's sakes.
Gabrielle,"And another thing, I don't want a four door. I want a sexy little convertible. And I want to buy one. Right now."
Gabrielle,"Well, not this one. 'Cos I vomited in this one."
Gabrielle,Excuse me. This home pregnancy test-is it a good one?
Gabrielle,"Okay, do you have a rest room?"
Gabrielle,Thank you.
Gabrielle,You are out of toilet paper. Bree I'll call you later.
Gabrielle,"Yes. And its impossible, I'm on the pill-which you probably think is a sin, but it works. It's a 99.9% effective sin."
Gabrielle,"You couldn't wait to throw that in, could you? Look, god is screwing with me! He doesn't like the way I live my life, so he's punishing me."
Gabrielle,"No, it was-You just had to be there. But, my point is, that I'll be an awful mother. I'm selfish and I'm self-centred. And the only person more self-centred than me is Carlos! I mean, he's so self-centred that he doesn't even know how self-centred I am! We'd be terrible parents!"
Gabrielle,I want to know who to be angry at.
Gabrielle,I don't have time for this crap. I have a party to plan.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, I just didn't realise how disgusting meat could be."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, you son of a bitch! I am pregnant and it's all your fault!"
Gabrielle,"I think I can honestly say, no, I'm not."
Gabrielle,Thanks.
Gabrielle,I don't know who the father is.
Gabrielle,Yeah.
Gabrielle,Yeah.
Gabrielle,"No, I know, Susan. I don't know what I'm going to do."
Gabrielle,I'll call 911.
Gabrielle,I am pregnant and it is all your fault.
Gabrielle,"Oh, really?!"
Gabrielle,Look! It's been pulled apart and glued back together.
Gabrielle,You can still see the glue marks!
Gabrielle,"Don't insult me, Carlos! You've been whining about wanting a baby for months. Who else could it have been?"
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"Oh, please!"
Gabrielle,"Yeah, so?"
Gabrielle,That Bitch! I can't believe her!
Gabrielle,"Reaching out from the grave to screw with me. God, she's good."
Gabrielle,I feel a wave of morning sickness coming on and I want to be standing on your mother's grave when it hits.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, but I wanted to talk to you in person. I have some potentially upsetting news."
Gabrielle,I'm pregnant and it might be yours.
Gabrielle,"We don't even know for sure if i'ts yours, so relax. Okay, and I didn't come here to watch you freak out."
Gabrielle,I wanna make sure you'll let me protect you.
Gabrielle,"Um, Carlos? Your parents? John, something like this could ruin your life. That's why you have to keep quiet about our affair. There's no point in this catastrophe taking both of us down."
Gabrielle,Forget about it.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, that would have been helpful."
Gabrielle,I can't get it hot enough. My hormones are killing my taste buds..
Gabrielle,I plan on getting really fat as a tribute to your mother.
Gabrielle,John! What are you doing?
Gabrielle,Really? Why?
Gabrielle,"No, nobody expects you to do the right thing."
Gabrielle,What? Are you crazy? He would kill us both!
Gabrielle,John!
Gabrielle,Alright. You win. Wait right here.
Gabrielle,Don't get out.
Gabrielle,Because I was going to get in.
Gabrielle,Yeah. You see pregnant women have very strong urges.
Gabrielle,"I'm going to freshen up, and I'll be right back."
Gabrielle,You sit. Sit!
Gabrielle,I'm turning on some music.
Gabrielle,"Um, Carlos is unavailable at the moment."
Gabrielle,"John, what are you doing?"
Gabrielle,Stop it.
Gabrielle,What the hell are you????
Gabrielle,"John! John, you,you can't."
Gabrielle,Oh my god!
Gabrielle,It's just salsa.
Gabrielle,Really? I've been finding it so bland.
Gabrielle,"John! Stop! Shut the hell up! Listen to me, you are never going to be the father of this baby. No matter what the paternity tests say, it is Carlos' child."
Gabrielle,"Because Carlos can provide, John! He can give this baby everything. Piano lessons and summer camp and the best colleges. He can raise this child the way it deserves to be raised, you can't."
Gabrielle,"If you want what's best for the baby, you will help me. Help me make sure this baby doesn't grow up poor like I did."
Gabrielle,"He, uh-"
Gabrielle,"I'm pregnant, and it might be yours."
Gabrielle,"Hey, I thought you might be thirsty."
Gabrielle,"So, how's your roommate doing?"
Gabrielle,"Well, uh, I had to, um, tell him some news that was a little bit upsetting for him."
Gabrielle,Excuse me?
Gabrielle,It is a complicated situation.
Gabrielle,"Well, if you saw what he did to our pogonias you'd slap him too."
Gabrielle,So is Susan coming?
Gabrielle,She found out it was in self-defense. I think they've cleared everything up.
Gabrielle,Maybe this is a mistake. If there's one thing I've learned men can't be trusted.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, we could do that."
Gabrielle,Susan's coming.
Gabrielle,"I just want to say goodbye, because I'm leaving you."
Gabrielle,"You see, your health insurance sent us a letter because someone ordered a year's worth of birth control pills, and apparently our policy doesn't cover drugs bought by the kilo."
Gabrielle,"The prescription was dated, Carlos, and Juanita was in a coma when this claim was filed. You did this, not your mother. At least be man enough to own up to it. She would've been."
Gabrielle,"Ah, ah, ah, pregnant, cave man, remember?"
Gabrielle,Away.
Gabrielle,I know. That's why I only packed one bag.
Gabrielle,"Oh, your baby?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, Carlos. Whoever said you were the father?"
Gabrielle,Is John here?
Gabrielle,I just left my husband.
Gabrielle,They're charging you with a hate crime?
Gabrielle,With our gay cable guy?
Gabrielle,"Well, you sort of are."
Gabrielle,"Well, obviously."
Gabrielle,"I am not lying for you, Carlos."
Gabrielle,"Am I supposed to be impressed? Because of your little stunt with my birth control pills, I've lost my freedom for the next eighteen years."
Gabrielle,They're charging you with a hate crime?
Gabrielle,With our gay cable guy?
Gabrielle,Hello?
Gabrielle,Danielle called.
Gabrielle,"Honey, the doctors here are great!"
Gabrielle,Then we won't comfort.
Gabrielle,We're just gonna talk about non-crisis things.
Gabrielle,"I'm here to testify for you, Carlos. Can you take those off?"
Gabrielle,There's no way I'm dressing him.
Gabrielle,"Yes, well, Carlos, in some circles, beating people up at all is frowned upon."
Gabrielle,"Well, I'm about to be the mother of your child, which means a lot of responsibility and little time for myself. So if I'm gonna get you out of this mess, you have to reciprocate."
Gabrielle,"When the baby cries in the middle of the night, you're gonna get up without saying one word. Doctors' appointments: you're driving. I'm not putting a car seat in my Maserati. And you will also be on bottle duty. That means washing, sterilizing, and filling. That way I'll have some semblance of a life, and then maybe I won't hate you so much."
Gabrielle,"All right, there we go. So we're good? See you in court."
Gabrielle,"Oh, honey, if you can swing that one, more power to you."
Gabrielle,"Your Honor, this whole mess is just a result of my loneliness. My marriage is a bit strained, and after Carlos was convicted-"
Gabrielle,"Oh, no, no, I'm talking about his other crime."
Gabrielle,"Anyway, he was placed under house arrest, and he being the jealous man that he is, got a little crazy every time I left the house."
Gabrielle,"He knows how men look at me, and, well, I, I didn't exactly ease his mind. I falsely led him to believe I was having an affair. And, and before Carlos's house arrest, he was always working, and he was never with me. And I thought that maybe if he believed I was having an affair, he would realize he loved me. And I know it sounds stupid, I do. I just-"
Gabrielle,"My point is that Carlos is an angry, jealous Neanderthal. But he's not a gay-basher."
Gabrielle,Aaah. Carlos!
Gabrielle,Stop it!
Gabrielle,Who ever said you were the father?
Gabrielle,John! How did you get in here?
Gabrielle,"No, I'm pregnant, you jackass!"
Gabrielle,Do you have any idea what you've done? That little stunt you pulled yesterday in the courtroom could get Carlos sent away for eight years!
Gabrielle,You brought luggage?
Gabrielle,The three of us? How exactly does that benefit Carlos?
Gabrielle,You don't know it's your baby. I don't even know it's your baby. And I don't wanna know 'cause it doesn't matter!
Gabrielle,"Well, up until the point that you told my husband we were having an affair, I was quite fond of you. Since then, not a fan!"
Gabrielle,She doesn't look that busy to me.
Gabrielle,"Honey, we are so sorry."
Gabrielle,"So you're just not gonna talk to me, is that it? Fine. I don't need to talk. Okay. Yes, I had a little affair. It wasn't the best thing to do, and I'm not proud of it. But it's not the worst thing that could have happened. Nobody died. Oh, don't be such a martyr, Carlos. Okay, it takes two people. How many times did you go off on your little business trips and leave me alone? See, so technically, you cheated, too. It's just your mistress was your work."
Gabrielle,"No, okay. That was a stretch. I'm sorry. Carlos, wait! Come back. Look, I wanna start over. We're gonna have a baby. Isn't that what you always wanted? Carlos, wait! I said I was sorry and I love you! What more do you want?"
Gabrielle,"Hi, uh, I need a paternity test."
Gabrielle,"Oh, no, no. I don't need to take a test. I am just trying to reassure my husband of what I know is true in my heart. So if you could just slip me someone else's test results, I could make my own. I got Photoshop for Christmas. Oh, come on. You look like a fun-loving girl. I am sure you've been in a couple hairy situations of your own."
Gabrielle,Paternity test results? I know. I'm in the same situation.
Gabrielle,Mm-hmm.
Gabrielle,Okay. We're in slightly different situations. But do you wanna get a cup of coffee and talk about it?
Gabrielle,Yeah. Us girls have to stick together. We shouldn't let a stupid piece of paper ruin our life.
Gabrielle,Here it is in black and white. It's your kid. What? Why aren't you smiling?
Gabrielle,"What, you want a father's day card?"
Gabrielle,"You knew the one thing I didn't want was a child, and you still tricked me into getting pregnant!"
Gabrielle,Damn straight. What you did was worse.
Gabrielle,"No, we're not."
Gabrielle,Me too. Look on the bright side. At least we're still rich.
Gabrielle,"Isn't it bizarre that Paul and Mary Alice had this secret all those years, and we didn't even know about it?"
Gabrielle,"This is ridiculous, you know that?"
Gabrielle,Don't you think I have better things to do than to bring you checks every day? Checks that I could be signing at home?
Gabrielle,"You know, taking away my access to our account, that's just vindictive."
Gabrielle,Do you know how long it takes me to schlep out here to this hellhole?
Gabrielle,"That's ridiculous. You're my husband. I love you. Obviously, I would come visit."
Gabrielle,"I'm getting really tired of this song, Carlos. Isn't it about time you forgave me?"
Gabrielle,"Be careful, Carlos. Up until now, I've been really lonely in that big bed of ours, but when you're rude to me, it makes me wanna be not so lonely."
Gabrielle,Why are all rich men jerks?
Gabrielle,"Sure, baby."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, what is this big emergency? I had to cancel my hair appointment with Eduardo today. Baby, what is it?"
Gabrielle,Why?
Gabrielle,"Honey, you and your macho pride. Just tell him you're flattered, but you don't swing that way."
Gabrielle,Really? How?
Gabrielle,"Well, how much money?"
Gabrielle,Seven thousand dollars?!
Gabrielle,Why would he think you have that kind of money?
Gabrielle,"Oh, right. Sorry."
Gabrielle,He's actually willing to take a check?
Gabrielle,"Honey, I think this is a mistake. If we give in to extortion, the guy's just gonna keep coming back for more money."
Gabrielle,"You're a strong guy. You went to college on an athletic scholarship, for God sakes!"
Gabrielle,Oh.
Gabrielle,Excuse me. I'm looking for Rita Rivara.
Gabrielle,"Hi, are you Rita?"
Gabrielle,"I'm, uh, I'm Gabrielle Solis. Our, our husbands are roommates at the prison."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I see. Well, uh, your boyfriend asked my husband to give this to you. It's a sort of favor. It's all there. Seven thousand dollars."
Gabrielle,"Oh, don't even think about it."
Gabrielle,"Um, hello! Is there a problem?"
Gabrielle,Okay.
Gabrielle,Excuse me?
Gabrielle,"Uh, they're, they're nice."
Gabrielle,You're right. That was weird.
Gabrielle,"Uh, no. No. You, you seem to have everything you need."
Gabrielle,So are you gonna do it?
Gabrielle,"Not that it's any of my business, but it's your body. I wouldn't change anything unless I really wanted to."
Gabrielle,"Honey, he's in jail. How far is he gonna go? Maybe it's time you stood up for yourself. Tell him you don't need the surgery."
Gabrielle,There you go. I am so proud of you.
Gabrielle,"Carlos, what happened?"
Gabrielle,Is that what Richie said?
Gabrielle,"Well, it's not my fault. She didn't want the money."
Gabrielle,Because it's for a boob job.
Gabrielle,"So, her boobs are fine. And, honestly, what he's doing to her self-esteem is just cruel. I feel sorry for her."
Gabrielle,"Well, I do think it's silly to give someone seven thousand dollars if they don't want it."
Gabrielle,I just realized Rita and I have a lot in common.
Gabrielle,"We are both controlled by our husbands, which is idiotic because they're both behind bars. We should have all the power."
Gabrielle,This isn't about that.
Gabrielle,"Me either, Carlos. And if you expect me to go back and sweet talk her into getting the operation, I can't show up empty-handed."
Gabrielle,"See, I was thinking I'd be writing the checks."
Gabrielle,"Careful, Carlos, you're not in a position to argue."
Gabrielle,Hey--
Gabrielle,Ralph.
Gabrielle,You know me.
Gabrielle,"Uh, our anniversary."
Gabrielle,How could you forget our anniversary? You sit in a cell all day long staring at a calendar.
Gabrielle,"Oh, we're not doing this again."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, and husbands remember anniversaries, so I guess we're even."
Gabrielle,You are clearly determined to ruin this special day for us.
Gabrielle,"I feel tons of guilt, so back off."
Gabrielle,I apologized a million times.
Gabrielle,"A woman does need to be loved, and since you didn't give it to me, I had to find it elsewhere."
Gabrielle,"Say what you want, but John Rowland loved me like no one ever has. Not as a trophy or as a possession, but for me. He loved me."
Gabrielle,"No, he really did."
Gabrielle,"Let me count the ways. Um, gently, savagely, frequently, upside down--"
Gabrielle,"No, it's our anniversary. We're just reliving the good times."
Gabrielle,Uh-huh. Brand-new. Limited edition. A little anniversary present from my husband.
Gabrielle,More than he knows.
Gabrielle,"Hello, John. Long time, no see."
Gabrielle,"Well, someone had to tend to the yard. You were busy elsewhere."
Gabrielle,"Yes, and I have to say she's old enough to be your mother. Hell, she's old enough to be my mother."
Gabrielle,Joan? You're calling her Joan?
Gabrielle,"I know you're friends, and I have a hunch you don't do to your friends what I saw you doing to that wrinkly old lady."
Gabrielle,You're supposed to be in love with me.
Gabrielle,"How many times did you say it? How many times did you whisper in my ear, ""You're the only woman I'll ever love?"""
Gabrielle,So were you lying to me? Were you just trying to get me into bed?
Gabrielle,"Yeah, like five minutes ago! Haven't you ever heard of a mourning period?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god."
Gabrielle,"No. Oh, no, no. It's me. I am beyond stupid."
Gabrielle,"Oh, no, I am. Yesterday, I was still fantasizing that it could work with you, that a one-bedroom apartment might be cozy."
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god. I almost left my husband for someone who calls me Mrs. Solis."
Gabrielle,"That's okay, sweetie. I'm good."
Gabrielle,"Actually, John, given how stupid both of us have been, this an entirely appropriate ending."
Gabrielle,"Um, I've been thinking, you know, about, um, everything that happened with John, and, and, um, I was really selfish and stupid. And I'm sorry. I really am sorry. That's all I had to say, really."
Gabrielle,Really?
Gabrielle,"Actually, the one you gave me is really nice, too."
Gabrielle,I don't think a conjugal visit is such a ridiculous request.
Gabrielle,"But, I don't think I can wait that long."
Gabrielle,Excuse me! We are husband and wife. When we make love it is a very sacred covenant.
Gabrielle,"Okay, look, all we need is twenty minutes."
Gabrielle,You can't tell me no.You work for me. You will make it happen!
Gabrielle,Oh really. Then how about for this?
Gabrielle,"Carlos, will you calm down?"
Gabrielle,It wasn't a riot. It was more of a melee.
Gabrielle,He called me a bitch.
Gabrielle,He refused to help me get a conjugal visit.
Gabrielle,"Not just for me. For us. In case you haven't noticed, Carlos, our marriage is still on shaky ground."
Gabrielle,"It couldn't hurt! Ever since you've been in here, all we do is bicker!"
Gabrielle,"Yeah, but when we would finish arguing, we had this great sex! Now all we do is fight and there's no payoff and it sucks! You and I need to get laid!"
Gabrielle,"Oh, don't judge me! You're not in here because you got caught helping the poor."" ""See, we'd be enjoying this argument more if we had something to look forward to!"
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"You were about to turn me down, then you reconsidered once you realized I was gonna throw a ton of money at you. Which I am."
Gabrielle,Is this about the gay bashing thing? He's innocent.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, but that was a jealously thing. The man that my husband was trying to kill in court is not the least bit gay. Trust me."
Gabrielle,Why does everybody have a problem with me having sex with my husband?
Gabrielle,Only if it ends with me getting what I want.
Gabrielle,Excuse me?
Gabrielle,"But, I-"
Gabrielle,"Reservation! You're eating alone, remember? And I have a feeling it's not the first time!"
Gabrielle,"You have some nerve, leaving that message on my machine."
Gabrielle,I will tell you what is inappropriate. You making sweeping assumptions about the state of my marriage.
Gabrielle,No. I like to keep a clear head when I'm telling people off. What makes you think you know anything about me or my husband?
Gabrielle,Would those be the same instincts that picked out that cologne?
Gabrielle,"With all due respect, I will decide for myself what needs to be scratched and when."
Gabrielle,Are you hitting on me?
Gabrielle,I'd say I'm pregnant!
Gabrielle,"I'm not stuck, Mr. Bradley. Believe it or not, I love my husband."
Gabrielle,I'll pay you six and I expect a conjugal visit tomorrow by noon.
Gabrielle,Like you said. I want what I want when I want it.
Gabrielle,Thank God you were in flats.
Gabrielle,"No, Susan, come on. Zach attacked Felicia. He, he blew up your kitchen. Evidently he tried to kill Mike. We can all agree this kid's a freak!"
Gabrielle,"Yes, we got it. Uh, we interrupt our lovemaking to answer the phone or you call out the dogs."
Gabrielle,I'm ready whenever you-
Gabrielle,Obviously are.
Gabrielle,"Carlos, are we gonna make it?"
Gabrielle,"No. I'm talking about us. Our relationship, our marriage. Carlos, you're gonna be a father. When you get out of here, you're gonna need to get a job and make an honest living, for me and our child."
Gabrielle,"Okay, enough chit chat. We only have thirty minutes left and I want to make the most of it."
Gabrielle,Are you hitting on me?
Gabrielle,"No, it's his foot."
Gabrielle,"Well, that settles it. When this baby's born, I'll be in charge of putting on the socks."
Gabrielle,"Yeah? Well, if you don't mind the hemorrhoids and the nausea, it's quite the party."
Gabrielle,I wonder where David is. He should have been here by now.
Gabrielle,He's quite the shark. You're gonna love him. He hasn't lost a case in six years. He argued in front of the State Supreme Court and he made our conjugal visit happen pretty damn fast.
Gabrielle,"Oh, David."
Gabrielle,What the hell are you doing?
Gabrielle,About time.
Gabrielle,The what?
Gabrielle,We would love to come.
Gabrielle,Shaky at best.
Gabrielle,I don't know. I hired a brilliant lawyer to get my husband out of this hellhole and he fired him. For no reason at all.
Gabrielle,"Why not? He's experienced, he's intelligent, he's successful."
Gabrielle,Oh my god. You fired him because you're jealous?
Gabrielle,"Oh, Bob, you beat your wife. You are so not allowed to gasp."
Gabrielle,"One more word out of you, Lisa, and I will back hand you myself."
Gabrielle,I'm not discussing this anymore. You can rot in here for all I care.
Gabrielle,"By the way, he was wearing a suit. How do you know he had a good body?"
Gabrielle,No!
Gabrielle,What are you doing here?
Gabrielle,"Yeah. I thought you'd schedule an appointment later. Right now, I'm, I'm sort of disgusting and sweaty."
Gabrielle,"I don't want a new lawyer. I want you. So does Carlos, he just doesn't realize it yet."
Gabrielle,"Look, to be honest, Carlos is a little threatened by you. He thinks if we spend too much time together that something might happen."
Gabrielle,"David, we're not here to drink wine, okay? This is business. Now you have to convince Carlos that he can trust you."
Gabrielle,I don't know. Tell him you're happily married or gay!
Gabrielle,You're a lawyer. You lie to juries all the time. Can't you just make something up?
Gabrielle,"Okay, skip it. I'm holding my marriage together by my fingernails. If Carlos serves his full sentence, I don't think we're gonna make it. So please, I need you."
Gabrielle,Are you gonna help me or not?
Gabrielle,Really. What are you gonna say?
Gabrielle,"Hey, that's my wine!"
Gabrielle,"Oh for Pete's sake, Carlos. At least listen to the man."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, he's kidding. Tell him you're kidding."
Gabrielle,"Honey. I am so sorry. Honestly, that guy's insane!"
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"But, Carlos-"
Gabrielle,Where are we going?
Gabrielle,Are you sure?
Gabrielle,"Honey, I know you're hurt but are you sure you're not gonna change your mind? I mean, there's no turning back after this."
Gabrielle,"Excuse me. Hello, David."
Gabrielle,"Yes, you did, and I considered it for about a second."
Gabrielle,"David, I know you're the lawyer and all, but trust me, it's never a smart strategy to cover this up."
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,Are you okay?
Gabrielle,Are you seeing this?
Gabrielle,He's just mowing the lawn like nothing ever happened. What should we do? Should we call the police?
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god, Susan's home."
Gabrielle,Has she seen Paul yet?
Gabrielle,We know what you did to Mrs. Huber.
Gabrielle,"Why don't you ask Mike? He overheard everything, right?"
Gabrielle,"Well, you protected me from a hail of gun fire, so I thought I'd stop by and give you a card."
Gabrielle,"What do you mean, I'm your first visitor? You've been here two days."
Gabrielle,Oh.
Gabrielle,"Dear David, who knew you could actually bleed? Sincerely, your stunned co-workers."
Gabrielle,You're not gonna eat?
Gabrielle,"Well, I'm not gonna let you starve to death. Besides, you're gonna need your strength to get my husband out of jail."
Gabrielle,Of course you were.
Gabrielle,For what?
Gabrielle,"Sure. Now, open up."
Gabrielle,"David, where are you going?"
Gabrielle,You can't just quit in the middle of a hearing.
Gabrielle,Yeah. Why not?
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"Okay, yeah, David, if you don't get back in there right now, I will go get a gun and shoot you myself."
Gabrielle,"Look, I know the timing is bad."
Gabrielle,"I feel terrible. How was I supposed to know that he would take a bullet and suddenly realize he's in love with me? Okay, look, I know I pushed you into hiring that creep, but I promise I will do anything I can to fix this."
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,You think David and I planned this so we could sleep together?
Gabrielle,How dare you think that of me? I have been nothing but faithful to you! Since you've been in here.
Gabrielle,"And you know what? A lesser woman would let you rot in here, but I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction. So you better start packing up your shanks or whatever you people make in here, because you're coming home with me!"
Gabrielle,There are some ground rules first. I'm not leaving my husband. Carlos is looking at spending eight years in jail because of my lapse of judgment with the gardener. I can't let him rot in there. I'd be filled with guilt.
Gabrielle,"Not an option. I'm Catholic, hence the guilt."
Gabrielle,"This, us, stolen moments, seeing each other whenever we can. Carlos never needs to know."
Gabrielle,I thought this was what you wanted.
Gabrielle,Then it's nothing.
Gabrielle,"I said I was Catholic, not a fanatic. You know, David, you could tell me to stop. Just tell me to stop, and I will, or you can have me right now, on my terms."
Gabrielle,Making my point. You don't love me.
Gabrielle,"No. You just agreed to an affair. A cheap, illicit affair with the woman you love? Carlos would never share me. He's looking at eight years in prison because the mere thought of it sent him into a violent rage. That is love. This is, this is just lust, mixed with posttraumatic stress. I will see you in court tomorrow at ten a.m. and don't be late, or else I'll have you disbarred for sexual harassment."
Gabrielle,I don't think so.
Gabrielle,"Fine, I'm pregnant. Whee! Now come on, we are supposed to be cheering up Susan. This is a time of crisis and I think you need another scoop of mint chocolate chip."
Gabrielle,But Zach was starting to obsess with Julie again.
Gabrielle,Not unless we make some.
Gabrielle,It is glorious. I have to have it.
Gabrielle,Vern.
Gabrielle,I know I haven't been to the store lately but I've been a little busy getting my husband out of jail.
Gabrielle,"Luckily, the judge dropped the hate crime charge. So now all Carlos has to do is serve out the slave labor thing. He'll be out in six months."
Gabrielle,Because some of my model friends are coming down from New York on Friday so I have to look better than ever. I can't have them thinking I moved to the suburbs and I shop at strip malls.
Gabrielle,Good. You know what? It's a little snug.
Gabrielle,"Because I wear a double zero, you twerp!"
Gabrielle,Because you just called me fat!
Gabrielle,But I'm only three months pregnant. Women don't show at three months.
Gabrielle,I'm just not gonna eat for two days.
Gabrielle,Ralph! I need help getting dressed. Get in here! Now!
Gabrielle,"I have to fit in this, so for god's sakes, put some muscle into it."
Gabrielle,"Well, try harder."
Gabrielle,"Get me into this dress, and I will pay you ten more dollars a week."
Gabrielle,Oh! Thank god.
Gabrielle,"Bree, it's still too easy to breathe. You've gotta make it tighter."
Gabrielle,I don't care. I can't have these girls thinking I'm pregnant.
Gabrielle,Trust me. They're merciless.
Gabrielle,"When I decided to marry Carlos, I told these girls I would spend the rest of my days being rich and in love and childless, and they laughed at me, and they said I would just end up being another fat hausfrau living a life that I didn't plan. I'm not gonna give them the satisfaction of knowing they were right."
Gabrielle,"Bree, my friends are models. They're never happy for anyone."
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,No.
Gabrielle,"Well, I'm not saying I'm not gonna grow attached to the little bugger. I just don't have the motherhood gene. I wish I did, but I don't. What?"
Gabrielle,"Maybe, but I doubt it."
Gabrielle,Ah. How do I look?
Gabrielle,Bree.
Gabrielle,Hi!
Gabrielle,Bree? It's Gabby!
Gabrielle,"Hi. My, uh, friends just left, and I was hoping you could come over and cut me out of this thing."
Gabrielle,"It was, um, weird."
Gabrielle,"Well, Allison's mad because she's losing jobs to fourteen-year-olds, Holly is on a strict diet of cruciferous vegetables, and Yasmin is undergoing a new embryonic facial treatment that probably causes short-term memory loss. You know, I just stood there the whole night trying to remember why we were ever friends. And I couldn't."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, but that's the thing. They haven't changed. That's who they've always been. I've changed, and I honestly don't know how."
Gabrielle,I doubt that.
Gabrielle,"All right, but hurry up, because I've been having to pee since hors d'oeuvres. Are you free to go shopping tomorrow? I figured it's probably time I bought some clothes that actually fit."
Gabrielle,I like the sound of that. Thanks.
Gabrielle,Wait.
Gabrielle,Aah!
Gabrielle,"Hi, guys."
Gabrielle,"I'm fine. Thank you for the messages. I'm, I'm sorry I haven't had time to return calls."
Gabrielle,That sounds so nice. It's just I'm booked solid today. My head's gonna explode. Can I take a rain check?
Gabrielle,Thanks. Thanks for understanding.
Gabrielle,"Well, I'll tell you what, since it's my schedule that seems to be the problem, why don't I just figure out a time and call you?"
Gabrielle,"I just, I have so many errands to run and a million thing to return."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, you know, I would, but the store has this strict thirty-day return policy."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, what happened?"
Gabrielle,"Carlos, your hands."
Gabrielle,"Jeez, how are you feeling today?"
Gabrielle,Honey.
Gabrielle,"No, I'm good."
Gabrielle,"Oh, well, it was a little soon for that, don't you think? I mean, how can you name something the size of a walnut?"
Gabrielle,Do you like it? I picked it up on the way here.
Gabrielle,We all grieve differently.
Gabrielle,"I go shopping, you rip toilets out of the wall. Different strokes."
Gabrielle,"Oh, please. What do you think?"
Gabrielle,"Of course, I'm sad. It's a sad situation. Now, let go of me."
Gabrielle,"Honey, are you okay?"
Gabrielle,"Well, let's get you another round."
Gabrielle,"Ahhh! Oh, my god! What do you want?"
Gabrielle,"No, it's not cool! Who the hell are you?"
Gabrielle,I'm gonna call the police!
Gabrielle,"Inside what? You mean, you mean, in prison?"
Gabrielle,"No! No, you can't come in!"
Gabrielle,"No! Uh-uh! I can take care of myself, okay?"
Gabrielle,Okay?
Gabrielle,"Yes. Yes, I do. I need my space. Thank you."
Gabrielle,You said you were leaving.
Gabrielle,"Look, the guy who broke in stole ice cream. I don't think I'm in any danger. So you can go. I don't need you."
Gabrielle,Shopping. Not that it's any of your business.
Gabrielle,"Yes, I do."
Gabrielle,Uh-huh.
Gabrielle,Excuse me?
Gabrielle,He thought I was cheating with two gay guys. Are you sure you want to go with perceptive?
Gabrielle,"Yeah, so?"
Gabrielle,"Why is everyone on my back about this? I will deal with my loss my way, okay?"
Gabrielle,So what if it is?
Gabrielle,"You know, I also got a facial, and later on, I'm gonna get a pedicure and an eyebrow wax, so there."
Gabrielle,"No, it's not, because I know what you're thinking."
Gabrielle,"You know what? I am tired of you judging me. What is it gonna take to get rid of you, hmm? What's your last name?"
Gabrielle,Ramos. Here is one thousand dollars. I won't tell Carlos you didn't stick around. It'll be our little secret.
Gabrielle,And then you'll leave?
Gabrielle,"You don't have a, a window thingy."
Gabrielle,"You don't have a door handle, either."
Gabrielle,You're not gonna kill me?
Gabrielle,What am I supposed to think? You lie about protecting me and then you lock me in that heap without door handles so I can't get out.
Gabrielle,"You're kidding, right?"
Gabrielle,What's this for?
Gabrielle,"Okay, that's ridiculous. Besides, I don't feel what you think I'm feeling."
Gabrielle,"Fine, if I do this, will you go?"
Gabrielle,"Okay, should I say something?"
Gabrielle,"Not really, no."
Gabrielle,This is stupid. I didn't even want this baby.
Gabrielle,And I would've been a terrible mother.
Gabrielle,"If it was a boy, I was gonna name it Charlie."
Gabrielle,"And a girl, Aurora."
Gabrielle,Thank you.
Gabrielle,"Uh, I don't know. I can't see him."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, that's him."
Gabrielle,Hello.
Gabrielle,"Uh, yeah, this is her. Did, did something happen with Carlos?"
Gabrielle,He what?
Gabrielle,"No, of course not! He's a moron!"
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,It's so good to see you!
Gabrielle,What happened?
Gabrielle,"Well, what did they do?"
Gabrielle,Mmm. I guess I owe the Pope a thank-you note.
Gabrielle,Wow. That biting thing at the end totally blew my mind. Please tell me you didn't learn that in prison.
Gabrielle,Wait! I'm not done with you yet.
Gabrielle,What is wrong with you? You are totally useless after sex.
Gabrielle,Who is Sister Mary Bernard?
Gabrielle,So pretty much just you.
Gabrielle,A new path?
Gabrielle,What the hell did they do to you in that prison?
Gabrielle,"How do you ease into, 'hi, I'm your illegitimate daughter'?"
Gabrielle,Of course it did. Everyone needs a strong male role model.
Gabrielle,You're up early.
Gabrielle,Huh?
Gabrielle,But it's not even Sunday.
Gabrielle,Really? When did they start doing that?
Gabrielle,I saw your nun!
Gabrielle,"So, she's hot! She's a hot nun!"
Gabrielle,You mean to tell me that this miraculous conversion of yours has nothing to do with fact that the woman standing outside is a knock-out?
Gabrielle,"Oh, I invited Sister Mary Hot Pants over for lunch."
Gabrielle,You said she touched your soul so I just want to make sure her hands are clean.
Gabrielle,"So Sister Mary, tell me what's it like meeting men in prison. Do you bond with all the convicts or was Carlos just special?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, I get it. Sort of like, today's convict is tomorrow's convert."
Gabrielle,Currently? No.
Gabrielle,"Well, sure it can. That's just a lie we tell poor people to keep 'em from rioting."
Gabrielle,It's a joke. Lighten up.
Gabrielle,You are a hypocrite. The money you spent to buy your sports car could buy a mud hut for every peasant in Ecuador.
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,Share? What if you have the car and I need to go shopping?
Gabrielle,"Okay, I think we should all just calm down a little bit!"
Gabrielle,Carlos!
Gabrielle,"I have to, uh--"" ""Uh, here have some of this. No one needs to know."
Gabrielle,"I'm not here to talk you out of anything. Check in this drawer. Carlos, I wanna apologize for the way I've been acting. I mean, here you are trying to turn your life around, and all I can think about are my stupid jealousy issues."
Gabrielle,"No, I mean it. I'm sorry. I wanna be a better person, too. I'm sick of being bad. Forgive me?"
Gabrielle,Really?
Gabrielle,That's so sweet. I feel so close to you right now.
Gabrielle,I'm sorry. Guess I am bad.
Gabrielle,She can wait five minutes. We're giving her a car.
Gabrielle,Hi. Carlos will be down in a little while. We had an intense talk. He's resting.
Gabrielle,"Sorry. He's such an animal but since we have a couple of minutes, why don't we, uh, chat?"
Gabrielle,"Look, I don't mean any disrespect. It's just now that Carlos is home, we need to get back on our routine, and we can't do that if he keeps running off to church and charity bake sales. We need us time. Do you know what I mean?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, good. Good. So it would really help our marriage if you just backed off for a while, okay?"
Gabrielle,Huh?
Gabrielle,I know what you said. I'm wondering why you said it.
Gabrielle,"Well, I guess he should have thought of that before he married me."
Gabrielle,"What the hell kind of nun are you? Look, if you try to come between me and my husband, I will take you down."
Gabrielle,"You listen to me, you little bitch. You do not want to start a war with me."
Gabrielle,"Yeah,that's him."
Gabrielle,Who's sister Mary Bernard?
Gabrielle,You do not want to start a war with me.
Gabrielle,"Sweet, little George Williams."
Gabrielle,"God, and he's our pharmacist. It's enough to turn you holistic."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I hope that little creep suffered."
Gabrielle,You! What the hell did you do with my husband?
Gabrielle,Tell me where he is!
Gabrielle,"Not God, my husband."
Gabrielle,I was just about to ask you the same thing. You were supposed to meet me at the spa.
Gabrielle,That's your excuse? We missed side-by-side water massages. I had to book them weeks in advance.
Gabrielle,There are going to be people dying in this church if you don't wipe that patronizing look off your face!
Gabrielle,"Sister Mary, will you excuse us, please?"
Gabrielle,"We are supposed to be working on our marriage, Carlos, but we can't do that as long as our lady of perpetual stick-up-her-butt has you worrying about thirsty orphans."
Gabrielle,She wants us fighting. She wants you to get tired of me and walk out so she can have you all to herself.
Gabrielle,"She may wear a habit and the beads, but at the end of the day, she is still a woman, just like me, and I know what I'm capable of."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, where are you going? Carlos!"
Gabrielle,I'm concerned about the drought in Kenya.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, and you?"
Gabrielle,"Well, Bon Voyage, Father."
Gabrielle,Sister Mary was going on the trip?
Gabrielle,"I bet she did. How much cash are you short, Father?"
Gabrielle,"Sister Mary, what a lovely surprise."
Gabrielle,"Oh, that's so sweet. I'm really gonna miss you."
Gabrielle,Huh?
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,What happened to Sister Greta?
Gabrielle,"Carlos, you can't do this. You can't just go to Africa."
Gabrielle,"I may be a Catholic, but I am so not above slapping a nun."
Gabrielle,"Boy, Sister Mary's done a number on you."
Gabrielle,"Yes, right. She has you flying halfway across the world to help the poor and there's perfectly good poor right here. For god's sakes, give a buck to a homeless guy."
Gabrielle,"No, it's better because you can do it in the comfort of your own car."
Gabrielle,Here.
Gabrielle,"Honey, he's going to a remote village in Africa. Does it really matter that he's allergic to eggs?"
Gabrielle,"Really? Oh, don't write that down. I wasn't being specific. He's allergic to fish eggs."
Gabrielle,Poor baby's gone his whole life without caviar. Now that's suffering.
Gabrielle,"Baby, that's the fever talking. The doctor said you're having an allergic reaction, but you're gonna be fine, okay?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. Oh, maybe that stupid nun is right. Maybe I am trying to stop you from becoming a better person. It's just that I love you the way you are, greedy, selfish, and insensitive. I'm just scared if you're not those things anymore, you're gonna wake up one day and realize I still am, and then you won't want me."
Gabrielle,"Oh, Carlos."
Gabrielle,"So I finally said,if I'm head cheerleader,then nobody wears panties."
Gabrielle,"The tuba, huh?"
Gabrielle,"No, no, not at all.As a matter of fact,all of my secret crushes were on the band geeks."
Gabrielle,18?
Gabrielle,Poor baby.I would've kissed you.
Gabrielle,"Yes,I would have."
Gabrielle,"Oh, for god sakes,come here.Now on behalf of all the cheerleaders in the world,forgive us."
Gabrielle,"Oh, here,let me take that."
Gabrielle,Was that hysterical?The look on Tom's face!
Gabrielle,You're not serious.
Gabrielle,Okay.
Gabrielle,Okay.
Gabrielle,"You know,we were just having fun,entertaining the crowd."
Gabrielle,Nothing.
Gabrielle,You make it sound like--I was making a pass at your husband.And that's just a little bit insulting.
Gabrielle,You see?
Gabrielle,I'm not worked up.
Gabrielle,"Oh,Oh!it looks like you could use a hand."
Gabrielle,"Oh, come here,you sweet little thing."
Gabrielle,"Oh, god, um, Tom?"
Gabrielle,"Uh, I think she got sick."
Gabrielle,I'm honored.
Gabrielle,"Tom, I need to wipe up.Do you have a towel?"
Gabrielle,Hey!
Gabrielle,"Well, I saw that Tom was overwhelmed,so I thought I'd give him a hand."
Gabrielle,Is there a problem?
Gabrielle,Really? Because I sense that you're annoyed you found me here when you weren't home. Am I wrong?
Gabrielle,"Damn it, Lynette, if this has to do with that stupid kiss the other night,I'm gonna lose it!"
Gabrielle,Lynette thinks I was hitting on you at Bree's party.
Gabrielle,I can't believe you.I have done nothing to deserve this kind of mistrust.
Gabrielle,What does that mean?
Gabrielle,I'll tell you.Your wife doesn't trust me around you because I had an affair with my teenage gardener.
Gabrielle,"Oh.So I know Susan Mayer would never tell.It must've been Helen Rowland.She probably blabbed to all the girls at the salon.And Ida Greenberg goes to that salon.So if ida knows,the whole town knows.And we're just gonna have to move. That's all there is to it.Carlos, can you stop putting for two seconds and show me some support?"
Gabrielle,It was a harmless little kiss!Why is everybody making a big deal about this?
Gabrielle,"You're enjoying this,aren't you?Punishing me, dangling the affair over my head?Well,I won't tolerate it."
Gabrielle,"I'm gonna let you even the score.Carlos,go have an affair."
Gabrielle,I had my little indiscretion.So you go have you.Get it out of your system.I know you want to.
Gabrielle,Sure you do.Knock yourself out.Call up an old college flame.Rent a call girl.Fly to Africa and nail that little nun you've been drooling over.I don't care!
Gabrielle,"No, I'm pragmatic.Because once you finish your fling,we'll be equals again.And then you won't be able to judge me.And we can go back to being a boring, average married couple.Oh, just do me a favor. Don't bring back any diseases."
Gabrielle,"Actually,I'm right in the middle of something,and I don't know when I'll be done."
Gabrielle,All done.
Gabrielle,"Yes, it is.We worked it out."
Gabrielle,"Oh, whatever,close enough."
Gabrielle,Okay.
Gabrielle,"No, not really.Does it matter?"
Gabrielle,Okay.What's the 1%?
Gabrielle,"No.I kissed Tom,and it was a harmless joke.I think if I had kissed anybody else's husband,they would've laughed and then forgot about it ten seconds later."
Gabrielle,"See? I don't care.That's--just a waste of time--and spit.Oh. Okay.Okay, okay, okay."
Gabrielle,Okay! Okay!I get your point.
Gabrielle,So are we thinking this is Paul?
Gabrielle,#NAME?
Gabrielle,Have you guys noticed how friendly Betty's been since that body was found in front of her house?
Gabrielle,"Bree,maybe you should call in a favor from your police detective pal,have him poke around."
Gabrielle,Betty! Matthew.
Gabrielle,Count me in.
Gabrielle,"Ralph,if this is about Luis overwatering the hydrangeas again,I told you,no one likes a tattletale."
Gabrielle,"Oh,I'm sorry.I didn't know you and Bonita were having problems."
Gabrielle,Why?
Gabrielle,Ralph!Make your point.
Gabrielle,"Uh,Ralph,why are you telling me this?"
Gabrielle,"Oh,my god!"
Gabrielle,"Well,um,thank you,Ralph,for bringing this to my attention."
Gabrielle,"Baby,what you're about to see will most likely shock and upset you."
Gabrielle,"Remember Scott,the photographer I was dating when we met?The one I dumped for you,who never really got over it and who I always said was gonna get back at me?"
Gabrielle,"Oh,Carlos,I love you so much."
Gabrielle,"Scott's web site,with pictures of me on it.well,say something."
Gabrielle,It was supposed to be funny--a naughty little Christmas gift for my boyfriend.
Gabrielle,"I know,I was freakishly flexible back then.I'm sorry!Look,what are we gonna do about this?"
Gabrielle,I gave these pictures to him as a gift.He owns them.
Gabrielle,"Not necessarily.See,here's what I'm thinking--Scott's a coward,so you could totally put the scare into him.All you gotta do is go and rough him up,and he'll take my pictures off the web site like that."
Gabrielle,"And I would love to,but I have the upper body strength of a kitten.I need a brute!"
Gabrielle,"Well,when you left prison,did they leave you a contact list?"
Gabrielle,"Good morning,Luis,Ralph."
Gabrielle,"Good morning,honey."
Gabrielle,"Well,I thought about what you said--about the pictures--and you're right.It was my mistake and I have to live with it."
Gabrielle,I'm living with it!
Gabrielle,"Aw,you're so mean."
Gabrielle,Why? You either care if men leer at me or not.And you made it clear that you don't.So what's the point?
Gabrielle,"Then you better think of another way to get my pictures back.Because if you don't,people on Wisteria Lane are gonna be seeing a lot more of me!Ralph,Luis,feast your eyes!"
Gabrielle,"Okay,go get him,tiger."
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,You promised!
Gabrielle,"It doesn't work that way.Okay,look,I'm really trying to understand your moral dilemma here,I am.But if you don't get my pictures back,I'm gonna be humiliated.You think our gardener is the only local pervsurfing the web?"
Gabrielle,You used to go crazy when men would so much as look at me the wrong way--and that's when I had clothes on.
Gabrielle,Or maybe you just don't love me as much as you used to.
Gabrielle,"If you really loved me,I wouldn't have to ask!Fine,forget it."
Gabrielle,Be a good person.Knock yourself out.
Gabrielle,What are you doing?
Gabrielle,Now that's my guy.
Gabrielle,"If you're trying to come between me and my husband,I will take you down."
Gabrielle,She's okay.
Gabrielle,Knock it off.
Gabrielle,"Babies, babies, babies.You sound llike a broken record.I just had a miscarriage.It's gonna take some time before I'm ready to get pregnant again."
Gabrielle,Stop it. Let's just enjoy the here and now.We're together. Our marriage is back on track. Life is good.
Gabrielle,Son of a bitch!
Gabrielle,Sure.
Gabrielle,Okay.
Gabrielle,I'm sorry.I can't promise that.
Gabrielle,"Because I can't say that I'm gonna wake up tomorrow and suddenly wanna do something that I swore my entire life.I would never do. ""maybe"" is a very big step for me."
Gabrielle,"Well, I'm sorry, but you're just gonna have to accept it.There's nothing else you can do."
Gabrielle,Excuse me?
Gabrielle,"You are threatening me with an annulment?That conniving little bitch put you up to this, didn't she?Didn't she?"
Gabrielle,The only promise I am making you is that this is so not over.
Gabrielle,"Oh, um, I'm looking for Father Crowley.Do you know where he is?"
Gabrielle,"Who cares?Father, it's me."
Gabrielle,"Yeah.Look,I need you to do something for me.I need you to get rid of Sister Mary Bernard."
Gabrielle,Because she's ruining my marriage.
Gabrielle,"Yes!At first it started with the love letters while he was in prison,and the next thing I know,they're spending day and night together--sneaking off to private bible study,and one-on-one spiritual consultation."
Gabrielle,"And if that wasn't enough, he is saying her name in his sleep. It's disgusting.He's like a lovesick puppy."
Gabrielle,Yeah-- yep.They're having sex.Carlos confessed everything--right before he asked for an annulment.
Gabrielle,"Mm, not that long ago.Look, I sorta told a fib,so--how many ""Hail Marys"" is that gonna set me back?"
Gabrielle,Who was that?
Gabrielle,You're kidding me. Why?
Gabrielle,"Ah,Vatican politics.What's wrong?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, well, maybe you should go lie down.I'm gonna be out for a while."
Gabrielle,I heard you were being transferred so I came to say good-bye.
Gabrielle,"No, we've had our differences,but that doesn't mean I'm happy to see you shipped off to Alaska.Brr."
Gabrielle,"Me? Oh, I'm just a humble sinner.You're the one with all the power around here--all the-- annulment mojo."
Gabrielle,Maybe not--but you certainly are.You missed a spot.
Gabrielle,Ah! Oh.That was a mistake.
Gabrielle,There.I think we're all done here.
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god!Oh, my god! Hold on!"
Gabrielle,Are you okay?
Gabrielle,"Uh, depends.What have you heard?"
Gabrielle,"Yeah, that's about right."
Gabrielle,"I wasn't, but I was thinking about it on the way over here.And I realized the ass I should be kicking is yours."
Gabrielle,"Yes!Sister Mary manipulated you into threatening me,but you're the idiot that fell for it."
Gabrielle,"You made me a promise, Carlos,a long time ago--till death do us part.And one day you just come home and start throwing words around like annulment.How do you think that makes me feel?"
Gabrielle,"And I need to know I'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with,not just some uterus in high heels."
Gabrielle,"No, Carlos, I am sorry.I am not gonna be blackmailed into giving birth.You have to choose.And I wish you would do it so I can move on with my life."
Gabrielle,"I think that's the right decision.You know,I made a decision, too.The answer to your question earlier is yes."
Gabrielle,I wanna have a baby.I wanna have a baby with you.
Gabrielle,So is that all she said?
Gabrielle,"Oh, Bree,come on, dish already!"
Gabrielle,Hello. what's going on?
Gabrielle,"Oh, the slave.Wow. Looks well-fed."
Gabrielle,"Really? Baby, can I talk to you for a second?"
Gabrielle,Are you nuts?!
Gabrielle,"Oh, this time.You are quickly becoming Father Crowley's go-to guy for charity cases."
Gabrielle,"When he turns our house into a catholic underground railroad, yes!"
Gabrielle,"Well, they should've called ahead."
Gabrielle,"Oh,hi.Do you have to sit around all day?I mean,shouldn't you be out experiencing western civilization while you have the chance?What are you doing?"
Gabrielle,"No, this is couture!This rip has to be fixed by an experienced tailor.You can't just--holy crap!This stitching is perfect!"
Gabrielle,Did you make all of this?Oh!For me? Okay.
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god!"
Gabrielle,I like a lot.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, that's nice.Do you know what they do to people in China who speak out against the government?"
Gabrielle,They put them in forced labor camps.isn't that awful?
Gabrielle,You know what I mean?It's such a repressive regime.We forget how good we have it.
Gabrielle,"Don't you think Xiao-mei would like it better here in America?I mean,where she could learn about freedom and democracy and stuff?"
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"Well, first of all,that was her idea.Second of all,I can't have this conversation until you've tasted her crab puffs."
Gabrielle,"Well, who's forcing her?We'll pay her whatever she wants.And the best part is,with her resum��_��_,any wage will look good."
Gabrielle,Mnh-mnh.Hmm.
Gabrielle,"Oh, this isn't about me.This is about our great nation.And I have no intention of sexually satisfying a man who isn't willing to stand up for and help spread the ideals and values of the United States of America."
Gabrielle,"You like nice things? That's why I think you're stupid,for not wanting to stay here.You could be around my nice things all the time,taking care of them--how fun would that be?Well,I'm sure it's a lot more fun than you'd have in that tiny,godforsaken village of yours.You know,we're probably more alike than people would guess.I'm from a small town, too.My folks had nothing.That's why I love America.Anything is possible."
Gabrielle,"Hmm, you like that?No.An old, fat stockbroker gave this to me.It's not worth anything.You can have it."
Gabrielle,It's okay.Glad you like it.You can brush my hair.
Gabrielle,"Absolutely.Xiao-mei,you are a very special girl,so--so you take care, okay?"
Gabrielle,Oh!
Gabrielle,"Carlos, she wouldn't have been just a maid.She would have been the best damn maid ever."
Gabrielle,Shut up.
Gabrielle,"Oh, really?Oh, of course you can stay!Oh!"
Gabrielle,"Carlos,she thinks of us as family."
Gabrielle,I want to have a babywith you.
Gabrielle,"Carlos,what are you doing?"
Gabrielle,"Oh.Hi,mom."
Gabrielle,"No,I'm just surprised you're here.It's Valentine's Day.Don't you and Mr. Hedgefund have plans?I know Carlos and I do."
Gabrielle,"What?He was worth,like,$6 million."
Gabrielle,"For some people,but we're talking about you now,mother."
Gabrielle,"Yeah,we're just sick about it."
Gabrielle,Really?What did you buy?
Gabrielle,Whoa!
Gabrielle,"Okay,mom,put these away!"
Gabrielle,"Okay,you can think she's charming.But don't forget for one second that she is a monster."
Gabrielle,"Well,the doctor's not 100% positive,but it's very,very iffy."
Gabrielle,Don't be so suicidal.We can always adopt.
Gabrielle,What does it matter whose DNA it is?The diapers are still gonna smell the same regardless.
Gabrielle,"Fine.What about surrogacy?I mean,I know it's pricey,but at least the baby would look like us,and I wouldn't get stretch marks.It's a win-win."
Gabrielle,"What I want is for you to lighten up.We don't have a lot of options, and you're gonna have to pick one."
Gabrielle,So?
Gabrielle,"Mother,no!"
Gabrielle,"Off the top of my head,you're on medicare?"
Gabrielle,"Look,I don't care if she shot triplets out of her ass.It's not gonna happen.Can you believe this?"
Gabrielle,"Carlos,you are not seriously considering this."
Gabrielle,"I have a migraine.I'm gonna go lay down upstairs.Then when I get up,I hope we can all talk about this like rational human beings."
Gabrielle,"Hey--I don't know about you,but I am tired of all the tension around here,so I was thinking we could go shopping,have some fun.Then maybe later we can talk about the surrogacy thing,see if we can make it work."
Gabrielle,"Oh,it's in the hotel lobby.So go ahead,I'm right behind ya."
Gabrielle,I'm going home.
Gabrielle,"Here's how it's gonna work--you're gonna check yourself into the hotel,and then tomorrow,you're gonna plant your child bearing hips on a plane,and you're gonna leave our lives forever."
Gabrielle,I'm pulling out.Watch your boobs.
Gabrielle,"Okay,first of all,no one asked you.And the only reason you care about my mother is because of that ridiculous suggestion she offered."
Gabrielle,Generous?Don't you see the strings attached?
Gabrielle,"The only reason she offered up her dusty womb is because she's screwed.Her latest sugar daddy gave her the boot,so mom needs a place to stay and money.So trust me,if she carried our child,we'd be footing the bill for years."
Gabrielle,"Maybe,but you don't know her like I do."
Gabrielle,It wouldn't have done any good.
Gabrielle,"Because--she knew exactly what was going on with alejandro,and she chose to look the other way."
Gabrielle,"Because if I did,then she, we--because--there was a chance she wouldn't have believed me,and--and that would've hurt a lot worse than anything he ever did to me."
Gabrielle,"I'm getting her luggage back to her,and that's the best I can do."
Gabrielle,So? How did it go?
Gabrielle,Ah.
Gabrielle,What was that for?
Gabrielle,Seriously?But I thought you wanted a kid with your own DNA?
Gabrielle,"I'm the one who was sleeping with your son,but it's over now."
Gabrielle,"Oh,my god!"
Gabrielle,"Oh,nothing,really.Carlos and I are gonna go see the adoption counselor today."
Gabrielle,She barely mentioned it.
Gabrielle,"Oh,Bree, she didn't trash you. Honest."
Gabrielle,"No,I'm good."
Gabrielle,"Wow,did you smell the alcohol on her breath?"
Gabrielle,Oh.
Gabrielle,So how does this work?Do we flip through a catalog or something?
Gabrielle,Really?
Gabrielle,"So,um,we're auditioning to be parents?"
Gabrielle,"So just to be clear,some slutty cheerleader gets knocked up by the soccer coach behind the local gas 'n gulp,and she is going to make sure we're quality people?"
Gabrielle,"Oh,here's one we took on vacation."
Gabrielle,So?
Gabrielle,"Yeah,but it's St. Barts,and your hands are covering my naughty parts."
Gabrielle,"Yeah,that was a good trip."
Gabrielle,Fine. We won't use it.
Gabrielle,"So we like to have fun. I mean,who doesn't understand that better than an unwed,knocked-up teenager?"
Gabrielle,"Well,then we'll just have to find someone who can do it for us."
Gabrielle,You're in advertising.You can do it.Just write us a character reference saying we're great with kids.
Gabrielle,"Keeping that in mind,would it also be okay if we were your kids' godparents?"
Gabrielle,"Great,and can we take some fake pictures to document it?"
Gabrielle,"Well,as long as they don't make me play guitar,I think we're home free."
Gabrielle,Mm-hmm. Yes.
Gabrielle,"Parker and,uh--Porter,uh--and,uh--well,they're all P's.It is super cute."
Gabrielle,Preston!The other one's name is Preston.
Gabrielle,"Okay,first of all,it was statutory,and it happened so long ago."
Gabrielle,Will you shut up?
Gabrielle,"Carlos,we're Catholics,okay?God is pretty Johnny One Note on the whole subject of procreation.Hey,and will you stop with this defeatist attitude?Okay,do you wanta baby or not?"
Gabrielle,"Well,then who the hell does?I mean,look at all the idiots popping kids.Okay,they're not any more qualified than we are."
Gabrielle,"Look,Carlos--it doesn't matter what we've done in our past.Being a parent means rising to the occasion,and that's exactly what we're gonna do when we bring our baby home."
Gabrielle,"Well,this is the first time someone told me I couldn't have one."
Gabrielle,"There are ways to get babies,Carlos.It just might cost us."
Gabrielle,"$20,000.Is that proof enough for you?"
Gabrielle,"There are ways to get babies, Carlos."
Gabrielle,"$20,000.00"
Gabrielle,"Carlos, come on!They're here!"
Gabrielle,"Right, uh, lots of love.Honey, can I talk to you for a second?"
Gabrielle,"Okay. okay, look, we have to find another mother."
Gabrielle,"Okay, this isn't easy to say,so I'm just gonna say it,but have you taken a good look at her?"
Gabrielle,"No, plain I can handle.Carlos,since that woman has walked into our house,the clocks have stopped working."
Gabrielle,"With her DNA,the only thing that kid's gonna be winning is best in show.Look, Carlos, I am sorry,but I want a pretty baby,so let's find another mother."
Gabrielle,"Fine. Just know that in a couple of days,when that thing is born,and you're gonna have to cuddle and snuggle up with something with that face on it, don't come crying to me."
Gabrielle,Sorry.
Gabrielle,"These can't be our only choices, Mr. Beale.I mean, come on.Each girl is uglier than the next."
Gabrielle,"I don't care if it's a walk in the sewer.We are hemorrhaging money into your bank account,and I expect to see results."
Gabrielle,"If I wanted to catch flies,all I would have to do is call up one of these girls.Trust me, the flies would follow."
Gabrielle,We're gonna have to stare at this face for the next 18 years.I don't think now is the time to skimp on quality.
Gabrielle,"Wow, that--that sounds like interesting work."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, we'll do that.So, Libby, who's the father?"
Gabrielle,"No! No, actually, all we think about when we look at you is how pretty you are."
Gabrielle,"Oh, It's actually pronounced Solis."
Gabrielle,Nope. Latino.Proud of it.
Gabrielle,Yeah. My little girl's gonna inherit some wonderful genes.
Gabrielle,"Yes, it's all natural,from her straight teeth to her ""c"" cup.And I know she's athletic because she's a pole dancer,so I really hope that my little girl inherits that as well.No, the athletic gene,not the pole dancing gene."
Gabrielle,Yeah. When did they stop hating each other?
Gabrielle,Why?I thought they always annoyedthe heck out of each other.
Gabrielle,What is it?
Gabrielle,Why?
Gabrielle,"What?! Why,I--that's discrimination.It's illegal.We could have her arrested."
Gabrielle,"No! No,you don't just toss people aside because of the color of their skin."
Gabrielle,"Well,that's different."
Gabrielle,"Because I've read the constitution,and it does not protect ugly people."
Gabrielle,"No. No,no,no.I want that woman's baby,and I'm gonna get it."
Gabrielle,"Well,first of all,I'm gonna show her one of our tax returns.Once she sees how much money we have,I have a hunch we're gonna look a whole lot whiter."
Gabrielle,"Well,thank you,sweetie.I clean up well for a wetback,don't I?"
Gabrielle,Please. Do I look middle class to you?
Gabrielle,So is that what it's gonna take to change your mind--a gift?Fine. What do you want?
Gabrielle,You like jewelry?
Gabrielle,"Well,here."
Gabrielle,"Honey,the one in the center is 3 karats."
Gabrielle,"Well,my husband and I can expose you to a lot of nice new things."
Gabrielle,"Well,like they say,there's no such thing as a free lunch."
Gabrielle,Really?Just like that?
Gabrielle,I always hated math.
Gabrielle,"You never gave a crap that we were Mexican,did you?"
Gabrielle,So why put me through this?
Gabrielle,Wow. You're a lot smarter than I thought.
Gabrielle,Who's the father?
Gabrielle,"Well,why wouldn't she?It's exactly what she asked for,the most expensive one in the store.You know,I'm telling you,Carlos.I'm getting really tired of kissing her ass."
Gabrielle,"Look,we spent a lot of money on that.The least you can do is open it so we can bask in your happy expression."
Gabrielle,"Libby,you didn't tell us you had a boyfriend."
Gabrielle,"Oh,honey,he's right,okay.That trashy girl has been lying to us from the get-go.Let's just walk away while we can. It's not worth it."
Gabrielle,You said we could give her gifts.Everybody loves getting cash.
Gabrielle,How much are you gonna give him?
Gabrielle,Thousand?He's a bouncer in a strip club.Offer him eight.
Gabrielle,"Are we talking about the same idiot?I think for $8,000,he'd throw in a kidney."
Gabrielle,"You know,that's your problem,Carlos.Remember when you bought your car? You paid sticker.Nobody pays sticker!"
Gabrielle,"I'm thinking $12,000."
Gabrielle,"Okay,we're done."
Gabrielle,"There is nothing to work out.If Frank is not on board with this,it's over."
Gabrielle,"Wait,if it's not Frank's,then whose is it?"
Gabrielle,You think this is funny?
Gabrielle,"Well,you take care now."
Gabrielle,"Oh,Bree could never have done that!"
Gabrielle,So you think Bree punched Andrew in the face?'Cause I don't.
Gabrielle,"Well,I'm siding with Bree."
Gabrielle,Because I remember being 17.And I would've done a hell of a lot more than punch myself in the eye to get a car.
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,We were supposed to have four weeks.She promised me the baby wasn't due for four more weeks.
Gabrielle,"Exactly. We're not ready!You know,this is a total inconvenience."
Gabrielle,I forgot the lamaze book in my purse!
Gabrielle,"Oh,we missed it!"
Gabrielle,"No,thanks.You guys look like you got it covered."
Gabrielle,"Okay.Hi.Hi.Oh,honey,you were right."
Gabrielle,It was all worth it.
Gabrielle,Shh. In a minute.
Gabrielle,He's gonna light himself on fire with coffee liqueur?
Gabrielle,"Wait,what is she saying?"
Gabrielle,No.I'm not giving up the baby.
Gabrielle,Taking our baby home.
Gabrielle,"Do you really wanna leave this beautiful little girl with that white trash freak show?!Huh?Well,come on,then."
Gabrielle,Hurry up!
Gabrielle,Read the instructions!
Gabrielle,That is after the baby is in.You have to connect it to the car first!I told you we should've got an S.U.V.!
Gabrielle,"Oh,for god's sakes.Just take the baby."
Gabrielle,Here.We're good to go.Give me the baby.
Gabrielle,Maybe.But we don't have to make it easy for them.
Gabrielle,"Look,just buckle up!"
Gabrielle,Do you really wanna leave this beautiful little girl with that white trash freak show?
Gabrielle,"Oh,we just needed the one."
Gabrielle,It was my grandmother's name.
Gabrielle,"You know,I'm a little tired, but it's not too bad."
Gabrielle,"Oh,honey,please.Do I look like a masochist?First thing tomorrow,I'm hiring a nanny and a night nurse."
Gabrielle,"My husband,the comedian."
Gabrielle,"No,it's okay.I'll win this battle later."
Gabrielle,"Yeah,you should go."
Gabrielle,Put down the burrito.What is all this crap about me not getting help?
Gabrielle,"We have the money. What is wrong with getting a little help?Then I'll be able to relax once in a while,and I'll be able to be a better mother."
Gabrielle,"And that's what put her in an early grave!Well,that and the hit-and-run thing."
Gabrielle,"No,I got up twice already.It's your turn."
Gabrielle,What about my sleep?
Gabrielle,Every 40 minutes? When am I supposed to have a life?
Gabrielle,"Fine,fine,fine!"
Gabrielle,"Psst,Xiao-mei.Psst,wake up."
Gabrielle,"The baby won't stop crying, and I haven't slept for two days.Will you please take Lily for a while?"
Gabrielle,"Oh,come on. I won't make you do windows tomorrow."
Gabrielle,"Well,she's a baby.You hold her.You bounce her and, I don't know,maybe sing a little something."
Gabrielle,"Ahh.Oh,and Xiao-mei,Mr. Solis does not need to know about this,okay?"
Gabrielle,Okay.
Gabrielle,"Yeah,honey,can you take that downstairs?Thank you."
Gabrielle,Xiao-mei?
Gabrielle,"Oh,no,Xiao-mei,that's okay. That's okay. I know you were up all night with the baby,and I really appreciate it.You know,I'm very grateful for everything you've been doing for Lily.So to thank you,I bought you a gift certificate to my spa.And you can take a whole day off and just really pamper yourself."
Gabrielle,Mm-hmm.
Gabrielle,"Oh,you're welcome.All right,Lily needs to be bathed and put to bed.I don't wanna miss my yoga class."
Gabrielle,"Hi. Hi,pretty girl.Oh,yes,mommy has to go.Mommy has to go,so she can stay pretty and thin and you can be proud of her."
Gabrielle,Motherhood is such a blessing.I hope you get to experience it one day.
Gabrielle,Xiao-mei?Xiao-mei?I'm late to meet Mrs. Van de Kamp.I'll be back in a little while.
Gabrielle,Bree--I'm so sorry I'm late.
Gabrielle,"Ooh,I'll have a drink.Anything with an umbrella."
Gabrielle,"You know,it's been challenging,but I-I soldier on. So what about you?You look so rested."
Gabrielle,Good for you.I love that spa.
Gabrielle,"Oh,no,you must be mistaken. I just left her.She's at home working."
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"Lily?Lily,mommy's coming!"
Gabrielle,"Oh,thank god!Oh,honey,I'm so sorry.I'm never gonna leave you again. Oh!Yes. Yes."
Gabrielle,"Oh,that's my little girl.Your chakra lining up nice for mommy?That's my girl."
Gabrielle,"No! No,no,no.We're doing just fine.Aren't we,Lily?"
Gabrielle,Mm-hmm.
Gabrielle,"Exactly! Like,""He wouldn't have been with me if he was gettin' it at home."""
Gabrielle,"Look, I think we all know that Karl is a dog.Mm.I mean, but let's face it--if these tramps weren't laying out the buffet,he wouldn't be chowing down."
Gabrielle,"Yes, she needs the bonnet.It completes the outfit."
Gabrielle,"She's never too young to start accessorizing.Besides, all the neighbors are out today,and I want them to see how happy we are and wish they were us."
Gabrielle,Huh?
Gabrielle,"Uh, well, hi, Dale.Nice to meet you.A lot of people have been looking for you."
Gabrielle,"Well, it's a good thing he's here.We can take him to the lawyer's office,and you can sign over full custody to us. Okay."
Gabrielle,You're trying to take our baby!How is it not gonna be ugly?
Gabrielle,"No, you listen!We were granted custody.If you want her,you talk to the judge."
Gabrielle,"What the hell are you doing here, Frank?"
Gabrielle,Like hell!
Gabrielle,Let's talk turkey.What is it gonna take for you to give up the baby?
Gabrielle,"Okay, no, no!Wait, what about a car?Or college?Tuition's a killer these days.I could help you out."
Gabrielle,So why do you want to be a dad?These are your glory days.A baby would ruin your life.
Gabrielle,But it's not even his.
Gabrielle,"No, no, no.I am not letting that idiot use my baby as a bargaining chip."
Gabrielle,"No, it doesn't have to be, okay?Just do the right thing and sign the release form."
Gabrielle,"So my point is,do the right thing,and no one gets hurt."
Gabrielle,"Signed, sealed, delivered.Lily's ours."
Gabrielle,"Who's the pretty girl?Oh, looks like it's daddy's turn."
Gabrielle,"Oh, yes."
Gabrielle,Yes?
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"No, no,no, no, no, no!"
Gabrielle,You?You don't even wanna be a mother!
Gabrielle,So?!
Gabrielle,I don't want my money back.I want my baby!
Gabrielle,"Carlos!No!Carlos, what's happening?"
Gabrielle,"No, no, no, ma'am,you don't understand.You don't understand,This is our baby!"
Gabrielle,"No, we've been--we've been feeding her, and we--we've been bathing her,and we wake up in the middle of the night and we rock her--"
Gabrielle,"--which is crazy,'cause if you knew me,I don't do that.I don't do that.And--and my husband--my husband, he sings to her. He sings,so you can't take her away.It's too late. We've already fallen in love with her!"
Gabrielle,"Carlos, do something!"
Gabrielle,"No,you can't go!You can't--you can't take her!You can't take her! No!She's our baby!She's our--no!Please!"
Gabrielle,"Oh,no,thanks,Xiao-mei.The poor thing.She was so attached to Lily."
Gabrielle,The people from Carlos' church.
Gabrielle,"I don't think I could go through that pain again.I did freeze some of my eggs,so we might do the surrogacy thing,but I don't know."
Gabrielle,"I don't have an appetite.In fact,this is all gonna go to waste.You guys should take something."
Gabrielle,"Xiao-meI,I appreciate your grief,but,really,you're bringing everybody down.Will you pull it together?"
Gabrielle,I don't understand.It's from the government.
Gabrielle,"Oh,my--this can't be happening."
Gabrielle,"Oh,no,no,Xiao-mei,you're not going anywhere.Hey,you're much too important to Carlos and me."
Gabrielle,"Bree,you heard what she said.I can't let this poor kid go back to China and become someone's slave."
Gabrielle,"All right.Look,my friends wanna take some of this to go,so pack it up,and we're a little low on coffee."
Gabrielle,"Uh,Xiao-mei?We spoke to homeland security,and we have good news!"
Gabrielle,Mmm hmm.
Gabrielle,Oh! Okay.
Gabrielle,"Uh-- well,there's just one little thing--the immigration laws have gotten really tough in this country,so we're a little behind the eight ball going in.But we pled your case,and we fought tooth and nail,and the law says you can stay--but only if you have our baby."
Gabrielle,"So we thought,you need a baby in your belly,we need a surrogate--win-win-win."
Gabrielle,"Oh,well,it would be our baby.It would just be growing inside of you."
Gabrielle,"Okay,uh-- well--Okay,it's like this--the three of us are making your famous Szechuan dumplings,and I'm the dough,and Carlos is the pork,and you're the oven."
Gabrielle,"Well,uh,maybe just a little light dusting.Nothing major."
Gabrielle,"No,Xiao-mei,you don't have a choice.It's either this or go back to China."
Gabrielle,"Xiao-mei?I made you some hot cocoa.I guess the baby thing didn't really appeal to you,huh?I know it's a lot to ask,it's just,Carlos and I think of you as family.Don't you think of us as family?"
Gabrielle,"Mm hmm.Well,if we are so friggin' close,what's the big deal?It's nine months out of your life."
Gabrielle,"""Ruined""?"
Gabrielle,Wait.Are you a virgin?
Gabrielle,"Are you kidding?No one cares about virginity in this country.It went out of style in the '50s,and trust me,honey,it ain't making a comeback.Seriously,no one cares."
Gabrielle,"Well,what kind of husband do you want?Do you want a rich husband?Well,then,rich men don't marry virgins for the same reasons they don't hire chauffeurs who can't drive--they value experience."
Gabrielle,Would I lie to family?
Gabrielle,"Honey,why aren't you dressed yet?We have to be at the fertility clinic in 40 minutes!"
Gabrielle,"And,uh,give Xiao-mei a kick in the pants.I haven't seen her all morning."
Gabrielle,"Honey,come on.We're gonna be late."
Gabrielle,Oh. And were you planning on setting her straight?
Gabrielle,"Well,honey,she's a virgin.Who knows why virgins do anything?"
Gabrielle,Yeah. I wouldn't just slam her for no reason.
Gabrielle,"Oh! Okay,honey,only good swimmers now."
Gabrielle,Susan?We've all been talking.We've decided you and Julie should stay with Bree.
Gabrielle,"No, no, Xiao-mei,I've told you a million times.No red meat for Mr. Solis."
Gabrielle,"Sweetie,I need some more cream."
Gabrielle,Excuse me. What?
Gabrielle,"Honey, it's 100 bucks an ounce.That tends to make everyone a little nauseous."
Gabrielle,Carlos! Her boobs are none of your business.
Gabrielle,Oh!
Gabrielle,Oh.
Gabrielle,Absolutely. You have nothing to worry about here.
Gabrielle,Oh!
Gabrielle,"Oh, yeah. Okay. Sorry."
Gabrielle,Carlos--What's going on?
Gabrielle,"Oh, well,I'm sorry to hear that.So, uh, did you move my beauty products?They're not in the bathroom."
Gabrielle,Why in the hell?
Gabrielle,All of it?Even my hair pomade?
Gabrielle,"Yeah, well,it gives me volume,so I guess we're both gonna have a problem."
Gabrielle,"You're not a model, Carlos. Maintenance is my only skill."
Gabrielle,"Fine. I'll learn to live without product.But when my hair starts smelling like hair,I don't wanna hear a word."
Gabrielle,"Xiao-mei, what are you doing in our bed?"
Gabrielle,"Well, what's wrong with the guest bathroom?"
Gabrielle,It's right down the hall.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, I know.That's why I had the movers put it in here, where we sleep."
Gabrielle,"Yes, Xiao-mei,that would be good."
Gabrielle,Fine.You can use our toilet.
Gabrielle,Ow! Stop kicking me.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, in a twin?Good luck.God, I want my bed back."
Gabrielle,"That is not the point. We are a week into this pregnancy,and you're already putting Xiao-mei's needs before mine."
Gabrielle,Like hell she is.That is my egg.
Gabrielle,"Oven, Carlos. The oven.A well-cared-for,well-paid oven."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, sure,knock yourself out."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, stop with the dance.It's already in the wallpaper."
Gabrielle,"Oh, it's perfume,not toxic gas."
Gabrielle,"Because I see the writing on the wall,and it scares the hell out of me."
Gabrielle,"From the second Xiao-mei got pregnant,you have found a million and one ways to tell me that that baby is more important to you than me."
Gabrielle,"No! Men can't help it.When they become fathers,they become lousy husbands,and some wives don't mind,but you didn't marry one of those women."
Gabrielle,"Honey, look. I bought us matching golf outfits for our lessons tomorrow."
Gabrielle,I'm sorry?
Gabrielle,"Oh, okay, well, I'll just call the country club and cancel our lessons."
Gabrielle,I don't wanna go alone.It was your idea in the first place.
Gabrielle,"Fine, if you feel that way about it. Hey, I'm sorry. I'm just a little on edge today."
Gabrielle,"You pay six bucks an hour. it's all about the perks, honey."
Gabrielle,That is so true.
Gabrielle,Okay.
Gabrielle,Make me something strong.I have nine more holes with that guy.
Gabrielle,"Carlos is dead, Xiao-mei."
Gabrielle,"No, you don't understand.He's already dead.There was an accident.He's all over the highway."
Gabrielle,"Oh, honey!Oh, you're not dead!"
Gabrielle,"Honey, they didn't know all the details, but a witness said that they saw you run into the carpool lane to pick up a lawn chair that had fallen off some truck, and then a bus hit you right in front of the road crew.Why aren't you at the road crew?"
Gabrielle,"Well, Carlos, they had your name."
Gabrielle,Oh!Why is your back all sweaty?
Gabrielle,Barefoot?
Gabrielle,Hi there.
Gabrielle,"Well, I am Gabrielle Solis."
Gabrielle,"Oh! No, no. I was-- just changing out of my sweaty clothes.I didn't realize moving was such great cardio"
Gabrielle,"Honey, uh, I think it's time to unpack the pants."
Gabrielle,"Four months, and I've dressed like this for two of 'em. He's insatiable."
Gabrielle,Trying to have sex with you.
Gabrielle,You don't wanna have sex with me?You always wanna have sex with me.You wanted to have sex with me an hour after your hernia operation.
Gabrielle,"Xiao-mei said the strangest thing to me when I told her you were dead.She said, ��_��_��_please don't kill him.'"
Gabrielle,"Xiao-mei, do you have a second?This is probably silly, but it's been bothering me.When you said,""please don't kill him,"" did you mean Carlos?"
Gabrielle,"I know.It's just you said, ""kill,"" not ""dead."" and I'd have to do be pretty angry to kill someone, so I guess my question is, do I have a reason to be angry at Mr. Solis?"
Gabrielle,Xiao-mei--how did you rip your panties?
Gabrielle,"Yeah, I know.It's just, she's been having pain-- down there.So if you could take a peek, it'd make me feel so much better."
Gabrielle,"Um, and, doctor, uh, while you're down there, could you check if she's still a virgin?"
Gabrielle,"You don't even have to say it out loud.If you see hymen, just give me a thumbs up."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, you promised you'd come home today.Well, I don't care what Tanaka wants!Rattling around this stupid house all by myself is not what I signed up for!No, no, no, don't hang up on me.I'm not done yelling at you!"
Gabrielle,The best you've ever had.
Gabrielle,What's so funny?
Gabrielle,You were a virgin?
Gabrielle,"Oh, no.No, I mean, I guess it was, well, weird when you started naming the American presidents in order."
Gabrielle,"No, no, you were good.Just, if it comes up in school, Paul Revere was never president."
Gabrielle,"Well, good. I'm glad, because this can never happen again."
Gabrielle,"The only reason I did this was because I was angry at Carlos.Now, thanks to you, I'm not angry anymore."
Gabrielle,Oh. I seriously doubt that.
Gabrielle,"Because Carlos doesn't have an adulterous bone in his body.What we just did he could never do.For him, sex isn't just sex. it's a sign of intimacy.It's the way he shows love.You know, instead of talking and listening and spending time with me. What was that for?"
Gabrielle,"Well, since this is our last time, I guess we can make the most of it."
Gabrielle,Completely.
Gabrielle,"So I'm gonna go shopping and then I'm gonna see my trainer, and I'll definitely be gone for, like, three hours.Okay. Well, I gotta go.Have fun."
Gabrielle,But who has the ring?
Gabrielle,"So, wait, you're gonna get down on one knee, pop the question, and while you're down there, dig in his pocket?"
Gabrielle,"No, no, no!Don't turn it off."
Gabrielle,Are you done with my husband?
Gabrielle,Good.I have a little project for you.
Gabrielle,"To have meaningless sex, Carlos. Not to sleep with the woman who's carrying our child!"
Gabrielle,"I had a reason to. You were never here! I've been here, Carlos.I have tried so hard to not be selfish and to put your needs above mine.I mean, for god sakes, look at me!I have agreed to be a mother for you!"
Gabrielle,"Forget the hotel, Carlos.Get a lease."
Gabrielle,"No, you can start dinner."
Gabrielle,"You're not going anywhere, not as long as you have my baby in your belly."
Gabrielle,"I don't know what that meant, but I didn't like the tone.So just remember, am the boss of you, or else I'm gonna make this the worst nine months of your life."
Gabrielle,Not to sleep with a woman carrying on a child.
Gabrielle,"We're out, but I got you a pickle."
Gabrielle,"You know, that's all I got."
Gabrielle,You did not just to that!
Gabrielle,Pick it up!
Gabrielle,"Oh, cut it out, Xiao mei.The Doctor didn't say anything about me rubbing your chubby stumps.Rub'em yourself."
Gabrielle,"Would you rather go live with Mr. Solis in a dingy one bedroom apartment with no air conditioning and no cable?Huh?No, I didn't think so."
Gabrielle,"I am the meanest person.You've been in the country a year.Modify your nouns, damn it."
Gabrielle,"I can't wait for you to pop out that baby because when you do I am putting you on the first plane back to Shanghai, and you're going to be on all fours in a rice patty before the epidural wears off!"
Gabrielle,"Tell it to my Chinese friend, Sue Me!!"
Gabrielle,"What's the occasion?Bree: Oh, um, no occasion.Just a little get together."
Gabrielle,"If you don't tell us, we're not coming."
Gabrielle,Oh my gosh!
Gabrielle,"Oh, generous.That means he's good in the sack."
Gabrielle,"Oh my god, you're serious?No sex at all? No even-- um--"
Gabrielle,But you're gonna get married.You wouldn't buy a car without at least taking it for a little test drive.It's not like you've never slept with a guy you weren't married to.
Gabrielle,"Oh, don't worry, I'm just going to replay the look I had when I found out you hadn't banged him yet."
Gabrielle,"Come on out, I have your lunch.Xiao mei! Xiao mei!"
Gabrielle,Hey!Quick question.Have you by any chance seen Xiao mei?
Gabrielle,I did not lose our baby.Stop saying that!I know exactly where it is!Inside some crazy Chinese woman!Who also stole half a chicken from my fridge!
Gabrielle,"Hi, hi, Lee Wang, right.Remember me.Xiao mei lives with me.You came over, we had lunch."
Gabrielle,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!Hey, what happened to that famous Chinese hospitality?"
Gabrielle,I may have mentioned deportation but I didn't think she'd take it personally.
Gabrielle,"It was banter!I mean, has this country come to the point where you can't joke with the help?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, don't give me that ��_��_��_we are the world' crap!That woman's uterus is harboring a stolen baby!So if you know where she is you'd better start taking, or else I'm going to get the Health Department down her and get a closer look at what you're serving as Moo Sho Pork!"
Gabrielle,"Boy, those people just don't have a sense of humor, do they?"
Gabrielle,"I'm just dropping off Carlos now and I'll be by to pick her up.Okay, thanks Edie. Xiao mei's fine.Crisis averted, no harm, no foul."
Gabrielle,Don't you dare give me that attitude.You have no idea what I've been going through this past six months.
Gabrielle,I have had to wait hand and foot on your mistress.I mean imagine if the day after you found out about John Rowland you had to make his lunch and rub his feet!
Gabrielle,Xiao mei is going to be fine!Once that baby comes her slate is going to be wiped clean.She's going to walk away and live her American dream!Me?I'm going to be stuck!A single mother raising a child alone.Haggling with lawyers over who gets the kid at Christmas.My American dream is officially dead.
Gabrielle,Thank you.
Gabrielle,Here you go.
Gabrielle,"Once that baby comes,I'm gonna be stuck raising a child alone."
Gabrielle,"Uh, sure, who doesn't love a string quartet. But if you got a band, maybe people could dance as opposed to sway."
Gabrielle,"Yes, it would look perfect."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, Bree, I always thought of you as a person who wants time to plan."
Gabrielle,Susan! We don't know that! All we have is some crazy woman's accusation.
Gabrielle,"You heard me. And I want the bedroom stereo,want the marble console and that painting of Saint Augustine."
Gabrielle,I know he matches the drapes!
Gabrielle,And I want my pearl necklace back. Don't think I didn't notice that you swiped it.
Gabrielle,There was a time you thought I belonged in your family. And you got over that!
Gabrielle,Stop eating my fries!
Gabrielle,You know what the doctor said. You should see his cholesterol. This man bleeds bacon grease.
Gabrielle,"Well, in that case, have some more fries."
Gabrielle,Hey. You are supposed to be on bed rest!
Gabrielle,"Well, why don't you try putting on a pair of pants? That should kill a couple of hours."
Gabrielle,Or the stairs. What do you want?
Gabrielle,Your mama's pearls? Carlos! Thank you.
Gabrielle,And what?
Gabrielle,"Fine. You can come to Bree's wedding reception, as my guest."
Gabrielle,Here.
Gabrielle,Yeah. That's our wedding present to Bree.
Gabrielle,"Well, what kind of gesture did you have in mind?"
Gabrielle,Things I'll do for jewelry.
Gabrielle,"Oh my god, what are we going to do?"
Gabrielle,I said it was a theory.
Gabrielle,"Hey, look at you."
Gabrielle,"She's got glaucoma. To her, you're nothing but a Hispanic blur. Let me fix your tie."
Gabrielle,Yeah.
Gabrielle,Perfect.
Gabrielle,What would make you think I would have even consider taking you back?
Gabrielle,"Guest, Carlos. I said guest."
Gabrielle,You want a clear signal? How's this?
Gabrielle,"Hi there. I just wanted to say you're doing a great job, Tad. That's such a masculine name."
Gabrielle,"Okay, here's the drill. My ex is here and I want to piss him off so just act like you're all hot for me and there's a hundred buck tip in it for you."
Gabrielle,"No, I'll drive."
Gabrielle,Carlos!
Gabrielle,"Yes, I've been watching you make your new friend and it's disgusting!"
Gabrielle,Who the hell are you anyway? And why the hell are you at this wedding?
Gabrielle,"Lynette Scavo, I want to talk to you!"
Gabrielle,What were you thinking? I didn't invite you here to embarrass me in front of my friends.
Gabrielle,That's it! I take my invitation back! You are no longer welcome in my house!
Gabrielle,No!
Gabrielle,Carlos! No!
Gabrielle,No!
Gabrielle,Now look what you've done!
Gabrielle,"No, Carlos!"
Gabrielle,"Give me those! Get away, those are mine."
Gabrielle,"Not now, Xiao-Mei!"
Gabrielle,"Oh for God's sake, what?"
Gabrielle,What were you thinking setting Carlos up with that skank?!
Gabrielle,Lynette! Carlos will never be fair game! You know the rules!
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"Lynette, listen to me. You and Tom will survive this."
Gabrielle,You and Tom will survive this.
Gabrielle,"Because some marriages were built to last. And some aren't. Trust me, I know the difference."
Gabrielle,It's time! I can't believe this is happening!
Gabrielle,"Carlos, I am so sorry about the--"
Gabrielle,I forgive you. It's worth it when you experience a moment as beautiful as this.
Gabrielle,How could this have happened? What kind of half-ass fertility clinic are you running?
Gabrielle,"Excuse me, you screw up our lives and the best you can do is, 'that's the way the cookie crumbles?' And who is this guy? Why is he writing down everything I say?"
Gabrielle,You know what else would have been wise? Sticking the right baby in the right belly!
Gabrielle,Well.
Gabrielle,I feel so--
Gabrielle,What's that?
Gabrielle,"Yeah, that's something."
Gabrielle,See you then.
Gabrielle,"You can call it blackmail, Carlos, but the court calls it ""Spousal Support"".So unless I get a check by Monday, your shower buddies from jail will be throwing you a Welcome Back party."
Gabrielle,"Don't you love this?Oh, God bless Tom for taking the kids camping."
Gabrielle,This is exactly what we needed.Especially after everything I've been through lately.I am all about relaxing and rejuvenating--
Gabrielle,Yeah?
Gabrielle,"Oh, I'm sorry."
Gabrielle,"I'm sorry.It's just that I'm waiting for Carlos' lawyer to call.Spousal support has gotten ugly. Hello.Oh hi, Tom!"
Gabrielle,Yeah!
Gabrielle,She's right here. Did you say something?
Gabrielle,I know.I wouldn't trade with you for anything.
Gabrielle,Thank you.
Gabrielle,"What is this, freakin' Noah's ark?!"
Gabrielle,Who's there? I can't see you.
Gabrielle,"Your company? You have a company now?Oh, my Gosh, when I met you, all you had was a bike."
Gabrielle,Nothing. I just-- I can't get over how mature and confident you are. You've really changed.
Gabrielle,"So I guess, uh, there's no chance of getting you over to the house to pick the dead leaves off my Ficus."
Gabrielle,"Actually, we're getting a divorce."
Gabrielle,Really? Then why are you smiling?
Gabrielle,Gabrielle. I think that's the first time you've ever called me that.
Gabrielle,I intend to.
Gabrielle,"Except now when we're done, I don't have to proofread your essay on ��_��_��_Ethan Frome'."
Gabrielle,"Ooh, I like rich John!"
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,Oh! Your fianc��_��_e?
Gabrielle,"Uh, you--You're engaged? To who?!"
Gabrielle,How could you do this to me?I would never have let you seduce me if I knew you were getting married.
Gabrielle,You knew about Carlos! My cheating was upfront and honest.
Gabrielle,"No, I'm not going anywhere. In fact, I wanna meet the blushing bride."
Gabrielle,Don't laugh.I saved a bundle on airfare.
Gabrielle,Don't you mean her daddy will buy her a new one and just launder the money through you?
Gabrielle,"Me, too.Do you wanna sit down? You know, you're pretty hard to stay mad at."
Gabrielle,Who says it has to end?
Gabrielle,"Well, I'm single now, and I thought we could maybe--"
Gabrielle,"Sure, and I was married when we got together."
Gabrielle,"Well, that's what I thought, but trust me, marriage is hard."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, that can happen."
Gabrielle,"We got ties here, people! Designer ties, two for a dollar! Ooh, do you like those barbells? Make me an offer. I'm feeling generous. Here's the customer I've been waiting for."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, I see you got my flier."
Gabrielle,"I need cash, and you don't expect me to sell MY stuff, do you?"
Gabrielle,"And it pains me to sell it. It's just that my lawyer told me What you're offering for spousal support, And I can't get by on that."
Gabrielle,"So I should be punished? Attention, shoppers, for the next minutes, free golf club with every purchase!"
Gabrielle,"Oh, honey, the gloves aren't just off-- They're 70 % off! Get your cashmere gloves!"
Gabrielle,"Carlos, what are you doing here? I mean, besides lowering my property value."
Gabrielle,Oh?
Gabrielle,"Really? Wow. Well, thank you. Okay, you've seen my face. Now you can beat it."
Gabrielle,Wait! You can't stay here!
Gabrielle,Who is it? It is Sharla Banning?
Gabrielle,"I mean, that's how Bunny Connors got Chlamydia."
Gabrielle,"No, that's how she got crabs. Poor Bunny. It's always something. If it's not the clap, it's a botched face-lift."
Gabrielle,"I wouldn't. Women always say they wanna know if their husband's cheating, and they always resent the person who tells them."
Gabrielle,No! But I would hire someone to beat the crap out of him.
Gabrielle,Why?
Gabrielle,"Uh, would you excuse me?"
Gabrielle,What are you doing? I told you I was having friends over!
Gabrielle,"Oh, for God sakes, put some pants on!"
Gabrielle,Don't act like you didn't deserve that.
Gabrielle,You peed in my shampoo. Admit it!
Gabrielle,"Yeah, the cap was loose, and I know how your sick mind works."
Gabrielle,"To answer your question, no, we are not getting back together."
Gabrielle,"Hey, Carlos. What's up?"
Gabrielle,That's probably because I had the locks changed.
Gabrielle,Can't be too safe. You never know when someone might move in on you when you're not looking.
Gabrielle,Hello? There's an intruder breaking into my home. Can you tell them to come armed? I think he's Mexican.
Gabrielle,"All right, but we're going through a very messy divorce, And he moved back in on me. And everyone knows the wife keeps the house, And the husband gets the crappy apartment. It's the American way."
Gabrielle,"Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, you can't take sides! Police officers aren't allowed to take sides.I pay your salary."
Gabrielle,"Oh. It was a swat. Ted, does this hurt?"
Gabrielle,Get your hands off me! Police brutality!
Gabrielle,Don't talk to me.
Gabrielle,"Wow, you are crazy."
Gabrielle,"That's too bad, because I don't love you."
Gabrielle,I don't. And I haven't for a very long time.
Gabrielle,"No, if I wanted to hurt you, I would tell you about last weekend when I slept with John Rowland."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, what are you doing? Carlos! What are you doing?! Carlos! You can't leave me out here in the middle of nowhere! Ah! Carlos!"
Gabrielle,"Carlos, what are you doing in my room?"
Gabrielle,"God, Carlos! Strawberries and champagne? Did you really think you're gonna seduce me?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, right, right. You know, I may be living with you until the divorce is final, but it doesn't mean I have to put up with your cheesy come-ons."
Gabrielle,"What, you've been doing some thinking, and you realize that I'm your soul mate, and there's a vacancy in your heart only I can fill?"
Gabrielle,It's over between us. Just move on already. Forget me.
Gabrielle,"Lynette, you're not serious."
Gabrielle,"She promised to stand by him, and once you make that commitment you have to see it through."
Gabrielle,I'm done talking.
Gabrielle,He despised you for saying no?
Gabrielle,Carlos. No Trishelle tonight?
Gabrielle,"Does her pimp want the rest of the money? You know, there is some cash in my purse."
Gabrielle,"Well, I think it's more than that. I think you really hate me."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I think it is. You know, introducing your spouse to someone you're about to have sex with? There's only one reason to do that--pure hatred."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I think I do. Phil, come meet my basically ex-husband--"
Gabrielle,"Thank you. Carlos. Carlos, this is my new friend Phil Lopez."
Gabrielle,"Really? Well, that's weird. When?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, my God! That's right! That's right! You were up for the Latino businessman of the year award that Phil won."
Gabrielle,"No! Ooh, I remember. Carlos was so annoyed. What did you say, hon? ""He may have that trophy, but I've got you."" Ain't life funny?"
Gabrielle,"Mnh-mnh, not right now. Phil and I are getting in the hot tub. Ooh, Phil, did you bring your suit?"
Gabrielle,Not in front of Arlos-cay! Go upstairs. I'll meet you there.
Gabrielle,"Well, now you know."
Gabrielle,"Yoo-hoo! Carlos! I'm making a snack for Phil.Do you want something to eat? Some sour grapes, perhaps? Maybe a little crow? Okay, we need to move this over there."
Gabrielle,"Uh, Feng Shui."
Gabrielle,Yes! Yes!
Gabrielle,"Oh, no, no, let's get something straight. You and I are not gonna have sex tonight."
Gabrielle,"I'm sorry.No offense,you're a nice guy.I'm just not into you that way.Oh,God,Phil! Yes,yes,give it to me!"
Gabrielle,"No, no, I'm not talking to you. Back off!"
Gabrielle,"Yes, you saw my boobs, and you're gonna have that mental snapshot to use as you wish for the rest of your life, but that is all you're getting!"
Gabrielle,I'm what?!
Gabrielle,"Really? Oh, so are you, big boy! Yes!"
Gabrielle,Always happy to help a brother out. Hold on.
Gabrielle,"Oh,God,yes!Oh,ride 'em,cowboy!Oh,yes,God!Take me home,Philly!You should wear a saddle!Yes! Yes!"
Gabrielle,"Stop it, Phil. I told you to beat it. No means no!"
Gabrielle,I never said that.
Gabrielle,Shut up.
Gabrielle,"Well, then enlighten me. How can I hit you so hard that you will never recover?"
Gabrielle,"Oh,I have to,Carlos.I need you to give up on us.We're not good for each other,and I can't keep doing this."
Gabrielle,You know what? I'm tired. Can we talk about this in the morning?
Gabrielle,But you're bringing me breakfast in bed or no deal.
Gabrielle,"I got a second wind last night, so I went to a bar. That's where I met Jason. We spent the whole night how did you put it? Pulling the trigger. So did I hurt you, or should I keep trying?"
Gabrielle,"So did I hurt you, or should I keep trying?"
Gabrielle,You're giving me everything I want? Just like that?
Gabrielle,That's the thing.Carlos doesn't fold. That son of a bitch is up to something.
Gabrielle,Okay.
Gabrielle,"Uh, hold it. You're a sweaty mess."
Gabrielle,So you're not laying on anything in this house until you take a shower.
Gabrielle,"Uh, why did you put those shorts back on?"
Gabrielle,"Uh, it's just that they're filthy, and I was gonna wash 'em for you."
Gabrielle,"I don't want to, but if you wear them one more time, they're gonna ask me themselves."
Gabrielle,Got it.
Gabrielle,So it's a job contract?
Gabrielle,"Well, that's fantastic! I get half, right?"
Gabrielle,"That conniving, underhanded snake! Thank god I broke into his desk."
Gabrielle,"All right, well, let's just say something happened to postpone the divorce.I would still get my share of that two million, right?"
Gabrielle,"I know how Carlos thinks. More importantly, what he thinks with."
Gabrielle,Hey! Cocktails? Nobody called me?
Gabrielle,"Oh. Well, I was trying to do that with exercise,but why risk a heart attack? Make mine a double!"
Gabrielle,I'm just gonna say it. Tequila makes me happy.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, we're drinking on the porch. You got a problem with that?"
Gabrielle,Show-offs.
Gabrielle,What do you think their secret is?
Gabrielle,Can I tell you guys something? Something I can only tell you guys?
Gabrielle,Not what I was gonna say.What I was gonna say is with all his conniving and trickery I still love Carlos.
Gabrielle,"Anyway, what if I never find that passion with anybody else?"
Gabrielle,"Nah, I already paid a lawyer. I'm taking him down."
Gabrielle,"No! No, you're not! You're a great wife and a great mother. Although-- Don't you have children?"
Gabrielle,"Oh! Oh, sweetie!"
Gabrielle,"So go to Ian! Tell him you made the wrong choice, and he's the one you wanna be with. What have you got to lose?"
Gabrielle,See you later!
Gabrielle,"Go, Ida!"
Gabrielle,"Carlos, could you come help me?"
Gabrielle,It'll just take a second. Please?
Gabrielle,"Oh,thanks.I'm gonna go meet some new friends for dinner.But my zipper's stuck.Can you help me?"
Gabrielle,"Huh. Weird. Well, you know what? I don't wanna be late, so I should, um, probably change."
Gabrielle,"Oh, Carlos, this old thing? You've seen it all before. I'm just gonna wear the little blue number. Will you hand me those stockings? Oh, I've got a raggedy nail. You're gonna have to help me put those on."
Gabrielle,"Well, I'd do it myself, but I don't wanna get a snag."
Gabrielle,Really? It seems like yesterday to me.
Gabrielle,Sure. Why not? For old time's sake.
Gabrielle,I've decided I'd rather catch up with an old one.
Gabrielle,"Carlos, do you think we're making a mistake?"
Gabrielle,The whole divorce thing. Maybe we shouldn't go through with it. It's not like we're gonna find this kind of passion with anyone else.
Gabrielle,"Yeah.Yeah,I guess I am.Why don't we just put all of this behind us and stay together?What do you say?"
Gabrielle,"Well, what? What's so funny?"
Gabrielle,"You got a new job? Honey, that's wonderful!"
Gabrielle,What?! Why would you do that?
Gabrielle,You did this just to get me in bed?
Gabrielle,Your terms?
Gabrielle,You are a bastard!
Gabrielle,"Oh, god!"
Gabrielle,"Oh! Hello? Uh, there's been an accident. My husband--he--"
Gabrielle,I'm gonna have to call you back.
Gabrielle,Carlos? Honey? Carlos?
Gabrielle,"Oh, hon, again?"
Gabrielle,There was nothing you could do.
Gabrielle,"Oh, he's cute!"
Gabrielle,Keep talking.
Gabrielle,You can stop now.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, let's give him the scoop on the neighborhood."
Gabrielle,How dare you! That is a vicious lie.
Gabrielle,"Oh, Carlos, give it to me! Carlos! Yes! Yes! Carlos--"
Gabrielle,You recorded our lovemaking?
Gabrielle,"As a matter of fact, I do have a few thoughts.Carlos, you're a dead man! Do you hear me?"
Gabrielle,I said dead!
Gabrielle,"Come on, just give me one clean shot at him. I'm willing to do the time!"
Gabrielle,"Oh, I'm helping you pack. Think of all the money you're gonna save on bubble wrap."
Gabrielle,"Do you know how much I was worth?! When we met, I was on the cover of magazines. I had a career and a future, but I gave it all up for you, and what did I get in return?"
Gabrielle,What? What are you gonna do?
Gabrielle,"Carlos, have you lost your mind?!"
Gabrielle,It's kind of on the fritz.
Gabrielle,If only you'd come ten minutes earlier.
Gabrielle,"Oh, my God!"
Gabrielle,"Yeah, everything's fine. Having a little squabble. Give us a minute. Carlos, where do you think you're going with that?!"
Gabrielle,You know what the weird part is?
Gabrielle,"I keep thinking about that crazy lady in the market, and--I understand her. I could be her."
Gabrielle,"No,I mean it.The rage that I have felt in these past six months--If I had had a gun in the courthouse today--"
Gabrielle,"I don't know what I'm capable of anymore. This divorce has turned me into this-- bitter, hateful person, and I don't like her."
Gabrielle,"And for what it's worth, I don't like what it's turned you into either."
Gabrielle,Okay.
Gabrielle,He's cute.
Gabrielle,"I had a career and a future,but I gave it all up for you,and what did I get in return?"
Gabrielle,"Sure, knock yourself out."
Gabrielle,"I think you mean Vogue, sweetie."
Gabrielle,I should know. I was on the cover.
Gabrielle,"Uh, way."
Gabrielle,"Oh, see that coat I'm wearing in this shot? That's genuine ocelot fur. Although the photographer was the real animal, if you know what I'm saying-- which I hope you don't. And don't ever do drugs, okay?"
Gabrielle,"Well, I fell in love, got married and moved to the suburbs for the whole fairy-tale happy ending thing. That was a crock."
Gabrielle,"No. No, no, no, no, no, no."
Gabrielle,"Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. I'm just gonna fly to New York, meet with my old agent and take it from there. Come on, you guys, this is exciting. Be happy for me."
Gabrielle,"Well, now that my divorce is final, I need a reason to wake up in the morning. I have this hole in my life that can't be filled by shopping. That's right, I said it."
Gabrielle,"You look great.Well, apparently, taking a .38 slug to the shoulder agrees with you."
Gabrielle,"You look amazing, younger than ever!"
Gabrielle,"That's great! Well, I have some fun news of my own. I'm ready to model again."
Gabrielle,Divorce.
Gabrielle,Did I say that? Water under the bridge. I thought it was funny.
Gabrielle,"Look, Marcella, I'm back. And we made such a great team before, and I think we can be again."
Gabrielle,"Well, I just wanna work."
Gabrielle,"Are you serious? Well, I can't tell because your face doesn't move anymore."
Gabrielle,"You must be Tanya. I'm Gabrielle. We're gonna be co-models today. Now I don't know if you've ever done one of these big shoots before, but don't be nervous. Durkin and I are old friends. He's a sweetheart. Now just remember, he's the king, do exactly what he says, and you'll be fine."
Gabrielle,"Well, I guess you're all set then."
Gabrielle,I've got some wardrobe choices. I want to be buried in this dress!
Gabrielle,Mom?
Gabrielle,"Excuse me, Durkin?"
Gabrielle,"It's Gaby. Gabrielle Marquez. You shot me in Milan, remember?"
Gabrielle,"I do. Aren't you a little worried that I'm gonna pull focus? I mean, it's a little confusing. People are gonna see Tanya, and then they're gonna-- See that guy, and they're gonna wonder who I am."
Gabrielle,"People aren't gonna buy that, so here's what I was thinking. I slap on one of those gowns, I play Tanya's big sister home from college to raise a little hell."
Gabrielle,"I'm sorry. Is just, this outfit is hideous!"
Gabrielle,Fine. I just need a moment to get into character.
Gabrielle,"Ready, ready!"
Gabrielle,"Oh, I made it work. I'm hot Mom."
Gabrielle,"Marcella, look, I don't know what they told you, but all I'm asking for is a simple costume change."
Gabrielle,Where do you get off talking to me like that? I shot thirty-six covers by the time I was twenty!
Gabrielle,Do you know how many photographers would die to work with me again?
Gabrielle,I don't believe that.
Gabrielle,"Oh, it was fine."
Gabrielle,"You know,just hours and hours of sitting around,looking pretty.But I think I'm done with modeling."
Gabrielle,"Well, if something great comes up, I might fly out, but I'm pretty settled here."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, me, too."
Gabrielle,"Well, I hope it's more fabulous than this dress. I look like something Ike Turner would hit."
Gabrielle,"What, I slam one dress, and you quit on me?"
Gabrielle,"You're opening up a salon? God, could you get any gayer?"
Gabrielle,"Vern, I worked the catwalks in Milan and Paris. I'm not gonna give makeup tips to little miss training bra."
Gabrielle,"Don't call me a bi*ch, and stop tracking my cycle. I told you that freaks me out."
Gabrielle,The divorce decree came through today. Carlos is officially out of my life.
Gabrielle,I'm not doing it.
Gabrielle,"Fine. I'll do it, But I want this dress for free."
Gabrielle,"And I hate helping others, too, but I'm doing that, aren't I?"
Gabrielle,"I'm here to teach fashion, so I'm fashionably late."
Gabrielle,Vern? A moment.
Gabrielle,Yes! What am I supposed to do with that petting zoo out there?
Gabrielle,"Good comparison, because it's gonna take a miracle to turn these mutts into show dogs."
Gabrielle,"Hey, girls, let's talk beauty."
Gabrielle,"All right, girls, first things first things first. If you can't walk, you can't win. Hit it, Vern!"
Gabrielle,"Remember, eyes forward, shoulders back, hips square. Look left, look right, whip and walk. Yes, I'm unbelievable. Close your mouths."
Gabrielle,"Stop, stop."
Gabrielle,But where's your confidence? Where's your pride?
Gabrielle,"Have you guys ever seen a runway model without the hot clothes and makeup? Well, trust me, they're not that special, But the one thing that they do have is attitude. You have to believe in yourself, and if not, pretend to believe in yourself, okay?"
Gabrielle,"Now I want you to pretend you're on the runway--flashbulbs are popping, everyone's looking at you, envying you, and they're all thinking the same thing--Isabel Horowitz is smoking hot! Go, Isabel! Go! You're doing it! Isabel, you're doing it! That's it! Keep going!"
Gabrielle,"You were totally walking! Good job! All right, Donna, you're next. Get up there and make me hate your beauty."
Gabrielle,"Well, you guys earned it. But eat fast, because we only have one hour left, and I want to introduce you to your new best friend, Mr. Spray Tan."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I don't know."
Gabrielle,"Well,let me check my book.I might have to move some stuff around,but I think I can swing it."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, every day's a parade."
Gabrielle,"Honestly, it was like any other job, except the pay was great, the clothes were couture, and the parties were just this side of Gomorrah. You don't know what Gomorrah means, do you? Good."
Gabrielle,I invited her to a party once.
Gabrielle,"Well,honey,most models don't eat pizza. Well, at least not without having a finger for dessert."
Gabrielle,I know.I never did that.You would not believe the horrible things these girls did to stay skinny.
Gabrielle,"Well, some would smoke those unfiltered French cigarettes."
Gabrielle,"But before they do, they kill your appetite. One time, there was a girl who took too many laxatives, and, uh--well, if you're ever at the Chateau Milan in room two thirty-eight, do not use the Jacuzzi."
Gabrielle,"Well, yeah. When's the last time you saw a fat person on a magazine cover? Now I'm gonna go talk to Vern about our next session. You guys finish lunch so we can get back to work."
Gabrielle,"Vern, what are you doing here?"
Gabrielle,"Is it about the girls' makeup? 'Cause I got them each their own makeup kit, custom-tailored to match their skin tone. And I got Melina some wax. I know she's only eleven, but those Greek genes are gonna kick in any day now. What?"
Gabrielle,Really?
Gabrielle,Those damn tobacco companies!
Gabrielle,"Fine, I may have told a few stories about the old days, but as a warning. I didn't say anything inappropriate for kids."
Gabrielle,"Okay,look, we have to do damage control. I get it. Next session, I'll apologize to all the moms."
Gabrielle,"But I'm helping them.They love me!Wait,please,Vern,you have to give me a chance to fix this."
Gabrielle,"Okay,just give me a minute.I'm sorry about what I said to the girls,and it won't happen again."
Gabrielle,Can't you give me a second chance?
Gabrielle,"I don't think I'm better than you. Hell, I envy you."
Gabrielle,"No, it's true. You have husbands and families and a reason to wake up in the morning. What do I have? Him. Teaching your kids about confidence and beauty is the most useful thing I've done since--I don't know when. And as much as I've helped them-- They've helped me so much more. So please, I need this. And I promise, no more talk about dodgy weight loss methods. Like the highly effective, non-F.D.A. approved diet pill I can get from my friends in Zurich--in bulk."
Gabrielle,"Well, why don't you ladies talk it over? And I'm gonna work on posture with the girls."
Gabrielle,"Come on, you guys. Let's go!"
Gabrielle,"Yes, I'm unbelievable.Close your mouths."
Gabrielle,"Amy, small steps. Small! Little Miss Snowflake glides. She doesn't stomp."
Gabrielle,"Getting there, sweetie. If she was a horse, we'd have to shoot her."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, she's a trooper. Let's dump her."
Gabrielle,"Pageant consultants are judged on the strength of their roster. You know, we can't afford to bounce every nose-picking no-talent, but we can definitely lose the one who's dragging us down, and that's Amy."
Gabrielle,"Yes, I know, I know, and it's tragic, but we are running a business. Amy is sucking up all of our time, and we should be focusing on Sherri. She actually has a shot at winning."
Gabrielle,We'll do it together. We'll be very diplomatic.
Gabrielle,"Amy! For God sakes, Little Miss Snowflake does not scratch down there!"
Gabrielle,Do not wimp out on me here. We gotta do what's best for the business.
Gabrielle,Then I will jump in and defend you.
Gabrielle,"I'm always diplomatic. Now just get in there, you spineless 'mo."""
Gabrielle,I have no idea where you're going with this.
Gabrielle,Vern! He is so competitive. I constantly have to remind him they're just kids. When did you lose the joy?
Gabrielle,"Of course not, Bill. Can I call you Bill? It's just we feel that Amy would benefit from some private coaching. Maybe I could come to your house? Say, Friday, five o'clock?"
Gabrielle,Great! It's a date.
Gabrielle,After the harsh things you said about Amy? I don't think so.
Gabrielle,"Oh, um, the grass, honey, and my allergies--go ahead and practice. I'll watch you from here. Are you sure I can't help with anything?"
Gabrielle,I've got the restaurant thing down. I can't bring myself to cook for one. Not that I ever cooked for two.
Gabrielle,"Aw, that's sweet."
Gabrielle,Oh. It's nothing.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, she's a special girl."
Gabrielle,"Oh, honestly? Um, I hate it. It's like I've forgotten how to date."
Gabrielle,How was it?
Gabrielle,I know what you mean.
Gabrielle,"Oh, no, no, it's totally my fault. I'm sorry, sweetie. Go outside and do it again. I promise this time we're gonna watch."
Gabrielle,You always do the chips!
Gabrielle,You got it.
Gabrielle,I'll get the ball rolling. Anybody have a yeast infection?
Gabrielle,Orson was slipping it to the dead chick?
Gabrielle,Nope.
Gabrielle,This will blow over.
Gabrielle,I'd love to grab a cup of coffee--or something.
Gabrielle,"Amy, you are so lucky to have such a nice Dad."
Gabrielle,Excuse me?
Gabrielle,"Oh, sweetheart. I have a feeling I know what this is about."
Gabrielle,"I think I do. You miss your Mommy, and it feels funny seeing your Daddy be nice to somebody else. But believe me, I'm not trying to replace your Mom."
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,Sherri from class?
Gabrielle,What about your Dad? Don't you care what he wants?
Gabrielle,"You're working so hard, Sherri. You must really wanna win this pageant."
Gabrielle,"Oh. Well, I think dedication should be rewarded, so I have a little surprise for you."
Gabrielle,"Well, you know how the pageant starts with a big opening number? This year, all the contestants are gonna dance in pairs, and I've arranged for you to dance with your best friend Amy!"
Gabrielle,"What's wrong, sweetie?"
Gabrielle,"Well, I thought you two were practically sisters."
Gabrielle,"Well, that's true--"
Gabrielle,That's a good point. Now I wish I hadn't told Amy.
Gabrielle,"She was so excited. Well, she's your best friend. Why don't you just tell her the truth? She'll understand."
Gabrielle,"Well, friends come and go, but a crown is forever."
Gabrielle,"Hi. Bill? I was wondering, do you have plans Saturday night?"
Gabrielle,You're kidding. When?
Gabrielle,I'm so disappointed in her.
Gabrielle,How did you find that out?
Gabrielle,But that doesn't prove he had anything to do with Monique's murder.
Gabrielle,Are you kidding? What could be more romantic?
Gabrielle,"Back off,you son of a bi*ch!"
Gabrielle,"Yes, keep it coming."
Gabrielle,Hello?
Gabrielle,Carlos?
Gabrielle,Where the hell are you?
Gabrielle,What are you doing at Mike's house?
Gabrielle,What do you mean you live there? Since when?
Gabrielle,"Well,as you can see, I have more pleasant things to focus on."
Gabrielle,I'm gonna hang up now.
Gabrielle,So where were we?
Gabrielle,Yeah?!
Gabrielle,"That's right, Carlos. We have had some pblems with raccoons getting into the trash. So why don't you just put a lid on it?"
Gabrielle,Really? I only counted half that.
Gabrielle,Okay.
Gabrielle,Look at you! Who knew you were such a romantic?
Gabrielle,You didn't?
Gabrielle,"Uh, there's no signature. Sorry. This is kind of awkward."
Gabrielle,That's sweet that you're not jealous. Carlos would've hit the roof if some guy sent me--would you excuse me a minute?
Gabrielle,"Nice try, Carlos."
Gabrielle,"Oh, don't act innocent. You know you sent me these flowers."
Gabrielle,To sabotage my new relationship.
Gabrielle,"Oh, you care.First,you move across the street.And then, earlier today,I catch you spying on me--"
Gabrielle,"You need to move on, Carlos."
Gabrielle,"Bill is not boring. He is vibrant, and, and sexy."
Gabrielle,Anything for a good cause.
Gabrielle,Yeah.
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"I--am fine. Yes,I just remembered today's my mother's birthday. Can we stop by the florist on the way to the shelter?"
Gabrielle,Hi. I received some flowers from your shop yesterday and the card didn't say who they were from. Can you check The name is Solis.
Gabrielle,Yeah.
Gabrielle,"Really? Uh, well,the flowers were so beautiful, I'd like to know who to thank."
Gabrielle,Why? They're just flowers. They're not government secrets.
Gabrielle,"Well, okay, wait, wait, wait,let me explain."
Gabrielle,"You're right,and I am so sorry for taking up so much of your time."
Gabrielle,Sorry for doing this.
Gabrielle,"I'm gonna make it up to you, okay? Once I'm done, I'll send you flowers."
Gabrielle,"Yeah? Well, stop by. We'll hot tub."
Gabrielle,"This is totally her fault. I mean, I simply asked her if Carlos sent me the flowers, and she refused to show me the order slip."
Gabrielle,"No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait. I just need a couple more minutes. I need to know the truth."
Gabrielle,"What?! No, he's obsessed with me."
Gabrielle,"Okay, I see what you mean."
Gabrielle,There. I'm done. Let's go.
Gabrielle,It's okay. I'm probably not ready to date.
Gabrielle,"Well, you've won."
Gabrielle,Bill and I split up.
Gabrielle,I know. So just admit you sent the flowers.
Gabrielle,"Carlos, just tell me. I won't be mad.I promise."
Gabrielle,"I hate that you know me so well, and it took so long for that to happen. Now I have to start over again with somebody else."
Gabrielle,"I mean, you saw me. I went on a picnic and ate pudding out of a can. It was horrible."
Gabrielle,So you are dating. That's why you've been lifting weights and jogging.
Gabrielle,"I'll give you this--you're gonna be a tough act to follow, Carlos."
Gabrielle,It would've been nice if someone else could've found you.There was a whole lot of drama around here.
Gabrielle,"Susan, please. We look stupid enough for suspecting him. Just let it go."
Gabrielle,"Hey, guys--"
Gabrielle,Okay.
Gabrielle,There's no signature.
Gabrielle,Oh. I had a great time. Bye.
Gabrielle,Hi. You're sleeping at my place tonight.
Gabrielle,"Honestly, did you think I was gonna sleep with you?"
Gabrielle,"Carlos, this isn't funny. I am scared to death of this maniac."
Gabrielle,"The guy broke into the house. He went from secret admirer to stalker. For all I know, he's trying to kill me so no one else will have me."
Gabrielle,"Oh, and tell them what? 9-1-1, somebody broke in the house And left a six thousand dollar dress!"
Gabrielle,Nothing. Just having you here helps.
Gabrielle,"Because when he breaks in And starts hacking you up with his machete, your screams will wake me up, and then I'll be able to escape."
Gabrielle,All right. Don't take the big one. That's my favorite.
Gabrielle,What?! You can't abandon me! There's a madman stalking me. My life is on the line. Do you know how scared I am?
Gabrielle,"Hey, I'm scared, but not of the dress."
Gabrielle,"Carlos! Carlos, wake up! I need you!"
Gabrielle,What? No!
Gabrielle,He's here.
Gabrielle,"Carlos, be careful! He might have a gun!"
Gabrielle,"Oh, now you're gonna give me attitude?!"
Gabrielle,This jerk has been terrorizing me. He broke into my house!
Gabrielle,Your boss?
Gabrielle,"This is Gabrielle. Who the hell is this? Yes, I got your ��_��_��_token of esteem,' and I'm not impressed. Because you're freaking me out, that's why! No, I don't care how much it cost. That's beside the point. Really? That much?"
Gabrielle,"Look, I know you're trying to be romantic, But if you keep this up, I'm gonna be forced--"
Gabrielle,"That's very sweet of you, But I am not the most beautiful woman in the world."
Gabrielle,"Yes, I-I may be in the top ten."
Gabrielle,He says I know him and that he wants to reintroduce himself at dinner.
Gabrielle,I would not feel comfortable meeting for dinner.
Gabrielle,How about lunch?
Gabrielle,"But you have to promise to stop buying me these expensive gifts. Because I'm not that kind of girl. Well, for that many karats, yes, I could be that kind of girl. Um, I gotta go. I'll talk to you tomorrow! Oh, how about that? And here I was, thinking some guy wants to murder me in my sleep."
Gabrielle,Uh-huh.
Gabrielle,Ooh-kay.
Gabrielle,And you were valedictorian. What were you up to that your mother didn't know about?
Gabrielle,"Wait, wait, wait. First rule of ransacking��_��_��_remember where everything goes."
Gabrielle,So what does this diary look like?
Gabrielle,"Oh, god!"
Gabrielle,This is adorable! You think maybe I could��_��_��_
Gabrielle,Fine. Why does Julie have a VCR?
Gabrielle,Please. Kids don't watch videos anymore. Everything's digital.
Gabrielle,Is it?
Gabrielle,Thank you. Oh.
Gabrielle,"Zach Young! Oh, my god! It's been ages. Wow. Look at you! So handsome in a suit."
Gabrielle,"Aren't you sweet? Uh, well, anyway, I--I'd love to catch up, But I'm kinda waiting for someone."
Gabrielle,"Wow, someone got an advance on their allowance."
Gabrielle,I'm on a date with Zach Young. Nothing's ever gonna seem weird again.
Gabrielle,You got a little chocolate on your shirt.
Gabrielle,"Here, let me get it."
Gabrielle,"Next time? Honey, let's get real. You are way too young for me."
Gabrielle,"Well, John Rowland was a mistake. I was lonely."
Gabrielle,You've heard about my divorce.
Gabrielle,And let me guess--now you're my upgrade?
Gabrielle,Wait a minute. Who says I need someone to take care of me?
Gabrielle,"Well, they were wrong. Thank you for lunch, Zach."
Gabrielle,I'm sorry. I just can't.
Gabrielle,"Oh, sweetie. I really wish you would."
Gabrielle,"For god sakes, Zach! Don't hijack a Ferrari if you don't know how to drive!"
Gabrielle,"Uh, it was fabulous. Thanks for asking."
Gabrielle,"Oh, some global financier, saw me on the cover of Paris Match. Good-looking, just not my type."
Gabrielle,You son of a bi*ch. You were there?
Gabrielle,I can't believe you followed me.
Gabrielle,"All right, off my porch."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, about that--Um, I'm installing an alarm system tomorrow, so I'm not gonna need you to look after me anymore."
Gabrielle,I mind. We're divorced. I can't keep running to you every time I get scared. I want to be the kind of woman who can take care of herself.
Gabrielle,I won't. But thank you.
Gabrielle,Shh! Here it comes.
Gabrielle,"I mean, I knew she had a shot at the top five, but to actually win?"
Gabrielle,I know. She practically had sparklers coming out of her ass.
Gabrielle,"Oh, Zach. What are you doing here?"
Gabrielle,"Oh. Okay, why don't you support me from the lobby? I have some networking to do. My girl just won the pageant."
Gabrielle,What did you do?
Gabrielle,You bribed the judges?
Gabrielle,"Listen to me, you pimply psychopath. You and I are never going to party. In fact, the only reason we're ever gonna be in the same room again is if you strangle a cheerleader and I wind up on the jury!"
Gabrielle,No. Absolutely not.
Gabrielle,I don't care. I'm not going out with Zach Young!
Gabrielle,You wouldn't even let your own daughter go out with him. You said he was a psycho.
Gabrielle,"Susan, do you know what your obsession with Mike has cost you? First you piss off Bree and then Ian, and now you're pimping me out to a teenager!"
Gabrielle,"Oh, fine, I'll do it."
Gabrielle,How can you be so sure Zach's gonna go along with this?
Gabrielle,"Wow, you have your own recording studio in your house?"
Gabrielle,"Gee, well--not as wild as what I'm about to say. You can take me to dinner."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, here's how it's gonna work. We drive to the restaurant separately, we will not have dessert, and under no circumstances will you touch me. Capisce?"
Gabrielle,"Great. In order for this magical night to occur, you're gonna need to help Mike Delfino."
Gabrielle,"He's in jail--for murder. But Susan swears he's innocent, and she wants you to get him a good lawyer. All right, we have a deal?"
Gabrielle,No?
Gabrielle,A whole day?
Gabrielle,"Not quite. The day starts with lunch, and that kiss, off the table."
Gabrielle,One million dollars.
Gabrielle,"Okay, deal, you little skunk."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I'm stuffed. I can't believe you talked me into that cr��_��_me br��_��_l��_��_e."
Gabrielle,I know! You're such a good dancer! Where'd you learn how to salsa?
Gabrielle,When did I say that?
Gabrielle,"You researched me? That's sweet! In a, uh, stalkery kind of way. Thanks again for a surprisingly enjoyable night. See you around."
Gabrielle,"Right, the kiss. Sorry. I didn't mean to welsh on ya. All right. Pucker up."
Gabrielle,What the hell are you doing?!
Gabrielle,"Yes, my lips, not my esophagus!"
Gabrielle,By who? The same girl that taught you to use your tongue like a windshield wiper?
Gabrielle,How much did you pay them to say that?
Gabrielle,No! You've paid women for--
Gabrielle,"Uh, yes, it is. You just vacuumed my tonsils. I deserve to know where that mouth has been."
Gabrielle,"Wait, Zach. Zach, I'm not mad!"
Gabrielle,"Okay, I'm just a little--grossed out, that's all!"
Gabrielle,You play that pretty well.
Gabrielle,"I had a good time tonight, but I hated the way it ended."
Gabrielle,"Forget about it.Give a horny kid a couple million bucks and the yellow pages,and stuff is gonna happen."
Gabrielle,So stop doing it. Stop buying people.
Gabrielle,That's not true.You'd have me.As a friend.A friend friend.Not a girlfriend. really cannot overstress that.
Gabrielle,I don't know. Maybe it's because I think we're both-- adrift. It'd just be nice to have a pal who gets what I'm going through. Why don't you play me something you wrote?
Gabrielle,Sure. Why not?
Gabrielle,"Wow. Why don't you just hum it, okay?"
Gabrielle,"A ""friend"" friend,not a girlfriend."
Gabrielle,"No, Zach, I only accept jewelry from men I plan on sleeping with."
Gabrielle,You can buy me that toilet seat cover.
Gabrielle,"There will be no celebration. I'm turning thirty-one. I'm a single woman in her thirties. I now have to subscribe to ""Cat Fancy."" It's the law."
Gabrielle,"It means something to me.Being alone at this age, it's hard,and it's only gonna get harder.I'm so depressed."
Gabrielle,"No, thanks. But I do need a, uh, liquid soap dispenser. Go."
Gabrielle,Hello.
Gabrielle,"Well, I think it's a regular. California kings are much longer. Is your--wife particularly tall?"
Gabrielle,"Oh. Well, why don't you try it out?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, that'll happen a lot faster if you just hop on board."
Gabrielle,It was a--shameless sex joke. I was flirting with you.
Gabrielle,No. Moment's gone. You killed it.
Gabrielle,It could happen.
Gabrielle,Oh. You know my friend Zach?
Gabrielle,"Works for me, too."
Gabrielle,Zach!
Gabrielle,"Oh, that's so sweet, but I, uh--"
Gabrielle,"Oh, well, um, Luke's gonna be here in twenty minutes, and that kind of will be a date."
Gabrielle,"Yeah. That isn't a problem, is it? 'Cause this is what friends do. They talk about each other's dates."
Gabrielle,"Well, he seemed to like me in the mattress department, so here's hoping I like him the mattress department. What? Friends say these things."
Gabrielle,Don't get too full. You have to leave room for dessert.
Gabrielle,"Well, let's just say it's going to be served upstairs and involves whipped cream."
Gabrielle,No.
Gabrielle,It's okay. Do you want some coffee?
Gabrielle,"Just finish your soup, and we'll get naked."
Gabrielle,"Uh, go ahead. I'm gonna open some more wine."
Gabrielle,Guess someone's in a hurry to get on with the evening.
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"But can't it wait till after dessert? And by dessert, I mean sex. You are clear on that, right?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, I think you've got lots of choices. Here's one of them."
Gabrielle,Is that your office?
Gabrielle,Okay. So come back when you're done. I'll wait up.
Gabrielle,"What is with you?! An hour ago, you we really into me, and now you can't get out fast enough."
Gabrielle,Of course you are!
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"I still got a lot of kick for an old broad, don't I?!"
Gabrielle,Date's over. What do you want?
Gabrielle,"Ohhh, Zach!"
Gabrielle,You did not see the look on his face when I tried to kiss him. It's like he was sniffing expired milk.
Gabrielle,"Ah, that's so sweet--but it's a lie. Every tick of the clock takes away something. Zach, what am I gonna do when I'm not pretty anymore?"
Gabrielle,"I'm gonna take a little nap, okay? Just for a minute."
Gabrielle,"I'm gonna take a little nap, okay?"
Gabrielle,Zach? You're-- in your underwear.
Gabrielle,You've been here all night?
Gabrielle,Right after what?
Gabrielle,"Okay,listen to me very carefully,and this is no time to be vague.What exactly was I amazing at?"
Gabrielle,Please tell me that once contained a mint.
Gabrielle,"Okay, okay, stop talking. I'm getting nauseous."
Gabrielle,"Oh, God. Here it comes."
Gabrielle,No!
Gabrielle,"I sort of threw myself a little birthday party.So if you don't mind,I'd like to get back to my dry heaving."
Gabrielle,"Uh, oh, yeah. Um--He just came by to, uh--drop off a birthday card. Really cute little cat with balloons. All right, bye."
Gabrielle,We had sex last night!
Gabrielle,"I mean, I think we did. That's what he told me."
Gabrielle,"No, I don't remember anything! I just woke up, and he was in bed next to me."
Gabrielle,"Well, we were both half-naked, and there was a condom wrapper. And he said I was amazing, which totally sounds like me. He thinks we're a couple now. You have to help me."
Gabrielle,Where are you going?
Gabrielle,"Oh, you're--here."
Gabrielle,"Look, Zach, I'm glad you're here. I've been wanting to talk about us."
Gabrielle,Would you excuse me a second?
Gabrielle,"I am in hell.I just tried to break up with Zach,and the little twerp played the dead Mommy card."
Gabrielle,But I am guilty. I don't remember how we ended up in bed together. Maybe I led him on. I gotta be sensitive here. Could you threaten him for me?
Gabrielle,"You know, intimidate him. Do the whole jealous, Latin ex-husband thing you do. Tell him if you can't have me, nobody can."
Gabrielle,"Hey,I am looking out for Zach,too.If I dump him,it'll destroy him emotionally.Better to scare him off. Please?"
Gabrielle,"Thank you! Okay, look, there he goes. Go! Go get all cholo on his ass."
Gabrielle,Hey. So how'd it go?
Gabrielle,Really? Did he tell you that?
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"Little Zach Young? Well, just how much would I have remembered?"
Gabrielle,"Is it really good, or are you just pretending you had a slice? You and I did not have sex. Admit it!"
Gabrielle,Zach! How can you claim to care about me and lie to my face?
Gabrielle,"Zach, a real man is honest. All you've ever tried to do is bribe and trick me into falling in love with you. A little advice next time: Don't play games. Just stand up and be the kind of man a woman would be proud to share her life with."
Gabrielle,"No, there will be no clapping! You, moron, come with me!"
Gabrielle,"I'm not mad, Zach. I'm done!"
Gabrielle,I did not say to humiliate me!
Gabrielle,"I want you to leave me alone! This friends thing isn't gonna work 'cause you're always gonna want more, and I'm never gonna love you-- ever."
Gabrielle,"Okay, I'll take my chances."
Gabrielle,Bless you.
Gabrielle,He's devastated.
Gabrielle,"It's my fault. I should've known he couldn't handle the whole ""let's be friends"" thing."
Gabrielle,Really? I think it's been nice.
Gabrielle,"Well, hang in there as long as you can, 'cause I still need you."
Gabrielle,Look what you did!
Gabrielle,"Well, your driver's an idiot!"
Gabrielle,Now you're hitting on me?
Gabrielle,"Well, good. I'm glad you like it, 'cause you're gonna pay to fix this."
Gabrielle,"Five? Well, sure, I guess."
Gabrielle,Opponent?
Gabrielle,"I think I'd rather vote for the other guy--you know, the one who didn't wreck my car?"
Gabrielle,Not exactly.
Gabrielle,It would be your treat. I'm a hot date. What's in it for me?
Gabrielle,"Yeah. Check, please."
Gabrielle,"Well, a girl's gotta eat."
Gabrielle,That's what you think.
Gabrielle,"No, thank you. I'm stuffed."
Gabrielle,"Victor, you are so full of crap."
Gabrielle,There was no accident. I know you told your chauffeur to ram my car.
Gabrielle,"Uh,for the same reason you forgot to sign the check.You've been working me since the second we met,and I've been on to you every step of the way.What?What's so funny?I just called you a manipulative jerk."
Gabrielle,There is no relationship. This is our last date.
Gabrielle,"It was okay. You know, you told a few good jokes. You're sorta charming. You're not bad-looking. I just think I can do better."
Gabrielle,"I have noticed, and I'm throwing you back."
Gabrielle,"You can chase me all you want, but trust me, I'm way too fast for you."
Gabrielle,"I have noticed,and I'm throwing you back."
Gabrielle,I can't believe you bought another bustier.
Gabrielle,"In a slump, huh? How long's it been?"
Gabrielle,"Been there, done that."
Gabrielle,He's married.
Gabrielle,"No. God, no. As a matter of fact, I think I'm dumping him after dinner tonight."
Gabrielle,I don't know. He's just too arrogant. He acts like I'm some trophy he's already won. It's infuriating.
Gabrielle,"Oh, stop it. You cannot be that hard up."
Gabrielle,What the hell is this?
Gabrielle,"Oh, my God!"
Gabrielle,No!
Gabrielle,"Apparently, the water heater in the attic had burst. Everything is ruined. My clothes, my shoes, dresses. Why are you smiling?"
Gabrielle,You will never be my boyfriend.
Gabrielle,Not much longer. This is our last date.
Gabrielle,I mean it this time.
Gabrielle,Boring.
Gabrielle,Is that supposed to flatter me?
Gabrielle,"Oh, shut up and get me a sweater. Have you even noticed how cold I am?"
Gabrielle,"Sweater, now."
Gabrielle,"Oh, my God!"
Gabrielle,Look at this! There's Lacroix and Ungaro and Vintage Gaultier.
Gabrielle,"Shh! They can hear you. Oh, my God! There's another rack back here! This all your ex-wife's stuff?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, my God! She wears my size! It's amazing. Nobody wears my size."
Gabrielle,"And normally that would creep me out, except it means that I can borrow this one-of-a-kind Undari for our date!"
Gabrielle,So?
Gabrielle,"Okay, ""A,"" I'm not your girlfriend, and ""B,"" she's not gonna find out unless you tell her. Come on! A dress this gorgeous is meant to be seen. Every day it hangs in the closet, an angel loses its wings."
Gabrielle,I just wanted a moment to say good-bye.
Gabrielle,"Hi. Remember me? I had dinner here the other night. Anyway, I was driving through your neighborhood after having, like, three iced teas, and I really have to go to the bathroom. Do you mind?"
Gabrielle,You and I are gonna be so happy together.
Gabrielle,I feel ten pounds lighter. Thank you.
Gabrielle,You do not have to pay for my dress.
Gabrielle,"Trust me, it was a steal. I'm gonna go powder my nose, and then you can start showing me off."
Gabrielle,Hey.
Gabrielle,Thanks.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, couture."
Gabrielle,"Wow, good eye."
Gabrielle,"So you're--well, first, let me just say you have amazing taste. If we had met in any other context, we would so get along."
Gabrielle,"Okay, you're mad, so I'm just gonna blow right by that slut crack."
Gabrielle,"Okay, let's be reasonable. You can't wear two dresses to one lunch. It's not like I have a spare in the car."
Gabrielle,Go ahead. Yell all you want. You can't force me to take off this dress.
Gabrielle,Could you help me with the clasp?
Gabrielle,"Hey, Victor. You're probably wondering why I've been in here so long. Funny story. I ran into your ex-wife."
Gabrielle,So what kind of orange is this shirt? Like a salmon or a coral?
Gabrielle,"Oh, cheese doodle."
Gabrielle,Why don't you just tell Tom to pick another color?
Gabrielle,You mean quit?
Gabrielle,Guess so.
Gabrielle,Sorry. I wanted options. Stop judging me. I was hopped up on couture.
Gabrielle,"What? Over a dress? God, what a bi*ch."
Gabrielle,She threatened me with mace and then slugged you. Now you're on her side?
Gabrielle,What happened? Did you have some little mistress on the side?
Gabrielle,"I've known you for two weeks, and this is the first glimpse of a guy I could actually like."
Gabrielle,"A guy who can admit he screwed up, one who's not trying to impress me every second of the day with how perfect and charming he is. I wouldn't mind seeing more of that guy."
Gabrielle,I'd love to. Although what am I gonna wear now?
Gabrielle,"Look who's back, Mr. Cocky."
Gabrielle,"I've known you for two weeks,and this is the first glimpse of a guy could actually like."
Gabrielle,I had such a good time tonight. Who knew you could dance?
Gabrielle,"Not tonight, thanks."
Gabrielle,"And every time you say that, eventually gets a little further away. Stop begging, or I'm not going to your rally tomorrow."
Gabrielle,"Half the fun? Oh, honey, if I ever do say yes--you're gonna adjust that percentage way down."
Gabrielle,Sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry. I'm afraid Mr. Lang has to take an important meeting in his limo--now.
Gabrielle,Your speech--I liked it.
Gabrielle,"Well, you laid out all your positions. Don't you want to get acquainted with mine?"
Gabrielle,Music. Loud music.
Gabrielle,Not a peep. Twenty-four hours.
Gabrielle,I don't care! He can find two lousy minutes for me.
Gabrielle,"Sorry, no poker today. Lynette had to work. Want a margarita?"
Gabrielle,"Yeah, in the fridge."
Gabrielle,That's Toby. He's fixing my closet.
Gabrielle,We had sex yesterday in his limo.
Gabrielle,"Well, stretch, of course. I'm not a complete slut. Point is, he hasn't called since."
Gabrielle,Fantastic. As good as with Carlos.
Gabrielle,"God, I'm such an idiot. I gave it up way too fast. Now I've lost all the power."
Gabrielle,"No, I'm serious. Our mothers had the right idea. They let men think they were the only ones who needed sex, And women just went along as a favor. Men begged for every crumb, and we never lost the upper hand."
Gabrielle,Aren't they all? So what should I do to make him jealous?
Gabrielle,Thank you. You can go now. I don't want to take any more time out of your busy schedule.
Gabrielle,"Yes, it was."
Gabrielle,Just trying to get your attention.
Gabrielle,"Hey, you hurt me. If I have to strike back hard to protect myself--"
Gabrielle,"I've been taken for granted before, and I'm not gonna let it happen again. If I'm gonna give myself to you, you damn well better worship me!"
Gabrielle,Good.
Gabrielle,You're in love with me?
Gabrielle,Look. No gloves.
Gabrielle,Shouldn't there be an emergency light? Sometimes in these elevators there's a. . .
Gabrielle,"Well, aren't you clever?"
Gabrielle,"No, wait! This is the first time I've had you to myself all night."
Gabrielle,Taking my piece.
Gabrielle,Exactly. Going down. . .
Gabrielle,I know. That's what makes it so exciting--the risk.
Gabrielle,"It's an elevator, silly. It has an emergency stop button. I don't."
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god, that's amazing! What are you doing?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, god!"
Gabrielle,"Oh, man, I was just starting to get into it."
Gabrielle,You have no idea.
Gabrielle,I made you waffles! Eat 'em while they're hot. What?
Gabrielle,They're just toaster waffles.
Gabrielle,"Well, just so you're prepared, consider this my pre-refusal."
Gabrielle,We're having a good time. Why risk ruining it?
Gabrielle,"Oh, you don't wanna marry her. She's a tramp. Hold out for a good girl."
Gabrielle,"Look, Victor--getting divorced really kicked my ass. I'm sorry. Just--next time I get married, I've gotta be sure."
Gabrielle,"Well, if you can choke down that lousy waffle I made you, that'd be a start."
Gabrielle,Hi! Can I help you?
Gabrielle,He's not here. Is that for him?
Gabrielle,Okay.
Gabrielle,Do I look like the maid? Give me that!
Gabrielle,You! Blackmailer!
Gabrielle,No! Fifty thousand dollars? Are you insane?!
Gabrielle,"I want all the negatives of those photos, or I start breaking fingers!"
Gabrielle,Give me the pictures!
Gabrielle,That's for calling me a maid!
Gabrielle,"That miserable cockroach. Well, if you wanna smack him around a little, I can go inside and turn up the radio."
Gabrielle,"Oh, no, no, I'm gonna hang on to these. They're a little revealing."
Gabrielle,"Okay--yeah. But guard them with your life. Yeah, especially that one."
Gabrielle,How was I supposed to know the cops were gonna release the photos to the press?
Gabrielle,"You know, you're a single guy. Maybe people won't care."
Gabrielle,"Look, I know this is my fault, so if you wanna bite my head off, go ahead."
Gabrielle,Is there anything I can do?
Gabrielle,"It's not going very well, is it?"
Gabrielle,That does it.
Gabrielle,Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
Gabrielle,I am the woman in the photos!
Gabrielle,Standing by my man.
Gabrielle,"My name is Gabrielle Marquez, and I want you to know, right before those photos were taken, Victor asked me to marry him."
Gabrielle,I said yes. I would be thrilled to be Mrs. Victor Lang.
Gabrielle,"In fact, I was so overcome, that when we were trapped in the elevator, I seized the moment to express my joy."
Gabrielle,"The only reason Victor kept it from you was to protect me because he's the kind of man who puts a woman's honor before his own, and that's the kind of man you marry. That's the kind of man you vote for."
Gabrielle,The only reason he didn't tell you was because he was protecting me.
Gabrielle,"In a few months, I will be Mrs. Victor Lang."
Gabrielle,"In a few months, I will be Mrs.Victor Lang.."
Gabrielle,I don't know my own strength..
Gabrielle,Yep. She's on the top of a Swiss Alp and still managed to send a basket of muffins.
Gabrielle,"No. Damn things traveled five thousand miles, and they were still moist."
Gabrielle,"Wait, wait. You're not gonna embarrass me with some sappy toast, are you?"
Gabrielle,A poem?
Gabrielle,What are you waiting for? Get the champagne.
Gabrielle,"Hi, Edie!"
Gabrielle,"Isn't he great? I know it's been quick, but he's just so amazing."
Gabrielle,"He is, and I've never been happier."
Gabrielle,"Edie, are you okay?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, sweetie. Don't worry. You're gonna find someone soon. I just know it. What?"
Gabrielle,"Well, who is it?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, no, no, Edie. Come on. It would make me happy to know who's making you happy."
Gabrielle,Yeah! I wanna know who's putting that dopey grin on your face.
Gabrielle,Who?
Gabrielle,What kind of woman would keep her husband's body in the freezer?
Gabrielle,Why should we be embarrassed? We're not the ones who kept a corpse-icle in the basement.
Gabrielle,"Uh, yeah. Why else would she have hid the body?"
Gabrielle,"But once they defrost the body and do an autopsy, I guarantee you they're gonna find a bellyful of arsenic."
Gabrielle,Would you guys excuse me?
Gabrielle,"Hey, Edie!"
Gabrielle,"I've been doing some thinking, and you know how--how do I put this? You know how you feel like sometimes people hate you?"
Gabrielle,"We, you should, 'cause they do."
Gabrielle,Since you started doing things to piss people off.
Gabrielle,"Oh, I don't know. Off the top of my head--dating your friends' exes."
Gabrielle,"Edie, there are a thousand single men in Fairview. Why do you have to date my ex-husband?"
Gabrielle,"It's awkward! It's--it's like if I donated a dress to charity, and I went to a party, and you showed up wearing it."
Gabrielle,"Look, Edie, just find your own men and stop snapping up other people's castoffs!"
Gabrielle,Then be prepared to suffer the consequences.
Gabrielle,You're about to find out.
Gabrielle,So here's what's gonna happen-- we're not talking to Edie anymore.
Gabrielle,"I mean, we as in she betrayed me, and you're my best friends, so you're gonna support me because that's what friends do."
Gabrielle,"I can't believe you're not furious at this. Before she sank her fangs into Carlos, she was dating your ex-husband and Mike."
Gabrielle,"Really? Because I wasn't very comfortable taking your side when you were feuding with Patty Monroe over the backyard fence line, but I did."
Gabrielle,"Don't even get me started about what I've done for you, okay? I'm still boycotting Madame Kim's Day Spa because of your botched bikini wax."
Gabrielle,"She will show you later! The point is, good friends share more than just gossip and brunch. They share enemies, too. So are you with me or not?"
Gabrielle,"No, no! Not cold, frozen! I want icicles hanging from that bi*ch's ears!"
Gabrielle,"Hey, Lynette, it's Gaby. Victor got pulled into some photo op at the homeless shelter. So I'm free for lunch.You wanna go with? I tried Susan but she's not home, which is weird because her car's in the driveway and--so is yours. Where is everybody?"
Gabrielle,Lynette! Susan!
Gabrielle,What are you two doing here?
Gabrielle,I don't believe it. This is an absolute betrayal of our friendship.
Gabrielle,Is that what our friendship is worth to you--twenty pizzas? We had a pact!
Gabrielle,Me? You two owe me an apology.
Gabrielle,"I am leaving this party right now, and if you two don't come with me, our friendship is over."
Gabrielle,"Oh! No, I mean it."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, stop! Put me down! What are you doing?!"
Gabrielle,"Stop it! Carlos, put me down! How dare you maul me like that!"
Gabrielle,I'm sorry. Betrayal makes me a little cranky.
Gabrielle,I'll tell you what's ridiculous. You not having the guts to tell me you were dating Edie.
Gabrielle,Yeah. I had to find out from her at my damn engagement party.
Gabrielle,I didn't plan it that way. It was spur of the moment.
Gabrielle,"Yes, deeply."
Gabrielle,"Well, aren't you in love with Edie?"
Gabrielle,"I'm sorry, Carlos."
Gabrielle,"Well, I wanna look fabulous tonight when Victor's elected mayor."
Gabrielle,"Vern, focus. It's never bad luck when I look fabulous."
Gabrielle,Oh! Hi. Don't worry. I'm here now.
Gabrielle,"Oh, no, no. I'm just gonna say bye to my friend, then I'm gone."
Gabrielle,"Oh, Vern, I can't wait for you to meet him. He's everything I've ever wanted in a man--sensitive and kind--"
Gabrielle,#NAME?
Gabrielle,"Oh, my God. That's the best part. He lets me be me. All right, I gotta get going."
Gabrielle,What are you doing? I told you I was leaving. Stop writing!
Gabrielle,"Oh, give me a break. I was standing right there. You could've said something."
Gabrielle,You can't talk to me like that!
Gabrielle,Forty dollars? You think I'm gonna pay that?
Gabrielle,Thank you. Your husband runs a hell of a campaign.
Gabrielle,"Well, it is ending a lot better than it started."
Gabrielle,"Oh, this morning, I got in a fight with a parking cop over a ticket, and the guy was a total jerk."
Gabrielle,What do you mean?
Gabrielle,Keep talking.
Gabrielle,You ready to be the mayor's wife?
Gabrielle,My city. It's like I'm seeing it for the first time. Everything looks different now that I'm First Lady of Fairview.
Gabrielle,"Well, well, well. Who do we have here?"
Gabrielle,"Vern, you're just awful. And as it happens, so am I."
Gabrielle,Really? 'Cause I just did.
Gabrielle,Just stand back and enjoy the carnage.
Gabrielle,Thank you. Now what you're about to see may astound you.
Gabrielle,"You could try, but you might not want to. See, I'm engaged to Victor Lang. Ring a bell? The mayor? Your new boss?"
Gabrielle,"Listen, buddy, you're not getting it. You answer to me now. I could have you fired."
Gabrielle,"I can do whatever I want! In fact, my first official act of business as mayoress of Fairview--is to declare today free parking day!"
Gabrielle,Free parking!
Gabrielle,No!
Gabrielle,"Ow, you're hurting me!"
Gabrielle,"You know what that sound is, fat boy? The sound of your career circling the bowl. Yeah, you're gonna find out what happens when you screw with the first lady of Fairview!"
Gabrielle,"Hi, honey. You look handsome in a tux."
Gabrielle,"All right, look, I know you're mad, but wait till you hear what that jerk did to me--"
Gabrielle,Um--doesn't ring a bell.
Gabrielle,That explains it.
Gabrielle,He was mean. He deserved it.
Gabrielle,"Constantly? Aside from today, give me one example."
Gabrielle,"I was just joking around, being me. I thought you liked that."
Gabrielle,Okay. I'm sorry I disappointed you. It won't happen again. I better get dressed. I don't want to be late to the victory party.
Gabrielle,Oh. That's what I was trying to tell you. The meter man--he grabbed my arm and twisted it.
Gabrielle,"Mm, it's not as bad as it looks."
Gabrielle,I think so.
Gabrielle,"No. I can't find a good flower girl. Lynette keeps hinting for me to use Penny. But I saw her in that preschool sing-along, and I am sorry, but we are talking zero charisma."
Gabrielle,You did?
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god. She looks just like me when I was that age!"
Gabrielle,"I love that you're so into this wedding. Most men would be like, ""yeah, yeah, tell me where the church is,"" but you're as obsessed as me. You're like a hot groom and a gay best friend all rolled into one."
Gabrielle,"Oh, Susan! Julie told me about Ian. I am so sorry. You must be devastated."
Gabrielle,I see you've picked up the pieces.
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god! Congratulations!"
Gabrielle,Really? Same day?
Gabrielle,"Well, I'm sorry. I can't make it. I have plans that day."
Gabrielle,"No, I really can't."
Gabrielle,Uh--my wedding?
Gabrielle,"Oh, I see you got the invitation!"
Gabrielle,"Well, you canceled, and Victor was kind of in a rush because he didn't think it'd look good for the mayor to be shacking up. And every day we tried, someone had a conflict. And then your date opened up, and we knew all my friends were available, and, well--you know, you, too."
Gabrielle,I am so throwing the bouquet to you!
Gabrielle,Susan. Hi.
Gabrielle,I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Gabrielle,Only because I admire your taste. It's not theft. It's an homage.
Gabrielle,"Well, I gotta go."
Gabrielle,"Oh, what, now you suddenly have the trademark on peach tulips?"
Gabrielle,"""Yeah. Listen, about that--"
Gabrielle,"It was short notice, okay? These people are booked months in advance. The only people available were thones you just bailed on."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I see what you're getting at. And you know what? You are right. You have been my de facto wedding planner, and you deserve to get paid. All right, what's the going rate? Seven thousand? Eight thousand?"
Gabrielle,"All right, ten thousand. I'm not gonna haggle."
Gabrielle,"Well, you can't have it. And if you ask me, I am doing you a really big favor."
Gabrielle,You are rushing into this marriage thing way too fast. Why don't you give it some time and see if you and me work as a couple?
Gabrielle,"Yeah, on and off. Mostly off. What if you tie the knot in a month and realize that you miss Ian and Mike misses the coma?"
Gabrielle,You don't mean that. That's just a big dramatic gesture.
Gabrielle,My flowers!
Gabrielle,"Honey, I am so sorry. I hope you don't hate me."
Gabrielle,"Just so you know, I changed all my flowers."
Gabrielle,The hell I don't. Those peach tulips belong to you--and so do these.
Gabrielle,"Well, we got chocolate and wine.Your place or mine?"
Gabrielle,"Me, too, and I'm so sorry about that comment I made about Mike. It was way out of line. You guys are gonna be insanely happy."
Gabrielle,Please. Mike is not Karl.
Gabrielle,"Honey, please. If anyone should be nervous, it's me. I met Victor three months ago. I mean, I'm crazy about him. It's just, the thought of saying those vows again? That's scary."
Gabrielle,"Honey, you're gonna be okay. All right? We're gonna help each other through this."
Gabrielle,"And getting married is scary, but at least we'll be doing it together. Oh, my god! We should totally do that!"
Gabrielle,Get married together!
Gabrielle,"Oh! No, stupid. I mean, a double wedding!"
Gabrielle,"Yeah, and then you wouldn't be mad at me for the date, and I wouldn't feel guilty. And we could be brides--"
Gabrielle,"Oh, yes! Let's celebrate. More chocolate. And just so you know, if I was a lesbian, I'd totally do you."
Gabrielle,Morning.
Gabrielle,I hope I didn't wake you last night. I was at Susan's till midnight.
Gabrielle,"No, not exactly. Just a--small change of plans about the wedding."
Gabrielle,See--Susan was really upset--
Gabrielle,Practically in tears over this whole wedding date thing.
Gabrielle,"So after an hour of this, I suddenly heard myself say--"
Gabrielle,Wanted to bite my tongue the minute it came out.
Gabrielle,Jumping up and down and hugging me.
Gabrielle,So we're kind stuck.
Gabrielle,So what do you think?
Gabrielle,"How? Look I know I shouldn't have offered, but I did. I can't just take it back."
Gabrielle,"I do, and I know you've worked really hard to make our wedding perfect."
Gabrielle,That's your problem?
Gabrielle,Press? At our wedding?
Gabrielle,So all of this planning and attention to detail--that's all been about your image?
Gabrielle,How about the bride?
Gabrielle,Hey!
Gabrielle,Good.
Gabrielle,Mike said no?
Gabrielle,"No. No, it's okay. Victor was kind of on the fence about it, too."
Gabrielle,"Me, too. I think it would've been so much fun."
Gabrielle,"Well, I gotta go. I'm gonna meet Francois."
Gabrielle,That must feel really great.
Gabrielle,"I do, too."
Gabrielle,It is after three o'clock! Where the hell is Bree with my something new?
Gabrielle,"God, I should have my head examined for even agreeing to this. Who the hell cares about Swiss jewelry anyway?"
Gabrielle,"And, of course, it's the hottest day of the year. All the guests are out there sweating like pigs. God, at this rate, my reception's gonna look like the finish line of the Boston marathon."
Gabrielle,Are you out of your mind? I can't get married without my something new.
Gabrielle,I just paid a makeup artist five hundred bucks to do my face. Do you really think I wanna march down the aisle looking like I just ate a popsicle?
Gabrielle,"God, it is ten after, and Bree is never late! Where can she be? All right, that's it. After I finish ""tszujing"" my hair, tell the preacher it's showtime. I can't believe my wedding's already ruined, and it hasn't even started."
Gabrielle,Is that Bree? She better not have come empty-handed!
Gabrielle,Holy crap!
Gabrielle,Chicken or fish?
Gabrielle,I haven't gotten your reply card back yet. So chicken or fish?
Gabrielle,Why not?
Gabrielle,"Okay, maybe a little, but it'll be weirder if you don't."
Gabrielle,"Look, everyone knows you're living with Edie. If she shows up alone, people will think I asked her not to bring you, like it bugs me that you guys are together."
Gabrielle,"Which is why I have to show people that I'm okay with it. Please, just consider it my wedding gift."
Gabrielle,What? And just go to the reception? You can't do that.
Gabrielle,Reception starts at four.
Gabrielle,"Well, I'm glad you could join us, Milton. It's good to get to know you before the wedding."
Gabrielle,I'm hardly flawless. I'm sure I have a blemish hidden away somewhere.
Gabrielle,"Honey, he's a multimillionaire. He runs my league."
Gabrielle,"You gotta be kidding, right? I mean, we just finished a campaign. You're not about to put me through another one."
Gabrielle,"God, no. It's a complete snore. Pasting a smile on my face while you say the same speech for the fiftieth time?"
Gabrielle,"Well, the feeling wasn't mutual. You think I enjoyed sipping tea with these frumpy matrons who wore loud, polyblend pantsuits? You know how many times I just wanted to scream, ""vote for my husband, you color-blind cow!""?"""
Gabrielle,"Well, they're not gonna get us again. I made nice with Fairview. I'm not about to suck up to the whole damn state."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, I was trying to respect tradition--but I got horny."
Gabrielle,What are you working on so late?
Gabrielle,Polling data? Why are you polling? The election's over.
Gabrielle,Is this about running for governor? Because I told you how I feel about that.
Gabrielle,"Oh. Okay, well, let's explore it now. Nope, not gonna happen."
Gabrielle,"Victor, ever since we met, it's been photo ops and fund-raisers, and I'm sick of it."
Gabrielle,"Fairview is my home, and I don't want to leave it. And you can't make this decision without me. I'm gonna be your wife."
Gabrielle,"Oh, so I don't even get a vote?"
Gabrielle,"Okay, look, no! I already married a man who put his career before me, and I swore I wasn't gonna do it again."
Gabrielle,"Well, here's one less thing you have to worry about-- our wedding."
Gabrielle,"As far as I'm concerned, it's just in the nick of time."
Gabrielle,"God, Milton, the newspaper's not even here yet."
Gabrielle,Why? What happened wasn't your fault.
Gabrielle,You only suggested it. You can't make him go after something he doesn't want.
Gabrielle,Why?
Gabrielle,"So what are you saying, I should marry Victor because you're a withholding father?"
Gabrielle,Fine. I get it. But why would I want a husband who values his father's opinion more than mine?
Gabrielle,He did?
Gabrielle,"He blew off eighty million dollars? Well, if he cares about me so damn much, why am I not hearing this from him?"
Gabrielle,So how do I look?
Gabrielle,It means so much to me that we're all here together right now.
Gabrielle,Mrs. McCluskey! Enjoy the wedding?
Gabrielle,"I don't know and I don't care. Today, I'm so filled with love, I can forgive anyone anything. Oh, um, but if you do see them again, call security."
Gabrielle,"Oh, my gosh, that's right. Okay, you stay here. I'm gonna go grab him."
Gabrielle,"No, I'm still looking, but I'll let you know."
Gabrielle,"Oh, Carlos. Didn't know you were in here."
Gabrielle,Yes. I can see that.
Gabrielle,What are you talking about?
Gabrielle,Holy crap!
Gabrielle,"Trust me,Victor.This will be a night you'll never forget."
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,I just got married.There are 200 people out there waiting for me to lead a conga line.
Gabrielle,"I can't dump him on our wedding day.That's a horrible thing to do,even to Victor."
Gabrielle,I was--just counting gifts.
Gabrielle,Nope.
Gabrielle,Come on!
Gabrielle,"Oh,focus,you idiot!Come on.When are we leaving?"
Gabrielle,Okay.Wait!Aren't you gonna kiss the bride?
Gabrielle,"Finally!Carlos,where the hell are you?"
Gabrielle,"Oh,my god! Is she okay?"
Gabrielle,"Okay,that's all right.I'll just take a cab and meet you."
Gabrielle,In a few weeks? What?No! It has to be tonight!Victor's in the bedroom right now waiting to consummate.
Gabrielle,"Okay,you know,running away with you on my wedding night was crazy enough.But runnin' away to be alone is insane!"
Gabrielle,No!I would rather try and work it out with Victor.
Gabrielle,What's going on here?
Gabrielle,I remember telling you I wasn't ready to sell the house yet.
Gabrielle,I still have a lot of stuff here.
Gabrielle,"I'm just not in a rush to unload this house,okay?This was my home.I was very happy here."
Gabrielle,"Yeah,it's a great house."
Gabrielle,"I'm not waiting for anything.Oh,look,a moving van."
Gabrielle,New neighbors.What do we know?
Gabrielle,And money.They've been remodeling for weeks.
Gabrielle,Do you think this is them?
Gabrielle,He's a cutie.What does he do?
Gabrielle,So I hear congratulations are in order.Edie just announced you're getting married.Best wishes!
Gabrielle,"Really? Because she thinks you're getting married.Everyone else thinks you're getting married.So,again,best wishes."
Gabrielle,"Neither am I!You told me you wanna run away together,and then I don't hear from you for a month!"
Gabrielle,You were not.
Gabrielle,"Yeah,well,I--kind of thought about you,too."
Gabrielle,Yeah?Prove it.
Gabrielle,"Oh,my god,are you serious?"
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,Affair?I thought we were talking about runng away together.
Gabrielle,That old battle-ax is gonna outlive us all!
Gabrielle,"Oh,far be it for me to speak ill of the future Mrs.Carlos Solis."
Gabrielle,Best wishes!
Gabrielle,"Well,not unless we kill you."
Gabrielle,"Me,too."
Gabrielle,You're right. I'm not happy.Let's talk.All I'm saying is I just wanna know that I come first with you.Sometimes I feel less like your wife than a possession.It's demeaning.It's--it's--why are you smiling right now?
Gabrielle,"Well,it's hard when you're so busy.Maybe we should go away and just take a couple weeks a month.Let's rediscover what it was that made us fall in love to begin with."
Gabrielle,How's next week?
Gabrielle,Are you serious?
Gabrielle,"Yeah. Unfortunately, it's my sweat. When are you gonna dump her?"
Gabrielle,"Generally speaking, women don't leave their husbands for guys who have girlfriends. Just boot the bi*ch. What are you afraid of?"
Gabrielle,What the hell's the matter with you?
Gabrielle,One second!
Gabrielle,Edie! What brings you here?
Gabrielle,Sorry. Haven't seen him.
Gabrielle,"Uh, that's impossible, because he's there! There he is!"
Gabrielle,"Carlos! He's at your house. Oh, he just let himself in. There you go. He's home."
Gabrielle,So?
Gabrielle,"Edie! Edie, wait! Wait, wait, wait! Don't go! Don't go!"
Gabrielle,"Uh, you, uh, have a birthday coming up, and, uh, I don't know what to get ya."
Gabrielle,Or maybe a coffeepot or scented hangers or--a nice clock radio.
Gabrielle,"Uh, wait, but don't go! I-I need a little more guidance!"
Gabrielle,"Not the same girl like she's changed, or not the same girl because she's been replaced by a robot?"
Gabrielle,"Uh, Susan."
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god. Have you been there this whole time?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, no, no. She doesn't want to talk about that."
Gabrielle,"Oh, come on. Let's dig into the pie. Looks amazing."
Gabrielle,Wow.
Gabrielle,"Oh, no cream for me, thanks."
Gabrielle,"Hey, what's up?"
Gabrielle,I know. Do you believe that pie business? I thought Bree's head was gonna explode.
Gabrielle,"Well, it just seemed like people had it pretty well covered."
Gabrielle,"Oh, that's sweet. But to be honest, I don't like hospitals."
Gabrielle,"What, is this a test of our friendship?"
Gabrielle,I can't wait.
Gabrielle,"Oh, sorry. I stopped off to get you some magazines."
Gabrielle,Why don't I go check if there are some other ones?
Gabrielle,It's good. Are you cold? They keep it cold in here.
Gabrielle,"You must be freezing. You know, I have the cutest shawl in the car, so I'm just gonna run out and get it for you."
Gabrielle,I'm sorry. It's just hospitals are hard for me.
Gabrielle,You think I don't care?
Gabrielle,"Did I ever tell you about my father? He had cancer, too. Started in the liver, went into his bones, and ten months later, he was dead."
Gabrielle,"I'm not finished. Those last weeks, every day we thought we were gonna lose him. And every day, before I would go into his room, my mom would say, ""no tears"". Daddy wants to see you smiling. If you're gonna cry, you can't go in"". So--on the last night--I sat there and I watched him die. His eyes were closed, but I thought he could still see me. So I kept smiling--all night. I was 5."
Gabrielle,"But on the plus side, I made a pretty good career out of knowing how to smile when I didn't really feel like it. But I can't pretend with you. Not when I'm scared I'm gonna lose you."
Gabrielle,You promise? 'Cause if I did--then--god! I'm such a mess.
Gabrielle,"Well, don't get sappy on me. I won't stand for it. All right. Susan, is the camera ready?"
Gabrielle,A charades party? Didn't you just throw one?
Gabrielle,Oh. Right. Guess it's time for another one.
Gabrielle,Um--sorry. Victor needs me at this--political thing. Damn. Damn. Damn.
Gabrielle,She slapped her kid?! No!
Gabrielle,Don't answer it! It's Susan. She's hosting another game night.
Gabrielle,Probably. Why?
Gabrielle,"Susan, good news. We can come to the party after all. Hey, you know who else you should invite?"
Gabrielle,You leaving already?
Gabrielle,"Well, Victor has a teachers' union thing on Thursday. Guess I'll see you on Thursday. Carlos, what's happening here? I mean, with us. Why are we still sneaking around?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, come on. Edie's recovered from her little suicide attempt. Don't you think it's time to move on?"
Gabrielle,"Okay, but if you did have a choice, would it be a hard one? I mean, it's not like you're in love with Edie, is it?"
Gabrielle,A bracelet's always nice. For Edie's sister.
Gabrielle,State senator?
Gabrielle,"Oh, that's right. I was reading about that in politics is boring magazine."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, you're lucky."
Gabrielle,Were you widowed or divorced?
Gabrielle,Excuse me.
Gabrielle,She's got a ring!
Gabrielle,"Edie---she's wearing a big, honkin' engagement ring the size of a peach pit."
Gabrielle,"Oh, so you're not engaged?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, you gotta be kidding me!"
Gabrielle,"No, no, no. I am done with your explanations, and I am done with just give me two more weeks, baby. Whatever games you're playing, I'm sick of it. We're through."
Gabrielle,"You think Victor's my only option? Well,Igot news for you, Carlos. I can have any guy I want, because this--waits for no man."
Gabrielle,"Adam, I feel the tag of my dress sticking out, and I can't reach it. Do you mind?"
Gabrielle,I think I got a chill. Now let me see if I can give you one.
Gabrielle,I'll do it.
Gabrielle,"Oh, okay. I will pick Adam."
Gabrielle,Orson.
Gabrielle,Why?
Gabrielle,Good point. Mike! Yes! Let's get started.
Gabrielle,"Okay, when has anyone ever used a poem as a clue?"
Gabrielle,Yeah! Let's play!
Gabrielle,That's not fair. She's like the charades ninja.
Gabrielle,Working out.
Gabrielle,A blister. Sounds like blister.
Gabrielle,All right. Ready? Get set--go.
Gabrielle,"Tom, watch it!"
Gabrielle,"Oh, here. Let me get that."
Gabrielle,Okay.
Gabrielle,Sorry.
Gabrielle,What? I spilled my drink on him.
Gabrielle,"Look, lady, you need to calm down. You're getting a reputation around here for having a stick up your ass."
Gabrielle,What do you mean by that?
Gabrielle,"Oh, no, no. Tell me. What's my reputation? Am I smug and holier-than-thou? Oh, no, wait. That's you."
Gabrielle,Bree saw you slap your daughter.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, she asked about her father and then you smacked her. Why'd you do that?"
Gabrielle,I guess you--saw what happened down there.
Gabrielle,"Look, it was a long time ago, and--and it didn't mean anything."
Gabrielle,Now or before tonight?
Gabrielle,"Look, I know you're upset."
Gabrielle,"Victor, really, I don't think it's a big deal."
Gabrielle,"When you saw me flirting, you smashed a glass. When Victor heard I had an affair, he started crunching poll numbers. I need a man who cares enough to explode when he thinks he's gonna lose me. I don't just love you. I love the way you love me."
Gabrielle,See you Thursday.
Gabrielle,"Night, Carlos."
Gabrielle,"Well, I bought you an expensive gift, and I'm not giving it to you unless there's a party with people who can see how generous I am."
Gabrielle,"And we can play games, like ""how big is mummy's tummy?"""
Gabrielle,"Yeah, we get a ball of yarn, and we each cut a piece that we think is just big enough to fit around your stomach, and the one closest wins a prize."
Gabrielle,"Honey, it's okay. You look cute in a scarf."
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,Why'd you take your wig off?
Gabrielle,"Okay, not smart."
Gabrielle,"Interesting. Question--when was the last time you were in the bar and heard a guy turn to his friend and say, ""hey, check out the soul on that girl""?"
Gabrielle,"I'm saying men are visual. Hell, I have a whole closet full of costumes. You need to give Tom something to look at, something spicy, like--"
Gabrielle,"But you could be, which brings me to my second point--men like variety. Tonight you're a redhead. Tomorrow--you are--Helga, the sexy milkmaid. Or--Amber, the lonely runaway. Or--Jeff, the friendly guy from work. What? I don't know what Tom is into."
Gabrielle,What are you doing here?
Gabrielle,Can't you just call me?
Gabrielle,Ew! How did you get those?
Gabrielle,You are still sleeping with Edie?
Gabrielle,"Yeah, if I didn't, he would think something is going on. What is your excuse for doing it with Edie?"
Gabrielle,"This is serious, okay? If Victor wakes up with a zoo in his pants, there's gonna be hell to pay."
Gabrielle,"Okay, just don't panic, okay? We're gonna get the salve or ointment or whatever it is you put down there, and we're gonna be fine."
Gabrielle,Yeah.
Gabrielle,That's nurse Gaby to you.
Gabrielle,"Well, the doctor says you need to relax, and I know just how to relax you."
Gabrielle,"It's a blend of 36 essential oils, anise root and fennel. Do you like it?"
Gabrielle,That's the fennel.
Gabrielle,That's the tension--leaving your body.
Gabrielle,And we can rinse it off--in three to five minutes. But before we do that--
Gabrielle,"You know, for a guy getting rubbed down by a hot nurse, you ask a lot of questions."
Gabrielle,"Well, don't just stand there. Come in. We have lots of food and fun and surprises."
Gabrielle,Yep.
Gabrielle,All quiet on the southern front.
Gabrielle,"Absolutely. It's kind of exciting, though."
Gabrielle,"Playing with fire, almost getting burned but not quite."
Gabrielle,That's what's so exciting.
Gabrielle,And I was married when we got together.
Gabrielle,Ooh.
Gabrielle,What the hell is it?
Gabrielle,I say we keep smiling and look for the hidden cameras. I think we're about to get Punk'd.
Gabrielle,Ooh! They're coming.
Gabrielle,"Well, we're not saying that."
Gabrielle,"Good work, boys, but I have to head out in a few minutes, so make sure you put all the stuff back in the garage. Hello?"
Gabrielle,"I'm leaving in five minutes. Uh, Brett, could you come here a second? How long has that van been parked over there?"
Gabrielle,"Hours? Are you serious? Oh, my god."
Gabrielle,"Brett, when's the last time a cable guy waited for anyone? I see a lot of lawn mowing in your future. Hey, it's me again. You're not gonna believe this. Before Victor left on his business trip, he hired someone to tail me."
Gabrielle,No way. It's gonna take more than a guy with mini binoculars and a bag of doughnuts to keep me under lock and key. I'll be there as soon as I can.
Gabrielle,"Boys, time to get paid."
Gabrielle,"As soon as we get around the corner, we're gonna have to adjust this horn."
Gabrielle,H-hi. Look at you. What a surprise.
Gabrielle,"Wow, look at you. Congratulations."
Gabrielle,Okay. So-- Are you guys staying here?
Gabrielle,That's right. You're a hotel heiress.
Gabrielle,"Uh, yeah, so I married the mayor. Kooky, huh?"
Gabrielle,"Uh, no. He's away at a conference, so I decided to treat myself to a spa weekend."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I plan to. Good to see you."
Gabrielle,"Sorry about that. A complete shock. I mean, of all people to run into."
Gabrielle,Just an old friend and his idiot wife. Come on. Let's go.
Gabrielle,Because I want to feel pretty and feminine. Ooh! My chili cheese fries! Just a second!
Gabrielle,"Uh, okay. You know that old friend I ran into in the lobby? It might have been John Rowland. Maybe. I'm not sure."
Gabrielle,"But just to be safe, you may wanna hide in the closet."
Gabrielle,"Really? Because his father-in-law goes hunting with Victor --You know, the guy who hired someone to tail us and possibly kill us?"
Gabrielle,"John, what are you doing here?"
Gabrielle,"Seriously, John, you have got to get out of here."
Gabrielle,What about your wife?
Gabrielle,Awfully pregnant.
Gabrielle,"I-I wasn't ""trapped."""
Gabrielle,"Well, I think you're paraphrasing. Okay, seriously, you have to go."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I don't think we need to get into that."
Gabrielle,"Uh, does not ring a bell."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, good times. Anyways, uh, that's a negatory on the affair--"
Gabrielle,And I will see you later.
Gabrielle,Please!
Gabrielle,"Boy, that was a close one, huh?"
Gabrielle,"Yes, I had an affair. Old news. Move on. Where's that room service?"
Gabrielle,You deserved it. All you cared about back then was work.
Gabrielle,I shopped because I was bored and lonely--Same reason I had an affair.
Gabrielle,"Oh, let it go! John Rowland didn't do anything to you that you're not doing to Victor."
Gabrielle,"Is it, Mr. Man in the closet? Yeah, you heard me. Who's John Rowland now?"
Gabrielle,Hey. What's going on?
Gabrielle,You serious?
Gabrielle,"So what are you suggesting, we stay with Victor and Edie?"
Gabrielle,How long are we talking about?
Gabrielle,"Six months? Nobody takes that long to heal anymore. It's a breakup, not a face-lift."
Gabrielle,"Yeah. I do. You're such a good guy, Carlos. I really hate that about you."
Gabrielle,This kiss has to last six months. You better make it good.
Gabrielle,"Victor, it's me. I got your message. I've gotta be honest, I'm very annoyed that you're not coming home today like you promised. I told you I have something very important to tell you, and I wanted to do it in person, but now you're gonna be home for another week, and I can't wait. Victor, I'm leaving you. I-- can't believe I'm ending my marriage on a hotel voice mail. This is very tacky. You're forcing me to be tacky, Victor. I am not a tacky person. I am very, very classy. Oh! Hang on one second."
Gabrielle,"Hello? Hey, Carlos. Yeah, I can't talk right now. I'm breaking up with Victor. No, he's not here. He's in Washington. Yeah, okay, I'll explain later."
Gabrielle,"Sorry about that, Victor. Uh, anyway, it's over. Uh, we both know it wasn't working. Uh, good luck on everything, and you don't have to call me back. Okay, bye-bye."
Gabrielle,Milton-- You scared me. I thought you were in Washington with Victor.
Gabrielle,"Well, if he really wanted me to stay, he would've come here himself, instead of siccing daddy on me."
Gabrielle,"Oh, great. Now I have to break up with him all over again."
Gabrielle,And you flew all the way here to twist my arm?
Gabrielle,"Milton, there is no amount of money that is-- wow!"
Gabrielle,Hold on. This check is dated for next year.
Gabrielle,And isn't there an election around that time?
Gabrielle,"And you're going to make sure he goes straight to the top, aren't you?"
Gabrielle,Can't say hello to a girl?
Gabrielle,"Oh, uh, yeah, about that--what if we make it 13? Okay, no, just go with me on this. What I'm about to propose will give us total financial freedom and-- help a conniving billionaire's dream come true."
Gabrielle,"Milton Lang doesn't want me to leave Victor until after he runs for governor. Once the election's over, ka-ching!"
Gabrielle,"I don't have to sleep with him, just stay with him for political reasons. It's basically a modeling fee for a 13-month photo op."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, you're not working right now, and you know we'll never be happy if we're broke. We need this."
Gabrielle,Which he did.
Gabrielle,"How much is ""a little""?"
Gabrielle,You embezzled $10 million?
Gabrielle,"Mm. Oh, wait, wait, wait. If this is Tanaka money, then you had it when we were married?"
Gabrielle,Which also means you had it when we got divorced.
Gabrielle,"Carlos, we were married. I was entitled to half of everything you embezzled."
Gabrielle,"Well, it matters that you lied to me. I can't trust you."
Gabrielle,"If I can't trust you, I don't think I can be with you."
Gabrielle,"No, I'm serious. After everything I have been through? No! No, get out!"
Gabrielle,"Oh, so you want me to sleep with you and take your money. Gee, if that were a job, what would they call it?"
Gabrielle,"Susan, hey, it's me. Um, sorry to leave this message on your machine, but can you tell the other girls I'm, uh, going to be by myself for a while? I-- Just--going through some stuff and need to think. Um-- oh, god, that's my car ready to take me to the airport, so I'll tell you everything when I get back. Okay? Love you. Bye."
Gabrielle,"This is nice. I didn't order a stretch, but I'll take it. Victor."
Gabrielle,"Well, I'm-- sort of leaving you."
Gabrielle,"Victor, it's not that simple. We have major problems, and you never have time to talk about them, let alone fix 'em."
Gabrielle,"Victor, I know you're only doing this because a divorce would hurt your run for governor."
Gabrielle,You mean that?
Gabrielle,"For the last time, Carlos, stop calling me."
Gabrielle,And I told you it's over.
Gabrielle,I don't know. I'm taking it one day at a time. But what I can say about Victor is he doesn't lie to me about how much money he's got.
Gabrielle,"Oh, that's great. Yeah, well, I-I gotta go, Bree."
Gabrielle,It's Bree.
Gabrielle,That's amazing. Where should we go?
Gabrielle,Oh!
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god, Victor. A month in Rio sounds like heaven, doesn't it?"
Gabrielle,That's so romantic. I love that.
Gabrielle,The girls are gonna be so jealous.
Gabrielle,You're so blessed. Makes me wanna have another one myself.
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god!"
Gabrielle,I thought you kept your boat at the yacht club.
Gabrielle,Where's the crew?
Gabrielle,What? Who's gonna bring us umbrella drinks and salute us when we walk by?
Gabrielle,So you're gonna drive this thing by yourself?
Gabrielle,"Oh, that's right--Those two boring hours I'll never get back."
Gabrielle,"For god sakes, Carlos, am I gonna have to change this number?"
Gabrielle,Knows what?
Gabrielle,"No, that's impossible. He hasn't said a word. In fact, I've never seen him so sweet and attentive."
Gabrielle,"Well, if he's so mad at me, why would he take me on a boat trip?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, crap."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I-I was just talking to-- Bree."
Gabrielle,"No, I'm good."
Gabrielle,"Uh, actually, I'm really cold. Maybe we should bail and do this another day. You know, when it's warmer."
Gabrielle,"Oh, okay, well, just in case, we should run back to shore so I can grab a jacket."
Gabrielle,I'm not?
Gabrielle,"Okay. I am so sorry. But in my defense, you were always gone, and you knew how needy I was when you married me."
Gabrielle,"Well, it'd be easier to talk if we were back on shore. What are you doing?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, Carlos, thank god you're here."
Gabrielle,"Well, I-I clubbed him and knocked him overboard."
Gabrielle,He was going to kill me! He had a gun.
Gabrielle,"No, he's mad, but he wasn't dead."
Gabrielle,"It's in there. Well, maybe he wanted it to muffle the gun."
Gabrielle,Ice pick? What are you doing?
Gabrielle,"And tell them what, I knocked my husband overboard because he was coming after me with a sweater? No, come on. We gotta go back out there."
Gabrielle,Here. Sit him here.
Gabrielle,"Well, I came back for you, didn't I?"
Gabrielle,"Well, I thought you were trying to kill me."
Gabrielle,"Aah! Victor! Oh, my god! Victor! Oh! Oh, my god!"
Gabrielle,"Oh, I'm getting pretty good at that."
Gabrielle,"What, are you crazy?!"
Gabrielle,Where'd he go?
Gabrielle,Victor! Victor!
Gabrielle,We looked for six hours. He's gone.
Gabrielle,"It was self-defense, right? I mean, he was trying to kill us."
Gabrielle,Maybe they won't.
Gabrielle,"No one but you knows I was with Victor. I'll say he went out alone. I told him I was leaving him, and he was depressed, suicidal even."
Gabrielle,Then maybe the boat needs to go back out--alone.
Gabrielle,Victor!
Gabrielle,"Carlos, why are you calling me? I told you we can't be seen together."
Gabrielle,"Oh, okay. And say what? ""Yes, officer, my lover and I knocked my husband overboard twice and left him for dead. Okay. Bye-bye."" I don't think so."
Gabrielle,Let them ask. No one knows we were on that boat. Let's just play dumb and ride this thing out.
Gabrielle,"Yes, I feel awful, but he threatened our lives. It was self-defense."
Gabrielle,"He took the Lord's name in vain. Look, we have a good plan. Let's just stick to it."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, if Victor had lived, he would've killed us. I'm thinking we already had our miracle."
Gabrielle,Of course.
Gabrielle,I guess two days ago. Why? What's wrong?
Gabrielle,"Oh, no. They did?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, my God. I hope this isn't--Last time I saw him, I told him I was leaving him."
Gabrielle,"Well, he took it pretty hard. Oh, you don't think he did anything stupid, do you?"
Gabrielle,You don't?
Gabrielle,"Well, that's weird. What--what do you think that means?"
Gabrielle,"Okay, this is no time for name-calling. A man is missing."
Gabrielle,Great.
Gabrielle,"Carlos, please."
Gabrielle,They don't know that someone else was us.
Gabrielle,"Okay, if we just stay lm and stick to the story--"
Gabrielle,Fine. I'll go.
Gabrielle,"Can we at least have a drink before we go? Calm our nerves? I mean, you can't talk to the cops the way you've been babbling to me."
Gabrielle,You okay with tequila?
Gabrielle,"Oh, I think you'll find this has a real kick."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I don't know, but if you're not feeling well, maybe we should put this off."
Gabrielle,Crap!
Gabrielle,"Detectives! Any, uh, news on my husband?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, okay. So ask away."
Gabrielle,Carlos? That's crazy. Where'd you hear that?
Gabrielle,"Oh. Well, you tell Edie Britt, just because Carlos dumped her doesn't mean she has to go around trashing my reputation, especially when she's the slut."
Gabrielle,"Boy, let me think. Uh--mm--No. No, I haven't."
Gabrielle,Huh?
Gabrielle,"Well, why wouldn't I? Just let me grab my purse."
Gabrielle,"Well, you can stop feeling guilty. Victor's alive, and we're screwed."
Gabrielle,How is he?
Gabrielle,"Of course! I-I bet he's pretty delirious. I mean, after his ordeal, I wouldn't be surprised if he's just babbling like a crazy person!"
Gabrielle,"Don't strain yourself, Victor. There's plenty of time to talk later. What's important now is that you rest. Just stay quiet and rest--quietly."
Gabrielle,"Really? I mean, what?"
Gabrielle,No. No.
Gabrielle,"Well, who cares? The important thing is that he's safe, and we're gonna nurse you back to health, and I think that would happen a lot faster if we all clear out. Thank you."
Gabrielle,Of course.
Gabrielle,But you're okay now. That's the important thing.
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,Victor!
Gabrielle,Carlos and I are back together.
Gabrielle,"Uh, you want the fondue set back? Fine. But don't act like it cost a bundle, 'Cause it clearly didn't."
Gabrielle,Oh. Right. It's nice.
Gabrielle,"You would think so, but no such luck. That vindictive have told Victor everything."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, and seeing how he's the rich mayor of a small town with various thugs and cops at his disposal, Carlos and I thought it would be safer if we got the heck out of dodge."
Gabrielle,Yeah. This afternoon.
Gabrielle,"Look, we'll be back-- someday. We just have to wait till this all blows over."
Gabrielle,"I know. This is-- a lousy way to say good-bye. And I'm sorry, but I don't have a choice. Do you guys have any idea how much I'm gonna miss you?"
Gabrielle,"Um, go. You guys go."
Gabrielle,They said Victor's getting out of the hospital--tomorrow.
Gabrielle,I can't deal with that right now. I'm packing.
Gabrielle,That's what I'm doing.
Gabrielle,"Carlos, if you are taking me somewhere where I don't need a boa, then I don't want to go. Fine. You could be a little bit more sensitive. I had to say good-bye to my friends today."
Gabrielle,"Like what? ""Rot in hell, you maggoty who*e""? That woman ruined our lives. If she had kept her mouth shut, we wouldn't be running away."
Gabrielle,"Who cares?! Thanks to her, I'm giving up my home, my friends, half my wardrobe. So do me a favor and never mention her name again unless it's followed by the phrase, ""that conniving skank."" Ya think you can do that?"
Gabrielle,"Edie, what have you got there?! Oh, crap!"
Gabrielle,"Edie, you thief! Open this door now!"
Gabrielle,Oh!
Gabrielle,"Oh, good. You're home."
Gabrielle,"Give me the damn folder, Edie!"
Gabrielle,It's worthless to you!
Gabrielle,Give me my money!
Gabrielle,"Oh, now you're moral all of a sudden? You didn't care where the money was coming from when you thought Carlos was gonna spend it on you!"
Gabrielle,Aah!
Gabrielle,Aah! Edie!
Gabrielle,No!
Gabrielle,"No, you!"
Gabrielle,"You! Aah! Oh! Oh! No! No! What did you do?! What did you do, Edie?!"
Gabrielle,You just threw my money in a tornado. I am not getting in there with you.
Gabrielle,Move your ass!
Gabrielle,Can I say something?
Gabrielle,"I'm sorry Carlos and I lied to you. I know we hurt you, and I wish it didn't happen the way it did, and I-I just want you to know that."
Gabrielle,"Well, I thought just in case we-"
Gabrielle,You really hate me?
Gabrielle,"Oh. Well, I'm still sorry, though."
Gabrielle,Aah! It's here.
Gabrielle,Milton. Hi. It's a nice turnout.
Gabrielle,"Oh, no, no. I'm a mess-- You know, on the inside, where the mascara can't run."
Gabrielle,Is it? I'd forgotten.
Gabrielle,No. I'm not thinking about money today. I'm burying my husband.
Gabrielle,"Well, I guess there's nothing disrespectful about a ballpark figure."
Gabrielle,"Okay, I made a mistake. I'm sorry, but Victor wasn't entirely blameless. He ignored me. He used me politically. Oh, yeah, and he tried to kill Carlos. So I think I'm entitled to whatever he had."
Gabrielle,Go? You can't kick me out of my husband's funeral.
Gabrielle,Go to hell.
Gabrielle,Hey. How you feeling?
Gabrielle,"Well, they should give you something for the pain."
Gabrielle,"Tragic. I found out everything Victor had is in Milton's name, and he told his father about us, so I'm not getting a penny."
Gabrielle,Yeah--
Gabrielle,"Um, remember that day, uh--when Al was going to drop off the account information?"
Gabrielle,"No, no, no. He did. It's just--remember how windy it was that day?"
Gabrielle,"I know, but Edie was trying to steal the papers from me, and we got into this fight, and then the tornado just took them away."
Gabrielle,Kinda.
Gabrielle,I'm texting someone.
Gabrielle,"Carlos, just calm down, okay? I'm sure al has an access code or a copy or some super nerd way to get back into the account, okay? I know we can fix this."
Gabrielle,"Okay. All right, you look very tired, so I'm just gonna go."
Gabrielle,"Hi. Um, I'm a friend of Al's, and I was wondering if I could see him."
Gabrielle,"Oh, Al."
Gabrielle,Excuse me. Are you Al's wife? I'm Gabrielle Lang.
Gabrielle,So I was shocked to hear about Al. I can't remember the last time I was so devastated.
Gabrielle,"That sucked, too. So what happened to Al?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, sweetie, don't. I want you to remember Al like I do-- at his desk, with a big smile on his face, surrounded by all his files. By the way, where are those files?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, I bet that was hard. So where'd you put 'em?"
Gabrielle,Which is--
Gabrielle,"Well, look at me, monopolizing the widow. You go mingle. I'm gonna get you a cracker."
Gabrielle,"Oh, crap."
Gabrielle,"Why do people have to die?! Why, god?! Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?"
Gabrielle,"So when I finally came clean, his wife told me she shredded anything that had to do with offshore accounts. She was protecting Al."
Gabrielle,"I'm so sorry, honey. I-I know this is bad, but we have each other. We'll get married again, and everything will be fine. For richer, for poorer, right?"
Gabrielle,"The whole nine yards. I'm gonna go down to the cafeteria and get us a couple of ginger ales to toast our future. Hey, doctor. He's looking better and better every day. Keep up the good work."
Gabrielle,So we just wanted you to know that we're here for you.
Gabrielle,"No, we thought that you just might need someone to talk to."
Gabrielle,"Oh, shoot. Did I miss Mass? Was it at 9:00?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, that's good to know. Uh, Father, can I talk to you?"
Gabrielle,Why?
Gabrielle,"Oh, that. Yeah, I was a little blue, but the good news is, I've bounced back."
Gabrielle,"Okay, this may come as a little shock to you--But guess who's getting married again? And I was thinking, maybe you could perform the ceremony. Is Tuesday good for you?"
Gabrielle,"Yeah, I know, but I'm no good single. Honestly, I don't know how you do it."
Gabrielle,"No. no, no, no, no. it's Carlos."
Gabrielle,"Oh, yeah. We bumped into each other a few months ago, and we just fell in love all over again."
Gabrielle,"Boy, you are just determined to make this awkward, aren't ya?"
Gabrielle,"Okay, look, in the eyes of the church, Carlos and I were never divorced. Technically, the affair was with Victor, and god smote him. So we're good. All right, yes, I've been a bad catholic. Enough with the guilt thing. are you gonna marry us or not?"
Gabrielle,"Absolutely. Oh, but if I don't, I promise you, I will change religions."
Gabrielle,"Hi, babe. I'm about to do something that's gonna make you very happy."
Gabrielle,Carlos! I have a priest with me.
Gabrielle,"No, no, no. I wanted it to be a surprise, but we're getting married! Father, hit it."
Gabrielle,"I don't know. Just after everything we've been through, there's nothing in our way now. We can finally be together. And I really need that. I need a happy ending, Carlos. So what do you say? Will you marry me?"
Gabrielle,Holy matrimony. Bring it on.
Gabrielle,"Okay, he's gone. What's up?"
Gabrielle,Okay.
Gabrielle,"Wow. That's-- a really long time. But for better or worse, right?"
Gabrielle,"Okay, padre. We're ready. Let's take it from the top."
Gabrielle,"Oh, Edie, it wasn't a competition, but, yeah, I guess I did."
Gabrielle,Hero? Why am I a hero?
Gabrielle,"It's not a big deal. Carlos is gonna get his sight back in three months. Four, tops."
Gabrielle,What are you talking about?
Gabrielle,I don't believe you.
Gabrielle,"No. no, no, no. This can't be true."
Gabrielle,"Okay, I'm calling Dr. Dunlap."
Gabrielle,"Yes, sweetheart. I'm in the kitchen making dinner."
Gabrielle,It's a new recipe for beef stew. I think you're gonna love it.
Gabrielle,Skip straight to dessert?
Gabrielle,"I'd say I'm one step ahead of you. I have already slipped into my pink lace teddy, and I'm wearing those whorey pumps that you love."
Gabrielle,"I'm right here, babe."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot that was open. Let's do it over here, on the table."
Gabrielle,"Can't. my legs are in the air. Just follow the sound of my voice. There you go. I'm over here, sweetie."
Gabrielle,"Ooh, I meant to move that. Hang on. Let me just pull my panties up so I can help you. Okay. Here. Let's go do it over here."
Gabrielle,"I'll tell you what's going on. ""In three months. Four, tops."""
Gabrielle,"""Uh-oh"" is right, you blind bastard!"
Gabrielle,"Oh, no, no. I think it was a fantastic plan. I mean, there's no way I ever would have figured out that I was married to a permanently blind guy!"
Gabrielle,Leave you? Do you really think I'm that shallow?
Gabrielle,"Wow. thanks for the vote of confidence. Y-yes, the truth would have freaked me out, but I would have come around. If you had just had a little faith in me, I could have proven to you that I was up for the challenge, but you robbed me of that chance."
Gabrielle,"Good. To avoid future confusion, I love you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you."
Gabrielle,"I know, but like I said, ""For better or for worse."""
Gabrielle,I'll work on it.
Gabrielle,Sure.
Gabrielle,"And in a surprise move, the Spurs announced a trade that will send perennial all-star to the--"
Gabrielle,I did.
Gabrielle,There you go. All gone.
Gabrielle,Of course not. I use a spoon.
Gabrielle,"I know you are, babe. And I know it's hard, and I'm gonna try to be more sensitive to your needs. Now hurry up and finish. I have to go to the store."
Gabrielle,"Oh, please, Carlos. I have a million errands to run, and I'd do it a lot faster without you. Plus I'm having lunch with the girls first."
Gabrielle,Just eat them. Carrots are good for your--just eat them.
Gabrielle,Sorry I'm late. Blind husband. You know the drill.
Gabrielle,It's a black-tie fund-raiser that Bree organizes every year.
Gabrielle,"Ooh, I say we nominate the woman who gives Edie her bikini wax."
Gabrielle,It'll start with hair pull and end with detectives taking our statements. Remember the pie thing?
Gabrielle,Lynette!
Gabrielle,I'm poor now. Remember? I have to mingle with the unwashed masses. What are you doing here?
Gabrielle,This place is huge! Would it kill them to have valet parking?
Gabrielle,"Look at all these handicapped spots. I mean, what a waste. Take that guy selling oranges, put him in a vest, stick him under an umbrella, and bam! You got valet parking. I don't know why poor people refuse to better themselves."
Gabrielle,"No, I think you have to have a wheelchair to get one of those."
Gabrielle,"Oh, hey there."
Gabrielle,"I know. Primo spot, isn't it? What? I have a thingy."
Gabrielle,I'm not. My husband is. He's blind.
Gabrielle,"And how is he gonna park a car if he can't see? Feeling pretty stupid now, aren't ya?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, don't play victim with me. I have to walk in heels all day long. You get to sit in a chair and roll."
Gabrielle,"You know, the quicker I can run my errands, the faster I can get home to my husband, who needs me, because that's the kind of person I am. W-what are you doing?"
Gabrielle,Like hell I am! Give me that.
Gabrielle,No! You started it. Hang it up!
Gabrielle,Hang it up!
Gabrielle,"Jeez. What, is there a telethon going on around here?"
Gabrielle,"No, no, no, no, no. Wait! Okay, you know what? This is getting ridiculous."
Gabrielle,"Let me go! Well, it's official. I'm going to hell."
Gabrielle,Come on. You've been cooped up in this house since you got home from the hospital. Let's go out and have some fun!
Gabrielle,"Carlos, I see handicapped people out and about all the time. In fact, I met two feisty men in wheelchairs yesterday at the mall. They were living their lives--so it's time for you to live yours. Come on. Come on."
Gabrielle,I'm just dropping off a few letters. You might as well just wait here.
Gabrielle,Just picking up some vitamins. I'll be quicker if I do it myself.
Gabrielle,I just have to drop off a gift to my manicurist. Why don't you listen to the radio?
Gabrielle,"Thank you. Sorry, babe. That took a little longer than I--Carlos? Carlos? Carlos? Carlos! Carlos! Oh, there you are."
Gabrielle,Where the hell have you been?
Gabrielle,I don't believe this. I was worried sick about you!
Gabrielle,"I'm sorry. I told you, I had errands to run first."
Gabrielle,What smell?
Gabrielle,"Move it along, pops. We're gonna be here a while."
Gabrielle,"To answer your earlier question, yes, I got a manicure. I'm sorry. Are we good?"
Gabrielle,That's a really mean way to put it.
Gabrielle,"Well, why shouldn't I get something out of this? You know, the blindness didn't just happen to you."
Gabrielle,"Oh, you bet I am! Every morning, the toothpaste has to be to the left of the sink, because if it's not, you can't find it, and I have to put it there. And--and sometimes-- I don't know--I'm driving, or I'm in line at the bank and I think, ""Is the toothpaste there?"" so then I have to run home and check because I don't want you reaching for the tube and not being able to find it. I just didn't think this was how it was all gonna turn out, Carlos. I didn't think that every day for the rest of my life, a part of me is always gonna think, ""Where's the toothpaste?"""
Gabrielle,"That's not the point, you blind idiot! I'm saying if all I get in exchange for this crappy situation is a nice parking spot for my $8 manicure, then I'm taking it!"
Gabrielle,"Here, honey. Let me."
Gabrielle,You're welcome.
Gabrielle,"If it were anyone but you, it wouldn't be worth it. You ready to go to the party?"
Gabrielle,You look very handsome.
Gabrielle,How do you know that?
Gabrielle,"You and Kathere did an amazing job. Boy, we didn't think you guys could work together."
Gabrielle,"Bree, what's up? I thought giving out this award was your thing."
Gabrielle,"If it for anyone but you, it wouldn't be worth it."
Gabrielle,"There you are! Oh, you must be Roxy! Aren't you the cutest thing! Oh! Okay, not too close. It's silk."
Gabrielle,"Ah, nice to meet you. Carlos told me how much he enjoyed taking classes with Roxy."
Gabrielle,"Well, I have got a million questions about this little lifesaver here."
Gabrielle,"Okay, hypothetical situation - Carlos and I are sitting on the couch. I'm doing my nails. he's whining for the remote. How do I get Roxy to fetch it for him?"
Gabrielle,"I get that, but surely she's trained to do other stuff, you know, like find his keys or turn off the radio or lick up his spills."
Gabrielle,Don't give me your blind sarcasm. I saw a collie on TV who could push a lawn mower. Do you have one of those?
Gabrielle,"Really? Well, for a dog who's supposed to help us, she sounds kind of limited. Sorry, but it's true."
Gabrielle,"Well, I'm sorry. I was on my hands and knees that day, scouring the bathroom floor because you refused to pee like a girl."
Gabrielle,"No, it's crystal clear. Carlos gets a new best friend, and I get to check the sofa for ticks. Yay for Gaby!"
Gabrielle,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! No more doggy treats. She's had enough."
Gabrielle,"Yeah? Well, when she learns how to make granite sparkle, she can have more."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, I said no--Fine. One treat. That's it. Those things are expensive, and until your disability kicks in, we have to tighten our belts."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, remember what my fingers look like? Just picture the middle one all by itself. Besides, you're the one who married me for my looks."
Gabrielle,"Do you have any idea how selfish you sound right now? Just because you're blind, the world should suffer?"
Gabrielle,"Carlos, I'm getting my hair done! End of discussion! What are you barking at? You got your damn treat. You know, if we really want to save money, you could cut down on those Cuban cigars."
Gabrielle,Why don't you get a job?
Gabrielle,Put flags on pencils and sell them at the airport. What do I care? Just get out of my kitchen--Whoa. What is this about?
Gabrielle,"Oh, so now I can't hit my own husband in my own house?"
Gabrielle,No way. That mutt is not sleeping in our bed!
Gabrielle,"No. no, it's not. I read the pamphlet Steve left. These dogs are not allowed on furniture."
Gabrielle,"Well, if you ever want to bond with my boobs again, you'll get her off!"
Gabrielle,"Carlos, no!"
Gabrielle,"You're right, baby. I'm sorry. Let me try it this way. You listen to me, you blind son of a bitch. If you don't get this mangy, 6- nippled, cujo wannabe off my satin sheets, you won't just need a dog to get around. You'll need a motorized wheelchair that you steer with your tongue."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, I mean it. Who's it gonna be - me or the dog?"
Gabrielle,Roxy--look what I've got. Come on. Come on.
Gabrielle,"Oh. Yes. Okay, let's go. Let's go, Roxy. Let's go, Roxy. Let's go. Let's go in the car."
Gabrielle,"Oh, Roxy, this way."
Gabrielle,"Hi. Uh, I'm bringing Roxy back."
Gabrielle,"Shame, isn't it? I mean, I personally adored the little angel, but she and Carlos just did not get along."
Gabrielle,"Well, sorry it didn't work out. I gotta run."
Gabrielle,"Oh, well, actually, we found one."
Gabrielle,"Well, that's it. It's not a dog. We got him a seeing-- eye-- monkey. He's amazing. Not only can he call 9-1-1, he can toast a bagel. Bye."
Gabrielle,"Oh, Carlos, I'm afraid I have some bad news."
Gabrielle,"Well, you know how you like it when I read you the box scores? When I went out to get the paper - only thinking of making you happy-"
Gabrielle,"She ran away. When I opened the door, she saw a squirrel, and she took off."
Gabrielle,Where do you think I've been? There's no sign of her anywhere.
Gabrielle,"How dare you. I have looked from one end of town to the other, and I'm telling you, she's nowhere to be found. But since you love her so much, I'm gonna keep looking."
Gabrielle,"I'm not sure. Why don't I go look? Huh. No. Oh, wow. It's the Scavo dog--way down in their yard. I guess it's true - lose one sense, all the others get heightened. Okay, you get that. I'm gonna go find your dog."
Gabrielle,"Come on, you stupid mutt."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, still no sign of Roxy. But don't worry. I'm on the case."
Gabrielle,He called you? Why didn't he ask me?
Gabrielle,"Don't judge me. You don't know this hound from hell. I raise my voice a teensy bit, and she barks, or I give Carlos a little smack, and she growls."
Gabrielle,"Thanks for the biscuits, Edie."
Gabrielle,We're fine. This is who we are. This is our relationship.
Gabrielle,Not that much. Just his eyes.
Gabrielle,"Are you done with your armchair analysis, 3- divorce Annie?"
Gabrielle,"Yeah, come on in. So because of my husband's disability, our financial situation has changed, and we have this big house."
Gabrielle,"Well, you know--anyhow, uh, you have a great credit score."
Gabrielle,What was what?
Gabrielle,"I'm sorry, Ellie. There's been some tension between my husband and me. See, the truth is, we could've had the room rented by now if my husband wasn't so paranoid."
Gabrielle,You're as blind as a fruit bat. How would you know if he's a bodybuilder?
Gabrielle,That wasn't his biceps. Why do you think he rushed out of here?
Gabrielle,"You're right, Ellie. My husband was totally inappropriate. So a class? Are you a teacher?"
Gabrielle,"No, it's gutsy. Well, we like you, Ellie, and if you have first and last months' rent, we'd like you even more."
Gabrielle,"Oh, no, I love cash. Cash and I go way back. So are you okay with this, or do you need to grope her, too?"
Gabrielle,"Honey, I can't find my nail file. Have you seen it?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, right. I keep forgetting you're useless. I'm gonna see if Ellie has one."
Gabrielle,"Hey, Ellie, you got a sec?"
Gabrielle,"Hey, uh--oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were--entertaining. Hi, I'm Gaby Solis."
Gabrielle,"Oh, you know what? It can wait. I'll see you in the morning."
Gabrielle,"Okay, that was weird."
Gabrielle,"Earlier tonight, I saw a guy coming out of Ellie's room, so I assumed it was her boyfriend, but just now I caught her in there with another guy."
Gabrielle,"That was for the ""useless"" comment, wasn't it?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, it sounds like he's leaving. I hope it's not 'cause of me. Maybe I should go apologize."
Gabrielle,"Okay, there may be two tramps in this house, but only one of 'em is getting paid."
Gabrielle,"There have been men coming out of her room at all hours of the night, and I saw her counting a wad of cash. So long story short, I need your help to get that hooker out of my house."
Gabrielle,"Well, I've got no solid evidence, and she's got a lease. So, Bob, I was hoping you could ""solicit"" her services. That way I'll have proof."
Gabrielle,"Exactly. You people are theatrical, and I need someone I can count on to give a decent performance."
Gabrielle,"Well, no offense. I just think Bob has a better shot at pulling it off. He's a little more--"
Gabrielle,"Well, I really don't care who does it. Just get it done. And--don't wear that."
Gabrielle,Target in place. We're a go.
Gabrielle,What is he wearing? He looks like the lost member of Wham!
Gabrielle,"Must he put his hand on his hip like that? Butch up, for god sakes!"
Gabrielle,"Oh, crap! Abort! Abort!"
Gabrielle,"Ellie, what are you doing?"
Gabrielle,"Uh, he did the same thing to me. Perv!"
Gabrielle,Here's the thing. I thought you were a hooker. So I had Lee proposition you so I could catch you in the act. But guess what? You passed the test. Everybody inside for margaritas.
Gabrielle,"Ellie, wait. I made a mistake. Can we please talk about this?"
Gabrielle,Look at it from my point of view. You're an attractive woman. Guys are coming and going. I saw you take money from one of 'em. What am I supposed to think?
Gabrielle,You do what?
Gabrielle,You've been running a tattoo parlor out of my house?
Gabrielle,"Okay, Ellie, wait. You don't have to go."
Gabrielle,"Well, I suppose I could look the other way for a few months. It's the least I could do for thinking you're a whore. Forgive me?"
Gabrielle,"We like you. If you have first and last months' rent, we'd like you even more."
Gabrielle,Don't. we're waiting for Ellie. She's finishing up with a customer.
Gabrielle,"You know, I've been hitting you a lot less lately, and I don't feel like I'm getting enough credit for that."
Gabrielle,"No, seriously. We're getting along better. Have you noticed that?"
Gabrielle,"Me, too. it's impossible to argue with her in the house. She makes us laugh. She takes you off my hands every once in a while."
Gabrielle,She's amazing. I don't know where she gets all her energy.
Gabrielle,"Ellie, it's getting cold!"
Gabrielle,"Oh, hey, guys! You were up there a while. Can I see it?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, on his-- got it. Does it hurt?"
Gabrielle,You guys going for another walk?
Gabrielle,You're spoiling him.
Gabrielle,"what the hell? Ellie, your door is locked! Ellie! Oh, shut up already."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, I was a fashion model in the '90s. I know cocaine."
Gabrielle,What are you doing?
Gabrielle,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Shouldn't we hear Ellie's side of the story first?"
Gabrielle,"Okay, look, maybe I was wrong. Maybe it was flour. Maybe she's a pastry chef."
Gabrielle,"All right, look, I know we have to do something, but this woman's our friend."
Gabrielle,"So that's when I saw all those bricks of cocaine under her bed. I mean, I-I mean, I think it was cocaine, and I think they're called bricks. I'm just a simple housewife. I don't know what I'm saying."
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god!"
Gabrielle,It's one of Ellie's customers.
Gabrielle,"Okay, look, I'm all for doing my civic duty, but this woman-- she's-- sort of a-- friend. And now you're asking us to trick her? I'm not sure we're comfortable with this."
Gabrielle,And Edie threatened to use that to--
Gabrielle,I can. She went after Carlos and Mike and Karl. The only person she hasn't gone after is Tom.
Gabrielle,You were only doing it because you're the devil.
Gabrielle,And we're gonna make sure every woman in a 5-mile radius knows the kind of crap you pulled.
Gabrielle,Ellie? Brunch is almost ready! This is gonna be so hard.
Gabrielle,I'll try.
Gabrielle,What's this?
Gabrielle,Oh.
Gabrielle,"Carlos, I was a fashion model in the '90s. I know cocaine."
Gabrielle,"Oh, no, thanks. I gotta make sure my handyman gets his wiring done. He screwed it up the last time. You realize we could've had a fire?"
Gabrielle,And--she's gone.
Gabrielle,"Well, isn't her room enough?"
Gabrielle,"Well, how long is that gonna take?"
Gabrielle,"Okay, first of all, you're a pig. Second of all, don't say things like that. Ellie's my friend."
Gabrielle,"Hey! You don't even know her. Okay, yes, she's made some bad choices, but deep down, she's a good person."
Gabrielle,"Okay, when this thing is over, let's not do the whole Christmas card thing."
Gabrielle,"No, he's at Braille school."
Gabrielle,"Oh, Ellie! Hey!"
Gabrielle,We weren't expecting you back so soon.
Gabrielle,"Well, we needed some privacy. See, Roy and I are lovers."
Gabrielle,"I know, it's crazy. You wouldn't believe the passion. I mean, I was powerless to resist."
Gabrielle,"Okay, okay. We're going."
Gabrielle,That's for using your tongue.
Gabrielle,Hey! Lunch is almost ready. I'm making your favorite. I take it you're still mad at me.
Gabrielle,"Well, I couldn't risk doing it in my room. Ever since Carlos went blind, he's developed a strong sense of smell. I don't know if you happened to catch a whiff of Roy, but that is one telltale odor."
Gabrielle,"Uh, you know, he's a handyman. He knows how to--get in there--and make stuff work."
Gabrielle,"Of course I do. Carlos Solis is the love of my life. But sometimes you get bored, and a big, greasy, disgusting handyman really hits the spot."
Gabrielle,He's so precious.
Gabrielle,Wow. Interesting.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, think about your son. People live up to the names they're given. If my parents hadn't named me ""Gabrielle"", who knows if I'd be this pretty?"
Gabrielle,"So sarcastic, but what would you expect from a ""Lynette""? What? If your name was ""Francesca"", you wouldn't have time for sarcasm. You'd be too busy having sex on a Vespa."
Gabrielle,"Hey, sweetie."
Gabrielle,Excuse me?
Gabrielle,"That little snitch. I can't believe she did that! Well, thanks for letting me know."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, the second that bitch gets home, I'm gonna let her have it. Boy, you trust someone, and they just betray you. It sucks, you know?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, you moron! There was no affair! That was the cop. Ellie caught us putting the bug in her room. That was just an excuse we used as a cover."
Gabrielle,"I got news for you, Carlos. You're blind. You don't have a choice anymore. You have to believe what I tell you. Just like when I hand you the deodorant, you have to believe it's not oven cleaner. I know it's not fair. I know it gives me absolute power, but tough. You're screwed. Deal with it! Are we good?"
Gabrielle,"Thank you. Now please, I just lost a friend. Stop being so insensitive."
Gabrielle,"About how you snitched on me to Carlos? No, thanks. I'm all caught up on that."
Gabrielle,Let me guess. This story ends with you throwing your boyfriend's varsity jacket in the lake?
Gabrielle,Oh.
Gabrielle,"Oh, Ellie, I'm so sorry. I had no idea."
Gabrielle,Yes?
Gabrielle,Okay. Bye.
Gabrielle,The cops are coming. Go.
Gabrielle,It's a sting. Go out the back now.
Gabrielle,"No way, Bree. I don't want Katherine in our games. She bums me out."
Gabrielle,"Name one, and keep in mind that ""aloof"" and ""unfun"" have already been taken."
Gabrielle,"Okay, so here's the deal. Bree needs all of these wedding favors wrapped by tomorrow, and she's really counting on me, so-- I'm gonna need you to hurry."
Gabrielle,"Mm--well, it would be easier if I knew what you knew."
Gabrielle,"Okay, when you yell at me, I get upset. And you know what I do when I get upset? I shop. So if we do end up homeless, guess whose fault it'll be."
Gabrielle,Hello?
Gabrielle,"Ellie, you can't call me! The cops are all over my ass because they think I helped you escape."
Gabrielle,"Oh! Ellie, I don't know. What is it?"
Gabrielle,"Teddy bear? What is that, code for ""a pound of blow""?"
Gabrielle,Crap. Ya had to play the daddy card.
Gabrielle,Hmm.
Gabrielle,"Over here, Carlos."
Gabrielle,"I just found $118,000 in Ellie's teddy bear."
Gabrielle,Savings? Nobody does that anymore.
Gabrielle,"Oh, Carlos, we're never gonna have kids. Shoes are my kids. Let me be the mother I was meant to be."
Gabrielle,Hello?
Gabrielle,"Oh. Right. The bear. Well-- I looked all over and just couldn't find it. I guess the cops took it. I'm really sorry, Ellie. I know it was a gift from your dad. It just breaks my heart."
Gabrielle,Money? What money?
Gabrielle,What's wrong with my voice?
Gabrielle,How about we split it 50-50?
Gabrielle,"Okay, we really need to get caller I.D."
Gabrielle,"Yes, officer. I see you. Thank you for coming. Now remember, Ellie's dangerous. So if she shows up, feel free to use excessive force."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, are you almost ready? Carlos? Did you hear me?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, honey, can you carry the house keys? They don't fit in my purse."
Gabrielle,What?!
Gabrielle,Wait! She's gonna steal our money!
Gabrielle,"Well ,not as dangerous as poverty!"
Gabrielle,"Aah! Carlos! Carlos, don't just stand there! Go get help!"
Gabrielle,That's the closet!
Gabrielle,Police! Police! Get in here now!
Gabrielle,Excuse me. Susan!
Gabrielle,What's going on?
Gabrielle,She was always telling us how terrified she was.
Gabrielle,"Okay, my friends are gone. I'm ready to fix you dinner. What the hell are you doing?!"
Gabrielle,Look at this mess! You are lucky I got in here before you touched my dresses!
Gabrielle,My Vera Wang?!
Gabrielle,"Juanita, this dress is awfully tight. I don't think you can get into it."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I think we're gonna need the next size up."
Gabrielle,She's only 4 1/2.
Gabrielle,"Look, my daughter was invited to a princess party, so I can't let her be the only girl there without a princess dress."
Gabrielle,"Juanita, take off the dress! We're going."
Gabrielle,"My daughter does not have a weight problem. She has a little baby fat, that's all. In fact, the only problem she has is this store being completely unprepared for a perfectly average 4-year-old girl. Just ring it up."
Gabrielle,"""We""?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, you know what? We should have a dinner or something."
Gabrielle,Thank you.
Gabrielle,I had two children.
Gabrielle,Really? Are you okay?
Gabrielle,"Carlos, what's with all the cheese?"
Gabrielle,"Well, next time, give her a carrot and put her on a roller coaster. Have you tried to lift her lately?"
Gabrielle,"Ha! We can only hope, with your DNA running through her veins."
Gabrielle,"Oh, don't make me pull out the Solis family photo Album. It's like a bunch of sea lions posing on a rock."
Gabrielle,"All I'm saying is that our daughter has a weight problem, and the sooner we admit it, the better. Carlos: She's only 4. But, you know, you want her to develop a weight problem? Go ahead. Nag, criticize, make her feel self-conscious. See what happens."
Gabrielle,Juanita!
Gabrielle,"I know, but so much? You could've gone back for a second piece."
Gabrielle,"Honey, I know you wanna go home and watch your cartoons, but you had a lot of cake, so I was thinking I'd take you to the park. That way, you could run around and get some nice, fun exercise."
Gabrielle,You sure? Running around in the sun and fresh air would make you feel good.
Gabrielle,Okay. Why don't you go throw that in the trash? And I'm gonna get the car started.
Gabrielle,"Hey, Juanita. You wanna play a new game on the way home? Winner gets a new doll."
Gabrielle,"Well, come on, then!"
Gabrielle,"It's a new game I invented, and you're winning 1 to nothing!"
Gabrielle,"18 to zero! 2 more points, and you'll break the record."
Gabrielle,"Really? Well, I thought running through that guy's sprinkler would've refreshed you. Now come on!"
Gabrielle,"Looks like mommy's gonna score her first 2 points. Come on, Juanita. Show mommy what a winner you are. Juanita! What are you doing?! Juanita, stop! Juanita! Juanita!"
Gabrielle,"Carlos, our daughter sucked down half a sheet cake, and afterwards, no one could find the candles. Wake up! We have got a problem!"
Gabrielle,"Hey, I'm protecting her. She doesn't know the truth yet. Women only have five seconds to be young and beautiful, and then it's gone. And then before you know it, we're old and fat and married and wondering where our beauty went."
Gabrielle,"No, Carlos. I mean--Sometimes I'm glad you can't see me. Five years and two kids and no time for facials or the gym. It just-- takes a toll. And when Edie same the other day, it was like she didn't even recognize me."
Gabrielle,"Edie, this is not a ""we're sorry"" party. This is a ""we forgive you"" party."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, we got invited to Michelle Downing's party! I'm gonna have to buy something nice to--aah!"
Gabrielle,I can see that. I can see a lot of things--things that can never be unseen.
Gabrielle,Carlos? Kitchen. Now.
Gabrielle,"He's got a bum hip. He's also missing a testicle. Carlos, how much more of this am I supposed to take?"
Gabrielle,No! That's only part of the problem. Have you checked our bank balance lately?
Gabrielle,Why not? You'd be massaging rich people. They tip better and they tend to flake less.
Gabrielle,"Carlos, I don't need to spend lots of time with you. And frankly, the kids are on the fence."
Gabrielle,"Bottom line, I miss our life. I miss shopping. All I have to look forward to is the occasional invitation to a fancy party. And I can't even afford a dress to go to it. Carlos, please, I am begging you."
Gabrielle,Thank you.
Gabrielle,Bree! What's up?
Gabrielle,"I heard. I can't wait. Ooh, I was gonna ask you should I wear the navy blue Chanel or the red sleeveless dress?"
Gabrielle,What? She's disinviting me?
Gabrielle,"She called us ""staff""?"
Gabrielle,"No! It's not just one party! It's the kickoff to the whole social season. If people see we're off Michelle's list, then we'll be off everyone's. And then it's gonna be the start of our slow slide from gowns and galas to flip-flops and keggers! Okay, if Carlos working at the club is the problem, then tell her he just quit."
Gabrielle,What's happened to my life? We used to have help. Now we are the help!
Gabrielle,"Oh, don't be silly, Carlos. We're still on everyone's list."
Gabrielle,"Oh, it's just the caterers putting glasses and silverware on the tables. They make some racket, huh? But the decorations are stunning. Especially that waterfall effect."
Gabrielle,"Bree! Shouldn't you be in the kitchen? Don't move, honey. The press is taking your photo."
Gabrielle,"I got it all figured out. We duck inside, make sure we're seen by all the right people--except Mrs. Downing--and then after about 20 minutes, we cut out."
Gabrielle,"Oh, they are fun. Mm-hmm. But I enjoy my intimate lunches with Michelle even more. We have intimate lunches. We're friends."
Gabrielle,Really? We'd love to.
Gabrielle,"Well, it's the caterer! Everything is fabulous. But would you be a dear and get me some more wine?"
Gabrielle,"The Bowmans. I found out Mrs. Bowman is home with the flu. Score! Oh, will you unclench? It'll be fine."
Gabrielle,"That was Mr. Bowman, wasn't it?"
Gabrielle,What kind of man leaves his sick wife at home to go party with mommy?!
Gabrielle,Right.
Gabrielle,"That was the Matre D', wasn't it?"
Gabrielle,Which we're not on.
Gabrielle,Right.
Gabrielle,That's Mrs. Downing. How am I gonna fix this?
Gabrielle,Thank you. Mm-hmm.
Gabrielle,Poor blind bastard. I'll meet him outside.
Gabrielle,What? I was just trying to salvage what's left of our social life. Now just let it go and start thinking about where we're gonna move.
Gabrielle,You wanna know what's humiliating? Waking up one day and finding out you're invisible. Now it's official. I've lost everything.
Gabrielle,"First our money, then my figure, now the last shreds of our social Standing."
Gabrielle,"What do you mean, they're unhappy? They're rich! They have jewels and cooks. They use ""winter"" as a verb."
Gabrielle,Are you serious?
Gabrielle,"Now it's official. I've lost everything. First our money, then my figure, now the last shreds of our social standing."
Gabrielle,"Oh, come on. It's already priced way below blue book, not to mention it's mint."
Gabrielle,"Okay, this car goes zero to 60 in 5 seconds. By the time someone says, ""wow, a ding,"" You're in the next county."
Gabrielle,"What? No! No, no deal! The nondriving blind guy does not speak for me."
Gabrielle,"God, isn't there any way we can keep it? I mean, this car's the last thing I have that tells the world, ""I'm better than you."""
Gabrielle,Here. Take good care of her.
Gabrielle,"Okay, that one hurt."
Gabrielle,Be glad you're blind.
Gabrielle,"Okay, just let me handle this."
Gabrielle,"I don't know, Andrew. I mean--we like it. We don't love it."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, about that price--You're gonna have to drop it. I mean, look at all these dents."
Gabrielle,"Well, I'll tell you what. Since your mom and I are dear friends, I'll take it off your hands if you knock off $ 300."
Gabrielle,"Andrew! Unless you lower this price, we're walking--right now."
Gabrielle,I mean it. This is it.
Gabrielle,"Fine. Okay, fine. Knock off $200, and we'll give you cash."
Gabrielle,$100.00
Gabrielle,Wh--Will you at least have it washed?
Gabrielle,Damn you.
Gabrielle,"Guys, hey, knock it off back there. Oh, god. What now?"
Gabrielle,You sold me a lemon. That's what's up.
Gabrielle,"Your car! I took it to a mechanic, who told me the radiator's shot."
Gabrielle,What jug?
Gabrielle,"Okay, I-I can't drive around avoiding gravity and the sun."
Gabrielle,"Or I could get the radiator fixed, which is gonna cost $300, which you are paying for."
Gabrielle,"Okay, you know what? That's it. I wanna talk to your mother."
Gabrielle,"Damn it, Andrew. You tell Bree to call me by the end of the day."
Gabrielle,Really?
Gabrielle,Wow. I'm sorry. I'll talk to her.
Gabrielle,And don't worry. No one will hear about this from me.
Gabrielle,That M.J.'s getting beat up by a little girl.
Gabrielle,Are you suggesting that Juanita is fat for her age?
Gabrielle,"Yeah? Well, let's face it. M.J. could get beaten up by a kitten."
Gabrielle,Yeah? Or maybe you could teach your son to grow a pair!
Gabrielle,"Susan, I saw that! Kids, get inside!"
Gabrielle,Really? 'cause it looked like you body-slammed my daughter.
Gabrielle,"That's your defense? You were only assaulting her ""a little""?"
Gabrielle,"Well, I'm sorry. I was too busy trying to explain to her why M.J. Doesn't wear a dress like All the other little girls."
Gabrielle,I did.
Gabrielle,"You can dye that hair all you want, but the gray's just gonna keep coming."
Gabrielle,You attacked my child and then me. Why should I even listen to you?
Gabrielle,Come on in.
Gabrielle,"Well, what do you expect?"
Gabrielle,But that's okay. Mike's a great dad.
Gabrielle,"Susan, it's not your fault."
Gabrielle,"Well, if it's any consolation, Carlos is a hands-on, full-time dad, and I still feel like I'm not getting the job done, like--I'm not preparing them enough."
Gabrielle,"For how hard life is. I mean, I have to admit, when you told me Juanita was bullying M.J., my first thought was, thank god! Let her do the pushing, just as long as she's not a victim."
Gabrielle,"I used to be. Look at my life, Susan. I--I've been beaten down."
Gabrielle,Today doesn't count. Today I was mad.
Gabrielle,Maybe you're right.
Gabrielle,To Susan Mayer--Good mom.
Gabrielle,So?! There's waffles in the freezer! And get mommy some ice!
Gabrielle,I want my 300 bucks.
Gabrielle,"That's it? No compassion? No, ""Hey, let's split the bill and call it even""?"
Gabrielle,True. Now here's a valuable lesson for you.
Gabrielle,"Give me my money, or next time we're trading paint."
Gabrielle,"I am tired of being a victim, Andrew. And trust me, that is no bluff."
Gabrielle,"Luckily, I'm insured. Oh, wait. Our policy lapsed. Hope you've got good coverage."
Gabrielle,I prefer cash.
Gabrielle,"Look at you, right on the cover!"
Gabrielle,"No, it's horrible! She's gonna become this famous author and have no time at all for us."
Gabrielle,You have a marketing plan. You wanna see my marketing plan?
Gabrielle,"Honey, she's only been here 20 minutes. We invited her over to play, so go play."
Gabrielle,"Honey, we want Bethany to be our friend, so if she wants to spin, just suck it up and spin."
Gabrielle,That little weirdo is the key to you and I having more sex.
Gabrielle,Bethany's mom hosts a weekly playdate. I'm trying to get Juanita an invitation.
Gabrielle,"Carlos, the only time you and I have to ourselves is late at night, but by that time, we're too exhausted. And now that we have Celia in afternoon preschool, all we have to do is unload Juanita, and then we can get back to doing the nasty."
Gabrielle,"Wake up! Playdates were invented by mothers for this exact purpose. Shopping, sex, drinking in the afternoon--playdates make all these things possible."
Gabrielle,Bethany's mom will take Juanita once a week for two whole hours. That is sex and a nap.
Gabrielle,"Okay, I dropped off Celia at preschool, and Juanita's at her playdate. Drop trou."
Gabrielle,"Can I ask why? I mean, you can't see it."
Gabrielle,"Aw. What's it like, Carlos?"
Gabrielle,"Sex as a blind man. I mean, you used to be so visual. Is it still as good?"
Gabrielle,Really? You're so lucky.
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god, you were right. Blind sex is incredible."
Gabrielle,"No, I think we're done."
Gabrielle,Honey! What are you doing home? I thought you were at Bethany's.
Gabrielle,"Well, how long have you been standing there?"
Gabrielle,We were wrestling. Wrestling.
Gabrielle,"No! No, that wasn't real. Sometimes I fake it when I wrestle with daddy."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, Carlos, stop that. Okay, go to your room, and I'm gonna bring you something for your tummy. I think she bought it."
Gabrielle,Relax. I told her I was fine.
Gabrielle,"What, that sometimes mommy rides daddy like a mechanical bull to get jewelry? She's 5. She's too young to understand either half of that."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, if she was standing there any longer than five minutes, there was nothing natural about what she saw."
Gabrielle,"Hi, Bethany. I'm here to pick up Juanita. Is she around?"
Gabrielle,Excuse me?
Gabrielle,"So apparently, after we had our little chat with Juanita, she went straight to Bethany and passed on the facts of life in excruciating detail."
Gabrielle,"She didn't wanna hear it not with Bethany running around the house, screaming ""intercourse!"" at the top of her lungs."
Gabrielle,"Oh, yeah. Way out."
Gabrielle,"I'm not going back, Carlos. I can't. If Juanita doesn't get her playdate, you're not getting yours."
Gabrielle,Juanita! Stop talking to your sister!
Gabrielle,It just seemed like the right thing to do at the time.
Gabrielle,So--do you think there's any chance Juanita could rejoin your playdate?
Gabrielle,Not if she wants to see her favorite dolly Alive.
Gabrielle,"Oh, we totally agree. Kids are forced to grow up way too fast these days."
Gabrielle,So--next playdate's Monday at 1:00?
Gabrielle,"Yeah, and the water was as flat as the ad campaign. Your Martini was as dry as the ad campaign. Let it go."
Gabrielle,"Hey, beautiful!"
Gabrielle,Her place makes the best pizza in town.
Gabrielle,"Oh, wait! No, honey. Why don't you wait till after the ceremony?"
Gabrielle,"Get your hands off me, you selfish son of a bitch!"
Gabrielle,Damn.
Gabrielle,"Uh, well, mommy has a friend who visits her every month, and she's late, and that's bad."
Gabrielle,Because she's the one who assures me that you won't get a baby brother or sister.
Gabrielle,"I don't care. Oh, sorry. It's just--mommy really misses her friend, and mommy's gonna be really sad if her friend doesn't show up soon. Now go downstairs and play. Mommy has some praying to do."
Gabrielle,I don't care. You told me this couldn't happen. You said it was impossible!
Gabrielle,This isn't a miracle. This is a disaster. My husband's blind. Neither one of us have jobs. My husband's blind.
Gabrielle,"Well, I hope to god you're right. And what does this number mean anyway?"
Gabrielle,"I am so sick of everybody looking at the glass half-full. The glass is empty, people, and so is our bank account."
Gabrielle,"What are you gonna do, take up piano and get a contract with Motown?"
Gabrielle,"Well, I guess that's not the worst idea you've ever had. But it's not just about the money, Carlos. It's-- Oh, after my miscarriage, I gave up on this dream. I just figured god decided I couldn't possibly be a good mom, so he didn't make it happen."
Gabrielle,"Well, I wish he'd stop doing that. Nobody likes a fickle god."
Gabrielle,Great. so do I have anemia? Is that why I've been so tired?
Gabrielle,I'm pregnant!
Gabrielle,"Yeah, we're up to two miracles, and if you come back from the dead after I kill you, it'll be three."
Gabrielle,"Oh, Gaby, why do I need to wear a condom? There's no way lightning's gonna strike twice."
Gabrielle,"Put the baby down, Carlos."
Gabrielle,"Do it. I need to hit something, and it needs to be you."
Gabrielle,"Oh, cram it, you fertile freak. You're getting a vasectomy."
Gabrielle,I got news for you. We just converted to Judaism. Problem solved. Mazel tov!
Gabrielle,"I am done fighting off your bionic sperm. You're getting snipped, and that's final."
Gabrielle,Got a lot on my mind. I think I'm pregnant.
Gabrielle,I know. It's crazy. You had a vasectomy. It's impossible.
Gabrielle,"My period's late, and that never happens to me. I'm like a Swiss clock."
Gabrielle,Okay. But I'm gonna talk to Bob.
Gabrielle,Because he and Lee are here. Bob's an attorney. I'm gonna get him to sue the quack who obviously botched your vasectomy.
Gabrielle,"Well, I'm gonna find out."
Gabrielle,"Oh, don't worry. He's a professional. He'll keep it confidential."
Gabrielle,Why the hell not?
Gabrielle,"Katherine, great dress. You're gonna turn some heads with that one. I hope you're enjoying this party, Carlos, because you're not gonna live to see another one."
Gabrielle,You know what's gonna tear me apart? Another 10-pound baby shooting out my hoo-ha.
Gabrielle,"Get your hands off me, you selfish son of a bitch."
Gabrielle,"Whoo-hoo! Halle-damn-lujah, I got my period! Oh, was she surprised?"
Gabrielle,I don't know. But you would have if I hadn't started my period. How could you have done this?
Gabrielle,We can't handle another kid. We're living hand to mouth as it is.
Gabrielle,Of course I can't. It's just--How could you have lied to me?
Gabrielle,"Or--we use birth control, and I'm talking double-bagging, At least until we both decide it's a good idea."
Gabrielle,"And until we get a box of condoms in that house, that's all you're gettin'."
Gabrielle,"I'm about to go get groceries. Where are your tips? Oh, my god! How did you get so much?"
Gabrielle,"Carlos, what are you doing home?"
Gabrielle,"Oh! You are the Mrs. Hildebrand. Well, you're Carlos' favorite client. Well, mine, anyway. I bought this top with that crazy tip you gave him."
Gabrielle,"Oh, that's Carlos for you. Mr. Magic hands. He hits the OL' sweet spot every time."
Gabrielle,What proposal?
Gabrielle,Two whole months?
Gabrielle,"$50,000?"
Gabrielle,"Well, pip-pip and arrivederci!"
Gabrielle,"Well, uh, what's to discuss? For that kind of money, you can lock him in a cage and feed him peanuts."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, don't even think about saying no to this!"
Gabrielle,"Oh, don't worry about Mr. Banks. I'll take care of him."
Gabrielle,"And so what if he fires you? Once Virginia tells all of her rich lady friends about what you did for her, they'll be lining up around the block."
Gabrielle,"Hey, Clay. Is Mr. Banks around?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, I need to sweet-talk him into giving Carlos two months off."
Gabrielle,"No, just Carlos. Mrs. Hildebrand is taking him to Europe as her personal massage therapist."
Gabrielle,"Paying him a fortune. But he's worth it. I mean, what he's done for that woman, no one else has been able to do."
Gabrielle,"They both did. You should have seen the woman, looking at Carlos, gushing like crazy."
Gabrielle,"Why should I be jealous? The woman's, like, 60. If she gets off on Carlos' magical touch, what do I care?"
Gabrielle,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Nobody used the ""o"" word."
Gabrielle,No! He's giving her orgasms?!
Gabrielle,"Oh, I bet he does! Where is he? Is she here now?"
Gabrielle,Where? Where does she live?
Gabrielle,"Hmm. Well, when the time comes, an alibi would be nice."
Gabrielle,"I am Gabrielle Solis. Perhaps you know my husband? He ""rubs"" your boss. Where are they?"
Gabrielle,"Fine. When the cops bust up this brothel, I'm gonna tell them you're the madame."
Gabrielle,"I know what you've been up to, and shame on you."
Gabrielle,"I know about--the big ""O."""
Gabrielle,"And it never will, because if you think I'm gonna let you drag Carlos off to Europe, you're nuts."
Gabrielle,Maybe a little too much.
Gabrielle,"No, but I just think we should end things before they get any weirder."
Gabrielle,Lucky you.
Gabrielle,"Gosh, that's a--a hell of a sweet offer, but I've--got the girls, and, um--"
Gabrielle,"What the hell? You're never too young to see Paris, right?"
Gabrielle,He's giving her orgasms?!
Gabrielle,"Oh, lap of luxury, how I've missed sitting in you."
Gabrielle,"Ooh, we'd love to."
Gabrielle,Why not?
Gabrielle,What's to get ready? You buy a $9 sheet cake and fling a Piata over a tree and bam! Party time.
Gabrielle,"Carlos, just nod your head, 'cause I ain't leaving this pool."
Gabrielle,Thank you.
Gabrielle,What? You heard the woman. She wants children's laughter. And I want the lobster the chef is serving for dinner. It's a win-win.
Gabrielle,"Why not? I mean, look at this place. It's like Shangri-La."
Gabrielle,What is your problem?
Gabrielle,Says the man who massaged her into an orgasm.
Gabrielle,"Carlos, she is just a lonely old woman yearning for some friendship and human contact. And I, for one, am happy to be that human."
Gabrielle,"Oh, shoot. I can't reach it."
Gabrielle,"No, we're good."
Gabrielle,You sure you don't want to shut your piehole?
Gabrielle,"Anyway, we're good. So have a nice night."
Gabrielle,Some animated thing.
Gabrielle,"The girls wanted to watch it, so we're kind of having a family movie night."
Gabrielle,"Gee, I don't know. I can't really see the screen anymore."
Gabrielle,"Oh, that's okay."
Gabrielle,"Oh, yeah."
Gabrielle,"Rise and shine, girls. Rise and shi--Oh, my god! What are you doing?!"
Gabrielle,"You're both stupid. Stop it! Um, Mrs. Hildebrand, this is really nice of you. But why would you want to ruin your beautiful room?"
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"Uh--next weekend, uh, Carlos and I have plans."
Gabrielle,I--don't think that's such a good idea.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, and that's why we're leaving."
Gabrielle,I don't know. Make an excuse. Say you ha some blind thing you have to go to.
Gabrielle,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not going to Europe with Grandma Nutjob."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, it's not worth it. She's really starting to freak me out."
Gabrielle,"Hey, I seem to remember some melted butter on your bib, too. Now how we getting out of here?"
Gabrielle,"Virginia! What, uh, are you doing here?"
Gabrielle,"Well, she's a little busy with her friends right now, so just give it to me, and I'll make sure she gets it."
Gabrielle,"Well, she's not gonna leave her party to go buy a doll."
Gabrielle,"Uh, look, I'm sorry, but I don't want you driving off with my daughter."
Gabrielle,"You sure are making this hard. I have tried to be nice, but I am running out of polite here, so I'm just gonna say knock it off."
Gabrielle,"This whole creepy, clingy ""I'm your grandma"" routine."
Gabrielle,In three days. That's the creepy part.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, too generous. It's like you're trying to buy us or something. Well, we're not for sale, so just back off!"
Gabrielle,"Okay, we're done here. Good-bye. Am I not making myself clear? Get off my property!"
Gabrielle,Back off!
Gabrielle,We're done here. Good bye.
Gabrielle,"Honey, I'm home. You wouldn't believe the traffic--"
Gabrielle,"Well, maybe that's because the last time we spoke, you called me a greedy bitch, and I called you a scary old hag."
Gabrielle,"Family?! Lady, you had Carlos fired."
Gabrielle,Delightful. Now leave before there's a terrible misunderstanding between my foot and your ass.
Gabrielle,"Save your breath, Carlos. There is no way we're letting grandma screw-loose back into our lives."
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god! That woman is crazy."
Gabrielle,I don't care.
Gabrielle,"Right, and in exchange, when she finally kicks the bucket, we wind up with a lamp. I'm sorry, Carlos."
Gabrielle,Virginia! Why can't I stay mad at you?
Gabrielle,"Okay, girls, mommy's leaving. I love you!"
Gabrielle,"I'm planning on having a massive hangover tomorrow, so keep the girls up late so we can all sleep in."
Gabrielle,Virginia. What are you doing here?
Gabrielle,"No, uh, what I remember was you asking me to the movies tonight, and me saying I couldn't because I was going to watch Carlos' band play. You got invitation out of that?"
Gabrielle,"Well, here's the thing. I'm supposed to go with my girlfriends."
Gabrielle,"Well, I guess we're all going to the same place. I'll just see my friends there."
Gabrielle,Don't talk like that. You want a cheeseburger or something?
Gabrielle,"Well, thanks, but the girls already have a school."
Gabrielle,"Virginia, they're happy where they are. They love Fairview. Besides, Greenbrier's, like, an hour away."
Gabrielle,"No, I want them to be close by. They could need me during the school day-- get sick or something."
Gabrielle,Excuse me. You don't get to insist on anything when it comes to my daughters.
Gabrielle,"You know something? I like money. I like it a lot. A couple years ago, you could've bought me with that big fortune of yours. But I'm a mom now, and I make the decisions for my kids. And that is something that cannot be bought."
Gabrielle,And that is your right as a crazy old rich lady.
Gabrielle,"Sorry about the tip, but I just lost $50 million."
Gabrielle,"No, I haven't. Why? Is he supposed to be here?"
Gabrielle,Mm-hmm.
Gabrielle,Crap!
Gabrielle,"Come on. Let's get you out of here. Let's go. Hey, since I'm saving your life and all, you wanna think about maybe keeping us in your will?"
Gabrielle,"Eh, it was worth a shot."
Gabrielle,"Hi, sweetie. How's our patient?"
Gabrielle,That's it? No concussion?
Gabrielle,"And, what, you're afraid it's gonna impair his vision? I'm sorry. You were saying-?"
Gabrielle,That's fantastic!
Gabrielle,Oh!
Gabrielle,Oh.
Gabrielle,"I know. It's just--he's been through so much these past five years, and he's never complained. I just think he deserves to open his eyes to a wife who doesn't tuck her boobs into her pants."
Gabrielle,"But I'm not most women. I was an international fashion model, and that's how Carlos remembers me."
Gabrielle,"It's okay, it's okay. Let her talk. At least she's being honest. It's the kind of support and friendship I need right now."
Gabrielle,"Thank you. God, what am I gonna do?"
Gabrielle,"Really? I mean, do you think I could pull this off?"
Gabrielle,You gonna start that crap again?
Gabrielle,"Oh, boy! Who knew healthy food could look so tasty? Okay, dig in. What's wrong?"
Gabrielle,It's a recipe I got from a diet magazine. It's--it's fish and broccoli.
Gabrielle,"Yes. Not all fish is shaped like a stick. Now I know you're not used to it, but give it a try. You're gonna love it. Mmm. Yummy."
Gabrielle,See? Delicious!
Gabrielle,"Hey, I'm not a short-order cook. I don't have time to make different meals for everyone."
Gabrielle,"Okay, look. Mommy needs to lose a few pounds, and it's not easy eating healthy with you two in front of me, scarfing down all the good stuff. So what do you say? You want to help mommy be beautiful again?"
Gabrielle,You got a lot of nerve. Part of the reason I'm on this diet is because carrying you 2 brats for 18 months made mommy fat! And you with the head-- you ruined me! So this is how it's gonna go down. You're going to eat this with mommy and you're gonna like it. Got it? Thank you.
Gabrielle,Huh.
Gabrielle,Huh. Huh.
Gabrielle,"Hi, Dr Bach! How are you?"
Gabrielle,"Friday?! But you said it would be at least a month. I mean, that's so soon."
Gabrielle,"Okay, I didn't wanna have to say this, but you should never have surgery on a Friday. The surgeons are thinking about the weekend. They're all distracted. Next thing you know, you come out of the O.R. still blind and missing your right leg."
Gabrielle,"Also, the surgery is very expensive. We need time to figure out how we're gonna pay for it."
Gabrielle,That only covers 85%. And we are broke.
Gabrielle,No. We don't accept charity.
Gabrielle,"Well, I have turned over a new leaf. I'm sorry about the timing, Carlos, but it is what it is."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, well, let's keep our fingers crossed. Ow!"
Gabrielle,Yeah. It's my hamstring. I've just been working out.
Gabrielle,"No, no, you rest. You're gonna have surgery in a couple days."
Gabrielle,"You know, Carlos, I know you're really excited to see Christmas decorations again, but--I just want you to be prepared because--Well, some of those lights may have lost their luster."
Gabrielle,"No, I'm talking about me. I may have lost my luster."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, that's when you thought you were gonna be blind forever. But if this operation works, I just don't want you to be disappointed."
Gabrielle,First time you saw me on the runway.
Gabrielle,"Mmm, I remember that place."
Gabrielle,You know when I decided I wanna be with you forever?
Gabrielle,"About two seconds ago. Up until then, it was pretty touch-and-go."
Gabrielle,That's it?
Gabrielle,"Can you see me, babe?"
Gabrielle,"Carlos, that's the doctor. I'm right here."
Gabrielle,"Uh, doctor, we are very grateful, so don't take this the wrong way, but--"
Gabrielle,"Damn it, Carlos. What are you, a moron?"
Gabrielle,Why aren't you wearing your blackout glasses? The doctor says your eyes can't be exposed to any light. I can only handle my husband going blind once per marriage.
Gabrielle,It was? I didn't know that. I thought it was some stupid collectors item.
Gabrielle,"Uh, Carlos, I think it's time to put your eyedrops in. Why don't you go do that?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, don't look at me that way. I did what I had to do."
Gabrielle,"The car needed tires. How was I supposed to know he was gonna get his sight back? I mean, of all the rotten luck."
Gabrielle,"I don't know. Some Italian guy. Hey, Mike's into baseball. He must know someone who can track down this Lou Gehrig guy and get him to sign a new one. What?"
Gabrielle,"So you see, it belonged to my husband's grandfather, and if I don't get it back, I am telling you, I'm gonna be in the crapper."
Gabrielle,��_��_��_Per nulla��_��_? What does that mean?
Gabrielle,"Oh, please. This is important."
Gabrielle,What? What's he saying?
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"Yeah, you know what? I'm gonna have to call a big, fat ��_��_��_per nulla��_��_ on that one."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, what's wrong?"
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god. That's wonderful!"
Gabrielle,"Oh, I told you."
Gabrielle,Oh. I had to sell it a few months ago so I could make the mortgage. I'm sorry.
Gabrielle,Really? That makes me feel so much better. You wouldn't believe all the stupid things I've been worried about.
Gabrielle,"Oh, it's silly. I sold that baseball of yours. But you're right. You can see, and that's all that matters."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, but it's just a thing. We don't care about things."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, and I know that now, but--Juanita, dance for your dad."
Gabrielle,"Hey, this featherhead kept this family afloat for five years. You have no idea what I had to do to keep this roof over our heads."
Gabrielle,I didn't sell your watch.
Gabrielle,Right. Damn.
Gabrielle,Get your boss.
Gabrielle,There.
Gabrielle,Fell off a table. Don't want to talk about it.
Gabrielle,It's beautiful. Where'd it come from?
Gabrielle,What? We can't afford this.
Gabrielle,You were blind and depressed. I didn't wanna add to it.
Gabrielle,You should know that watch is a knockoff. I sold the real one two years ago to get the roof fixed.
Gabrielle,That's wonderful! Oh!
Gabrielle,Wow! Neat! Why don't you guys go wash your hands for lunch?
Gabrielle,"Yeah, pretty. What? You're gonna be late for work."
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,You quit?! Why?
Gabrielle,"Carlos, you don't just quit a job because of a few moles and a little back fat."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, it sure is. I'll get you the want ads."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, yeah. I'm comin'."
Gabrielle,"Oh, right! How are you?"
Gabrielle,"Good, good. I don't know if you heard-Carlos got his sight back."
Gabrielle,I know. Life is good. Now all we have to do is find him a job.
Gabrielle,Why? You need someone?
Gabrielle,I don't know. I-I can't speak for Carlos.
Gabrielle,I'm now speaking for Carlos. He'll take it.
Gabrielle,Yeah.
Gabrielle,"So long, sucka."
Gabrielle,Aren't they? Daddy bought them for mommy - He doesn't know it yet - because he has a wonderful new job. He doesn't that yet either.
Gabrielle,"Me, too. Me first. Remember Bradley Scott? I ran into him today, and he's giving you a job."
Gabrielle,"Fantastic! Well, you didn't sign a contract or anything, did you? 'Cause maybe we can get them into a bidding war."
Gabrielle,Oh. Great. And what's the signing bonus for that-a cup of pencils? I thought you were gonna get a better job. What happened to the world being your oyster?
Gabrielle,Who cares? Bradley's offering perks. What kind of perks is this blind thing offering?
Gabrielle,"Carlos, I've spent the last five years working with the blind. Trust me, it's not that fulfilling."
Gabrielle,"Hi, Bradley, it's Gaby Solis. I just talked to him, and he's intrigued. How would you like to come over for dinner and seal the deal?"
Gabrielle,How do you sleep with someone and not remember?
Gabrielle,"Okay, let's skip to the important part - who was it?"
Gabrielle,"It was Tom Scavo, wasn't it?"
Gabrielle,Was it Lou?
Gabrielle,"Come on. You were with a plumber and a housepainter. I mean, let's face it - you like your service providers."
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god."
Gabrielle,No. I think I should stay and clean this up. It's a--huge mess.
Gabrielle,Hahaha--
Gabrielle,Hahaha--Aw.
Gabrielle,"Hi, honey. You remember Bradley and his wife Maria. They dropped by for dinner."
Gabrielle,Excuse me.
Gabrielle,"I know. Just listen to what Bradley has to say, and if at the end of the evening you're still not interested, I support you completely. Deal?"
Gabrielle,"Wow. Impressive. Huh, Carlos?"
Gabrielle,"Carlos, be nice."
Gabrielle,"So, Bradley, if Carlos were to come work for you, what would a typical week look like?"
Gabrielle,"You hear that, Carlos? Five-star hotels."
Gabrielle,"Um, honey, Bradley's right. You could take this job and do your charity work in your free time."
Gabrielle,So--is eye care included in the health plan? 'Cause that's obviously a big issue for Carlos.
Gabrielle,"Hang on. Before you do that, let me lay it out for you. Either you let your family continue to sacrifice so you can feel good about yourself, or you grow up and make real money and look after us like we've been looking after you for the past five years."
Gabrielle,"It took a toll on us when we couldn't pay the gas bill, Carlos. It took a toll on us when Juanita was sent home from day care because the check bounced. But I handled it, and now it's your turn to handle it."
Gabrielle,"Emphasis on the word ""laid."""
Gabrielle,You know what would lift your spirits? We should all do a spa weekend.
Gabrielle,"Uh, wait, you're moving?"
Gabrielle,"Absolutely. Come here, you!"
Gabrielle,I can't believe you're leaving.
Gabrielle,"Carlos, what is going on? You're gonna miss your plane."
Gabrielle,"Oh, for god sakes, girls. It's not like he's going off to war. He's gonna be back tomorrow."
Gabrielle,Because daddy has a new job that's gonna make us lots of money.
Gabrielle,"Hey, what did I say about that kind of language?"
Gabrielle,And the best part is you get to spend a whole day with just mommy!
Gabrielle,"Juanita, it's time for your bath."
Gabrielle,"You've seen it a hundred times. She loses her shoe, the prince finds it--end of story. Let's go."
Gabrielle,"It is for you. Now move! Juanita Solis, I am not kidding. Okay. That does it. Juanita. If you think I'm not gonna drag you to the bathroom, you are sadly mistaken!"
Gabrielle,"Oh, yes, I will. My rage is fueling me in ways you can't imagine."
Gabrielle,My rage just needs to catch its breath. Okay. Okay. I am willing to forget this entire incident if you just go jump in that bathtub right now. What do you say?
Gabrielle,"I am gonna scrub that smug look right off your face. Oh, my back!"
Gabrielle,"Celia! Juanita! I am not gonna ask you again to pick up these clothes! You've got till the count of three! One-- two-- three! You can hear me, right?"
Gabrielle,"All right, that's it! I'm calling your father! You are gonna get it now! He is gonna tear into you! It is gonna be a bloodbath!"
Gabrielle,It's your children. They've run amok.
Gabrielle,"Now that you've gone back to work, they won't listen to me. They know you're not in the next room, ready to drop the hammer. Help me!"
Gabrielle,"O-okay. I'm gonna put you on speaker, and I want you to rip 'em a new one."
Gabrielle,But---
Gabrielle,Carlos? Carlos!
Gabrielle,"Okay, girls. Pick up your toys and put 'em in the basket before dinner."
Gabrielle,I've had enough of your crap. Now pick up these toys!
Gabrielle,"Okay, Juanita. What is going on here? Why are you being so difficult? When daddy asks you to do something, you just do it."
Gabrielle,Fine.
Gabrielle,Yeah. just my kids. They really know how push my buttons.
Gabrielle,"Well, unfortunately, they're not afraid of me."
Gabrielle,Yeah. It's very effective.
Gabrielle,"Hey, you got an extra 15 minutes?"
Gabrielle,"It's out of my hands, girls. Word got out that you were disobeying, and they sent Reggie over."
Gabrielle,"Well, I know how much you love him, but--it was your daddy."
Gabrielle,If you wouldn't mind.
Gabrielle,"Hey, you're the one who told me to get creative."
Gabrielle,Easy for you to say. They told me they love you more than me.
Gabrielle,Really?
Gabrielle,"Well, I wouldn't have to if you would do it."
Gabrielle,Just for the first 15 minutes after you walk in the door. Then it's Carlos time.
Gabrielle,I just wanted us to have a normal life.
Gabrielle,"Wow! Jimmy Choo! Oh, Carlos! These aren't even in the states yet. What's the catch?"
Gabrielle,"You never buy me a present unless I'm mad or about to be mad. And I don't think I am, so why am I about to be?"
Gabrielle,Carlos!
Gabrielle,You just got home!
Gabrielle,Don't leave me here. I'm going out of my mind. Everyone is so boring and suburban. And how many freakin' honor students N that school have?
Gabrielle,He has a name. What's your name?
Gabrielle,"You hear that, Carlos? You've brought me to a place where people are named ""Eli Scruggs."""
Gabrielle,Not the Jimmy Choos. They're the only friends I've got.
Gabrielle,You're right. It's not.
Gabrielle,"Yeah. They came by, brought muffins. One of 'em wants her basket back."
Gabrielle,Hello there. Welcome to my home.
Gabrielle,"So I said, ""Pumpkin""-- that's what I call Jon Bon Jovi-- I said, ""Pumpkin, even if I could steer a yacht, I'm certainly not about to do it in 5-inch heels."" True story."
Gabrielle,"Well, it was before my husband moved me here to east nowhere. Seriously, I don't know how you girls do it."
Gabrielle,"Get out of bed in the morning. I've only lived here a month, and I want to put a gun to my head. You know what I mean?"
Gabrielle,"There are no good nightclubs, no theater. What do you do for a good time?"
Gabrielle,"Church. Oh, you're serious."
Gabrielle,"No, no, it's cute. It's cute. I get that. It's just-- I was a top-tier fashion model, and I guess I'm just gonna have to get used to the fact that the best part of my life is behind me. Good-bye Doi Vod shots with Kate Moss, and hello to sipping international coffee with you girls. Full house."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I got it. I got it. Go, go, go, go, go."
Gabrielle,Okay. Thank you.
Gabrielle,Really?
Gabrielle,"Well, I'm sure it was kind of exciting for them to have a star their midst."
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"Oh, clothes said that, not me."
Gabrielle,Why would they want to talk about their lives? Their lives are boring.
Gabrielle,"Well, thanks for the advice. You wanna add that your bill?"
Gabrielle,I brought muffins.
Gabrielle,"Playing poker, and I wasn't invited. I know. I get it. I just wanted to tell you guys I know I made a horrible first impression. Now you know why models don't usually talk. Because we say a lot of stupid, patronizing things that make people want to avoid us. What I should've said was--my husband's never home. I miss the city. I miss my life. I'm lonely all the time--and I could really use some friends. Anyway, here."
Gabrielle,I'm sorry. What?
Gabrielle,"Actually, why don't you let me pay for it? It can still be from all of us."
Gabrielle,I sort of do. Now let's play some poker.
Gabrielle,"And by ""we"" and ""food,"" you mean Bree, right?"
Gabrielle,I'll go get it.
Gabrielle,"Oh, it's only temporary. Juanita needed her coloring book back."
Gabrielle,"Watch out, ladies."
Gabrielle,Hey. You coming back in?
Gabrielle,Eli would've liked it.
Gabrielle,Eli would have said that's more than most people get.
Gabrielle,Mommy needs to lose a few pounds. You wanna help mommy be beautiful again?
Gabrielle,I wish I had one.
Gabrielle,"Yikes. That's, like, a half a step away from selling your eggs on the internet."
Gabrielle,"The Palm? As in, ""They don't even show the prices on the menu"" the Palm? Honey, we're still paying off credit card debt."
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god! That's great! Oh, why didn't you tell me this when you were begging for sex this morning? You would've closed that deal, too. We're rich again! Hallelujah!"
Gabrielle,"Honey, we're gonna be us again--the old Carlos and Gaby. You know what? I'm gonna wear my dress from the night you proposed."
Gabrielle,Have you not noticed me working my butt off? I'm almost back to the weight I was when we got married!
Gabrielle,"No, no. This'll be way more romantic. I'm one good colonic away from being the old me!"
Gabrielle,"Oh, I don't get it! I'm only a few pounds away from my runway weight."
Gabrielle,That would be cheating. I'm gonna try to go pee again.
Gabrielle,"Jean, you didn't just give in to it. You slapped a piece of cheese on it. Yeah, I said it. Now just fix the hem. And this time, try not to leave the edges frayed. Hey, Edie! Wait up!"
Gabrielle,"Now don't forget, the clasp is broken."
Gabrielle,"Jean, Carlos is taking me to the Palm, not out for Hoagies. Make it perfect."
Gabrielle,"Ah, yeah. Times are good. Not for her. Her, Mrs. McCluskey said something about you losing 5 pounds in one day. How'd you do that?"
Gabrielle,"No, not that story. Something about a boot camp."
Gabrielle,That's perfect. I'm trying to fit in an old dress. I need intense.
Gabrielle,Why not?
Gabrielle,"Oh, you're just afraid I'm gonna look better than you!"
Gabrielle,Here you go. All signed.
Gabrielle,"Oh, no need. I'm up for anything. Although I did just get a manicure, so nothing that might chip a nail."
Gabrielle,"Not tough enough? Let me tell you something, Mr. Iraqi army guy."
Gabrielle,"Whatever. I used to be a model, and you don't know what war is until you've been in a dressing room with a bunch of size zeroes reaching for the last rice cake. I am plenty tough."
Gabrielle,"Hey, I know some of those women in your exercise class. The most exercise they ever get is cutting a piece of cake."
Gabrielle,Excuse me?
Gabrielle,"It's an exercise class. Why would anyone say ""doughnut""?"
Gabrielle,"You know, maybe I should give this a little gander."
Gabrielle,It's hard.
Gabrielle,"Shut up, Mona. I'm puking air."
Gabrielle,Okay. We need to talk.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Time-out."
Gabrielle,"Look, I appreciate this whole military commando act, but I'm new at this, and frankly, this is a bit much."
Gabrielle,Yeah. Are we gonna get a break soon?
Gabrielle,"Oh, that sounds so yummy. You got any?"
Gabrielle,I said time-out!
Gabrielle,Don't take that tone with me. I am paying.
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"Oh, yeah, I quit that."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, well, maybe you should take it up with my lawyer. Here he is."
Gabrielle,What the hell do you think you're doing?
Gabrielle,Are you out of mind? I have two sleeping children.
Gabrielle,"Oh, don't get all holier than thou, Mona. I saw you pull into the doughnut shack yesterday."
Gabrielle,"Oh, really? Well, try this on for size. I'm going back to bed, because I'm tired. And when I wake up, maybe I'll have some cake, and you can't stop me."
Gabrielle,"Well, frankly, some of them need it. I just came for a little remodel, and there are some real teardowns out there."
Gabrielle,"Oh, for god sakes, Edie, it's a stupid exercise class. I tried it. It sucked. I don't want to do it anymore. Lighten up."
Gabrielle,"Well, they're crazy. He yells, and they jump. He tells them to run all the way over here, and they do it."
Gabrielle,What the hell for?
Gabrielle,"Okay, be honest. Here I come. So what do you think?"
Gabrielle,Really?
Gabrielle,"Oh, I think I've changed a little bit."
Gabrielle,"Jean, wait."
Gabrielle,"No, no. It's perfect. I just want to tell you how helpful you've been to me over the years, and I'm really grateful. Thank you."
Gabrielle,"Boy, dinner without the kids--it's nice to eat without having macaroni thrown at you."
Gabrielle,Please. It was our pleasure. How did we do that again?
Gabrielle,"Oh, I'll be more willing to forgive once his bonus check comes in."
Gabrielle,Beat it. What?
Gabrielle,"But do you know how much overtime Carlos has pulled? How many trips he's taken? He's killed himself. For god sakes, don't do this to my jeweler."
Gabrielle,So this was his bonus? A salad and a stuffed chicken breast?
Gabrielle,We're ready for dessert now. Wrap up ten lobsters to go.
Gabrielle,"Oh, put it on and have a good time. Turns out I'm no gonna be able to afford it right now--unless you can help me out on the price."
Gabrielle,"You give it to me, and then call your insurance and say it was stolen? I didn't think so."
Gabrielle,"Oh, will you excuse me a minute?"
Gabrielle,"Carlos, get in here! I got a real shockeroo for you! You are not gonna believe this! Brad! Hi. Uh, what's going on?"
Gabrielle,Really?
Gabrielle,"Oh, I think I know the kind. So, Brad--what sort of bonus are we looking at?"
Gabrielle,Like a great jumping off point.
Gabrielle,"Oh, honey, you heard Maria the other night. Your hard work is what's brought them so much closer."
Gabrielle,"Oh, Brad. Come on. Saving a marriage? You can't put a price on that--at least not a small one."
Gabrielle,"You're right. I'm sorry. It's just--I really wanted to buy this bracelet I saw today downtown in this little jewelry shop. You know the place, honey. It's right next to the, Lexington Hotel."
Gabrielle,"Absolutely. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll leave you two to business. All this negotiating just goes right over my head."
Gabrielle,Hey.
Gabrielle,"Uh, sure."
Gabrielle,So--what's going on? I'm gonna buy a golf club. A baseball bat would be cheaper. Maybe I should let you finish.
Gabrielle,"Oh, it's a gift. Sure, yeah. We'd love to help out. So what's the occasion?"
Gabrielle,"Well, don't spend too much. Why don't you just get him a card?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, you're in counseling. That's great."
Gabrielle,Are you sure about that?
Gabrielle,"Well, ice is solid too, until it cracks and you're drowning in freezing water. I'd stay in counseling if I were you."
Gabrielle,I'm sorry. I think they do.
Gabrielle,Who? Him and Maria or him and the blonde I saw him kissing yesterday?
Gabrielle,Yeah. And Brad saw me. Why do you think your bonus jumped from a stuffed chicken breast to 30 grand in a day?
Gabrielle,You're welcome.
Gabrielle,"No, we can't tell her. We'd have to give the money back."
Gabrielle,"It's like you said��_��_��_their marriage is none of our business. He's the one who's cheating. If we say anything, it'll just make things worse. We're the good guys here, Carlos."
Gabrielle,Hey. When did you two get here?
Gabrielle,"Oh, really? What is it?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, whoa."
Gabrielle,"Do you hear that, Carlos? Godparents."
Gabrielle,How could we say no?
Gabrielle,"Oh, yeah. Uh, but I'm not enjoying it as much as I thought I would."
Gabrielle,"So, Brad, what sort of bonus are we looking at?"
Gabrielle,Shh.
Gabrielle,The federal deficit.
Gabrielle,"I mean, let's be honest, Susan. You weren't exactly over the moon when you heard they were gonna live together."
Gabrielle,"Shut it, bitch."
Gabrielle,"They had theater tickets, and their sitter canceled. We're only gonna watch their kids for a couple hours."
Gabrielle,Shh. Hi!
Gabrielle,"Well, what are friends for?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, that Shayla."
Gabrielle,"Two. Two.There's, uh, Shayla the hairstylist and then there's this other Shayla I know who's a home-wrecking whore."
Gabrielle,Come on in.
Gabrielle,You're using me as an alibi now?
Gabrielle,"Why? So you can go get another ""haircut""?"
Gabrielle,"Well, Bradley, we all want things. For instance, I would like Carlos to have a week off next month."
Gabrielle,"4:00? Let me think. Actually, noon would be better for me. Could you do noon?"
Gabrielle,Nope. He is not to be believed.
Gabrielle,How about we let it ride? Double or nothing��_��_��_McCluskey slugs someone by 5:00.
Gabrielle,You painted that? You're good.
Gabrielle,Katherine hung one of Mike's paintings over the mantel till she found out Susan painted it. Then she took it down.
Gabrielle,"Really, Susan, there's not a woman in the world who doesn't know what ""I broke it dusting"" means."
Gabrielle,"Fine. Fine. I will do it, but you owe me. I gotta go."
Gabrielle,"Yes, he wants me to take Maria shopping tomorrow."
Gabrielle,"I know. Just keep reminding yourself that we're getting things out of it, too."
Gabrielle,What? You can't do that. You'll lose your job and all that money.
Gabrielle,I do-- and so does my personal shopper and Pilates instructor.
Gabrielle,Or we can--make someone else do the right thing.
Gabrielle,It means--tomorrow I'm going to the mall to get my hair cut by a slut.
Gabrielle,You didn't.
Gabrielle,"Well, Shayla��_��_��_it is Shayla, right?"
Gabrielle,I need a fresh look. I've been going through some pretty intense personal stuff lately.
Gabrielle,"Fine. I'll tell you. I have been having an affair with a married man, and it's come to that point where I can't even look at myself in the mirror. So I want a new style that says I'm not a giant turd of sin."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, that's what I thought at first, and then I realized that's stupid. I mean, what about his poor wife?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, no. She does. She loves him plenty."
Gabrielle,And he has kids��_��_��_two adorable little kids.
Gabrielle,"Well, maybe I am tired of being that kind of selfish bitch."
Gabrielle,"Focus, Shayla! We are talking about how I'm ruining innocent people's lives."
Gabrielle,"Oh, for god sakes, you bleached blonde twit. I'm not talking about me. I'm talking about you and Bradley."
Gabrielle,"I'm a friend of Maria's, who, by the way, happens to be a warm and lovely person."
Gabrielle,"Oh, Shayla, he's lying. She's pregnant."
Gabrielle,"Well, call the Vatican, 'cause we're gonna need a manger and some hay."
Gabrielle,I'm just trying to protect you here.
Gabrielle,"Okay, let's just take a deep breath here--let's not do anything we're gonna regret."
Gabrielle,This is why people should never get their hair cut in a mall!
Gabrielle,"Jeez, Bradley, you scared me!"
Gabrielle,"Yeah, she's a real gem."
Gabrielle,"Well, I'm tired of the deal, and what you're doing to Maria is despicable."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, well, I'm not that person anymore. I've changed."
Gabrielle,You know what? You're right. I'm out.
Gabrielle,Deal's over. I'm not covering for your stupid little fling anymore.
Gabrielle,Shayla? She has a Hello Kitty tip jar.
Gabrielle,"Well, at least be man enough to tell Maria, because if you don't, I will."
Gabrielle,What you reading?
Gabrielle,I'm so sorry.
Gabrielle,I should have done it sooner.
Gabrielle,"Well, that means a lot, coming from a United States marine."
Gabrielle,"Hello? Maria. Calm down. Calm down. Okay, we're coming over."
Gabrielle,I guess Bradley told her.
Gabrielle,"You know, Jody, I really don't think this is the time or place to discuss gory details."
Gabrielle,I want to go home!
Gabrielle,"Yeah, well, I have a feeling most of these vultures didn't come to pay their respects to Brad. They're just here to pump us for dirt about his murder."
Gabrielle,Were your coworkers. Bradley fired you. Remember?
Gabrielle,"Oh, hi."
Gabrielle,"Well, what did he say?"
Gabrielle,"That was my guess, too."
Gabrielle,He sure will. The man has a plane to catch.
Gabrielle,The same compensation package! We're rich!
Gabrielle,Okay.
Gabrielle,"We've moved on to my daughter, the thief."
Gabrielle,"Anyway, Juanita went over before breakfast to invite M.J. To her birthday party, and, well, candy plus Juanita. You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to crack this case."
Gabrielle,S-so what kind of kiss are we talking about?
Gabrielle,"Susan, if you're not sure what she meant by it, why don't you just have a talk with her?"
Gabrielle,"Okay, we're gonna figure this out for you. Were her eyes open or shut?"
Gabrielle,"Well, how many seconds did the kiss last?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, for God sakes. Was it this--or was it this--"
Gabrielle,"Oh, honey, I'm flattered, but I only did that to help Susan out."
Gabrielle,"Thank you. I mean, it's sad how it happened, but, you know, when opportunity knocks, you gotta answer the door, right?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, yeah. How's that going?"
Gabrielle,I don't know.
Gabrielle,"Well, I thought you did advertising."
Gabrielle,I guess.
Gabrielle,"Look, Lynette, you're my friend, and I love you, but as far as knowing if you're any good at your job--"
Gabrielle,"You're putting me in a tough spot. Carlos is under a lot of pressure now, and he's not really in a position to be taking big risks."
Gabrielle,Well--
Gabrielle,It's all part of being the president's wife. So tell me about your new hire. She's gonna be your number two?
Gabrielle,Lucy Blackburn? Please tell me it's a coincidence that your new VP has the same name as your ex-girlfriend.
Gabrielle,You told me you slept with her.
Gabrielle,I don't care! Why couldn't you have told me this before she's about to appear on my doorstep?
Gabrielle,"I'm not jealous. It's just--you can't hire her. I'm Mrs. President, and I get a vote."
Gabrielle,"Well, you can beg all you want. I am not on board with this!"
Gabrielle,You can call me Gaby. come on in! I'm on board.
Gabrielle,Now I know why you wanted to hire her. She's a force of nature.
Gabrielle,I'll bet. So were you surprised when the door opened?
Gabrielle,"Well, she's obviously stopped counting calories since the last time you saw her."
Gabrielle,What? But--you two used to have sex.
Gabrielle,So don't get me wrong--she's attractive. It's just-- she's not really your type. Your type is skinny model.
Gabrielle,Except maybe at an airport.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, I thought that was something we had in common."
Gabrielle,"Hey, are you still looking for a marketing director? I have a friend that I would love to see working with you two."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, no problem. Two eggs coming right up. Wait. I made omelets this morning, so I'm all out."
Gabrielle,Where did that come from?
Gabrielle,"Unbelievable. Juanita, get your butt down here."
Gabrielle,To find out what McCluskey's sleeping Mexican is doing in my house.
Gabrielle,No. Why would you think that?
Gabrielle,It's been sitting on McCluskey's porch for years. I keep telling her how racist it is. First the candy bowl and now this? How many times have I told you not to steal?
Gabrielle,"Juanita, you play with it every time we go by Mrs. McCluskey's. Now either tell me the truth, or I'm gonna cancel your birthday party."
Gabrielle,That's it. Party's over!
Gabrielle,"Well, then how else did it get here?"
Gabrielle,Great news! You got the job!
Gabrielle,"Hear about it? Honey, I did it. I talked to Carlos. You're in."
Gabrielle,"Say, ""How do I thank you, greatest friend in the world? What's your birthstone?"""
Gabrielle,"Well, un-accept it. You have to take this job. It's essential that you be there."
Gabrielle,Because it's a great opportunity.
Gabrielle,"Yeah. Yes, and then I went home and ought, what a horrible thing to say to such a dear, dear friend who's probably really, really good at her job. So--I said, ""Carlos, you have to hire Lynette."""
Gabrielle,"Yeah, okay. What are they paying?"
Gabrielle,"I don't think that'll be a problem. By the way, you're gonna be reporting to this woman Lucy. She's a real star, so you're gonna wanna keep an eye on her."
Gabrielle,I just wanted to see how your first day went. Sit. Take a load off. Spill it.
Gabrielle,"Oh, well, you know me."
Gabrielle,"So did you get a good office? Were the people nice? Oh, what about Lucy? Do you like her?"
Gabrielle,"Ooh! What's going on? I mentioned Lucy, and you get all weird. Is something going on with her--and Carlos?"
Gabrielle,What do you mean by affectionate?
Gabrielle,That son of a--I'm gonna kill him!
Gabrielle,"How dare you! And, yes, I did!"
Gabrielle,You needed a job. I did you a favor. And then I brought you hot cocoa. Why don't you ever thank me?
Gabrielle,"Oh, were you, Miss ""they offered me $100,000 a year""?"
Gabrielle,"Honey, I've played poker with you for the past nine years. I think I can tell when you're bluffing."
Gabrielle,"Fine. We're a couple of users. The big question is, are we still friends?"
Gabrielle,Will you still be my spy?
Gabrielle,I talked to Carlos. You're in!
Gabrielle,"Carlos, do you have to go back to work?"
Gabrielle,But can't Lucy cover it?
Gabrielle,How about a quickie?
Gabrielle,"Right, that's why I didn't suggest a longie. Oh, come on. I'll have your eyes rolling back in your head in three minutes flat."
Gabrielle,All gone. Now let's do this. It'll be like old times.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, we did, years ago. Don't you remember?"
Gabrielle,"Right. Well, we'll create new table memoes."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, do you realize since Bradley died and you took over, we haven't had sex once? I miss you. I wanna spend time with you. Now move the creamed corn and do me!"
Gabrielle,"Yeah, I've heard that before, and then tomorrow comes, and you're too tired."
Gabrielle,"I just can't get used to everyone working--first Bree, then Susan, now Lynette. Thank God for you. I just had to get out of that boring house."
Gabrielle,Mostly gossip. You got any good gossip?
Gabrielle,"You know, I should get back."
Gabrielle,Okay. We'll start with something a little easier--bitching.
Gabrielle,"Well, I am so pissed at Carlos. He is never home. And when he is, he's too tired to do anything. And by ""anything,"" I mean sex. Are you uncomfortable?"
Gabrielle,"Well, we've never had a drought like this. It's been almost two weeks."
Gabrielle,"Yeah. Lately, Carlos just doesn't want to do it."
Gabrielle,Really?
Gabrielle,Even if you're tired and get home late?
Gabrielle,Huh. That's good to know. You're good at this girl talk thing.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, I should get back."
Gabrielle,Hi there.
Gabrielle,I couldn't sleep. I was a little hot. That's better. You look a little warm yourself.
Gabrielle,"Oh, if that were true, your pants would be around your ankles right now."
Gabrielle,"I'm releasing the horny teen inside of you. Now come on. Two boobs, no waiting."
Gabrielle,Not my problem.
Gabrielle,"Now listen up, the pair of you. I haven't been sitting around in butt floss all night for my health. You're putting out. That's more like it!"
Gabrielle,I forgot these were in the nightstand. This is gonna be fun.
Gabrielle,"Tight, just the way I like it."
Gabrielle,"Carlos, where you going?"
Gabrielle,"Carlos, get back here! Carlos! Could you at least scratch my nose?"
Gabrielle,Juanita! Celia! Get your coats on! We're going to see daddy.
Gabrielle,"Hey, Lynette! Great office. I see you're busy. Don't let me disturb you. I just wanted to drop off the girls so I could talk to Carlos for a sec. All right, girls, have fun with aunt Lynette."
Gabrielle,You think you can buy me off with presents?
Gabrielle,"Well, I'd say let's talk about it tonight, but who knows if you're even gonna come home?"
Gabrielle,"You're right, and I'm sorry. It's just--I'm scared. We're turning into what we used to be. I'm unhappy at home, you're always working, trying to buy me off with presents, too tired to make me feel loved. We've made these mistakes before, Carlos. For God sakes, let's not make 'em again."
Gabrielle,"I know you can't, and that's the part that really scares me."
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god."
Gabrielle,I hate that we have to this.
Gabrielle,"Well, can you at least put the radio on? I won't feel like bitching if I can sing along to something."
Gabrielle,It's a 4-hour drive. We have to do something to pass the time.
Gabrielle,"And after that five minutes is up, then what do we do?"
Gabrielle,"Say what you want about Edie, she really understood men."
Gabrielle,"Okay, my hour's up. Someone else hold Edie now."
Gabrielle,I got it.
Gabrielle,Maybe it's a sign we're not supposed to do this today.
Gabrielle,Do you wanna tell what it is.
Gabrielle,Yeah. Edie Britt shamed you into being a better human being. That is embarrassing.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, I do. I spent a night with her right after Carlos and I got divorced."
Gabrielle,Is this too red? I think I need something pinky
Gabrielle,This is gonna be fun. I can't believe we've never gone out on the town together.
Gabrielle,"Oh, I feel so sorry for all those other girls in the bar."
Gabrielle,We're an unstoppable team.
Gabrielle,"Oh, be nice! There are lots of attractive women on the street."
Gabrielle,How about Bree?
Gabrielle,Lynette's beautiful.
Gabrielle,And Susan?
Gabrielle,Too much?
Gabrielle,All right. Come on. Let's go.
Gabrielle,Wow! You were right about this place.
Gabrielle,"Oh, Edie, don't take it personally. We're just different types."
Gabrielle,"Now, now, Edie. Don't be snarky. We're both hot, remember? Although, apparently, I'm just a little bit hotter."
Gabrielle,"Hmm. Yes, I guess I am a little on the small side. That's the drawback to having ones that are real."
Gabrielle,"Oh, Edie, come on. When you jump up and down, the room moves more than your boobs."
Gabrielle,"Okay, you really think you're hotter than me?"
Gabrielle,"Yeah? Well, I have a vodka soda here that says otherwise."
Gabrielle,"Well, it's one more than you got."
Gabrielle,"Sure, you can, just not as many as me."
Gabrielle,"See ya in an hour, loser."
Gabrielle,"Well, I guess I could do that. Or I could do this. I should make some kind of speech. But think it's enough. We both know I crushed you, right? Now if you'll excuse me, swizzle stick number 17 has a yacht and giant feet."
Gabrielle,"What the hell were you thinking, abandoning me at a singles bar?"
Gabrielle,Why? Don't tell me you're depressed because you lost some stupid game.
Gabrielle,What is?
Gabrielle,"Oh, please. You're gorgeous. And you are going to stay that way forever."
Gabrielle,What?
Gabrielle,"Oh, that's ridiculous."
Gabrielle,You do realize there's medication designed to get rid of those voices?
Gabrielle,"Well, you know what? I have a voice inside my head that says you're wrong. It tells me that 50 years from now, you and I will still be wearing dresses too tight and walking in heels too high and going to bars where we'll meet old geezers who'll buy us drinks with the last of their social security checks."
Gabrielle,Now come on. Let's go to my house. Let's pop open a bottle of wine and toast to our future.
Gabrielle,Isn't that weird? She knew she was gonna die young.
Gabrielle,Pfft.
Gabrielle,So are we ready for this?
Gabrielle,"Uh, I'm sure the school will understand if you need to miss a few days."
Gabrielle,She should be. She's been doing it since she rode shotgun on an actual stagecoach.
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god. I can't believe we forgot."
Gabrielle,"We, uh--also came to give you your mom's ashes."
Gabrielle,Are you sure?
Gabrielle,"Actually, that's my leg. Get your hand off."
Gabrielle,"Well, Edie once told me she lost her virginity in cow pasture. If we can find that exact field--"
Gabrielle,I don't think Edie would want us to get all sappy.
Gabrielle,And then we dump her?
Gabrielle,"Okay, I got one. I'll go first. Edie Britt was sexy."
Gabrielle,Edie would so not be surprised you're welcome.
Gabrielle,You're good at this girl talk thing.
Gabrielle,Dave? Hello? Dave? He didn't answer.
Gabrielle,"Ugh, and I have a garden club meeting."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, I just joined."
Gabrielle,"Gee, this bit just gets funnier and funnier."
Gabrielle,That's a bit that I never get tired of.
Gabrielle,"I know I'm new here at the garden club, but what's with all the gardening? I thought this was just an excuse to get together for bitchin' and boozin'."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I'd kill for a margarita."
Gabrielle,"And she's the one I'd kill. I mean, really, who died and left her in charge?"
Gabrielle,"Oh. Well, this Edna has got to be stopped."
Gabrielle,"Well, that's three. Who else can we get?"
Gabrielle,How about the woman in the overalls?
Gabrielle,"Okay, so the lush gives us six. What about them?"
Gabrielle,"Mm. All right, so they have six, and we have six. We're gonna need a tiebreaker. Hey, uh, are men allowed to join the group?"
Gabrielle,"Ladies, start your blenders."
Gabrielle,"Edna, here's your diet soda. Try to keep your pants on."
Gabrielle,There's some seeds in this. Knock yourself out.
Gabrielle,"Patty, do you mind if I steal Tom for a sec?"
Gabrielle,"First of all, you're a real prince for coming today. Thanks to you, our coup is complete."
Gabrielle,"Anyway, I know you must be bored silly, so go ahead and make your escape."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, about that--I gotta warn you. Patty's kinda got a thing for married men."
Gabrielle,"Yes, she's like that. She'll give you the bra off her back."
Gabrielle,"""Oh, Tom, what big arms you have""--That kind of talking?"
Gabrielle,"Okay, great. Now if you'll excuse me have to get back to my gardening."
Gabrielle,"Hey, Tom."
Gabrielle,Was that Patty Rizzo?
Gabrielle,Patty lives six blocks away. I live down the street. Why didn't you ask me to take you?
Gabrielle,"All right, look, Tom, I'm sorry, but I got a responsibility here. I brought you into the club. I introduced you to the horny homemaker. I just don't want you to--"
Gabrielle,"I was gonna say ""die of gonorrhea,"""
Gabrielle,"All right, Tom, you leave me no choice. You are no longer allowed to see Patty."
Gabrielle,I trump your mother. I am garden club president.
Gabrielle,"Look, I love you, Tom, but you're my friend with a small ""f."" My friend with the big ""f"" is Lynette. So if I see something that could hurt her, You bet your ass I'm gonna do something about it."
Gabrielle,"And by ""do something,"" he means having me slave over a rack of lamb all day."
Gabrielle,"Really? Any favorites, Tom?"
Gabrielle,"Although I keep telling Tom how dangerous gardens can be. Everywhere you step, there are shovels and rakes and hoes."
Gabrielle,Us?
Gabrielle,"Lynette was taking a shower and Carlos came by to drive her to work. She slipped and fell, and he helped her."
Gabrielle,"So I assume you fully disclosed your little ""friendship"" with Patty Rizzo."
Gabrielle,Exactly.
Gabrielle,"Hey, don't snap at me. Lynette's my friend. I was just watching her back."
Gabrielle,"If you have a shower at the office, How can you come home smelling so bad?"
Gabrielle,Hey.
Gabrielle,"Oh, Phyllis got tanked on cosmos and threw up on Edna--So now we're back to planting crap. Look, I'm really sorry for sticking my nose into that whole Patty Rizzo thing."
Gabrielle,Then why did you keep hanging out with her?
Gabrielle,"No. I get it. When we first moved here, Carlos was working round the clock, and he'd come home and barely say hello to me."
Gabrielle,It was like I was invisible.
Gabrielle,"So when he didn't see me, I found someone who did."
Gabrielle,I never thought I'd do it to Carlos.
Gabrielle,"Well, for the record, you're growing on me. You know what? I'm thirsty. Let's start a book club."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I hate splitting the pot."
Gabrielle,"Yeah. There's gonna be a huge dinner, and we're taking a picture with the mayor and his wife."
Gabrielle,Was his name Carlos Solis?
Gabrielle,"Juanita, hurry up. The bus will be here any minute."
Gabrielle,There's an extra piece of cinnamon toast on the table.
Gabrielle,"Hello? Oh, hi, Principal Hardy. What's up? She's wearing what?"
Gabrielle,Now march in there and wipe that stuff off!
Gabrielle,"Yes, I do. Do you have any idea how humiliating it was for me to get that call today? Now every parent in town is gonna think that I let my 6-year-old wear makeup to school! And I want my makeup back. Is it in here? Why do you have this? Juanita."
Gabrielle,Why?
Gabrielle,"He's right, sweetie. You don't need all that gunk on your face."
Gabrielle,"Because I'm an adult. And besides, I hardly wear any."
Gabrielle,"Well, it's a big, fancy dinner. Of course."
Gabrielle,"Sweetie, you're 6. There's a lot of things I can do that you don't."
Gabrielle,"Okay, see? Your daddy's got a great idea."
Gabrielle,"No, no, no. Your daddy's just being silly. Can I talk to you for a second, silly daddy?"
Gabrielle,Are you a lunatic? I am not walking Into a ballroom full of people without my face on.
Gabrielle,"Yeah, well, once you see this skin without foundation, you may want to rethink that."
Gabrielle,"I was in labor for 20 hours. She still owes me for that! Fine. I will make the ultimate sacrifice, and I will be ugly for my daughter. But if she ever needs a kidney--"
Gabrielle,"Oh, fine. As long as you don't mind people thinking you're out on the town with your anemic lesbian sister."
Gabrielle,Hi. Nice to meet you. You're probably wondering why I look like this.
Gabrielle,I'm not ill. I'm just not wearing any makeup so I can teach my daughter that beauty's what's on the inside. I don't actually look this hideous.
Gabrielle,I can't help it. I don't want people thinking I condone this face.
Gabrielle,"Oh, thank you. I'm not ill. I'm just not wearing any makeup."
Gabrielle,Gotta go.
Gabrielle,"Oh, that's so sweet. Tell him no way in hell."
Gabrielle,The newspaper? Forget it.
Gabrielle,"Seriously, we cannot allow this photograph. Next time there's an epidemic, people are gonna think I'm patient zero."
Gabrielle,"Fine. But just so we're clear, you're also Latino jerk of the year."
Gabrielle,"Oh, can I at least use the bathroom first?"
Gabrielle,"Ladies! Attention, please. I am in a jam, and I need lipstick and eyeliner. Come on. Chop chop."
Gabrielle,"Oh, that doesn't really go with my skin tone."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, it doesn't really go with your skin tone either, but I can only deal with one disaster at a time. Ooh. Asian girl. Close enough."
Gabrielle,"Ugh. Was it the ""chop chop"" thing? Fine. I'm sorry. Now can I borrow some blush?"
Gabrielle,"Oh, don't worry. I'm as healthy as a horse."
Gabrielle,That's 'cause I don't have any makeup!
Gabrielle,"Okay, okay, look. I'm sorry. You're right. I never should have asked."
Gabrielle,"You know, for a woman who has a purse full of dinner rolls, you sure have a lot of attitude."
Gabrielle,Thank you.
Gabrielle,"Hey. I know I disappointed you tonight, and I'm really sorry."
Gabrielle,"Honey, I know you think being pretty seems like the most important thing in the world right now, but believe me, it's not."
Gabrielle,"Yes, I was. And my whole life, people told me how pretty I was. So you know what? I never--thought I had to work hard in school or work on friendships or my personality--none of it. And then I stopped modeling, and I realized I didn't have much on the inside. And I don't want that for you. I want you to be brave and funny and creative--to be more than just a shell. I want you to have the whole rich, gooey center. Will you promise to do that for yourself?"
Gabrielle,I tell you what. You can wear makeup the day you realize you don't really need it.
Gabrielle,We're rich again! Hallelujah!
Gabrielle,We're gonna be us again--the old Carlos and Gaby.
Gabrielle,It is such a stunning piece. It's simple and elegant. Don't you think?
Gabrielle,"I mean, I know it was expensive, but you can't put a price tag on beauty. Am I right?"
Gabrielle,"So when daddy finds out how much I spent, would it be okay if I used you as a human shield?"
Gabrielle,"You know, I should really get you tested."
Gabrielle,Did you have a fun playdate with Heather?
Gabrielle,We just bought you a bed. It's not even a year old.
Gabrielle,"Then go move in with Heather, 'cause I'm not getting you one."
Gabrielle,Who told you that?
Gabrielle,"Well, mommy shouldn't have said that. Just, when Aunt Bree started bragging about her Prada bag, mommy kind of lost it."
Gabrielle,I don't have to get you anything. And stop acting like a spoiled brat. I am not spending a fortune on a bed you don't need.
Gabrielle,That vase is not stupid.
Gabrielle,"Okay, you know what? This conversation is over. Go to your room! You, too, bobblehead."
Gabrielle,"Well, you should've thought about that before you started acting like such a diva. Now sit down. Father Crowley!"
Gabrielle,"Well, I want Juanita to work with the poor. I want to teach her to be grateful for how good she has it."
Gabrielle,Fran Schulman? Fran. It's Gabrielle Solis from the tennis club.
Gabrielle,"Wow, it's been years! The last time I saw you was at that charity fashion show. Wasn't that fun?"
Gabrielle,So what are you doing here? Are you volunteering?
Gabrielle,"Me either. My daughter's gotten so snooty, I am forcing her to spend time with the great unwashed. You wanna ditch this place for a cappuccino?"
Gabrielle,Haha--ew
Gabrielle,I'll explain it to him later.
Gabrielle,I'll explain it to him later.
Gabrielle,Thank you.
Gabrielle,"Can you believe this? Seven years ago, Evelyn did Fran's house. Now? Nohouse."
Gabrielle,No! I didn't want to embarrass her.
Gabrielle,Remember that dinner party she gave? She had 20 place settings of Tiffany china. How does this happen to someone who has Tiffany china?
Gabrielle,I bet I know what happened. She drank it away. That one new year's eve where she got so plowed she fell in the koi pond--
Gabrielle,"Well, then it must've been a gambling problem."
Gabrielle,She never missed bingo night at Immaculate Heart-- and she was Lutheran.
Gabrielle,"Uh, I don't know. There has to be some reason. You don't fall that far that fast without making some really stupid choices."
Gabrielle,"It was Tiffany china, Carlos."
Gabrielle,"Oh, relax. I already ate dinner at home--in my box under the bridge. Fran? Oh, god. I was afraid I wouldn't find you here."
Gabrielle,"I feel bad I ducked out so fast the other day. And I've been thinking about you a lot, and I just-- I really wanna help."
Gabrielle,Now--I just wanna make sure that you're not gonna--you know--
Gabrielle,"I didn't think so. You were always so classy. 20,40,60-- Was it drugs?"
Gabrielle,Good to know. Because gambling is bad enough without being high.
Gabrielle,"Well, then what the hell happened? This doesn't make sense. I was at your house. You had such lovely things."
Gabrielle,Mark died? I didn't know.
Gabrielle,"Oh, Fran, I'm so sorry. You didn't have any family to turn to? Any friends?"
Gabrielle,"I don't agree, Fran. You know, Carlos went blind for five years. We went broke. We almost lost our house. But we worked our asses off and we made it back."
Gabrielle,"Well, no, but--"
Gabrielle,We're going to a family reunion at Aunt Connie' and I want to look my best.
Gabrielle,"Well, if your idea of a good time is sitting on rusty lawn chairs in the driveway eating lard in the shape of chicken, Then yeah! It's gonna be a blast."
Gabrielle,"Honey, you're 6 now, so I think it's time we had a little mother/daughter talk. Your father's side of the family's trash. Any questions?"
Gabrielle,"Cause that's what grown-ups do, sweetie. When we don't like someone, we don't punch them or say mean things. We just find subtle ways to make them feel bad about their lives. Ooh, like these earrings, Aunt Connie can't afford them, and that'll make her sad. And this will bring her to her knees. And this will be a kick in her throat."
Gabrielle,"Oh, no, sweetie. We have to go. They're family."
Gabrielle,"As in ""moo goo gai pan"" Chinese?"
Gabrielle,"The first time a man did something stupid, and a woman pointed it out."
Gabrielle,"Well, then you have no choice. Bite the bullet and be bitch."
Gabrielle,Isn't it just easier to shut down your hoo-ha until he gives in?
Gabrielle,"Wow, this place is looking worse than ever."
Gabrielle,Say no more.
Gabrielle,"Because all she ever does is put me down. If you'd pay attention, you'd see what I'm talking about."
Gabrielle,"No, it's not just you."
Gabrielle,Let me see your palms.
Gabrielle,Fine. Ok.
Gabrielle,"Trash don't change, sweetheart. She's up to something. Now come on, let's go grab a lawn chair before we get stuck on the grass with the fire ants."
Gabrielle,"Well, let her wait. I need something to drink. Trying to keep down one of hers world-famous tamales."
Gabrielle,Sorry. Bad heart. Floor's all yours.
Gabrielle,"Well, you know--we're still gonna be family tomorrow, so I think we should think about it overnight and search our hearts, and try to figure out which one of your homes is best for Ana."
Gabrielle,"We love you, Aunt Connie! Yeah."
Gabrielle,"What's there to talk about? You won't even let the girls get a golden retriever, and now you wanna take in a teenager?"
Gabrielle,"Well, luckily, it's a big family. Let her go live with Nina and Luis."
Gabrielle,So what's one more? They'll never know the difference.
Gabrielle,"No, I'm thinking about our children. They're so happy. Taking in a kid we don't even know? That's a huge risk."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, and knowing Aunt Connie, she's waited all these years to call that favor in. She's probably dying on purpose."
Gabrielle,She's two blocks away. She'll be here any second.
Gabrielle,Why would I be nervous?
Gabrielle,"Well, I didn't say I wasn't sedated."
Gabrielle,"Yeah, when I think about everything that little girl's been through--her dad walked out, her mother's in jail, the way she bounced from relative to relative--I just want this to be the end of the line for her."
Gabrielle,"Oh, I doubt it. You haven't seen her since she was 6."
Gabrielle,Brought you a laundry basket. You need me to show you how to use the washer? It's my clever way of saying you're gonna be doing your own laundry.
Gabrielle,"You know, the girls have chores, too. It's how we teach 'em responsibility. Speaking of which, uh--curfew's 10:00, 11:00 on weekends. Does that seem reasonable?"
Gabrielle,This teenager thing isn't so bad.
Gabrielle,"Oh, well, not to push my luck, but I was thinking you could sweep the front porch and take care of the guest bathroom."
Gabrielle,"Oh, that's a pretty dress. Oh, my god, it's Versace!"
Gabrielle,"""All right""? Young lady, if you live under my roof, you will not disparage Versace."
Gabrielle,"No, I'm just kidding. it was a joke."
Gabrielle,Vera Wang! Where are you getting all these dresses?
Gabrielle,Boyfriends? How many do you have?
Gabrielle,"Yeah, the economy has hit us all. So--what kind of boyfriends can afford things like this?"
Gabrielle,"And so-- they give you designer clothes, and you give them--"
Gabrielle,"Yeah. Okay, well--don't take this the wrong way, but that's not exactly from the Versace virgin line."
Gabrielle,"Uh-huh, and how long do you think that will last?"
Gabrielle,Ha. Funny.
Gabrielle,"And if you don't mind, will you make sure Juanita and Celia do their chores, too?"
Gabrielle,"All right, I'll see you inside."
Gabrielle,"Oh, my god. Ana, the houses so clean."
Gabrielle,"Well, how did you get everything down so quickly?"
Gabrielle,"Okay, boys, thanks for your hard work, but maybe it's time to go home and take a shower--preferably a cold one."
Gabrielle,All right.
Gabrielle,Did she?
Gabrielle,"Uh, okay, Juanita, go to your room. And don't come out until you're 18."
Gabrielle,"Ana, the whole point of chores is that you do them. You don't bat your eyes and call rent-a-horny-kid."
Gabrielle,"I care about the message it sends to my little girls, and I'm starting to care a little bit about your tone."
Gabrielle,"And the teenager has finally arrived. Ana, listen. We want you to be part of this family. We will love you and support you and take care of you, but in exchange, you will show us a little bit of respect and obey our rules, which means doing your own chores, no boys in the house and no more gifts from men."
Gabrielle,Of what?
Gabrielle,"You wanna see crazy? Make one more statement like that, and I am throwing your ass out on the street. You care to test me?"
Gabrielle ,Just get here as fast as you can
Gabrielle ,She turned me in.
Gabrielle ,Welcome home.
Gabrielle ,Hey.
Gabrielle ,"If you say, a grandchild, so help me, God!"
Gabrielle ,"Oh no, I'm just at the grocery store wondering if I should buy a ticket. Thanks a bunch, Mr. Hartley. So what time should I bring Carlos to the DA's office tomorrow? Great."
Gabrielle ,"Boy, with all this passion, isn't it too bad we're not having sex?"
Gabrielle ,What? That the card was cancelled by my lover's mommy?
Gabrielle ,So let me get this straight. You play tennis. You know wine. And you speak mandarin. Does every other man in the world want you dead?
Gabrielle ,Son of a bitch!!!
Gabrielle ,"Forgive me,Father, for I have sinned."
Gabrielle ,"Well, now, this I can work with."
Gabrielle ,Can we object to that?
Gabrielle ,"God, no!"
Gabrielle ,"Ah, get the camera, get the camera!"
Lynette,"Hey, it's Lynette. I know you're down about this Mike thing, but you got to come to poker. It'll be worth it. I got dirt on Maisy Gibbons."
Lynette,Touch every inch of your body until you're trembling.
Lynette,"Hey, hey, hey, hey!"
Lynette,"Stop it, stop it, stop it. Stop it."
Lynette,"No, you are going to behave today. I am not going to be humiliated in front of the entire neighborhood. And, just so you know how serious I am--"
Lynette,Santa's cell-phone number.
Lynette,"I know someone, who knows someone, who knows an elf. And if anyone of you acts up, so help me, I will call Santa and tell him you want socks for Christmas. You willing to risk that?"
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,Let's get this over with.
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,Please tell me you punched him.
Lynette,Even the limp ones aren't that ethical.
Lynette,"Oh, please, the man's gotten me pregnant three times in four years. I wish he was having sex with someone else."
Lynette,"Ow! Ease up, you little vampire."
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,What are you doing!? We are at a wake!
Lynette,I said you could go by the pool. Do you have your swimsuits on??
Lynette,"You three planned this?? Alright, that's it. Get out!"
Lynette,No? I am your mother. You have to do what I say. Come on.
Lynette,Here.
Lynette,"Get out. Or I will get in this pool and just grab you, get out! Get over here. Get over here. Get back or I'll kill you."
Lynette,"That's right, get over here. Go, go, go, ugh. Move it. Out. Get out."
Lynette,"Paul. We have to leave now. Once again, I am so sorry for your loss. Go!"
Lynette,"Tom, this is my 5th message and you still haven't called me back. Well, you must be having a lot of fun on your business trip. I can only imagine. Well, guess what, the kids and I wanna have some fun too, so unless you call me back by noon, we are getting on a plane and joining you."
Lynette,"Not now, honey, Mommy's threatening Daddy."
Lynette,Where're your brothers?
Lynette,"Natalie Klein, I don't believe it!"
Lynette,"Years! Uh, how are you, how's the firm?"
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,"Yeah, well."
Lynette,"Well, to be honest--"
Lynette,It's the best job I've ever had.
Lynette,Now what.
Lynette,"Hey, yeah!"
Lynette,I wasn't expecting you for a week!
Lynette,Yeah! It's been a little rough!
Lynette,"Oh my god, oh my, oh!"
Lynette,"Ooh, you gotta be kidding! I'm exhausted! I look terrible, I'm covered in peaches!"
Lynette,"Well, is it ok if I just lie here?"
Lynette,I love you.
Lynette,"Oh wait, I gotta tell you, I was having trouble with swelling, so the doctor took me off the pill, so you're just gonna have to put on a condom."
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,Let's risk it?
Lynette,Ooh!
Lynette,She was having sex with some guy when the fire started.
Lynette,"He got smoke inhalation, he's at the hospital."
Lynette,Absolutely. She'll get through this. She'll find a way to survive.
Lynette,To Mary Alice.
Lynette,Let's get this show on the road.
Lynette,What're you doing? That's private.
Lynette,"I don't know, but check out the postmark."
Lynette,"That would be fun. Paul, we have proof your wife killed herself over some deep dark secret. Another ??"
Lynette,Maybe it's just some sort of sick joke.
Lynette,Let's say we do. There's a chance we're not gonna like what we find.
Lynette,"Boys, guys, I'm begging you, sit in your seats. I'm not gonna tell you again! Buckle up! I mean it, so help me, I'll-"
Lynette,I have a theory.
Lynette,"I yelled at them. They never listen to me, it's very frustrating."
Lynette,You saying I'm a bad mother?
Lynette,"I have no help, my husband's always away on business."
Lynette,My babysitter joined the witness relocation program. I haven't slept through the night in 6 years.
Lynette,"And for you to stand there, and judge me."
Lynette,I accept your apology.
Lynette,"Here's, uh, here's what I pulled for Edie. I should warn you, most of the clothes in there aren't that stylish."
Lynette,"Listen, I was just getting dinner ready."
Lynette,"No, no."
Lynette,"Yeah, the boys were acting up in the car, I couldn't get them to sit down."
Lynette,"I try everything. I scream, I threaten, I reason, I beg, nothing works. I don't know if it's because they're too young and they don't understand, or if they're just getting some perverse joy out of testing me!"
Lynette,You're kidding.
Lynette,"Mrs. Huber, I could never leave my kids by the side of the road."
Lynette,"Well, like I said, I should go back and get dinner ready."
Lynette,Goodbye.
Lynette,"Boys, I am not gonna tell you again, sit. I mean it, I am serious. You guys are gonna be in so much trouble if you don't sit back in those seats."
Lynette,"Out. Can't behave, you heard me, can't ride. You, out. Move it."
Lynette,"Okay. Uh. Oh! Uhh. I'll be right back, Mommy'll be right back."
Lynette,"Boys? Boys? Boys?? If you're hiding, you've gotta stop now cause Mommy doesn't think it's funny!"
Lynette,"Oh! Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm looking for my boys. Three boys with red hair, have you seen 'em?"
Lynette,"I know, I was just trying to scare them into behaving. Did you see where they went?"
Lynette,"I have 4 kids under the age of six, I absolutely have anger management issues."
Lynette,"I-I-I didn't abandon them, I came back!"
Lynette,"Well, my kids aren't normal, and now I don't have time for this, lady, so. Boys! Get out here."
Lynette,Oh. Get in the car.
Lynette,"Well, bring 'em, we're leaving."
Lynette,"Oh, I don't think so. Oh!"
Lynette,"Let go of me! What's the matter with you? Run, boys, run!"
Lynette,"Oh, crap."
Lynette,"Boys, you're gonna need to put on your-"
Lynette,"If any of you acts up, I will call Santa and tell him you want socks for Christmas."
Lynette,Just give me a second-5 minutes.
Lynette,I know. Preston used the three of diamonds to scoop jam out of the jar.
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,"Hey! I know, our dinner."
Lynette,"We didn't exactly forget, it's just usually when the hostess dies, the party's off."
Lynette,"I'm not being flip, I'm just pointing out a reality."
Lynette,I'm in.
Lynette,I'm still in.
Lynette,"Yeah, it'll be fun. Bree's cooking, everyone's coming."
Lynette,"Oh. Tom. There'll be liquor. And hors d'oeuvres. And grown-ups without children. And, and silverware. Remember silverware?"
Lynette,Have you heard anything I just said?
Lynette,I already got a sitter.
Lynette,I was looking so forward to a night out.
Lynette,So did Mike say anything?
Lynette,"I'm sure it's not that bad. He's coming to the party, right?"
Lynette,"You know what, it's not gonna change until you resolve your issues with that man."
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,Honey. Get a pet. See ya. Son of a-?
Lynette,It's a frat party.
Lynette,"Margarita, cigar, sombrero."
Lynette,"No! But when I say, we've been invited to a party, don't whine about your exhausting 60-hour week. Put on your dancing shoes, and take the mother of your children out for a good time."
Lynette,"Can't, I already cancelled the sitter."
Lynette,"Throw a dinner party? I don't even have time to wash my face. No, you know what? I'm gonna go to this one. You can stay home and babysit the kids."
Lynette,"The boys will be hungry at 5:30, so put the fish sticks in the toaster oven at 5 o' clock-"
Lynette,"Well, if the food's late, god help you."
Lynette,"Preston, would you come here?"
Lynette,"Sweetie, you know our rule about eating cookies, right?"
Lynette,"Yeah, but tonight, anything goes. Make sure you share with your brothers."
Lynette,"The kids are bouncing off the walls?Huh. Well I'm sure you can find a way to put them to bed, Tom. I mean, for god's sakes, Tom, they're just kids."
Lynette,I think I can top that. Try getting thrown out of Disneyland for lewd behaviour.
Lynette,"When Tom and I were first married, things got a little out of hand on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride."
Lynette,"No, we got perp-walked down Main Street USA."
Lynette,How was your night?
Lynette,Oh. Didn't have a good time?
Lynette,Oooh. Who cracked anyway?
Lynette,"Well, there was dinner, but it wasn't much of a party."
Lynette,"I don't know. Rex announced that he and Bree are in counselling. She retaliated with this whole revelation which I won't even go into now. And the bottom line is, he stormed out. Clearly there's trouble in paradise."
Lynette,Why not?
Lynette,Are we happy?
Lynette,You're wearing a really big hat.
Lynette,By reliving your night out with the guys?
Lynette,You look-ridiculous in that thing.
Lynette,Maybe.
Lynette,"Aww. You know, it's gonna take more than just this one night."
Lynette,Let 'em look. As long as they don't try and cut in.
Lynette,I have a theory.
Lynette,How in the world did they?
Lynette,"Well, the little girl."
Lynette,Why didn't she say anything?
Lynette,"Well, obviously they will be punished for this. Severely."
Lynette,"They don't have attention-deficit disorder, and I'm not going to drug my boys just to make your job easier. I'd rather change teachers."
Lynette,What if we separate the twins? Put them in different classes? They're much calmer when they're not bouncing off one another.
Lynette,Are you sure? He's gonna freak.
Lynette,Malignant?
Lynette,"Hi, I got your message. What's going on?"
Lynette,They refused? They're six years old.Make them.
Lynette,Fine.
Lynette,Oh.. which one goes and which one stays?
Lynette,I used to run a company with 85 people and now I can't wrangle three small boys without doping them. Talk about feeling like a failure.
Lynette,"Thank you. That's the nicest way you could have said that. you know, the truth is, when they're not making me want to pull my hair out they're really, really sweet. I'm afraid that if I change the bad stuff, I'm going to change the good stuff."
Lynette,"Like this mug , I love this mug. If I medicate them, are they still going to make me a mug like this?"
Lynette,"Yeah, I know."
Lynette,It seems there may be more to Mary Alice's death than you were aware of .
Lynette,"Hey Paul, what's up?"
Lynette,Why? We unloaded a lot on you.
Lynette,Troubled?
Lynette,"Paul, I'm so sorry."
Lynette,"Of course, of course."
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,So do I.
Lynette,"Boys, will you come in here please?"
Lynette,We'll talk about that later. Right now I need you to take some medicine.
Lynette,Not exactly. This is a special kind of medicine.
Lynette,"It's like a vitamin, and you'll take one everyday."
Lynette,Stay right there.
Lynette,Now open up.
Lynette,"Here, you."
Lynette,"Guys, this isn't-"
Lynette,"Not in so many words, but everything Paul said certainly made it seem like she was schizophrenic."
Lynette,Mary Alice was not crazy.
Lynette,Boys! Stop it! Go to bed.
Lynette,"Well,at least go upstairs.."
Lynette,"GO!GO, GO!"
Lynette,I really do appreciate you guys staying and helping.
Lynette,"That's nice of you. And since we're talking about it, there's something else nice I'd like you to do. Your kids both went to Barcliff Academy, didn't they?"
Lynette,We need you to recommend Porter and Preston. We can't even get an interview.
Lynette,"Yes, you can tell them how beautifully behaved the boys are."
Lynette,Yeah. I thought that was understood.
Lynette,"Yes, but by the time they realise their mistake we'll be in."
Lynette,You're not having any more kids. What do you care?
Lynette,It really doesn't.
Lynette,That's the second time this week. They never used to fight like that when Mary Alice was alive.
Lynette,"Oh,that sounds great."
Lynette,Yes. Completely identical. You can't tell them apart. They're like bookends.
Lynette,"The boys are fascinating. They even have their own twin secret language, don't they,Tom?"
Lynette,It's not really so much scary as highly developed.
Lynette,"Sorry, Tom, Mr Lenz was trying to say something. Mr Lenz?"
Lynette,Thank you so much.
Lynette,What is a must-meet list?
Lynette,Ooo-observation?
Lynette,That's wonderful.
Lynette,Boys? Wake up.
Lynette,You're going to have some fun today.
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,C'on! I got you beat!
Lynette,"Yes, yes, come on!"
Lynette,I can still see your heads. The pool's not deep enough.
Lynette,They're always a little shy at first.
Lynette,Look at that concentration. Porter loves his puzzles.
Lynette,So he just blew you off?
Lynette,"Well,did you bat your eyes? You know, it doesn't work if you don't bat your eyes."
Lynette,"Oh,thanks."
Lynette,UmGophers.
Lynette,"Listen, I'm sorry about Mike. I know how much you like him."
Lynette,There has been flirting.
Lynette,"But to be fair, that is part of your charm."
Lynette,You think Mike is a Carl in disguise?
Lynette,Apparently we're in competition with one other family. A generous donation will ensure our kids beat them out.
Lynette,Fifteen thousand.
Lynette,And that's what I told them.
Lynette,We're not moving.
Lynette,I know you did not just say that.
Lynette,They won't make it to their later years if I have to spend all day with them.
Lynette,Why don't we just put them back in me and cook them until they're civilised?
Lynette,"Boys,could you stop?"
Lynette,"Oh,thank you."
Lynette,"Yeah. It gave me some good ideas. Well, one, anyway."
Lynette,"Well, you know how we both agree that one of us needs to stay home and parent the kids and one of us needs to go off and make a living. And then I suddenly remembered, when I was working I made a little more than you."
Lynette,"You tossed out that little Sacrifice comment a while ago and it occurred to me,I've made sacrifices over the past six years. I gave up my career! If another sacrifice has to be made, I think it's your turn on the merry-go-round."
Lynette,"So if I went back to work, then you could stay home and take care of the kids."
Lynette,Ah-ha!
Lynette,"Aye, aye."
Lynette,I'm not surprised that he's playing it close to the vest. Paul knows we're on to him.
Lynette,"I'm sorry, I thought you were kidding."
Lynette,"Oh, okay."
Lynette,"I'm sorry, aren't we doing Little Red Riding Hood?"
Lynette,"So then you are aware that the wolf is a bad guy. He eats Little Red's grandma. If you let him go, he's just going to chow down on another defenseless old lady."
Lynette,I'm Lynette Scavo. My twins just joined. They're playing oak trees.
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,Sure. Whatever.
Lynette,"All right. I think everyone is down for a nap. We've got no more than an hour. Let's get cracking. Five car draw, nothing wild."
Lynette,Might I suggest the Barcliffe Academy production of Little Red Riding Hood?
Lynette,"Sure, they get to play oak trees. I'm the one who has to deal with all the drama behind the scenes."
Lynette,She's a total nightmare. I guess I shouldn't have challenged her.
Lynette,Because now no one on the play committee even wants to talk to me.
Lynette,"That would have never happened in Boy Scouts. When I worked, mostly with men, I preferred the way they fought. A guy takes his opponent on, face to face, and once he's won, he's top dog. It's primitive, but it's fair."
Lynette,"It's science, Gabrielle.Sociologists have documented this stuff."
Lynette,I hate playing three handed poker. Let's take a break.
Lynette,Why not? Fifty cents a bet?
Lynette,"Um, ladies. We all grew up with Little Red Riding Hood, and we survived it, scary stuff and all, so I say, to hell with political correctness, let our kids experience this classic like it was meant to be enjoyed. Let's kill the damn wolf, and just put on the best show we can."
Lynette,"Well, that's what's so great about being in a democracy. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. Also, everyone has a right to vote. So all in favor of the woodsman going medieval on the big bad wolf's ass--"
Lynette,"Oh, yeah, huh, it was a creative call. Look, I'm in the middle of a costume crisis, and if I don't take a few shortcuts, I'll never finish."
Lynette,My boys are the oak trees.
Lynette,I'll finish the costumes.
Lynette,"Bree, I totally understand. Yeah, I already tried Susan. And Gabby can't sew to save her life but seriously, I'm going to be fine. But thanks anyway. Bye!"
Lynette,"Oh Jordana, you are really a lifesaver, thank you. Here, these pieces need trim."
Lynette,"You're not human, are you? You were sent by aliens to make the human race feel inadequate."
Lynette,"Seriously, how, how do you cram it all in?"
Lynette,"Um, sure."
Lynette,"That's ADD medication. My kids take this, or they almost did. I thought it was supposed to calm you down."
Lynette,"Seriously, you're taking your kids medication?"
Lynette,"Oh, that's very kind of you, but I just smoked some crack a little while ago, so I better not mix."
Lynette,"Jordana, Maisy, here are the costumes, right on time."
Lynette,"Uh-huh. Ah, incidentally, who is 'they', as in 'they forgot to tell the printer'?"
Lynette,"Well, these things happen. Oh, I'll be right back."
Lynette,"Okay, lady, that's it!"
Lynette,"Maisy, we have kids the same age, which means there are years ahead of us, having to deal with each other. So instead of playing all these petty games, why don't we put an end to this right now."
Lynette,Let's take it outside.
Lynette,Your sorry ass. We're throwing down.
Lynette,"Just being practical. Isn't it better to settle this once and for all, rather than endure all this alpha mom crap until our kids graduate? Hmmm? Come on! I'll even let you take the first shot."
Lynette,"Yeah, I didn't think so. And just so you know, next spring when we do Bambi, his mother is going to take a slug to the heart, and you're going to like it!"
Lynette,How do you cram it all in?
Lynette,I thought the character of Madame Bovary was -- very inspirational.
Lynette,Really?
Lynette,I stopped after page 50.
Lynette,Did he say anything about his mother's suicide?
Lynette,That's the mystery part.
Lynette,So somebody found out Mary Alice's secret--
Lynette,Thanks.
Lynette,Great! You wanna run it by me?
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,Yeah?
Lynette,And when exactly would this formal dinner take place?
Lynette,Tom
Lynette,You think? How am I supposed to pull off a formal dinner with no warning?
Lynette,What did you say?
Lynette,"No, no. Let's, let's do it."
Lynette,"Yeah, it's good for your career. I'll pull it off."
Lynette,"Hey, Jordana!"
Lynette,"Actually, I'm getting ready for a dinner party tomorrow night. Six people."
Lynette,"Big fun. Say, you wouldn't have any of your kids ADD medication that you could spare just to get me over the hump?"
Lynette,"Yeah, that's exciting. I wish my sister would visit more often."
Lynette,"Yeah. Just three or four pills, I'm really hitting a wall here."
Lynette,"I'm not going to forget about this, Jordana."
Lynette,"It means come Girl Scout Cookie time, don't bother bringing little Tina, because we won't be home!"
Lynette,"Great, this will keep the crab dip warm. It took forever to shell the little buggers, but it'll be worth it."
Lynette,"Oh, I'm fine. I just need some coffee."" ""Thank you."
Lynette,'Dana.' Where did this come from?
Lynette,Dana. Wow. Dana was a baby.
Lynette,I knew this play date was a good idea.
Lynette,Yep. He's a feisty one.
Lynette,"Hey, word on the street is that you've been medicating Timmy--"
Lynette,I bet--can I use your bathroom?
Lynette,"I've got it covered, no problem."
Lynette,"Oh, you know what would be even better? Dry cleaning bags."
Lynette,"No, really, hear me out. Put a big Spotless Scrub ad between a woman and her cashmere sweater, and I guarantee you'll get her attention."
Lynette,Exactly!
Lynette,"Why not? Start by targeting the top chain, then branch out from there. Boom, boom, boom. Mass saturation. Oh, and you know what else would be a great idea? Here's the thing --"
Lynette,I was just participating.
Lynette,"Well, maybe you need better ideas. I'm sorry-I'm sorry, I didn't mean that."
Lynette,That is not fair!
Lynette,"Tom, I am sorry about tonight. Truly, but these days, if I'm competing with anyone, it's the Bree Van de Kamps of the world with their spotless kitchens, and their perfect kids, who throw fabulous parties where nothing ever goes wrong. I try so hard to keep up, but I can't."
Lynette,"And when you work on a pitch, or you bring the partners over, I am reminded of a world I left behind where I was the winner, and people tried to keep up with me! I can't go back. I can't win where I am. I'm stuck in the middle, and it is really starting to get to me."
Lynette,"Yeah, well."
Lynette,"No, they don't."
Lynette,Thanks.
Lynette,"Nothing, I'm tired."
Lynette,"I'm fine, really--what's going on outside?"
Lynette,How am I supposed to pull off a formal dinner with no warning?
Lynette,Woo. That stuff is strong!
Lynette,"So, has anyone been over there?"
Lynette,This is awful. Carlos must be just devastated.
Lynette,"Slow down, you jerk, this is a residential neighborhood."
Lynette,"It pisses me off. I've got four kids, you know. I was up all night reading statistics online. One out of every four traffic accidents happens on residential streets. I hope whoever hit Juanita gets put away for life."
Lynette,An innocent woman gets hit by a car and the driver just takes off? I don't think it's extreme.
Lynette,"I hope this works. My sleep cycle is totally out of whack. I'm up all night, I'm dozing off during the day."""
Lynette,"You know, you're right."
Lynette,"Boys, I can hear you out there. Now be quiet. Just sit there and color."
Lynette,"Oh, yeah. Sorry."
Lynette,"Parker! I don't know --ow!--what you think that you're doing, but put that back where it belongs!"
Lynette,I'm sorry. You were saying something about wind?
Lynette,"Oh, for the love of God!"
Lynette,"Knock it off, you little monsters."
Lynette,"Look, I'm on my last nerves, so I'm going to level with you. I've screwed up my entire system by taking my system by taking my kids'ADD medication. Yeah, that's right, you heard me. I plan to stop, but right now I need to sleep, and I need more than a few, crappy, needles, so whattya got?"
Lynette,I know you're not.
Lynette,Sure. Whatever.
Lynette,Go to hell.
Lynette,Go to hell. Go to hell. Go to hell. Go to hell. Go to hell.
Lynette,The scout meeting is today?
Lynette,"What? Oh--right! Okay, boys. This knot is called the bowline. It is a remarkably useful knot. Now, pick up your ropes. Okay. First we cross this end over here, and then we make a loop, and then another loop, and then you sort of pull it through, I'm guessing, and then, ready? Yank it taut."
Lynette,"You're never going to be a sailor, what do you care? Okay everybody, let's just take a break!"
Lynette,Thanks!
Lynette,"No, Tom, you can't do this to me. Because, I need you at home. Boys, stop it, I am on the phone. Well, yeah, I realize it's not your fault that the meeting got postponed, but you promised you'd be back tonight. I, I, I gotta go. The kids are-- Yeah, I know-- you're sorry, just, will you try to get back as soon as you can? Okay, bye."
Lynette,"Boys, would you please, please, stop it. Really, really, mommy's got a headache. Okay? Just, uh--"
Lynette,Turn that damn thing off.
Lynette,"Oh, Susan, you gotta take my kids for a while."
Lynette,"No, no, I'm sorry, I can't do this. It's just too much. Boys, you stay with your aunt Susan."
Lynette,"Then I started taking the pills because they gave me energy, but then I couldn't sleep at night, and I was getting so tired in the daytime. And, it totally messed me up. I love my kids so much. I'm so sorry they have me as a mother."
Lynette,"No, I'm not. I can't do it. I'm so tired of feeling like a failure. It's so humiliating."
Lynette,That's what's so humiliating. Other moms don't need help. Other moms make it look so easy. All I do is complain.
Lynette,"Well, we shouldn't. We should tell each other this stuff."
Lynette,"Yeah, it really does."
Lynette,I'm so tired of feeling like a failure.
Lynette,"Well, Mrs. Huber never showed up. Why don't you wear this one?"
Lynette,"That is so like you, Edie. You're always thinking of others."
Lynette,Sunscreen?
Lynette,"While you're gone, I'll be here, paying bills and sorting laundry and cooking dinner, so what part of that sounds like a vacation?"
Lynette,Then what?
Lynette,"Tom, our last version of normal had me popping pills. Normal is a bad, bad plan."
Lynette,I think we need to hire a nanny. Full time.
Lynette,"I know. And I know we can't afford it. And I know everything that's happened is my fault. But, if I don't get some help, there's an excellent chance, I will lose my mind."
Lynette,Ten. Ten! Each one more incompetent than the last. One actually asked me--here you go --if she was expected to change diapers.
Lynette,"Yeah, that's why I was hoping to take advantage of your expertise."
Lynette,All your rich friends have nannies. A-list nannies. I need to catch one--here you go--without their bosses.
Lynette,So I can poach me one.
Lynette,"Look, at my old job, we didn't wait for good people to come to us. We went out and raided other companies. I don't see why it should be different when you're hiring a nanny."
Lynette,"I'm not twisting anyone's arm. If I make a better offer, why shouldn't a qualified person reap the benefits? So come on--where can I score some high grade nanny?"
Lynette,Is this seat taken?
Lynette,"You know, I couldn't help but notice how wonderful you are with those children."
Lynette,I'm Lynette.
Lynette,"Claire? I've always loved that name. So Claire--"" ""Do you come here often?"
Lynette,So your boss made you return her underwear?
Lynette,Couldn't you have just said no?
Lynette,She sounds awful.
Lynette,"Well, if we had a nanny like you at my house, we would treat her like gold. Did I mention I have four very loveable kids?"
Lynette,"Oh, yes."
Lynette,What?
Lynette,Are you going to be here tomorrow? I want to see you again.
Lynette,I just want to talk.
Lynette,"Claire, Claire, please."
Lynette,"Well, look on the bright side, Tom's having the time of his life."
Lynette,I guess he does have a sort of dorky charm.
Lynette,You should never take this dress off for your entire life!
Lynette,"Oh, she never showed up, somebody's got to take her place."
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,--I took--
Lynette,What?
Lynette,Just give me a second.
Lynette,How can you stay here after the way she treats you?
Lynette,I would never treat you that way.
Lynette,"I will give you a 20% bump on what she is paying you, plus overtime."
Lynette,Dishes?
Lynette,How fast can you pack?
Lynette,I've got a nanny--
Lynette,"If I don't get some help, I will lose my mind.Where can I score some high-grade nanny?"
Lynette,She's a total nightmare.
Lynette,You better finish those brussel sprouts. And don't think I can't see them hidden under your macaroni.
Lynette,"Yeah? Well, brussel sprouts help you grow. You don't want to be short your whole life, do you? Here, look, you know what we'll do? We're gonna dip them in a little cheese. Here you go. Good, yummy!"
Lynette,"Fine, fine. Be three-foot-eight the rest of your life. See if I care. Good luck finding girlfriends!"
Lynette,"I'm going to cancel it. The boys are in rare form, and you're still finding your way."
Lynette,"I--don't want to--shock them, by suddenly disappearing. You know? Deep down, they're very sensitive."
Lynette,You have my cell phone number. You call me if you need anything.
Lynette,Okay. You boys. Come here and give mamma a three-bear hug.
Lynette,"Come on, one, two, three, get in, get in!"
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"I wonder what's going on over there. I mean, Claire did okay with the kids yesterday, but that could have been beginner's luck. Do you think I should call? I should call!"
Lynette,"It's just, I don't know this woman, I mean, not really. So she has a degree in sociology. Well, big deal, who doesn't? My boys are a lot to handle. What if she's not up to it?"
Lynette,Yeah. I don't really think I could videotape Claire. It would be a breach of trust.
Lynette,"So, how are things with you and Rex?"
Lynette,"Well, I'm just curious. I mean, he moves out, he moves back in. Is he back for good?"
Lynette,"So if you're not sure he's back for good, why are you ironing his shirts?"
Lynette,That's good. It's good to have faith in people.
Lynette,"All right. ""Harvey: The Flying Turtle"". Doesn't this look fun!"
Lynette,I gave her the afternoon off. Who wants to turn pages?
Lynette,"No. She's fine. I just wanted us all to spend the day together, you know, like we used to. Here we go. Once upon a time there was a young turtle named Harvey. Every day Harvey would all tell the other turtles, ""One day I'm going to fly off this island and go see the world."" The other turtles laughed and said ""Turtles can't fly."" Oh, it's getting good now, huh?"
Lynette,"Well, what's wrong?"
Lynette,"Does she, now? Okay. Harvey didn't like the turtles laughing, so he told them,"" "" I'll show you. One day I will fly higher than the birds!"
Lynette,"Yeah, well, I'm just warming up. Then Bruno, the big bad turtle took Harvey up on a cliff and threw him over, and he proclaimed,"" ""We'll see if you can fly, fly or die, fly or die!"
Lynette,No.
Lynette,"Where is she, by the way? I haven't seen her in days."
Lynette,Oh. Well. Good luck with that.
Lynette,They're with the new nanny.
Lynette,"Well, trust me, it's not all it's cracked up to be. You know, our mothers were smart. They didn't get us nannies or put us in day care, because they knew, if they did, we'd find out - there are other women out there who were better mothers than they were!"
Lynette,You had a nanny?
Lynette,Oh! Sorry.
Lynette,Really.
Lynette,Huh.
Lynette,Bye.
Lynette,Hi.
Lynette,"Yep. Um, I'll be home late, so just the usual routine. A nap for Penny, and-"
Lynette,"You're the best. Oh, one more thing. Since the boys are having corn dogs for dinner, I'd like you to make sure they get a vegetable to go with it."
Lynette,They're full of iron. Could you make sure they clean their plates?
Lynette,You sly dog.
Lynette,"Bye, guys!"
Lynette,"I don't know how she did it, but Edie managed to make this all about her."
Lynette,She's bringing him home from the hospital today.
Lynette,"I know. The way she was talking about Mrs. Huber, it was like she was already dead."
Lynette,"You know, if we're going to buy a water heater, we should talk about it. We could go to the mall tomorrow. They're having a sale."
Lynette,"Well, I'm just trying to plan my day."
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,Hon?
Lynette,Did you set up the coffee maker?
Lynette,Tom--
Lynette,Tom--Come on.
Lynette,Thanks.
Lynette,"Just so you know, if we go to the mall, we can go to the shoe store. You said you wanted new running shoes."
Lynette,What?
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,Good morning.
Lynette,Want some coffee?
Lynette,About what?
Lynette,"So, Claire, when did this incident occur?"
Lynette,You don't say.
Lynette,"It's a search and rescue, not recovery. We don't know if she's dead."
Lynette,"Oh, my god!"
Lynette,"No, no! I'm sorry! False alarm. We didn't find a body. Uh, Susan just had some really good news. Sorry."
Lynette,Uh-huh. A little formal for the mall.
Lynette,"Okay. Well, you gals, um, shop your little hearts out. See you later."
Lynette,That sales girl that sold us the water heater - she had a cute figure.
Lynette,"Oh, how can you say, she was so your type, big breasts, really curvy."
Lynette,"Nothing. I'm just saying you prefer women that are really curvy, like that sales girl or Claire."
Lynette,"Aww--You kiss as though that would end this conversation, and it so won't."
Lynette,The only reason you made love to me the other night was because you had just seen Claire naked.
Lynette,You and I have had crushes before. We always tell each other. We laugh about it. It's no big deal. What worries me about this is you're denying you're obviously attracted. Why?
Lynette,"Oh, so you are attracted to her."
Lynette,"We are not going anywhere until you confess you have the hots for our nanny. Tom, it's okay. She's attractive. Men by nature are drawn to fertile young women with whom them can plant their seed."
Lynette,It's the basic flaw of your gender. I get it. Just do me the honor of-
Lynette,My husband won't admit that he has lust in his heart. Can you give us a minute?
Lynette,Parker's getting sniffily.
Lynette,"He doesn't have a cough yet, but he sort of has this post-nasal drip thing happening."
Lynette,"Hi, I understand your agency handles nannies. Uh, I need someone experienced and preferably unattractive."
Lynette,"Here, blow. Good, all right. Come on, it's going to be fun. Follow me."
Lynette,I'm here for the 10 a.m. yoga meditation class.
Lynette,"Yeah, I noticed that, but every time I come here, it's full."
Lynette,"Uh, Lauren? I'm a mother of four. Today I had to get up at five, make lunches, make breakfast, drop the twins off at school, and get across town lugging a baby and a sick child. Telling me to plan ahead is like telling me to sprout wings. And it's things like being told to plan ahead that make me so crazy, that yoga is the only thing that relaxes me, except I show up here, and I can't get in, and you tell me to plan ahead. It's a vicious cycle. See how that works?"
Lynette,"I hope someday, you have lots of children."
Lynette,"Hello? Oh, hey, Susan. Listen, I can't talk, I'm in the middle of something here. What?"
Lynette,"Okay, boys."
Lynette,"You see this gum? If you promise to be quiet while I am downstairs playing cards, it's all yours. Deal?"
Lynette,"Yeah, okay. That's what I like to hear."
Lynette,I remember talking to her right before she disappeared.
Lynette,"Oh, actually, she yelled at me for not bringing my garbage cans in."
Lynette,Edie!
Lynette,Hi. Come on in.
Lynette,Yeah. Tuesday's poker day.
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,That's so sweet.
Lynette,I wish I would have known earlier. I would have arranged a sitter.
Lynette,"Okay, Mommy's friends are gone now and you can -"
Lynette,"Well, yeah, I know it hurts, but that's what you get when you let your brothers put bubble gum in your hair. Pain and misery."
Lynette,Yes! Yes! I am mad at you.
Lynette,"And I'm also cranky. You know how you get when you haven't taken a nap? Well, mommies are the same way. We need our down time, and if we don't get it -"
Lynette,"- sorry, we end saying and doing things which we don't normally do."
Lynette,"And it's frustrating for me too, 'cause I do want to be the best mommy I can be."
Lynette,"Oh. That's sweet of you, but it's not exactly true."
Lynette,We're here! Woo! Ten minutes early! Sign me up?
Lynette,"No! No! I, I planned ahead."
Lynette,"We're, we're ten minutes early."
Lynette,What?
Lynette,"Uh, it kind of snuck up on us."
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,"No, you see, here's the thing -"
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"Hi, sorry."
Lynette,"I'm just picking up my sick poor little baby boy. All right, here."
Lynette,"Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey, Lauren! Hi. We had a really rough morning."
Lynette,"Ah. That was the best class ever. You can just terrific, thank you."
Lynette,Hi!
Lynette,"Oh, really? Why?"
Lynette,Sure.
Lynette,No! you're not dying! People just think that because I shaved your head.
Lynette,"Sorry."" ""Excuse me."
Lynette,"--okay, your 30 seconds is up now. Get back here, get back here, get back here. I want the toys picked up. How many times do I have to tell you, pick up your toys! You want a spanking? Is that what you want?"
Lynette,"Porter, don't you dare look at me like that. I will wipe that smirk right off your face. And don't think that I won't--"
Lynette,"You can do this, all right? Just, just scootch down a few inches, and I'll grab you."
Lynette,"I'm not gonna drop you. I might strangle you for climbing up here in the first place. But drop you, no. Come on!"
Lynette,Okay. Just wait.
Lynette,"Hey, Rodney!"
Lynette,Yep.
Lynette,"Yeah, I'm gonna get right on that."
Lynette,I'm so happy to see you. It's such a shame that Alison couldn't make it.
Lynette,Don't take it personally. He's scared to climb down.
Lynette,"Uh, yeah, sure, knock yourself out! Be careful."
Lynette,Are you okay?
Lynette,Sexism.
Lynette,"In the future, checklist means 'is it in the car' not like, 'do you remember', okay?"
Lynette,Hi.
Lynette,"Oh, Parker, um, forgot his catcher's mitt."
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,"Uh, it's nice to meet you."
Lynette,Thank you.
Lynette,"Well, um, we don't want to be late for the game. Nice to meet you!"
Lynette,Where are you going?
Lynette,"You know, the house isn't that big, Rodney. You're going to have to stop avoiding me."
Lynette,"Well, for starters, you can wipe that disgusting smirk off your face."
Lynette,How could you do something like this to Alison?
Lynette,It's not complicated. It's completely irresponsible.
Lynette,But your take on this is you're the victim?
Lynette,We're not done here.
Lynette,Yeah--
Lynette,Because I kicked him out of the house.
Lynette,Hold on. I made you a drink.
Lynette,"Yesterday, I came home, and I walked in on your dad with a woman. He's having an affair. I am so, so sorry. I know. Are you okay?"
Lynette,That's it?
Lynette,"I just, I expected a bigger reaction. I've been sitting here with knots in my stomach."
Lynette,You knew about this?
Lynette,"Impressed? Impressed? I-Tom, please, please don't tell me you're all right with this!"
Lynette,"No, he should never have been with her in the first place!"
Lynette,I seriously doubt that.
Lynette,That man is not coming back in this house.
Lynette,"No, he's not."
Lynette,"So here's the thing, I feel really awful about how I acted before."
Lynette,"I overreacted, I know. I'm sorry."
Lynette,"You're right. You're right. I guess I just got so upset because - oh, whatever, let's not beat a dead horse, it's over, I'm sorry, good night."
Lynette,"Well, you knew your father was having an affair, and it didn't seem to bother you that much. And that worries me, because if you can find it in you to condone something like that, then what's gonna happen when you've been on the road for forty years?"
Lynette,"I know, of course. You're not your father."
Lynette,"And just so we're absolutely clear, I am definitely not your mother, because if you ever betray me, I will leave you. I will take the kids, and I will walk out that door, and you will never see any of us again."
Lynette,Glad to get that off my chest. Thank you.
Lynette,I love you!
Lynette,Where did you guys get this pot?
Lynette,"Really? I love it. Well, this is the nicest present you boys had ever given me, and you know what? I'm gonna put it out on the front porch so the whole neighborhood can enjoy it"
Lynette,"Mrs. McCluskey, why are you taking my flower pot?"
Lynette,"No, no, no. My sons made that for me for Valentine's Day."
Lynette,So this is it! This is the secret that Mary Alice was trying to protect
Lynette,That's a good point.
Lynette,You're capable of doing all sorts of things.
Lynette,Boys! Get your little fannies inside. Guys?
Lynette,"Too late, you stole and then you lied. Even worse? You made me look bad in front of Mrs. McCluskey, who you know is mommy's sworn enemy. Time to pick your poison. How 'bout a belt? It's a classic."
Lynette,"Well, we could go with the old hickory stick. It's a clich��_��_, but it's pretty effective. I know, we'll go with the spatula. The holes give it less wind resistance. Moves faster."
Lynette,"Guys, guys, guys, hey, my hands are tied. Thieves get spanked. Just the way it works. Unless--"
Lynette,"For a first time offense, if you swear, cross your heart, that you will never, never steal again, and you write Mrs. McCluskey a letter of apology, I will let it slide."
Lynette,"All right, start with 'Dear Mrs. McCluskey.'"
Lynette,Do you know what physiological warfare means?
Lynette,"Well, too bad for you. Okay, start with a big em, little c. Good."
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,"Hey, what do you think you are doing? Get out of here."
Lynette,What?
Lynette,"Are you sure you didn't misplace it? You're getting up there in years, no offense, but you probably forget where you put things."
Lynette,"Look, my boys do not break into people's houses. Sure, they may have stolen your flower pot, but you know they apologized for that."
Lynette,You know what? This has been fun but now -
Lynette,Get out of my house!
Lynette,Nobody in my family knows or cares where your stupid clock is.
Lynette,"No, don't you dare. We'll move it when you say please."
Lynette,Think so?
Lynette,"I need to know if my policy covers it. No, my car actually wasn't involved. It was my neighbor's car, but the egg was mine. Uh huh. Can I please speak to your supervisor?"
Lynette,What?
Lynette,I'm not going over there.
Lynette,"No. I can deal with the humiliation of going around the neighborhood returning everything the boys stole, but please don't make me apologize to that woman."
Lynette,"But why do I have to apologize? Why don't we just go: ""Oh, now we're even"" and we'll start from scratch."
Lynette,"If our house catches fire I guarantee you, she's the one that started it."
Lynette,"Fine, I'll do it."
Lynette,You know whoever came up with the motto love thy neighbor clearly lived nowhere near Karen McCluskey.
Lynette,"Really, I, I recall no such motto."
Lynette,The boys have something they'd like to say to you.
Lynette,No. I'll just wait out here.
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,Um--
Lynette,"My kids have been on kind of a thieving jag, stealing stuff from around the neighborhood."
Lynette,"I know, they've being punished. Probably for life. But I needed you to see something. They said they stole it from Mike's garage. From inside his work bench. Your Mike."
Lynette,Read the engraving.
Lynette,I don't know.
Lynette,I don't know.
Lynette,I needed you to see something.They said they stole it from Mike's garage.
Lynette,"Well, I wouldn't put it past them."
Lynette,"Honestly, I don't think Mike did it either, but if we don't call, we're guilty of withholding evidence."
Lynette,It was a murder.
Lynette,How was your day?
Lynette,"Oh, Tom, I'm so sorry."
Lynette,I thought you liked Tim Doogan.
Lynette,"Well, did you tell Mr. Peterson that you wanted the job?"
Lynette,I'm not saying to beg. You just have to step up from time to time. You have to see your opportunity and take it. Nobody respects a shrinking violet.
Lynette,"Well, whatever works for ya."
Lynette,Hey! Don't look so glum. You're gonna get a hit.
Lynette,I forgot how much fun you are when you're bitter.
Lynette,Tom--
Lynette,"Oh, my God."
Lynette,"Hi. So, what's the word on Tim?"
Lynette,Thank god.
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,What?
Lynette,You're going after Tim Doogan's promotion?
Lynette,You called your boss a fool?
Lynette,Oh my -- what? What? The whole west coast? I thought you were going after an in-house position.
Lynette,"No. No, you didn't."
Lynette,"More travel? Tom, you're barely here half the time as it is. Now you're going to have -- what, twice the work load?"
Lynette,"I'm sorry, but you should have consulted me."
Lynette,I thought this was an in-house position.
Lynette,"Look, wait, wait. I know what this means to you."
Lynette,"So was mine, but I'm here, aren't I?"
Lynette,"Oh, we went out for burgers and the boys knew you wouldn't be home till after, um, bedtime so we decided to pop in and visit the new VP"
Lynette,"Yep, it's all about the window."
Lynette,"Oh, you know it."
Lynette,Sure.
Lynette,Really?
Lynette,"Yeah, he certainly did."
Lynette,"Well, it's great, obviously. Thank you."
Lynette,"Of course, I mean, I will miss him being gone all the time. He'll be bringing in more money, but he is gonna miss the birthdays, baseball games, first steps. That's the trade-off, right? I just hope one day Tom doesn't look back and regret being gone so much. I better get out there before they break something."
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,Long.
Lynette,Really?
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,"Yeah, of course."
Lynette,"Look, you're gonna make vice president one of these days."
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,I'll be right back.
Lynette,"Hey, guys. What's going on?"
Lynette,Head lice.
Lynette,"Hey, guys, over here."
Lynette,"I, um, excuse me."
Lynette,"Stop scratching. Stop scratching. Now, now, stop it. Guys, let's go, okay? Stop scratching. I mean it. Stop, stop."
Lynette,Hey. See you later.
Lynette,"Aah, aah, aah."
Lynette,"Yeah, here. See? It's this little white thing. Look. It looks like a --"
Lynette,"Aw, jeez. It looks like a sesame seed."
Lynette,"Yeah, well, there's lots more where that came from."
Lynette,What'd Tammy want?
Lynette,"Measles, huh?"
Lynette,Tammy Brennan spent a fortune on Topher's party. She'd call in specialists from Switzerland before she'd let it be canceled.
Lynette,"Because she saw Porter scratching his head at school. They all did, and now word's getting around."
Lynette,"Well, it is for the rich bee-eye-tee-see-atch's--"
Lynette,#NAME?
Lynette,"It's been one day, and they've been disinvited to a birthday party. If rumors start flying, these boys can kiss campouts and pool parties goodbye."
Lynette,"Yeah, not so cool now, huh?"
Lynette,"Guys, we should be ashamed of ourselves for reveling in that woman's misery. That being said, Edie, please continue."
Lynette,I don't get it. I don't get who would pay Maisy for sex.
Lynette,Really.
Lynette,I'll call. Bree?
Lynette,The stakes were raised.
Lynette,I can't believe how lucky you were today.
Lynette,"Really? Wow, you're good."
Lynette,He played poker?
Lynette,Thank you.
Lynette,"Um, I'm not sure."
Lynette,Huh?
Lynette,"Okay. She's going through something, and I'm sure she'd prefer it to be private."
Lynette,"She's devastated about the breakup, and she hasn't left the house in days."
Lynette,Because it's personal. It's the kind of thing she would only want me to tell her friends.
Lynette,"Edie, if you want me to share stuff with you, you're gonna have to start being more supportive of Susan."
Lynette,"What do friends do? They call, they're sympathetic, they ask about the pain the other person is going through, and then they listen."
Lynette,Then it's good to know how to bluff.
Lynette,Nurse Abigail?
Lynette,I just wanted to tell you that the boys are now lice-free.
Lynette,"I just can't figure out how it happened. They get a bath every night. Trust me, it's the ugliest 15 minutes of the day."
Lynette,I keep thinking that maybe it was the petting zoo that I took them to last week. That llama was really iffy.
Lynette,Really?
Lynette,"I guess. Still, I can't help but feel a little guilty. After all, my kids started an entire lice outbreak."
Lynette,They didn't?
Lynette,"Oh. That is a load off my mind. Well, thank you."
Lynette,So which kid is it?
Lynette,Of course.
Lynette,"No, I don't. You're going to have to give me a name."
Lynette,"Here's the thing. Acting like parents won't assign blame is like pretending they don't keep score at pee-wee league games. It's human nature. If you don't give the moms someone to blame, they'll pick a scapegoat. I can't let my boys be the scapegoat."
Lynette,"I'm begging you. They've already been uninvited from a birthday party, a really big birthday party with a bouncy house and a hot dog stand and a clown."
Lynette,"For god's sakes, there's gonna be a magician. Tammy Brennan went all out."
Lynette,Yes.
Lynette,"Hey, Tammy."
Lynette,I see Topher's made a speedy recovery.
Lynette,"Yeah, sure, boys. Have fun."
Lynette,"Just so you know, I got Topher a set of bongo drums. I know you'll love them as much as he will."
Lynette,"No, not -- not -- not quite yet. Boys, keep bouncing. That's right. Keep bouncing. Oh, by the way, I spoke to Nurse Abigail. I know who patient zero is."
Lynette,How could you do that?
Lynette,And the best you could come up with was letting my kids take the fall?
Lynette,"Oh, please."
Lynette,That was not a smart thing to say.
Lynette,"I'm going to tell the truth to every mother out there, and then I'm gonna take back the bongos."
Lynette,"Too little, too late."
Lynette,"Well, why are you standing there? Get to it."
Lynette,"Um, hi. I, I wanted to introduce myself to your Mom. I'm Lynette Scavo."
Lynette,"Oh, I'm sorry! I thought--"
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,"Oh hi. Nice to meet you, Lily."
Lynette,My twins talk about Matt all the time. We should set up a play date.
Lynette,I'd love to.
Lynette,"Even better, let's just keep it adults."
Lynette,So what did Mike say when he gave you the letter?
Lynette,You're a better woman than me. I would have ripped that open with my teeth. Aren't you dying to know what he wrote?
Lynette,Why?
Lynette,Didn't you once say you never mix business with pleasure?
Lynette,"Why wait, why don't we just rip it up now."
Lynette,She is so opening that letter.
Lynette,"Only for first time guests. Normally you'd be having, um, chicken fingers and cartoon shaped macaroni."
Lynette,Hey. Shut up.
Lynette,"Well, Lynette loves talking about Lynette, too."
Lynette,"I don't think we should be talking about Alisa with her, so--"
Lynette,It was really nasty and he wouldn't shut up either.
Lynette,I can't believe you said we'd play tennis with them.
Lynette,"Yeah, that's great. What am I gonna do?"
Lynette,"Well, obviously she needs to be told."
Lynette,"How can I ignore this? And I quote, 'It's not like she can hear.'"
Lynette,Excuse me!
Lynette,Are you saying I can't be tactful?
Lynette,Are you saying I'm not tactful?
Lynette,What a voice.
Lynette,"Are, are we supposed to be following them?"
Lynette,That's telling him.
Lynette,Sorry. I should have mentioned that my tennis is much better than my cooking.
Lynette,That was fun. You play really well.
Lynette,What's your problem?
Lynette,She's your wife. How can you talk about her like that?
Lynette,"All right, enough. If you've got issues with your wife, tell her."
Lynette,"Yeah, well it's not working too well if you have to unload on a perfect stranger, is it? If you're unhappy in your marriage, do something, instead of just complaining, 'cause frankly, I don't want to hear it!"
Lynette,Great.
Lynette,"Thanks."" ""I'll play with you."
Lynette,"Hey, Alisa, hey Lily, how are you guys?"
Lynette,"Um, sure. Here,boys. Stay right there."
Lynette,"So, how are you?"
Lynette,What?
Lynette,Why?
Lynette,"I'm sorry, What?"
Lynette,I'm sorry but I can't understand you. You're gonna have to talk slower.
Lynette,"Well, yeah!"
Lynette,"Yes, that's not exactly what I--"
Lynette,I didn't mean that you--
Lynette,"Alisa, come here."
Lynette,Are you sure you want to be saying these things in front of your daughter?
Lynette,"Lily, we're coming back."
Lynette,"Alisa, I am so sorry if I caused a problem. I just wanted to help."
Lynette,"Well, because--"
Lynette,"No, because your husband was being a total jerk!"
Lynette,"Yes, thank you. I know what she just said."
Lynette,"Tom, am I a bad person?"
Lynette,I don't know. I guess I just have it in my head that only bad people break up marriages and offend the handicapped.
Lynette,You did. Why do I do it? This compulsion to stick my nose where it doesn't belong. I mean--
Lynette,"Yeah, a lot of good it did her."
Lynette,"Oh, please."
Lynette,That's me. Never afraid to create a scene.
Lynette,You know what I admire you for? You find a way to compliment me when you could say 'I told you so.'
Lynette,"You just signed 'I told you so', didn't you?"
Lynette,"Because I'm having drinks with friends I used to work with and they never call and if I blow them off that's it. I'm dead to them. No, I can't call Patty Binks, because she steals things. Dammit, Christy, you're thirteen years old, you've got a lot of trips to the mall ahead of you. Ok, ok, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I raised my voice, I'm calm. I'm starting to think this is about money so what is it that'll make it worth your while? A hundred? That's extortion, there's no way in hell that I'm gonna. Hello, hello?"
Lynette,Hi. Hi.
Lynette,"Oh, um, my babysitter cancelled"
Lynette,"Please hear me out, this is important. Today I have a chance to rejoin the human race for a few hours, there are actual adults waiting for me with margaritas.Look I'm in a dress, I have make up on."
Lynette,"Oh for God's sake Bree, I'm wearing panty-hose."
Lynette,"Thank you, thank you. Alright in you go."
Lynette,"Bree, thanks again for watching my boys. You sure they weren't too much to handle?"
Lynette,What do you mean Porter had less fun? I'll raise.
Lynette,"Now when you say punishment, what exactly are you talking about?"
Lynette,You spanked my son?!
Lynette,"Tom and I don't believe in hitting our kids, I thought you knew that."
Lynette,"Yeah, you're right, Bree, I've got a lot to learn about parenting. And I feel so blessed to be getting sage advice from such an impeccable mother like you. I mean your kids turned out perfect, as long as you don't count Andrew. Where is he again, hum? Some kind of, uh, boot camp for juvenile delinquents."
Lynette,The hell I'm not.
Lynette,She spanked my son. I'm not apologising.
Lynette,"So help me, if you don't back me up on this I will lose it."
Lynette,"That is not the point, you don't spank other people's children."
Lynette,"Yeah, you're damned right she did. She could've tried something else, like a time out or she could have simply threatened to spank him."
Lynette,It does work. It does work most of the time.
Lynette,My mom used to beat the hell out of my sisters and me. And I won't do it. I will not become my mother.
Lynette,-We're screwed.
Lynette,"Yeah, yeah, I'm coming. What is it? Why aren't you guys brushing your teeth? Parker, what happened?"
Lynette,"No, no. I'll fish it out later, alright.? You're off the hook for tonight, but not you two so start brushing. Preston did you not hear me? I said start brushing your teeth."
Lynette,What are you doing? Don't. You. Dare.
Lynette,"Preston, don't listen to them. Back away from the toilet and no one gets hurt."
Lynette,"I mean it this time, these are not just words. If you do this, so help me."
Lynette,I will walk you over to Mrs Van Der Camp's and we all know what happens when she gets mad.
Lynette,Now go brush your teeth and I want them to sparkle. Go on.
Lynette,"Hey. Look, I just wanted to apologise."
Lynette,Thank you. It looks like Tom's got the mob under control. Do you want to have some coffee? Sit around? Bitch about our kids?
Lynette,Hey hey hey. Hey! Why are you stealing my garbage cans?
Lynette,"Oh, that's cute. That's great. Here, Give them here."
Lynette,"You want to talk about good neighbour etiquette, how about you hire a gardener to take care of that jungle you call a lawn."
Lynette,Then why don't you think about moving somewhere less expensive? Like a nursing home?
Lynette,Run by Germans. Hmm?
Lynette,And you know-Mrs McClusky?
Lynette,"Mrs McClusky, are you alright?"
Lynette,I'll get the door.
Lynette,"You're going to the hospital, Mrs McClusky. You're going to be fine."
Lynette,"Yeah, I'll come with you. Here I am."
Lynette,You're not going to die.
Lynette,"Mrs McClusky, You're back from the hospital already?"
Lynette,"Huh, well, I'm glad to hear you're alright."
Lynette,"Oh, Mrs McClusky, you don't have to."
Lynette,I don't know what to say. It's stunning. Thank you.
Lynette,I'd invite you in but-
Lynette,"OK, Tom, I will swing by the dry cleaners after I hit the market. Um, I don't know, Porter has a dentist appointment at 4 o' clock, so the, um, car might have to wait until tomorrow."
Lynette,"Okay, I love you too. Bye bye."
Lynette,"Um, Mrs McClusky, thank you, that is very nice."
Lynette,Now's not a good time. I'm on my way out and I have a tonne of errands.
Lynette,"No I can't. I'm sorry, but I have a lot of things to do."
Lynette,"Mrs McClusky, I won't have any time tomorrow."
Lynette,"Oh, for god's sake."
Lynette,"Here, you should take this back. I don't have a place for it."
Lynette,"Yes, and it was a beautiful gesture. Really. But I-"
Lynette,"Well, isn't she home? She usually doesn't go anywhere."
Lynette,Alright. Okay. Thank you.
Lynette,She never leaves her mail sitting out there. I mean how many times has she thrown ours away because we didn't pick it up the minute it came.
Lynette,"I don't know, Tom, I think something's happened to her."
Lynette,But if I'm wrong then I'm sucked into a two-hour conversation about bunions pilkingtons.
Lynette,"Six months from now when they find her mummified corpse at the bottom of the stairs what do I tell the kids? Oh yeah, I let Mrs McClusky die."
Lynette,"Hello? It's Lynette? Hello? Mrs McClusky? Mrs McClusky, are you alright?"
Lynette,"Uh, Mr Mullins had a spare. Why didn't you open the door?"
Lynette,Have you been taking your arthritis medication?
Lynette,Okay. Okay.
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,"You're a piece of work, you know that? Well, this is crazy, why'd they give you childproof caps?"
Lynette,First thing tomorrow I'll take you to the pharmacy and you can get you new bottles.
Lynette,"Let me tell you something: half of life is obligations. You don't want to go to your husband's company Christmas party, but you do. You don't want to sell candy so your kids' band can play piccolos, but you do. You attend your third cousin's wedding. You pick up the dry cleaning. That's life. Its obligation. And you are now my obligation. So tomorrow morning I'll pick you up and take you to the pharmacy."
Lynette,We don't have to be friends. But we're two human beings living on the same piece of earth. We could at least help each other out once in a while.
Lynette,And you know what. I am going to take this.
Lynette,I'll see you tomorrow morning.
Lynette,"Mrs McClusky, we're going to be late for the doctor."
Lynette,You forgot your Helprin file.
Lynette,"Oh, thank you. And you. You're here. In the office. Tom's office."
Lynette,"It uh, must have slipped his mind."
Lynette,"Well, I'll let you get back to work. I'll see you later."
Lynette,"I almost forgot, your file. Here."
Lynette,Three months?
Lynette,Were you ever going to tell me?
Lynette,Congratulations. You read me like a book. Why would you hire that woman?
Lynette,Tom!
Lynette,Do you still have feelings for her?
Lynette,"C'on, you can tell me. You still care about her, don't you, just a teeny tiny little bit?"
Lynette,"Well, you can't work with her."
Lynette,"Talk to Peterson, maybe he can get her transferred. Weren't you guys talking about setting something up in Belize?"
Lynette,"No. I'm serious. If she stays, I will haunt your office. I will bring you lunch everyday. I will bring the kids to visit. I will change diapers on your desk. Every birthday cake in the break room, every retirement party, I will be there. Watching her."
Lynette,"No, I wanted to see you."
Lynette,"Yeah, I'll check my book. So Annabel, do you have feelings for Tom?"
Lynette,You heard me.
Lynette,Watch your step. Tom and I are a team. Our marriage is rock solid. Nothing you ever do will break us up.
Lynette,"Edie, hi."
Lynette,"Wow, things are really coming along."
Lynette,It'll be worth it. You're doing an amazing job.
Lynette,"Look, you're basically a predator and I need your advice."
Lynette,"And I know Tom loves me, but I don't trust this woman. I think there's an agenda there. I don't know, maybe I'm being paranoid."
Lynette,Fantastic shape. She's gorgeous.
Lynette,I'm listening.
Lynette,I thought you said you didn't have any female friends?
Lynette,"Tom, we're having a dinner party. I'm thinking of inviting Annabel."
Lynette,"Excuse me. I need to get in here,so I can clear the plates."
Lynette,I'm good. Looks like we're got some company.
Lynette,"They never get to see you, let them stay up for a while."
Lynette,"She is an old, old friend of your daddy's."
Lynette,"Hold on, honey, grown ups are talking."
Lynette,You think?
Lynette,Good.
Lynette,Show?
Lynette,What's wrong with subtly reminding Annabel that you're happily married?
Lynette,I did not mean it that way.
Lynette,Keep your voice down!
Lynette,"Anyone is capable of anything. The first time we ever met, you were cheating!"
Lynette,It's a pattern of behaviour.
Lynette,"Well, what am I supposed to do? You hire your old girlfriend and you don't tell me for three months?"
Lynette,She's in the next room.
Lynette,I trust you.
Lynette,"Well, that's just something that wives say to their husbands."
Lynette,It's too late. You said it.
Lynette,Please do.
Lynette,You hired your old girlfriend and you didn't tell me for three months?
Lynette,"Oh, that's fine. I wanted to talk to you about something."
Lynette,"That's your car pool. You've got to go, never mind."
Lynette,It's nothing.
Lynette,It's just-
Lynette,We haven't had sex in ten days. And the longest we've ever gone before is nine.
Lynette,We started to but then *huh* you fell asleep.
Lynette,Whatever.
Lynette,"Yeah, he's just getting his briefcase."
Lynette,Bye.
Lynette,"Okay, you boys, it's seven o'clock. Time for bed."
Lynette,"I told you, honey, daddy and I have a special meeting tonight."
Lynette,I love you.
Lynette,Hi.
Lynette,What are you thinking?
Lynette,"Oh. Oh, it's probably baby drool."
Lynette,"There, now you have easier access."
Lynette,What?
Lynette,Yes. It soaked through a little. That is the nature of baby sick. Do you want me to wear a haz-mat suit or are you going to be okay?
Lynette,"You make me feel like I just got off the shrimp boat, for god's sake."
Lynette,Fine.
Lynette,"Okay, off!"
Lynette,"Oh , ha ha ha. Not funny, Tom."
Lynette,Tom!
Lynette,"No, I'm glad that you find my humiliation so entertaining."
Lynette,I was thinking that our marriage was in trouble and one of us should do something to fix it.
Lynette,"That's Annabel, how ironic."
Lynette,Because she now comes to our house everyday to remind you of what I'm not.
Lynette,"She's the fantasy, Tom, the hot woman that you work with everyday. With her manicured nails and designer outfits. I am the reality. The wife who never wears make-up and whose clothes smell like a hamper."
Lynette,"I used to be the fantasy. There was a time when I didn't need a maid's outfit because I knew I was enough for you, even wearing a smelly T-shirt. And clearly, that's no longer the case."
Lynette,"No, there's nothing to fix. We've changed. That's all I'm saying."
Lynette,You should go. You don't want to keep Annabel waiting.
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,Tucked in tight.
Lynette,Sound asleep.
Lynette,"Tom, what is this?"
Lynette,Alright?I'm coming in.
Lynette,Oh my god!
Lynette,"You know, I kinda like it."
Lynette,No.
Lynette,"No, I'm not turning off the lights."
Lynette,No. nononono.
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,"You told me Duggan's coming back to work today, I thought I'd do something special for him."
Lynette,What?
Lynette,"Tom, I don't care about you working with Annabel. I told you that. This is for Duggan. He had a heart attack. I don't care about Annabel."
Lynette,Huh. Speak of the devil. And I mean that.
Lynette,"Oh, yeah. I wanted to do something nice for Duggan."
Lynette,"Actually, it's fruit juice sweetened. Can I cut you? A piece?"
Lynette,She said she might be a little late. They already started moving a few of Mike's things over to her house.
Lynette,"Yeah, it's nice to see Susan so happy again."
Lynette,Mike's a decent guy.
Lynette,That's right. Did they ever explain that?
Lynette,"Yeah, that didn't walk into Mike's garage by itself."
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,"I know it seems like we're ganging up on you, but you're moving so fast we thought a sort of intervention was necessary."
Lynette,"Well, as happy as I am to see you, I actually have an agenda. I ran into someone last week who said you guys were looking to hire. Is that true?"
Lynette,"No, no, not me. I was actually thinking more about Tom."
Lynette,"Yeah, he's been thinking about making a move for a while. He kind of feels like he's done everything he can where he is now."
Lynette,"He's more then solid, Tom's ideas are spectacular. He's passionate about his work. His visual instincts are off the chart."
Lynette,"He's apples, I'm oranges, we excel in different areas. Trust me, you should give Tom a look."
Lynette,"Geez, Nat, you make me feel like some kind of shark. Ah, okay. You know, actually, if that's the kind of exec you're looking for--"
Lynette,"Yes, a very pretty shark."
Lynette,Hello?
Lynette,So how are you doing?
Lynette,"Yeah, and he's so young, he's gonna bounce right back."
Lynette,You're gonna lose it?
Lynette,"Yep, that'll do it."
Lynette,"Uh, you can, honey, If you can pay for it."
Lynette,"Just stay here with Penny for a second, okay?"
Lynette,Tom?
Lynette,"Tom, what are you doing?"
Lynette,"Well, it's the middle of the day, and shouldn't you be at work?"
Lynette,You did not.
Lynette,Could you talk to me for a second? I don't understand.
Lynette,"Okay. Okay. Could we go home and talk about this, please?"
Lynette,You're just gonna stay here and play games all day?
Lynette,Tom.
Lynette,"So, did you have a fun day?"
Lynette,"You know, I didn't tell you to quit."
Lynette,I don't know what to say.
Lynette,"Yes, I am sorry. I am so, so sorry. I didn't want to hurt you. But I was trying to protect our family. If you got a promotion, we never would have seen you. You would have been traveling all the -"
Lynette,What does that mean?
Lynette,"Oh, well, yeah. I think it would be good for you to take some time off."
Lynette,Huh?
Lynette,"Tom, that's--crazy."
Lynette,"Well, yes, yes, it is hard, but I, I love it, too, and I've been doing it for six years, and I haven't complained the entire time."
Lynette,We should talk about this seriously before we make any rash decisions.
Lynette,We should-- talk about this.
Lynette,Hey!
Lynette,"Oh, why on earth would you let them finger paint before breakfast?"
Lynette,You're right. I'm sorry.
Lynette,"Oh, I have a thousand things to do before that. Borrow a decent scarf from Bree, buy a lipstick I don't hate."
Lynette,"Aah! No! No! No, nobody touches Mommy, okay? I love you, I love your finger painting, but if you touch me with those messy hands, I will cut them off."
Lynette,Go on. Off. Good.
Lynette,"Who? me? I've been out of work for seven years, I'm a woman of a certain age in a business that values youth above all else. Why should I be nervous?"
Lynette,Thank you.
Lynette,"Uh, no. I can't. You're very, so--"
Lynette,Thank you. Here.
Lynette,"Oh, my cell phone."
Lynette,Apparently Rex's heart just gave out.
Lynette,"She said she was gonna call. She's got a lot of things to do, planning for the funeral, that sort of thing."
Lynette,Hi. What are you doing out here?
Lynette,"Aw, sweetie."
Lynette,I was a stay-at-home mom. I wish it had taken time off.
Lynette,A girl. And three boys.
Lynette,"Yeah, of course, they won't get in the way of the job because my husband's staying home with them from now on."
Lynette,"With all due respect, Nina, won't be an issue. I can leave home at home."
Lynette,"Are you kidding? This office is paradise. Grown-ups talking about grown-up things. No screaming, no vomiting, no boogers under the table. You're gonna have to drag me outta here kicking and screaming - weekends, holidays, whenever."
Lynette,"Well, that, that sounds great. Thank you."
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"Okay, let's get outta here. Tom?"
Lynette,What's the matter?
Lynette,Okay. Come on. Give me your feet.
Lynette,How's that? Is that better?
Lynette,"Don't do this to me. I don't have time to make a phone call, and I promised that woman I would not let the kids interfere with this job."
Lynette,"Remember that time when you were away in Tucson, and I had a 104 fever, but I still managed to take the kids trick-or-treating?"
Lynette,"Tom, being a mom is like being an E.R. doctor. There are no days off, so get up! Get up!"
Lynette,"Jeez, are you crying?"
Lynette,"Oh, for god sakes!"
Lynette,You!
Lynette,"Great. Listen, uh--"
Lynette,"Stu. You look like a bright, uh, responsible young man, and I bet you just love kids. Am I right?"
Lynette,Ah.
Lynette,Thanks so much for having me in.
Lynette,Thank you.
Lynette,"""I have. But when I moved over to Cenn and Simmons-"
Lynette,"Um, I got to do a broader range of campaigns."
Lynette,"Um--T-- uh, V--and--uh-- radio--uh, billboards."
Lynette,Could you excuse me for a minute?
Lynette,"Stu, you are an idiot. You're an idiot, an absolute idiot."
Lynette,"Hi. Guys, I'd like you to meet Penny. She gives me all my best ideas."
Lynette,It won't be an ongoing thing.
Lynette,Not until I change her diaper. Could you just give me two minutes?
Lynette,"Well, then watch me multitask."
Lynette,"Here's how I see it. You guys run a really good shop, but if you want your agency to go to the next level, you have to focus on two things. First, you've gotta win some awards. Do some P.S.A.s, pro bono stuff, whatever it takes, because whether they admit it or not, clients care about what's in your trophy case. Two, your web site. It's the first thing a client's gonna look at, and it's hard to navigate. There's no site map. It just wasn't built for people who grew up without computers. There. And third, I don't have a third. Yeah, so that's it."
Lynette,Seriously?
Lynette,"Well, all right!"
Lynette,"Okay, obviously, I'm gonna clean that up."
Lynette,Give it to her! Give it to her!
Lynette,"Oh, my god. I mean, I knew Mary Alice had killed herself over something big, but wow. Can you imagine living with that guilt?"
Lynette,"Makes you wonder, doesn't it?"
Lynette,Why on earth would you let them finger paint before breakfast?
Lynette,Wow. It's really pilin' up.
Lynette,Really?
Lynette,Two days.
Lynette,And why have I never seen the sparkling part?
Lynette,"See, that's what I would call a flaw in the system."
Lynette,I think I'm asking you to clean the house.
Lynette,"No. No, no, no, no. No. I'm not saying it has to be sparkling."
Lynette,"Please, don't take this the wrong way. I think you are doing a terrific job, but let's be clear. When you came home, it was to clutter. I mean, come on, this is more than that."
Lynette,I did. I had to load the dishwasher.
Lynette,"Yeah, I sorta did."
Lynette,"You know, for the sake of our marriage, please don't mention the system again."
Lynette,What in the world?
Lynette,And you didn't change them?
Lynette,"Oh, that's disgusting."
Lynette,"No, I can't respect that, and do you know why? It's stupid. I'm gonna get new sheets."
Lynette,Why are you yelling at me?
Lynette,Of course it is.
Lynette,Why are you fighting so hard to sleep on baby vomit?
Lynette,Being too lazy to change the sheets is not a principle.
Lynette,"No, Tom! Tom, no! I'm gonna change the sheets!"
Lynette,"No, you come on! Just get up! Get up!"
Lynette,"All right, fine! Fine! Fine! Fine! Ah!"
Lynette,Hello? Hi!
Lynette,Okay. Welcome to the Promised Land. Go on! There! Good job!
Lynette,Hi. Hi.
Lynette,I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?
Lynette,"I saw you walk in, and I've been meaning to call since the service, but work's been so crazy so--how are you doing?"
Lynette,"Well, you look amazing."
Lynette,"Absolutely. Well, I can't imagine what you're going through."
Lynette,"Well, I'm very sorry for your loss, too, Phyllis."
Lynette,"Oh, I'm so sorry. Is she gonna be okay?"
Lynette,I forgot.
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"Hey, sweet pea. Why? What's wrong?"
Lynette,"Oh, did he now?"
Lynette,Honey?
Lynette,I'm home.
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,"It was good, but, more importantly, how was yours?"
Lynette,Yep.
Lynette,The sandwiches from yesterday?
Lynette,"Wow. So, um, I, I take it you took the rat outside?"
Lynette,You killed it?
Lynette,"Hey. Little guy. I just wanted to say I'm really sorry about what happened with the shovel. Neither one of us saw that coming. I know it's not much consolation, but you really helped my marriage. That's a lot for a little rat to accomplish in one lifetime. Well, it's getting late, so, hats off to ya!"
Lynette,"Hey, guys!"
Lynette,"Parker, guess what I got."
Lynette,School supplies.
Lynette,"Yeah, and the best part of it is I got you a really cool backpack."
Lynette,"So on your first day of school, you and your dad can find your cubby and you can hang it up."
Lynette,"Actually, your dad's gonna take you to school on your first day."
Lynette,"Yeah, well, honey, I have to work. Mommy's boss is a mean, mean lady and if I miss work, I'll lose my job and then we won't have any money to buy food. Honey, you gotta believe me, if I could be there, you know that I would."
Lynette,All right. I didn't know it was that important to you. I will talk to my boss and I will see what I can do.
Lynette,"Well, hey, when a kid's that good, you gotta give him his due."
Lynette,"Stu, isn't that the new video conference setup?"
Lynette,"Hey, Nina."
Lynette,"Uh, about tomorrow morning--"
Lynette,You know how the first hour of the morning meeting is always so slow? 'Cause I've got this thing--
Lynette,"I know, I promised I wouldn't do this, but Parker really needs me to be there on his first day of kindergarten. He's so freaked out I can't be there."
Lynette,"Because we can't escape the fact that I have kids. I love my job, but to be fair, there's gotta be some balance."
Lynette,Okay. Good point. And I'm sorry about your hair. I can see why you're upset.
Lynette,"Not now, Stu. Hang on a sec."
Lynette,This system is gonna let mommy be with you on your first day of school. The resolution is fantastic.
Lynette,"Parker, honey, can you hear me? Tom, why isn't he talking?"
Lynette,"Oh, hey, honey, this is so exciting. Your first day of school. You're going to make so many friends."
Lynette,"Uh, right, yeah. I'm going to be right there."
Lynette,"Honey, I'm gonna be right back."
Lynette,Right back.
Lynette,"Damn. I forgot my prospectus. Any extra copies? No? Oh, I'll be right back."
Lynette,"Hi, I'm back. How's he doing?"
Lynette,"Oh, honey, I'm here. I'm here. You can show me your cubby now."
Lynette,"Okay. I'll be back in two seconds, sweetie."
Lynette,Ladies' room.
Lynette,"Nina, nature is calling."
Lynette,Yes!
Lynette,"Bill on delivery, yes!"
Lynette,"No, no, I'm just, I'm very excited. It's a really good plan. Yeah."
Lynette,"And that's why we packed you extra cookies so you could share with all your new friends, remember?"
Lynette,"You're gonna be great, Parker. I love you."
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,Dad's gonna take you.
Lynette,You couldn't have given them coffee or something? I just feel like I'm missing out on their lives entirely.
Lynette,"I'm sorry, who?"
Lynette,Is that why he's sleeping with an umbrella?
Lynette,When did this start?
Lynette,And you don't find it odd that Parker's new nanny made her appearance right at the time I went back to work?
Lynette,"I agree with you to a point when they're flying kangaroos or giant robots, not surrogate mommies."
Lynette,"I hope you're right. At the risk of sounding too sensitive,"" ""How come she gets a bigger portion?"
Lynette,"Hey buddy, wake up sleepyhead. Parker. Hi, hi pal. What do you say you and me go get some donuts, okay, before mommy has to go to work. Yeah?"
Lynette,"Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on."
Lynette,"All right. Ah. So, what do you think you are going to have, huh? Jelly? Cause I think I'm gonna have a bear claw."
Lynette,"What? Oh, um. Well, since I'm here, maybe she could just relax in the house for a little while, okay?"
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"Hello, Mrs. Mulberry. Don't forget to buckle up."
Lynette,Here we go.
Lynette,"Well, Parker, we don't have time."
Lynette,I'm looking for Parker's umbrella. Have you seen it?
Lynette,Thank you for that.
Lynette,"I couldn't find Mrs. Mulberry's umbrella so I brought her her sun hat instead, all right? And, here we go."
Lynette,What?
Lynette,"Well, why didn't Mrs. Mulberry volunteer that information before I turned your room upside down looking for it, hmm?"
Lynette,"No! I'm not going to get the damn umbrella! I'm so sorry, sweetie. I am not mad at you."
Lynette,What are you doing?
Lynette,I'm so sorry I couldn't get here sooner. I forgot my husband had to take our youngest to the pediatrician--
Lynette,"So, what did Parker do?"
Lynette,Yes. We've met.
Lynette,Oh. That must have been ugly.
Lynette,"Oh, I am so sorry."
Lynette,No. No. Why?
Lynette,Uh huh.
Lynette,Thank you.
Lynette,I couldn't have imagined how much going back to work would upset Parker.
Lynette,"Tom, he attacked a teacher with an umbrella."
Lynette,I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't be working.
Lynette,Maybe I can change my work schedule. Try to get some flex time.
Lynette,"No! No, no, no, no, no! It would help if you came up with some ideas."
Lynette,Hugs?
Lynette,That'll fix everything? Hugs?
Lynette,Hi.
Lynette,Shut up.
Lynette,"Hey, buddy. You busy?"
Lynette,"Well, isn't she nice. It's time for bed, so I'm gonna tuck you in, okay?"
Lynette,"I know things have been hard for you since I started back to work, but it is just as hard for me to be away from you. And, you just have to remember that even when I'm not around, my love for you is real. You may not be able to see it, but it's not imaginary like Mrs. Mulberry. It's real. Okay, honey?"
Lynette,Parker!
Lynette,Parker.
Lynette,"No, can't say that I have."
Lynette,"Or, uh, maybe she's not. She could have left. You know. Maybe she had some other little boy that she needed to help."
Lynette,"I don't know. It could be a little boy in, uh, England named Spencer."
Lynette,"I mean this is conjecture on my part, but it is possible that someone like little Spencer needs Mrs. Mulberry more 'cause he doesn't have a daddy and a mommy who love him. Yeah, that's it. He's an orphan with no hands. Okay?"
Lynette,You're so sweet. Come here. I love you. You all right? Go get dressed.
Lynette,"Until there's a body, there's no evidence of a crime."
Lynette,Oh. Goodie!
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,Oh. Don't you worry? I'm here.
Lynette,"No, Tom. She's gone."
Lynette,"Because of me, my son's imaginary friend got crushed by a garbage truck. I am the worst person in the world."
Lynette,You really think so? Really?
Lynette,It's a gimlet. You'll love it.
Lynette,"Don't be ridiculous. Could we get a trough of these, please?"
Lynette,So why don't you go out and get in the game?
Lynette,"Well, I'm not. So, uh, what about that guy over there? He's been checking you out since we walked in."
Lynette,"So, go over there."
Lynette,"Oh, for god's sakes."
Lynette,"Hey, Stretch. See my friend over there? She thinks you're cute."
Lynette,Why don't you buy her a drink?
Lynette,Wow.
Lynette,"Thanks. Hey, Nina."
Lynette,Are those the same clothes you were wearing last night in the bar?
Lynette,"No, it's fine, I'll pick it up on my way home. So, what do you want?"
Lynette,"Oh, Parker hates pepperoni. How about sausage? Yeah. And a small cheese. Okay, perfect. Love you."
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,"You're welcome, but I really need to get home."
Lynette,"Um, why don't you ask Trudy? She loves going out."
Lynette,"Oh, is she now?"
Lynette,Ah.
Lynette,Pals?'Cause sometimes it's hard to tell. You know I wasn't feeling the love today when you mocked my campaign in front of the clients.
Lynette,Okay. One drink.
Lynette,No.
Lynette,Hi.
Lynette,"Oh, fun, but I can't go tonight because I promised the twins that I would help them finish their science project."
Lynette,You're gonna take me off Kamarov because I won't go drinking with you?
Lynette,Thank you.
Lynette,Nina.
Lynette,I can handle the extra hours.
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,Yeah?
Lynette,"Well, you guys have fun. This is the fifth night in a row I haven't been home to tuck in my kids, so I'm gonna go."
Lynette,"Chuck, I'm gonna stop you right there."
Lynette,Happily married.
Lynette,"Chuck, get your hand off my thigh. No! Not up my thigh. Off my thigh! Come on, what's the matter with you! I'm not available. And I'm not that easy!"
Lynette,"Well, I don't usually do this."
Lynette,It's crazy here tonight. Don't you want to dance?
Lynette,"Woo! I love this song. Here, hold my purse."
Lynette,"Bree, wait, you're gonna have to explain. Rex is dead. What could he have done to upset you?"
Lynette,"Great, great, no problem."
Lynette,"Um, I wasn't planning to, uh, but why?"
Lynette,I'll just wear a different suit then.
Lynette,Another suit. I have other suits.
Lynette,"No, actually, I have quite a few others. Uh, the blue one, and uh--"
Lynette,What's wrong with the blue suit?
Lynette,"All right, so if I get my blue suit dry cleaned, will that be acceptable to everyone?"
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"Okay, don't be distracted by that. Look at me. Here I am tomorrow, making my presentation."
Lynette,"You see? You see how it, how it moves with me? That's where the magic is."
Lynette,"Yeah, well, this one was the most expensive. The other ones aren't as nice. But look. Look, look, look, look at me, look at me. Watch. I don't walk in it. I glide."
Lynette,"Yeah, well, I haven't bought a new suit in six years."
Lynette,I'm willing to make sacrifices.
Lynette,"Whoa, hold on a sec."
Lynette,"All right, now you're being ridiculous."
Lynette,"Oh, no. Come on, Tom. Not this one."
Lynette,"You saw the walk, right? You wanna see the walk again? I'll tutor Parker myself."
Lynette,"Fine. I'll take them back. Could you step out for a minute, please? I want to be alone with it for a little while."
Lynette,Thank you.
Lynette,Oh. Thanks.
Lynette,I don't follow you.
Lynette,"Well, actually, this was already in my closet. I just forgot about it."
Lynette,"Good morning. Hi. I'm Lynette Scavo. Now is everyone taken care of in terms of coffee and whatever else they may like? Great. Well, then, let's get started. I will show you how Kamarov Vodka can expand its customer mindshare while still holding the line on marketing costs. It's something we here at Percher and Murphy like to call ""persuasive engineering."""
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"Just hear me out. I was gonna take it back, I swear."
Lynette,"But then I started thinking about it, and you know what? I'll be damned if I'm gonna pitch to a roomful of people who are all wearing Armani and Vera Wang, while I'm standing there with two-year-old breast milk crusted on my lapel."
Lynette,And you know what else? I kicked ass in that meeting because of this suit.
Lynette,"You can't explain obsession, Tom. It just is."
Lynette,"See? That's where I think we have been making a terrible, terrible mistake."
Lynette,"Sometimes we just need to get something that makes us happy. I know that sounds selfish, but I've been thinking. It might make us better people and maybe even better parents."
Lynette,Carbon--fiber--shafts.
Lynette,"Guys, stop it! Stop it, I mean it, come on!"
Lynette,"Hey, hey, hey, Porter, Preston, knock it off. All right, did you hear me, I said stop it. Stand up. Stand up! Come here!"
Lynette,I'm so sorry. Did my sons beat you up?
Lynette,Is that true? Did they beat you up?
Lynette,"Ah, no, it's, it's okay. Believe me, my boys can take care of themselves."
Lynette,"No, not to worry. I got the feeling they were sort of enjoying themselves."
Lynette,"Well, they look fine to me."
Lynette,Same time next week?
Lynette,"Rest assured, we have not forgotten. See ya!"
Lynette,Don't worry.
Lynette,"Well, you should be polite and watch it too. You know they're your guests."
Lynette,"Hey, guys. We got snacks!"
Lynette,"Guys, what is this?"
Lynette,"Oh my god! Oh my god, where's the off button?"
Lynette,"Well, it's stuck. Get the remote! Get the remote!"
Lynette,"Oh, uh--"
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,"Yeah, um, before that happens--"
Lynette,"Yeah, okay, enough of that."
Lynette,"Actually, yes. We've agonized whether to tell you this, Norma, but one of your private videos made its way into Jimmy and PJ's bag."
Lynette,"Oh, Norma. Norma, we just thought you needed to know what happened."
Lynette,"Norma, wait! We're still on for next week! Norma! The water park! Right?"
Lynette,"They need to know we don't judge them for what they do in the privacy of their own home. And, well, it's not unheard of to tape yourself while you're having sex."
Lynette,"I need these play dates. Tom, we need these play dates."
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,Norma--
Lynette,Wait!
Lynette,No!
Lynette,"Hi. Sorry for just showing up unannounced, but, um, could we talk to you for a minute?"
Lynette,"So, um, we've been trying to contact you, but you haven't been returning any of our messages."
Lynette,"Home, home movies. The fact is, we really don't care, and it's certainly no reason to keep our boys apart."
Lynette,"You know, what we're saying is, we get it. You're just having fun. It's nothing to be ashamed of."
Lynette,"Oh, no!"
Lynette,"Well, from a lay perspective, it looked very professional."
Lynette,Ah.
Lynette,That is a damn shame.
Lynette,Not a one.
Lynette,Huh?
Lynette,"Well, that sounds expensive."
Lynette,"Look, McClusky, I am as worried as everybody else in this neighborhood, but I just don't think that we-"
Lynette,Hi.
Lynette,Sure.
Lynette,You should hold onto that stuff for a while.
Lynette,"Porter, Preston, what have I told you about playing outside after dark?"
Lynette,Does your dad know you're out here?
Lynette,"You do that. Okay, guys, come on over here. On the sidewalk. Stay there. Not on the street. Thank you."
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,I'm home. Could you come here a sec?
Lynette,Again? How often does this happen?
Lynette,"Tom, it's nine o'clock at night."
Lynette,"And for good reason. Someone could have driven off with them, and you wouldn't have even noticed."
Lynette,"Yeah, well, that was a different time. You have to be more vigilant. There was a break-in on this street."
Lynette,I'm sorry. I've been doing this for seven years. Trust me. You have to have eyes in the back of your head.
Lynette,Really?
Lynette,Where's Penny?
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"Hi, guys."
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,Can I ask a question?
Lynette,What if the stranger is nice and not scary? Yes?
Lynette,"So, what if the stranger says they're gonna take you to the circus for pizza and elephant rides? Don't look at your dad. Eyes on me. What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do?"
Lynette,You're smiling like that actually meant something.
Lynette,"Give me a break. You know our kids. I love them dearly, but that goes in one ear and out the other."
Lynette,"Tom, you're not off the hook here."
Lynette,"Hey, Stu. You busy?"
Lynette,'Cause I've got an important assignment for you.
Lynette,"Yeah, I applaud that, but what I need is for you to help me to prove a point to my husband."
Lynette,"Uh, no. Actually, I need you to kidnap my children."
Lynette,"Just wait for it. Okay, here he comes."
Lynette,I'm just trying to prove a point.
Lynette,It's just Stu from our office.
Lynette,Maybe.
Lynette,Why? Are you worried they might get in?
Lynette,Well-
Lynette,"Oh, my god!"
Lynette,"And we integrated the corporate logo into the jungle background creating not only an ad for the clothing, but for the company, itself."
Lynette,"What, um, don't you get?"
Lynette,"Could you can the attitude, Nina?"
Lynette,You're being rude and it's totally out of line. You know how hard we all worked on this.
Lynette,"Nina, I think I speak for everyone here when I say we are sick and tired of your abuse. Frankly, you owe us an apology."
Lynette,"Guys, we talked about this. What happened to standing up for ourselves?"
Lynette,"No, Stu! These people don't deserve muffins."
Lynette,"All right. This is my last hand, then I gotta go."
Lynette,"I left a proposal on my desk at work. I have to go over it tonight, or you-know-who's gonna have my head."
Lynette,"Well, if one of you would just agree to raise my kids, I wouldn't need a job. Any takers?"
Lynette,"Yeah, no, I didn't think so. Ante up."
Lynette,Edie! I am sure Susan's father will like her just fine.
Lynette,"Edie, how old were you when you lost your virginity?"
Lynette,"Hey, Stu."
Lynette,And Nina!
Lynette,Sure.
Lynette,"Tsk, tsk, tsk. Having sex with the support staff. That's a big no-no. Ed's been known to fire people for that sort of thing."
Lynette,My demands are simple. I want you to be nicer.
Lynette,"No more belittling, berating, rude sarcasm."
Lynette,"Yeah. Pretty sweet deal, don't you think?"
Lynette,Great!
Lynette,And I'm gonna take your parking space.
Lynette,I kid the Nina!
Lynette,I'm Lynette Scavo. I work here. Who are you?
Lynette,"Oh. Well, welcome. What happened to Stu?"
Lynette,You fired Stu?
Lynette,I can't believe you would sink so low. I'm going to Ed.
Lynette,"Come on, Nina, we both know why you got rid of him."
Lynette,You threatening me?
Lynette,Black?
Lynette,Great.
Lynette,Oh course I noticed! You are one of my favorites and I thought it was really unfair how it all went down.
Lynette,"See, I don't think that's why you got fired."
Lynette,Word got out that you and Nina were-
Lynette,Being intimate. And Nina fired you to keep Ed from finding out.
Lynette,"And that wasn't right of her. She shouldn't have been having sex with you. She's upper management. Technically, it's sexual harassment."
Lynette,"Stu, you're a gopher. You can't consent to anything. So, I think you should talk to Ed about getting your job back."
Lynette,"Oh, he'll care. He doesn't want you suing him for millions of dollars."
Lynette,"Well, I'm not gonna lie to you. There is a possibility she'd get a slap on the wrist. So, you'll think about talking to Ed?"
Lynette,"Hey, Pat, what's going on?"
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,I am?
Lynette,Why? What happened?
Lynette,He did what?
Lynette,"Okay. I get Nina, but why are you firing everybody else?"
Lynette,"Oh, god, Ed. I am so sorry."
Lynette,"Yeah. Sure. I'll, I'm gonna go and take care of that."
Lynette,This is not what I wanted. I just wanted you to be nicer.
Lynette,"Oh, Nina, come on."
Lynette,"So, he poisoned Rex?"
Lynette,"Yeah, like you haven't been through enough."
Lynette,Does he know yet?
Lynette,Our company insurance policy. You ever bother to read it?
Lynette,"We have day care, Ed, day care. Do you realize that since we fired half the staff, you and I have barely left the building? My kids are forgetting who I am."
Lynette,"See? All we need is a minimum participation of, uh--sixteen kids. My kids, your baby, Sally in accounting has three, that new guy in Human Resources has two and we hit the mother lode with the Mormon receptionist. She just popped out number six. There. Sixteen."
Lynette,"Well, maybe if I talked to her."
Lynette,"Well, she won't just take some time off for a couple of hours?"
Lynette,"Oh, hi. Excuse me. Hi. I'm Lynette. You must be Fran."
Lynette,"Oh, well, come on in my office."
Lynette,"I'm not suggesting that you sign her up for all day. Maybe just a couple of hours in the afternoon. Wouldn't that be great? Have some time to yourself, relax, unwind?"
Lynette,"Oh, of course, of course, but we all have days when we're starting to lose it. Wouldn't it be nice to have some place to take her before you want to strangle her?"
Lynette,"Really? Yeah. Look, I'm gonna level with you. Parcher and Murphy can't have a day care center unless we have at least sixteen kids and without little Mindy, we only have fifteen."
Lynette,Okay. Okay. I just thought I'd give it a shot.
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,Excuse me?
Lynette,I work because my family needs me to.
Lynette,"I bet. Make no mistake, I'm a good mother."
Lynette,Bye-bye.
Lynette,"Kiss the kids good night and I'll see them in the morning. Okay, yeah. I love you, too. Bye-bye."
Lynette,You're Mindy's father. You have a right to spend time with her.
Lynette,"You could stand up to Fran. If you don't, you'll just become more resentful, she'll get nuttier. And without a father figure, poor Mindy will grow up to be a stripper."
Lynette,There's science to back that up.
Lynette,"You're doing the right thing, Ed, for little Mindy."
Lynette,"Hey! You know, the day care room won't be ready until next week at the earliest."
Lynette,You took the baby without telling Fran?
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,"Oh, I was planning to."
Lynette,"I am not on your side, Ed."
Lynette,"No, I am on Mindy's side. She is the one caught in the middle, and I'm not letting you two have her until you calm down."
Lynette,"Pat, can you see here I'm holding a baby hostage? I will call back!"
Lynette,"No, and you're gonna get her back a whole lot faster if you will just listen to me. Okay? Listen, and you? All right, good. So, first of all, Ed, stealing the baby was really stupid."
Lynette,"You're welcome. You need to find a better way to communicate with your wife. And, Fran, I know what the pressure of trying to be a super parent does to your head. You can take a break and be a great mom. Doesn't this little sweetheart deserve a well-rested mommy?"
Lynette,"This is communication. This is good. Why don't you guys go down to the lobby, talk it out over some coffee?"
Lynette,We've got day care!
Lynette,We've got day care!
Lynette,"Hi, bunny, bunny. Hi."
Lynette,He played the tuba.I have pictures.
Lynette,"So, uh, Gaby--you know that thing you and Tom did tonight?The-- the kiss?"
Lynette,"Yeah.I know this sounds silly,but--it kind of bugged me."
Lynette,"Yeah, I am.I don't--I don't want to make a big deal out of it,but, uh,could you maybe not do that again?"
Lynette,Thanks.
Lynette,"Oh, sure, but--but maybe next time you could try juggling instead."
Lynette,"No, no tension.What?"
Lynette,I just said it bugged me.Why is that a problem?
Lynette,That's all I'm saying.
Lynette,Me neither.
Lynette,"Hey, you're out early."
Lynette,"Oh, cool. Listen,I just wanted you to know I appreciated you backing me up last night,you know,with the kiss thing."
Lynette,"Yeah, but I probably should've just gone with it.Gaby was just being Gaby--having fun."
Lynette,What do you mean?
Lynette,Gaby had an affair?
Lynette,No!
Lynette,I am stunned.Who was it with?
Lynette,"Bree, come on, just tell me."
Lynette,"Oh, you're kidding!"
Lynette,The teenager?
Lynette,Does Gaby know that you know?
Lynette,Guess what? Ed loved the pitch.I got off early!
Lynette,"Hey, I'm right by the supermarket.You want me to pick up anything?"
Lynette,Not at all.
Lynette,"Yeah, they were out."
Lynette,"Yeah. Hey, Gaby.A surprise seeing you here."
Lynette,"Really?Wow, that was nice of you."
Lynette,No.
Lynette,Okay. Yeah.So exact what are you doing here helping out?
Lynette,"I never said that.What I said was that it made me uncomfortable when you kissed him.It's obviously an issue for me.And yet, here you are, alone in my kitchen with my husband.So you tell me,are you hitting on him?"
Lynette,"Well,that's not entirely true."
Lynette,"Come on, Gaby.It's a small town. People talk."
Lynette,"Maybe.Yes.But Gaby doesn't think she did anything wrong.That's not right,either."
Lynette,You're an attractive man.There is a primal need for a woman to protect what is hers.My initial impulse was justified.
Lynette,I don't know.
Lynette,You're kidding.
Lynette,Are you drunk?
Lynette,Come here.
Lynette,"Thank you.Thank you for reminding me that I am the only woman in the whole world who could love an ""idiot"" like you.I'll talk to Gaby."
Lynette,"Oh, yeah."
Lynette,"Good night, Tom."
Lynette,Shut up and go to sleep.
Lynette,Hey.Um--I hope it's okay.Carlos let me in.
Lynette,"I'm just here to say I am sorry,and I have been a complete idiot."
Lynette,So cute.'Cause it's beautiful!
Lynette,"Well, 99% wrong."
Lynette,"Anyway, Tom's probably got dinner ready by now.So I should get goin'."
Lynette,Bye!Mwah!
Lynette,"You know what the 1% is, right?"
Lynette,It kinda does.I wanna get it clear for our friendship.
Lynette,"Well, well--yes,I overreacted.I think you can see how even though I was somewhat off base,you were a little wrong,right?"
Lynette,"Okay,let's test that theory."
Lynette,"All righty, then,my work here is done.Carlos, Gaby."
Lynette,"Oh, hey, Carlos.Hi."
Lynette,"Well, sure, no problem."
Lynette,"Yeah, I can imagine."
Lynette,"Oh, well,I'm not surprised,and I really, really hope you can work it out."
Lynette,Yeah?
Lynette,Oh?
Lynette,Why are you telling me this?
Lynette,I-- don't.I really don't.
Lynette,Mm-hmm?
Lynette,"Well, he is our friendly neighborhood murderer."
Lynette,That doesn't mean Betty knew him.
Lynette,What's that about?
Lynette,"That's okay.They don't trust you,either."
Lynette,Sounds like a plan.
Lynette,See ya.
Lynette,What's wrong? Pat said you told her it was an emergency!
Lynette,What? Why? I called.The machine kept picking up.
Lynette,Chicken pox?That's the emergency?
Lynette,Not to us.
Lynette,"Well,you never told me that."
Lynette,"Well,Tom,somebody's gotta take care of our kids."
Lynette,And since you're immune--
Lynette,"Oh,you've gotta be kidding!I have to get back to work!"
Lynette,It is not the ebola virus.It's chicken pox.You are being a baby.
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,I'll call the office.
Lynette,"Hey,guys."
Lynette,"Hi,Carlos."
Lynette,"Oh,it's just chicken pox.But brave heart here will only come in to sleep and shower."
Lynette,See ya later.
Lynette,"See you later.I'm sorry,what did he mean,""shooting blanks""?"
Lynette,We're not having any more kids.Why would it matter?
Lynette,"So that if you're the last man to survive a nuclear holocaust,you could repopulate the planet?"
Lynette,So you're saying that if I died--you would want a second wife and a family?
Lynette,I can't believe you've actually thought about this!
Lynette,Thought about who I'd marry if you died?Hmm. No.
Lynette,Then why have it?
Lynette,"Yeah,well,why don't you have your second wife make you lunch,okay? Oops!"
Lynette,"I don't want you to have options,Tom.If I die,I wanna hear your life would be over.I want you to spend the rest of your life screaming,""it should've been me on that plane!"""
Lynette,I'm assuming there was a crash.It could've been something else.
Lynette,Do you have any idea how painful it is to hear about you even think about your next wife and kids?I could never do that!I can't imagine my life without you.You are my everything!
Lynette,"Okay,well,that's easy to say,but I need you to show me."
Lynette,With a vasec to me.
Lynette,"Look,it makes perfect sense.We're not gonna have any more kids.And the pill just makes me bloat.It'll be great!"
Lynette,"Oh,I know! I know!But it is what married people do.They go out of their way to calm each other's irrational fears.Oh,come on,Tom.I really need you to do this."
Lynette,Thank you.
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,You're not limping.Did everything go okay?
Lynette,What happened?
Lynette,Why not?
Lynette,"Oh,please."
Lynette,Staying home and taking care of the kids doesn't make you less of a man.That's crazy.
Lynette,Are you saying you're unhappy?
Lynette,"Well, what are we gonna do about that?"
Lynette,"Well, can't we just--"
Lynette,"Oh, not good. I am trying to salvage the pitch from the Black's Frozen Yogurt campaign.You know what kills me?"
Lynette,"Here we are at ""t"" minus 9 hours and 11 minutes from the biggest pitch in our company's history,and I have nothing even vaguely presentable."
Lynette,Thank you.
Lynette,"No, that's okay.I know you're exhausted.You should go to bed."
Lynette,We've got-- nothing.
Lynette,"Come on, I'm sorry.I just really need to focus here."
Lynette,That's actually good.
Lynette,"No, the cow part--that could work.We'll-- we'll make them into characters.We'll humanize them. Oh!I know! I know!Celebrity cow spokespeople!"
Lynette,"Hey,I got great news!We just landed the Black's Frozen Yogurt account!"
Lynette,The talking cows rocked their world.
Lynette,"Uh, well, I rewrote some of the stuff we worked on,but, you know, essentially, it's the same, and they ate it up."
Lynette,"Yeah, and Ed said we can finally afford to hire another executive."
Lynette,"Uh, well,the pitch was running long,so we cut a few things."
Lynette,"Well, to be fair--"
Lynette,They're calling me in for a meeting.I gotta go. Love you. Bye!
Lynette,Hi!
Lynette,Hi.
Lynette,"Oh, the pickings are slim.So far none of my top choices are available.Hey, um, do you have someone from your old company that you could, you know,maybe recommend?"
Lynette,Yeah?
Lynette,Really? What's his name?
Lynette,Tom? Tom what?
Lynette,Oh!No! No!I do not think that that is a good idea.
Lynette,"You have a real job, right here staying home with the kids."
Lynette,What about Penny?
Lynette,What about the two of us working and living together?I think that could be a recipe for disaster.
Lynette,"Oh, it's just--I'm--I'm not sure that you would find this job that satisfying."
Lynette,I'm not saying that.
Lynette,I'll go.
Lynette,"Oh, hey! Hey!"
Lynette,Thank you. Bye.
Lynette,"Well, honestly,I wasn't blown away."
Lynette,I know! I know! I know.So who's up next?
Lynette,Just-- uh--could you excuse me for just a minute?
Lynette,Tom Cavos?
Lynette,What do you think you're doing?
Lynette,"You want the truth, Tom?I think you're good.You have moments of brilliance.But I also think sometimes you coast.And I think if I were your boss and had to ride your ass every day,you would come home seething with resentment.Come on! It's hard enough keeping a marriage together."
Lynette,What does that mean?
Lynette,Tom--
Lynette,Great! Great!
Lynette,"Uh, just let your r��_��_sum��_��_ speak for itself?"
Lynette,Okay!
Lynette,"Yeah, gosh, it is.It's quite impressive.Oh, wow,I see you worked for Bellfore and Barrasso.That's a great shop."
Lynette,"Uh-huh, and when were you there?Because you forgot to list your dates of employment for that one."
Lynette,Uh-huh. And how long did you stay?
Lynette,"What, did you get recruited by another firm?Did somebody cherry-pick ya?"
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,So did you do that solo?
Lynette,Ed--
Lynette,"No, no, no, no,we never hire in the room."
Lynette,"Well--um, let me just call in a few references before we make anything official."
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,"I told Ed you were my husband,and he was cool with that.He really wants to hire you.So who am I to stand in the way?"
Lynette,"On one condition.If you take this job,you are never allowed to bring up what happened before with your promotion."
Lynette,"No, it's not a deal.I need a solemn vow that you will never throw that in my face ever again.Because if you do,you will unleash demons that you do not wanna meet."
Lynette,And what I really need from you--is to be forgiven.
Lynette,This dinner is really good.
Lynette,"Yeah, something about the Applewhites.I'm dying of curiosity."
Lynette,"Oh!Hey, none of that in here."
Lynette,You've only been here a week.Yhy don't you give yourself a break?
Lynette,I can't protect you.You're gonna have to find a way to click with Ed yourself.
Lynette,"Well,Tom, why don't you pitch him the other idea you came up with last night?You know, the one where people love bacon so much they wanna keep it a secret?"
Lynette,Go.
Lynette,"Pat, we're all here, send the call in as soon as you get it."
Lynette,"I'm sorry,I thought we were here to talk about the farm fresh rollout?"
Lynette,Guys--
Lynette,"Guys, please--that's--all right."
Lynette,"Just for one second, okay?Just for one second.Hey,I never thought I'd have to ask you this,but are you about to eat a doughnut out of the toilet?"
Lynette,I don't care!You're not gonna do this!
Lynette,"That's because Ed gets off on humiliating you.Please, don't do this!"
Lynette,You are so not allowed to complain to me.
Lynette,Tell him you're done with the games.You don't wanna play anymore.
Lynette,But--
Lynette,Here you go.
Lynette,"You know, Ed,I've been thinking.We've had a lot of fun and games around here lately,but maybe it's time to set a slightly more profession tone in the office."
Lynette,What?
Lynette,"No. No, you're not gonna make him pay.You are gonna stop this now."
Lynette,Ed!
Lynette,I'm calling you out.
Lynette,"Yes, you're right.This is your company,so I'll play by your rules.What do I have to do to get you to stop this frat boy crap?Shave my eyebrows?Come to work naked?Name your stakes."
Lynette,"Aw, what's wrong, Ed?You afraid a Phi Kap's gonna get beaten by a girl?Come on, big man--it's just a little bet."
Lynette,"I am not fighting your fights.This is my fight.This is how guys do business, right?"
Lynette,"So-- can this be a place of business again,Ed?No more games?"
Lynette,Thanks.Could you scrounge me up a bucket?
Lynette,You okay?
Lynette,I'm coming!
Lynette,Hi.
Lynette,"Uh,not that I know of. Why?"
Lynette,Really?
Lynette,"Oh,that's okay. Um--would you excuse me just for a second? I have, uh, a thing."
Lynette,Thanks.Follow me.You're part of the thing.
Lynette,"A million teenagers in this neighborhood,and you hire Mccluskey?"
Lynette,"Well,for starters,she's ancient!"
Lynette,It was not that long ago that she keeled over in her front yard.A day with our kids will finish the job.
Lynette,Just the twins and Penny?
Lynette,We will find someone--someone who doesn't remember what they were doing the day Lincoln was shot.
Lynette,"So,here's the deal.Um,there was a little miscommunication,and as it turns out,we don't need ya."
Lynette,Okay. Sorry.
Lynette,Hi.Is now a bad time?I could really use a favor.
Lynette,"Have they signed the contract?'Cause if not,somebody should call Bednark and tell them to adjust the language."
Lynette,Oh.I'm sorry.Hang on.Hello?
Lynette,Yes.
Lynette,Hi. Excuse me.Hi.You called and you said my kids are here?
Lynette,"Oh,my god!"
Lynette,"Honey,I was so worried about you."
Lynette,Thank you.Thank you so much.
Lynette,"Oh,yes.Oh,yeah,me too. Thank you."
Lynette,"Yes! Yeah,no,I know."
Lynette,"Well,uh,okay,I know how this looks,but I have to tell you,I left them with a very reliable baby-sitter."
Lynette,"Are you judging me?Because if you are,you couldn't say anything"
Lynette,What?!
Lynette,"Well,thank you so much!"
Lynette,Come on out.
Lynette,You were sleeping?
Lynette,"Okay,all right,that lie just lost you another week of TV and video game privileges.That's two.You wanna keep talking and lose more?Then apologize to Mrs. Van de Kamp."
Lynette,"All right,go back in."
Lynette,I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Lynette,Hey!
Lynette,Yeah.It was cleared up.It was just a little confusion.
Lynette,Excuse me?
Lynette,What?
Lynette,That's ridiculous.
Lynette,I've known Bree for years and years.There's no way she was drinking while baby-sitting my kids.So--just go spread your poison somewhere else. Okay?
Lynette,"Okay,well,thanks."
Lynette,"Hi.You,um,you recovered from all of yesterday's excitement?"
Lynette,"Yeah,although I-I still can't figure out how my boys managed to sneak past you."
Lynette,"They're like lightning.It's just,Penny--"
Lynette,"Well,I mean,I just don't understand how Porter and Preston managed to wrangle her into the stroller and then make it out your front door without you even noticing.I guess if you'd fallen asleep--it could've happened like that,I-I guess."
Lynette,"Look,I apologize in advance for how this is going to sound,but I have to ask. It's just gonna eat away at me.Were you drinking while baby-sitting my kids?"
Lynette,"Oh,gosh,you got drunk,and you passed out."
Lynette,Really?Is that why you passed out on your front lawn yesterday morning?
Lynette,"You put my kids in danger,and then you lied about it.Do you not get how big that is?Do you have some kind of problem with alcohol?"
Lynette,"On any given day,how many glasses of wine do you put away?"
Lynette,"You put my kids in danger,and then you lied about it.Do you have some kind of problem with alcohol?"
Lynette,"So apparently Bree had a few too many and passed out.Next thing I know, I get a call at work--someone found my kids wandering the street."
Lynette,"No.I'm worried about her,but I don't know how I'm gonna get over what she did."
Lynette,It feels a little familiar.
Lynette,"No,I'm pretty sure the Lowell Group used Eskimos in a deodorant commercial they had last month. Remember?"
Lynette,"Yeah. No,I get the subtle distinction.I think we can do better.Okay? So,sally,you're up.What do you got for me?"
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,"If you really wanna do this now, shut the door.Okay,sure, I was a little bitchy.But you know why? You did a half-ass job in there."
Lynette,"Oh,please.I live with you.Last night, when you should've been trying to make that pitch work,you were watching the game."
Lynette,I saw you!
Lynette,Are you saying you gave your heart and soul to that Eskimo pitch?
Lynette,"Did you give it 100%?Well,exactly. So? Big deal.Go work up some new ideas,and then we'll go over it during lunch.Okay?"
Lynette,"Yes,I am."
Lynette,"So you want me to,uh--pitch you as parents?"
Lynette,"Oh. Well,you don't have to bribe me.We're all friends here."
Lynette,Oh! Uh-- I guess.
Lynette,I don't suppose you brought a corkscrew?
Lynette,"Oh,right,I was talking to Susan on the phone,and I left it in a little longer than I should've. Sorry."
Lynette,Is it that bad?
Lynette,"Oh,good.Parker,don't put your elbows on the table. Come on."
Lynette,Huh?
Lynette,"Tom,if you're gonna make a point,why don't you do it now before I hurl the plate at you?"
Lynette,Stop right there.This is meat loaf. Your presentation was business.
Lynette,"Okay.So if I apologize for upsetting you at work,can we get past it and enjoy our meal?"
Lynette,I'm sorry.I'm sorry. I am sorry.
Lynette,"So,boys,how do you enjoy the meat loaf?"
Lynette,Just eat it.
Lynette,Yeah.I wonder if there's any way that we can turn it around still.
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,Hi! What's up?
Lynette,What?
Lynette,"Of you? No,I'm not."
Lynette,"Are you serious?Tom,I wasn't doing anything.I was just going for it.I was just lost in the moment.Oh,come on!Come on,this is silly.I don't wanna argue.I mean,unless it turns you on.Does it? 'Cause thenI'm all about it,baby."
Lynette,What--what was what?
Lynette,"Okay,okay,can I just mention you're talking like a crazy person?"
Lynette,Is this about me being boss again?You gotta get over it.
Lynette,"Oh,that's ridiculous."
Lynette,Tom--
Lynette,"I am so sorry you feel that way,but you cannot put that on me.This is your life.You wanna run it?"
Lynette,What? Why?
Lynette,I'm sorry.I'm not following.
Lynette,"Aw,sweetie."
Lynette,Ew.
Lynette,"Yeah,yeah.Gotta love the thunderbolt."
Lynette,"Oh,yes!Of course you do.Still,you gotta love the thunderbolt."
Lynette,Sorry.
Lynette,"Nicholson will be coming in in about 15 minutes with a pitch,so let's grab everybody and make sure we're all on the same page."
Lynette,What's going on?
Lynette,"Ah,yeah--"
Lynette,"But,honey, it goes back and forth."
Lynette,"Mmm.Whoa. Hello.What's going on,huh?"
Lynette,"Oh,I get it. I get it.Ooh! This is your idea of driving the train.And it's very manly and really impressive,but it's really,really bad timing.You can't be serious.Mmm. We're gonna--we're gonna be late."
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"Word is out all over town that you're unhappy at Zimms,so why not jump ship and come to Parcher & Murphy?I swear, Veronica,you would fit in so well here."
Lynette,"Yeah, it sucks, but there are other perks--the expense account, the corner office--"
Lynette,"Fair enough, fair enough.Okay, what is your secret?How can you eat like that and keep your figure?"
Lynette,I didn't know you had a child.
Lynette,"Really, Veronica?Well, you know, there's another perk that I just thought of."
Lynette,"How can they not?For working parents like you and me, It's a necessity.So is the pot getting sweeter?"
Lynette,Parcher & Murphy is completely mother-friendly.No one would say a word.
Lynette,"Yeah?Well, that's fantastic!"
Lynette,I have absolutely no idea.Let's go hammer out the details.
Lynette,I love it. I just love it.Let get a copy to Ed.
Lynette,"Oh,shoot,I gotta take this one.I'm sorry. It's Tom."
Lynette,"Perfect! Take your time.Hey,honey.How's the Big Apple treating ya?Good. Did those,uh,snooty clients like your pitch?Well,that's perfect.Excellent."
Lynette,"Uh-huh.Um,I'm--I'm,um-- I'm gonna have--I'm gonna call you back."
Lynette,On page 6 is an example of the new print ad. Check it out.
Lynette,"Hey,hey,don't get me wrong.I find that as bizarreas you guys do.But right now this firm needs Veronica more than she needs us.Telling a mother how to raise her kids is an act of war.We will lose her."
Lynette,"Yeah,well,we'll just ask her to keep the blinds always drawn when she nurses."
Lynette,"Okay,so who's gonna tell her?"
Lynette,"No! No,uh,please,don't make me do it.Why don't you have Jerry tell her?"
Lynette,"Okay. But for the record,the team is made up of wimps."
Lynette,"Hey,Veronica.Hi,Donovan!My,he's getting big.How old is he?"
Lynette,"Oh,wow,he's such a big boy."
Lynette,"Hey,you know,breast-feeding on this schedule must be a real hassle.I remember I used to express my milk into a bottle.Made my life so much easier."
Lynette,The people in this office feel a little--concerned--that you're nursing a boy of Donovan's age.
Lynette,"Yeah,well,in the third world,they don't have juice boxes."
Lynette,"Come on,baby birds don't jump out of the nest.They need to be pushed."
Lynette,Ouch.
Lynette,"Oh,I'm sorry,honey.Your mom-- is in her office on a conference call,and she's busy,so you're just gonna have to wait,okay?"
Lynette,That's chocolate milk.I shouldn't be having it.Have you ever had any?
Lynette,"Follow me.Here. Go ahead,try it.Come on,you'll really like it.I promise.Come on,yeah.All the grown-ups are drinking it.Yeah,that's good.Just-- chug it on down.Good.You like that?"
Lynette,Hey.What's wrong?
Lynette,"Already?I mean,I'm sorry."
Lynette,"Oh,sweetie--I know that we wanna keep them young as long as we can,but kids grow up.They just do."
Lynette,Huh?
Lynette,"Wow,that is--really a bummer."
Lynette,"Oh,I don't wanna be mad anymore.and I'm so happy to hear all that,and I am so proud of you."
Lynette,I heard about that.Andrew's asking to be emancipated?
Lynette,"Well,it makes sense,I guess."
Lynette,"I,I'll focus on your good qualities."
Lynette,"All right.That's-- not why you came to apologize,is it?"
Lynette,To soften me up for the deposition.
Lynette,"And--so-- what,you want me to lie?Make you look good?"
Lynette,"Good.Because when I give my deposition,I'm goingto tell the truth."
Lynette,I don't know why I have to get dragged into this.What happened with my kids has nothing to do with Bree's situation with Andrew.Sit.
Lynette,"I'm sorry,Mr. Bormanis,but I'm not gonna testify.It just doesn't feel right to me."
Lynette,You're saying Bree did this?
Lynette,I'm just telling you what the lawyer said.
Lynette,"I don't either,but on the other hand,she spanked my kids,she lied about her drinking and I once saw her bitch slap her mother-in-law.So I'm torn."
Lynette,How can you be so sure?We have Andrew saying that it's systematic physical abuse.And then we have Bree saying it's Andrew wanting to be emancipated so he can get at his trust fund so he can buy a car.How are we supposed to know the real truth?
Lynette,"Yeah,you think so?Why don't you come over here for a second?I'd like to pick your brain.You're the demographic that my client is interested in,so you'd actually be doing me a favor if you drove it around for a couple hours,and tell me what you thought.Do you mind?"
Lynette,I can't believe you are old enough to drive.I still remember when you were 10 years old.I paid you a dollar to rake our leaves.
Lynette,"Uh,all the bells and whistles,but listen--I really wanted to tell you how sorry I am."
Lynette,Your lawyer came to see me.I'm going to be deposed.It's going to be hard for me--
Lynette,She must be.It's hard for me to imagine the Bree I know capable of hurting you.
Lynette,"Oh. Sure.Anyway,I just--I feel so guilty that this all went on in your house,right under our nose.So if there is anything I can do to help you--"
Lynette,"Um--actually,yeah.One of the perks.Even so,it's a little out of the price range of a high school student."
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"My kids don't wander.They scurry,like rats."
Lynette,"Do you know a rat can fit through a hole the size of a quarter?Anyway,my children have that trick down,too."
Lynette,"No,I don't hold her responsible.Bree van de Kamp and I have known each other a long time.I trust her completely.She's a wonderful friend and a fantastic mother.She puts the rest of us to shame."
Lynette,No.
Lynette,I was helping Bree with her recycling.
Lynette,"No,you don't.In fact,I hate liars."
Lynette,That's fantastic!
Lynette,Formula.
Lynette,Welcome to parenthood.Come on.
Lynette,There's a gift receipt taped to the bottom of the box.
Lynette,What is it?
Lynette,Teeth?
Lynette,"So,um--your message said that Parker had been involved in some sort of serious incident.What--what kind of incident?"
Lynette,What kind of cookie?
Lynette,"Oh,it doesn't.I'm just stalling because I am completely mortified."
Lynette,"Oh,my goodness."
Lynette,"Oh,right.That happened with dinosaurs."
Lynette,So you think that now he's obsessed with--
Lynette,Of course.I will talk to him.I'll talk to him till I'm blue in the face.I promise.Take care.
Lynette,"Sweetie?Um,could you put the Crayons down for a second?We need to talk.So I spoke to your teacher today,and she told me about the--cookie deal you made with Cindy Lou."
Lynette,"No,not exactly.I'm just--I'm trying to understand why you--did that."
Lynette,"Well--actually,he's kinda right. He's got the concept down."
Lynette,Daddy will be home from his business trip in a few days.Why don't you wait for him?
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"And then the mommy and the daddy,because they love each other so much,they hug.Real tight."
Lynette,"Oh,that's not important."
Lynette,"Parker,I'm your mother.Mothers don't lie to their sons.Now go wash your hands or Santa's not gonna bring you anything for Christmas."
Lynette,"Oh,wait a couple months. She'll start sleeping through the night."
Lynette,Good luck.
Lynette,I'm home.
Lynette,"Hey,Mrs. Mccluskey.So how did everything go?"
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,No.
Lynette,"Uh,yeah. Of course.No,sorry."
Lynette,"Oh-- that was me.He was asking about the birds and the bees, and I fudged a few of the details."
Lynette,Excuse me?
Lynette,That is ridiculous.
Lynette,"No,I'm not gonna shame my son."
Lynette,"I talked to Mrs. Mccluskey,and for god's sakes,Parker,you can't ask people things like that."
Lynette,Because--it's rude.
Lynette,"Well,that doesn't matter!You gotta quit talking to people about their bodies,and about where,you know,babies come from."
Lynette,Because it's not an appropriate subject.
Lynette,Because it's not.
Lynette,"Ugh!Because it's dirty and wrong, and I'll wash your mouth out with soap! That's why."
Lynette,Well-- it turns out we really needed one.You can go and play.
Lynette,But we're not presenting for another two weeks.Why don't we start tomorrow?
Lynette,What?
Lynette,That would explain all our working hours.
Lynette,"Hey, great.Let's go before he changes his mind."
Lynette,You're kidding!
Lynette,"Thanks, Jer."
Lynette,Yeah?
Lynette,Karl broke up with Edie.
Lynette,"Guys,I'm all for bashing exes,but let's save a little of our hate for his partner in crime--the other woman."
Lynette,"Yeah, ""honey,you're the love of my life.She's just the runner-up."""
Lynette,"Oh, my god!"
Lynette,"Ed? Hey,I'm so sorry,but obviously that was just meant for Tom's eyes only."
Lynette,"Okay.Thanks.Well,I'm gonna go back in my office and continue to feel like a huge pervert."
Lynette,"Well, we do the best we can given the circumstances."
Lynette,"I appreciate that.You know, Ed--I don't wanna pry into your personal business,but if you are having problems in that area,you don't have to be resigned to it."
Lynette,"I mean, you and Fran could spice it up a bit.You know, get the old juices flowing again."
Lynette,"Okay, well,that wasn't my best work,but you can't deny results.I.M.ing works,and when I go home tonight,Tom and I are going to--Okay, well,I'm gonna be exhausted,so I'll probably just lay there.But trust ,Tom is gonna go to town."
Lynette,"Okay!Uh, well,I hope that helped.And I'm just gonna go back and finish so we can all get out of here."
Lynette,"God,I don't know.I'm gonna go check with Ed."
Lynette,"Hey, any luckwith that I.M.ing thing?"
Lynette,"Okay, that's good.Then what?"
Lynette,You blocked?
Lynette,"You're an award-winning copywriter, Ed.You get paid to write."
Lynette,"For God's sakes,it's not brain surgery.Is she still online?"
Lynette,"Ugh.""I love the way that blouse clings to your body."""
Lynette,"Mnh-mnh-mnh.""Yeah? What did you want to do to me?"""
Lynette,"No,Ed,I'm not doing this for you!"
Lynette,What?
Lynette,Hey there.Did you have a late night?I hope.
Lynette,I didn't!I didn't.Why would she--oh!The honeymoon thing.
Lynette,"Oh, god!"
Lynette,You're getting divorced?
Lynette,What kind of terms?
Lynette,You're gonna fire me?
Lynette,What?!
Lynette,You can't make my husband your scapegoat.I won't let you.
Lynette,"He's under contract.If you just fire him,he'll sue you, and I'll back him up.You need cause."
Lynette,"If you just fire him,he'll sue you,and I'll back him up.You need cause."
Lynette,So you think you and Carlos will try for another adoption?
Lynette,"No,no,you should keep it."
Lynette,"Let me see.Gaby,she's being deported.Xiao-mei,is this the first letter like this you've received?"
Lynette,"Well,you've been working so hard,off on business trips all the time.Tonight,we throw caution and cholesterol to the wind.You deserve a little comfort food."
Lynette,"God,your mind goes to dark places."
Lynette,"Okay,well--remember I was helping Ed spark up his love life?"
Lynette,"Well,Fran found out that Ed didn't send them,and she blew her top.She wants the responsible party fired,and Ed lied and told her--that you sent them."
Lynette,I know.
Lynette,"Look,I know it's ridiculous,but Ed is not a rational person.Fran has him whipped,and a whipped husband is someone we must take very seriously."
Lynette,"You're under contract.Ed can't fire you unless he has just cause.So until this blows over,you have to be a model employee.Show up on time,no more 3-martini lunches,and above all,have ready all your presentations."
Lynette,"Well,honey,in all fairness--those are all things you should be doing anyway."
Lynette,I can't believe that son of a bitch hired a forensic accountant.He's more whipped than I thought.
Lynette,What? Yesterday you were up in arms.Now you're ready to cave?
Lynette,"No,no!We are not backing down.I'm gonna walk over to Ed's office right now,and I'm gonna make very clear that if you're out the door,I'm right behind ya."
Lynette,"Oh,it'll never happen.He knows this place will go down like a house of cards without me."
Lynette,"What,what?"
Lynette,We're a team.I'm just lending support.
Lynette,"Okay,go get him."
Lynette,Here are the numbers you wanted.
Lynette,"He's not answering his cell phone.But you don't have to worry,okay?You got what you wanted.He's out of the building."
Lynette,"You sure?I might punch you,too."
Lynette,"If this is where you want me to apologize for my husband,I'm not gonna do it.Maybe he shouldn't have hit you,but you provoked him."
Lynette,"No! I'm sorry,Tom gets punished beuse you can't deal with your screwed-up marriage.It is pathetic,Ed.If you had stood up to your wife in the first place,none of this--what?"
Lynette,What? That can't be right.
Lynette,That doesn't make any sense.There's gotta be some kind of an explanation for this.
Lynette,Hey. Hey!I didn't know if you were coming back.
Lynette,"So,um--what happened?You said you were just gonna go in there and talk to him."
Lynette,Anything else going on?
Lynette,I don't know.Anything you wanna talk about?'Cause there's nothing you couldn't tell me.I would understand.
Lynette,"I love you,too."
Lynette,You know what's weird?
Lynette,"In all the years we have been married,I have never seen you lead with your fists."
Lynette,Maybe you do.
Lynette,We're aware of that.
Lynette,Atlantic City?
Lynette,"Yeah, how, indeed?"
Lynette,I didn't say anything.
Lynette,"No! Except that I know you've been to Atlantic City three times in the last month without telling me.Ed found the receipts when he did the office audit.Other than that,no, nothing's wrong."
Lynette,"Tom, it would be better for your general well-being if you did not laugh at this moment in time."
Lynette,"I'm thinking, yeah, ruin it."
Lynette,I am-- so happy and I'm so relieved.
Lynette,No! Absolutely not.
Lynette,"No! Okay, a little bit.I'm sorry, I'm sorry.Ed found receipts for flowers and theater tickets.I mean, by the way, did you--"
Lynette,I knew that. You didn't have to tell me that.Why did you buy flowers for Milt's wife?
Lynette,Sorry. Stop. Done talking.That's fantastic.I love you!
Lynette,I got my boarding pass.
Lynette,"Is this crazy?Following Tom across the country just to spy on him?If he knewI was doing this--God, I don't think I can go through with this."
Lynette,"Do I? I'm happy.I mean, I was. Why don't I just look the other way and pretend nothing's wrong?Lots of women can do that."
Lynette,And what if I see him with another woman? What then?
Lynette,Hello?
Lynette,"Hey! Great.Great. How's Atlantic City?Are you, um, winning some money?"
Lynette,Yeah?You're quite a gambler.Where's Jerry?
Lynette,Great. Great.They're in the day care room.I'm-- looking at 'em right now.
Lynette,"Okay. Sure.First,can I talk to Jerry?"
Lynette,"Well, just, you know, say hello.It's been a long time."
Lynette,Uh-- no.
Lynette,"Whoa. That's weird kind of feedback.You know?Physics can be spooky that way.Listen, I gotta go.I gotta go.Ed is talking to me,and, um,I'll call you back later?"
Lynette,"Okay, bye."
Lynette,Hello?
Lynette,I can't. I can't.I'm sorry. I just can't.
Lynette,"Yeah. Hang on.I'll call you later. Okay, bye."
Lynette,Yeah?
Lynette,"He's not coming, sweetheart.But you could show me."
Lynette,--playing Russian roulette with my ovaries and--
Lynette,Hi.
Lynette,"Yeah. No, wait. Actually, wait.This is perfect.You know why? Because we need some impartial judges."
Lynette,"Let's suppose your husband begged you to get pregnant-- begged you--and out of the goodness of your heart, you agreed, even though it might derail your career.You agreed to a baby.A baby, singular."
Lynette,"Then--then you go in for an ultrasound, and you hear two heartbeats. Then and only then does your husband tell you that twins run in his family."
Lynette,"Your family had eight sets of twins over three generations, not to mention your relatives in Kentucky with triplets!Triplets! So I ask you, do I not deserve to punish this man severely?"
Lynette,"What are you, a scientist?"
Lynette,"I'm sorry that you saw my panic attack.I won't let it happen again, especially since this is my last pregnancy."
Lynette,"Well, don't encourage him."
Lynette,"Guys?Could you come here for a second?We need to have a serious talk. Okay, we have had a great-- vacation, but tomorrow we're going home, except we're not going to our home. We're gonna go stay with Grandma."
Lynette,"No, dad is not gonna be there, but he--he is gonna come and see you guys all the time.We are still gonna be a family.It's just-- we won't be living in the same place anymore.So--is there any questions you wanna ask me?"
Lynette,Would it be better if we came back at another time?
Lynette,What's this now?
Lynette,"Well, we already swam.Now it's time to pack.Hey, hey, hey!What's going on?"
Lynette,"Okay! okay, okay, Porter, just stop, all right? Just come on inside, and we'll forget the whole thing."
Lynette,"No, no!"
Lynette,He broke his arm.They took him up to x-ray.
Lynette,I've got nothing to say to you.I just called because I had to.
Lynette,"I am not interested, and if you wanna keep those fingers, I would move 'em away from my body. Thank you."
Lynette,I saw you with that woman.
Lynette,I don't care what her name is.
Lynette,Then why are you going to Atlantic City every other weekend to visit her?
Lynette,What?
Lynette,Uhh!
Lynette,Why did she wait so long to contact you?
Lynette,Not ready for that yet.
Lynette,You have no idea how badly you scared me.
Lynette,I had already let you go.
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,"Yeah, we're going home."
Lynette,"Not here, Penny.Mommy's gotta change you now 'cause you stink."
Lynette,No way.
Lynette,I said I wanted Penny.
Lynette,Eight hours of grueling labor.
Lynette,"Neither are stretch marks, but what are you gonna do?"
Lynette,Isn't your aunt named Penny?
Lynette,Our daughter is officially named.You may go now.
Lynette,"You promised me we'd stop at four.Remember?You wanted four kids, I wanted one, and somehow we compromised on four.Can we please stop now?"
Lynette,I will stop as soon as you promise.
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"Sweetie, sometimes when you're at work, and I'm home alone with three young boys, I'm not so happy, and now I'm gonna be alone with four kids. Each one is a blessing, yes, but I don't think I can take any more-- blessings.More blessings could make me lose my mind.Do you understand?"
Lynette,Thank you.
Lynette,Did it hurt for eight hours?
Lynette,"Okay, then."
Lynette,"I must have been crazy, agreeing to this."
Lynette,"I don't..Well, here goes."
Lynette,And you must be Nora.
Lynette,Probably.
Lynette,Business?
Lynette,We can't afford this.We have four kids.Tom just lost his job.That'd bankrupt us.
Lynette,How could he abandon her if he didn't even know she existed?
Lynette,"Are we just gonna keep talking louder?Is that the plan?You wanna just keep raising your voice 'cause that's how you get what you want, right?You make a scene, you throw a tantrum, and everyone gets scared and backs off.Well, I don't work that way, Lady.I don't care that my husband was so phenomenally stupid and or drunk to actually have sex with you.I'm not gonna let it ruin my life. Am I talking loud enough for that to get through to you?"
Lynette,I don't see another way to make this work.We've gotta dip into the pensions.
Lynette,"Well, it's that or the kids' college fund.We'll write Nora one big check, and in return, she'll sign away her claim for the back child support. If we're lucky, she'll take the bird in the hand."
Lynette,"Well, we need to show her we're serious. $30,000?"
Lynette,"If she takes you to court, we'll lose and end up paying 11 years of child support all at once. We could lose the house."
Lynette,"Tom!I am trying very hard to be strong right now, and you melting down is not helping me."
Lynette,"I know we're using up a huge chunk of our savings, but if it keeps that crazy woman out of our life,it is the best money we have ever spent.We will be okay."
Lynette,What if you pull out his key chain?
Lynette,"Sorry, that's Penny's baby monitor.It's always picking up weird frequencies."
Lynette,Hi. Did you get the check?
Lynette,Tom?!
Lynette,Really?
Lynette,My sincerest apologies.
Lynette,"Well, to be honest, first, we bought you pie, then you tried to extort money from us."
Lynette,"As the mother of 80% of Tom's children, I don't think it's in their best interest for you to drive us into bankruptcy."
Lynette,Sort of.
Lynette,"Like, five minutes from here Arden Drive?"
Lynette,"Well, to be clear, how are you going to live? How are you going to pay the mortgage?You don't have a job here."
Lynette,"Yeah, that would be a shame."
Lynette,Settle down.
Lynette,Kayla ready yet?
Lynette,No problem.She's a great little girl.
Lynette,"All right, let's do this.I'm just going to check the focus."
Lynette,Nora.
Lynette,Uh.What are you doing there?
Lynette,"Tom, could I, could I check your tie again?"
Lynette,"How about, ��_��_��_you're in the frame, Bitch, move."
Lynette,"No, I am sorry.How much of her crap do I have to put up with?First it's little drop bys, than she's inviting herself to dinner three times a week.Now she wants to be in our Christmas photo? I'm sorry, no, that is not happening."
Lynette,"Nora, this is just for our family.I would prefer if you weren't in it."
Lynette,"Fine, fine, no absolutely fine. Put ��_��_��_Crazy' at the end and we'll crop her out later."
Lynette,Ten seconds.
Lynette,"No, that's fine.Wow, white gloves.What are we having lunch in the 1880s."
Lynette,What are you being so coy about?
Lynette,She said coyly.
Lynette,Wow!
Lynette,You move fast.
Lynette,That's cute.
Lynette,Of course.
Lynette,And?
Lynette,I told her that we were picking up Kayla for a quiet afternoon at home.
Lynette,"Yeah, your damn straight I lied.I will not have that lunatic ruining one more family gathering."
Lynette,So what are you saying?You're more afraid of Nora that you are of me?
Lynette,Thank you.
Lynette,Hello.
Lynette,"Hey, Nora."
Lynette,"Shhh, Shh, Quiet, Shush!"
Lynette,"No, no, no, of course not. In fact we're just having a quiet afternoon at home.The kids are so bored Tom and I were thinking about taking them out for ice cream."
Lynette,"Oh, I will, I will.And I'll see you tonight."
Lynette,"No, I think she'll be over here in ten minutes."
Lynette,"Okay, now, move it.I've got ten bucks here for the kid who can carry the most stuff. Okay?"
Lynette,"Hey, Gaby, it's Lynette.Got a little emergency.Is it okay if we use your backyard? Great, great, and we take full responsibility for whatever the pony does.Hope you get this message soon.Oh!"
Lynette,"Okay, kids.Come on, Come on!"
Lynette,"Okay, all right, everybody's in."
Lynette,"Oh, crap!"
Lynette,"Hey, Nora, wow.We weren't expecting you until seven."
Lynette,I thought I told you Tom took the kids to the movies.
Lynette,"Ah hun, after the movies.Movies than ice cream.An American tradition.So is something wrong?"
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,"Oh, apology accepted.You want me to walk you to your car?"
Lynette,"Nora, look, I am sorry I lied.You know you gave me no choice."
Lynette,"No, I'm not telling."
Lynette,"No, no, no, no.You want in you're going to have to go through me."
Lynette,"I know you are Tom, and I know love her. Why else do you think I'm willing to put up with all this for six months?Why do you think I'm willing to say to my college roommates, ��_��_��_Yes, that's my husband's love child and her mother in our Christmas picture.Because I am your wife!You always come first with me.Do I still come first with you?"
Lynette,Thank you for that.
Lynette,Gonna go buy a pinata?
Lynette,"Personally, I love smoked rabbit, but for a sure crowd-pleaser you can't beat chicken."
Lynette,"Well, we are happy to pitch in."
Lynette,"He says he innocent. She believes him. If we say we don't, she'll just end up hating us."
Lynette,"Whenever, just go. You and Turk have a great time."
Lynette,Ah.
Lynette,She and Turk are going down to the river for the weekend.
Lynette,"Hey, hey, hey! Please!"
Lynette,You haven't even met him. He could be the sweetest man in the world.
Lynette,"More importantly, ever since he entered the picture, Squeaky Fromm is never around. It has been bliss! I haven't made this face. in a week. If you ruin this, so help me, I will hurt you!"
Lynette,"No, I'm good. Could be a monkey."
Lynette,"Nora, what are you doing back? Are you okay?"
Lynette,What's wrong?
Lynette,"What? No! No, no, no. What happened?"
Lynette,Right.
Lynette,"Okay, whoa, whoa, take a deep breath. You don't wanna break up with a guy because, in a weak moment, he calls you a whore."
Lynette,"Okay, but he didn't, he didn't, and you know until--"
Lynette,I'm on the side of love. You guys seem like such a perfect couple.
Lynette,"I just, I, I, you know, you don't wanna throw that all away 'cause of a little fight with no hitting."
Lynette,"Oh, I'm working on a seating chart for Bree's wedding."
Lynette,I did. We need to find her another boyfriend and weddings are crawling with single men.
Lynette,"Hey, sacrifices must be made, Tom!"
Lynette,"Oh, there are other urologists in the world. Go back to that other guy."
Lynette,"Oh, it's once a year. Suck it up."
Lynette,"Get a grip? I am hanging on for dear life, here. You are the one that brought this little problem into our family and the only thing I should be hearing from you is 'how can I help?' I am also putting Steve Hansen at her table so you might want to start shopping around for a new golf buddy."
Lynette,Get a grip.
Lynette,"So, he was an actual suspect?"
Lynette,The point is Alma disappeared under very suspicious circumstances.
Lynette,You know what's really bad luck? Marrying a wife killer.
Lynette,"Hey, look at you. Miss Popular. So, you having a good time over there?"
Lynette,All of them? What about Jerry? Jerry's fun.
Lynette,Um. How about Steve? You know what? I hear his family has money.
Lynette,"Hey, Carlos. You should come over to our table. That's where all the hotties are."
Lynette,"Hey, I just brought two lost souls together. Okay, how about this? He cheated on my friend. He deserves every bit of crazy she's gonna rain down on him."
Lynette,What are they doing?
Lynette,Uh oh.
Lynette,They are just two random people who met at a wedding. Can't pin it on me.
Lynette,"Well, I thought you might need a change of clothes. Yeah, you're still mad at me, huh?"
Lynette,"I'm sorry, I was desperate. I had a little too much to drink and you are divorcing Carlos."
Lynette,You're right. You are right. You're right. I'm so sorry. It's just--
Lynette,"I'm so unhappy. Ever since that woman pushed her way into our lives I can't even work up a smile. And the more she pushes the more I resent Tom. Tom. For something he did twelve years ago. And I'm afraid if I can't fix this, that the anger is just going to fester until.."
Lynette,"No, seriously, Gaby, I am so tired of pretending to smile."
Lynette,Yeah? How can you be so sure?
Lynette,"No, no, you'll be fine."
Lynette,"No, no.What's unfair is that we're slowly running out of money and you've barely even looked for a job. You're going to have a good time, all right? I love you. Bye."
Lynette,Hi.I'm ready.
Lynette,Ummm.
Lynette,Gaby!
Lynette,Could you be all about shutting up!
Lynette,Thanks.
Lynette,"No, no, no, no!"
Lynette,NO!
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,So?
Lynette,"Oh, well why don't you take a muscle relaxant."
Lynette,"Well, why don't you give them to the kids?"
Lynette,"Please, Tom, please!Don't do this to me!"
Lynette,"Allllll right. Yeah.I will be there as soon as I can.God, I hate my life."
Lynette,What are you doing here?
Lynette,"Hitch?You mean, like, we're going to be driving in the car together?"
Lynette,"Ah, it's like an eight hour drive."
Lynette,"Ah, how far is the impound lot because, you know, I would just drive you over there--"
Lynette,"Ah, I don't have a problem.I just don't think we both need to go up there.I can grab Kayla and bring her back."
Lynette,"Yeah, I do mind. I mind deeply."
Lynette,"Oh, that's-- delightful. That's delightful. Maybe it'll just soak up the cream soda you spilled."
Lynette,"No, my favorite game is counting all the things I'm dying to say to you but I don't. Like--��_��_��_Pipe down, you annoying nut job.' I'd never say that."
Lynette,No! You're colorful.Colorful in a way that might respond to medication.
Lynette,"Ah! Oh, my God! Knock it off! What is the matter with you?! What is wrong with you? What the hell do you think you're doing?"
Lynette,"No, well, it wasn't funny. If you wanna kill yourself, fine, but don't take me with you."
Lynette,"That is not what I'm saying. But if you did, I'd find a way to carry on."
Lynette,"Oh, lighten up. It's a joke."
Lynette,Nah.
Lynette,"All right, all right, all right, all right. I'm pulling over! Jeez! What the hell are you doing?!"
Lynette,Nora! You can't be serious!
Lynette,"All right, now look, you've gone from crazy to stupid. This guy could be dangerous."
Lynette,"See?This is what you do. You just manipulate. You wormed your way into my family. You conned your way into coming on this trip with me, and now you wanna force me into saving you. Well, forget it! You wanna go, go."
Lynette,What happened to your ride?
Lynette,"Oh, my God, Nora. Did you actually-- Well, I'm-- I'm very sorry. I had no idea. But your life is better now, right? You have a beautiful daughter, and you have that fun job at the--pancake house."
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,Excuse me? Did you smoke that bong before you beat the guy with it?
Lynette,"And you think that's easy? Okay, I have a good life. Yes, yes, I am very lucky, but I work twelve hours a day, and then I come home to what seems like thirty three children, and husband who refuses to get a job. And believe me, there is not a supermom out there who wouldn't trade in her cape, for a chance to read a book and get a massage by a man who has the decency to leave when it's over."
Lynette,I'm sorry I said that about Tom. He's doing his best to find a job.
Lynette,He doesn't hate advertising.
Lynette,He said that to you? He's never told me that.
Lynette,Why would he be afraid?
Lynette,How's your back?
Lynette,"Well, you're under a lot of stress. You got a new kid in the family. You're job hunting."
Lynette,"No, I don't wanna fight. In fact, I was thinking--If you can't find something you like in advertising, maybe you should cast a wider net."
Lynette,You're a bright guy.Isn't there anything else you might wanna do?
Lynette,"Okay, let's call that the backup plan. But, seriously, don't you have some road not taken, some dream you never got around to?"
Lynette,Maybe?
Lynette,"Well, think about it, okay? Cause whatever you wanna do, I'm in your corner."
Lynette,Tell me something I don't know.
Lynette,"Hey, Parker, where's your uniform? You got your game in an hour."
Lynette,What?
Lynette,"Well, Daddy should have checked with mommy, so she could have a chance to tell him why he's wrong. Hey, you're playing."
Lynette,"It is not fake. There is not a team I know that could get along without their backup far right fielder. Okay, come on, let's go practice."
Lynette,"All right, let's try it again. Nice and easy. Watch the ball hit the bat. You ready? You can do it. Here we go. Okay, Parker, I keep telling you, you gotta keep your eyes open. How are you gonna hit the ball when you're doing this?"
Lynette,"If I threw any slower, we would be bowling."
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,I'll tell you what we're not doing--quitting.
Lynette,He's got five more games in the season. He made a commitment. He's gonna see it through.
Lynette,"Yeah, well, that's not the point.What kind of message are we sending if we let him quit whenever the going gets rough?"
Lynette,"Well, it's called parenting, Tom.Watch and learn.Okay, P-dog, this is a curveball. Again, opening the eyes--can't stress it enough."
Lynette,"Hey, did I tell you that, uh, Burnham Fox is looking for a new creative director?"
Lynette,"Easy hours, big paycheck, access to great parties--yeah, what was I thinking?"
Lynette,"Look, I was just making conversation. Batter up!"
Lynette,"Come on, Parker! Keep your eye on the ball!"
Lynette,"Hey, people, he's just a kid, okay?"
Lynette,"Hey, hey, that is not helpful. It only takes one, Parker! Only takes one!"
Lynette,"Yeah, guy's a machine. Who is that kid?"
Lynette,The kid's got an arm like a 13-year-old.
Lynette,"I'm gonna go buy him an ice cream. It's okay, P-dog. You're gonna get 'em the next inning! So tell me, what else do you know about this Nicky kid?"
Lynette,"Hey, give the kid what he wants."
Lynette,"That's right. Come. Walk with me. So, money's a little tight, huh?"
Lynette,"Yeah, I heard your old man's out of work. That's gotta be tough."
Lynette,"No! A kid's gotta have an allowance. How else you gonna buy the things you want, right? Like that cotton candy. That's a little piece of heaven, huh? Hey, I got an idea. Maybe we could help each other out. My son's having a little trouble hitting the ball."
Lynette,Yeah. Ever seen one of these?
Lynette,"Yeah, well, after all those fastballs--come on, Parker! You can do it!"
Lynette,"Oh, my God! Yes!"
Lynette,"Absolutely. If he's cheating, he could bring home a disease."
Lynette,"So if Tom was cheating, you wouldn't tell me?"
Lynette,"Aw, you're sweet. Bree, I'm sorry. I think you gotta follow your heart on this one, even if it isn't the easiest thing to do."
Lynette,What'd the coach say?
Lynette,That's not fair! It's not his fault!
Lynette,"Not Nicky, too!"
Lynette,I was trying to repair my son's shattered self-esteem.
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,"Well, excuse me for not wanting my son to be a quitter."
Lynette,Whoa. Where'd that come from?
Lynette,That is not true!
Lynette,"I just figured, since you're taking your time figuring out what your dream even is, you might wanna make a few bucks in the meantime. I have a dream, too. It includes keeping this house."
Lynette,"No.It was excitement, because we have just decided you don't have to play baseball anymore. Ha! Isn't that great?"
Lynette,Huh?
Lynette,This is all my fault. Why punish Parker?
Lynette,"Just one more game.He'll suck, the other kids will taunt him, and he'll wanna quit again.See, everybody wins."
Lynette,Please? You can't bend the rules just once?
Lynette,Are you asking for a bribe?
Lynette,I'll get my checkbook.
Lynette,Two bribery scandals. Gotta count the batting helmets.
Lynette,Good.
Lynette,No.
Lynette,"Okay, well, maybe a little."
Lynette,You get to chase your dream while I get to spend the rest of my life in advertising.
Lynette,"Maybe I'd like to write a book Or, you know, start my own magazine. And then I think, no, I can't. I have a family to support, and I am okay with that--"
Lynette,#NAME?
Lynette,"Don't you dare! You are gonna chase your dream, And I am gonna support you 99 % of the time."
Lynette,How the hell did he do that?
Lynette,"Oh, he's never gonna quit now!"
Lynette,"I don't know how these rumors get started. No, Parker only quit the team 'cause he hurt his ankle."
Lynette,"Whatever you wanna do,I'm in your corner."
Lynette,"Wow, you're pretty good at that."
Lynette,Hi. Yes-- I am. What is all this?
Lynette,What are we celebrating?
Lynette,"Thanks. No, seriously, though."
Lynette,"Oh, my God! You know what you wanna do! That's fantastic! What is it?"
Lynette,"Okay, okay, I'm dying here. What's the dream?"
Lynette,Excuse me?
Lynette,"No, that was a real Frisbee to the head, that one."
Lynette,Isn't he the one that asked us for a loan last Christmas?
Lynette,Hmm.
Lynette,I think-- I'm gonna open another bottle of wine.
Lynette,"Well, hey, we're celebrating, right?"
Lynette,Mm-hmm.
Lynette,"I know, but I said that I would support him and help him follow his dream."
Lynette,Yeah--how's that divorce going?
Lynette,"Hey, Parker, be careful up there.I just keep thinking he's gonna come to his senses and realize it's a bad idea."
Lynette,Why?
Lynette,"Care to elaborate, Dr. McCluskey?"
Lynette,"Oh, great. So, uh, Tom will drop her off at your house on Friday."
Lynette,Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Lynette,"No, not really."
Lynette,And make Tom resent me for the rest of his life. I don't think so.
Lynette,"That's great. Hey, can we talk about this restaurant thing for a second?"
Lynette,"I don't know if you noticed,but when you first pitched the whole pizza concept--I was a wee bit skeptical."
Lynette,"Of course you did, 'cause you're a smart guy, which is also why you are gonna jump on the idea I have to make the whole thing work."
Lynette,"No. No, no, no, I am totally on board."
Lynette,I'm thinking--catering company.
Lynette,"Start small, have an Italian theme,create some cash flow, and then later on,expand into the pizza thing."
Lynette,"Well, think about it. You're gonna do all these fun parties. People will start talking-- ""Hey, this is great food. This guy should open a restaurant."" ""Yeah, yeah, I'd eat there,"" and then wham! Five short years later, you have a built-in customer base.��_��_"
Lynette,"I know, I know. Catering's how you get there."
Lynette,"Because you'll fail! I'm sorry! God.I shouldn't have said that.But you're gambling with our life savings, and you have no experience."
Lynette,I'm trying to.I am trying to. But are you aware that 90% of restaurants tank in their first year?
Lynette,"Tom, I--"
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"Oh, dear god."
Lynette,It's a dump! What are you thinking?
Lynette,It's a burner-downer.
Lynette,"Well, I just don't. Tom, you know how I feel about this pizza thing."
Lynette,Don't tell me. You didn't sign a lease.
Lynette,Tom! No.
Lynette,You leased a building without telling me?
Lynette,"Okay.Okay, here's what we're going to do. You said there were multiple offers, so we can sublease. Now let's get the hell out of here."
Lynette,My mistake. I assumed you'd have a dream worth supporting.
Lynette,Fine.
Lynette,"Well, that sort of depends on daddy."
Lynette,"Yeah. A little.But that's okay.That's okay.We still love each other very much.But just like kids, sometimes grown-ups throw tantrums and need a time-out."
Lynette,"'Cause he decided to take it in his pizza place.Not this pizza place.It's a rat hole.But once your dad comes to his senses and stops being petulant, he'll come home."
Lynette,"It means childish, stubborn, careless with my money and your futures."
Lynette,"It's a grown-up word, and when daddy comes home, you'll learn a new one: grovel."
Lynette,"Hey, you."
Lynette,I suckered McCluskey into taking the kids for a while so I could kick back and catch up with my old friend margarita. You care to join us?
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,You were trying to figure out how to kill Edie without doing time.
Lynette,"Fine, Gaby! Don't say hi!"
Lynette,We're numbing the pain of our miserable lives.
Lynette,"Oh, I know them. They live on Cypress. They just celebrated their fifty-third wedding anniversary."
Lynette,I'll take a wild guess. The man never opened a pizza place.
Lynette,Bite on this.
Lynette,"Oh, god, here she goes again. What grade is he in?"
Lynette,"Yeah, he's hot."
Lynette,"Well, maybe you should try to patch things up with him."
Lynette,"I brought this on myself. I tell Tom, ��_��_��_I want you to be your own man.' But the truth is, I don't. I want him to have what he wants if it's what I want. I'm a bitch with a capital C."
Lynette,"Look, Susan, god called you a cab."
Lynette,"Mm-hmm. Yeah, you are!"
Lynette,"Go, Ida!"
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,"Oh, just a quiet night with the girls."
Lynette,"Oh, stop right there. I am the one who should apologize. I have been a bad wife."
Lynette,"Yeah, well, any wife can support a husband who never takes risks, and I don't want that kind of husband, and I'll be damned if I'm gonna be that kind of wife. So you open your pizza place, and we will find a way to make it work."
Lynette,Mmm. So what happened tonight?
Lynette,Ding-dong.
Lynette,I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that. Why don't you just come on over here and say that to me again?
Lynette,I have been trying to stay away from you--
Lynette,"Everything's all right, so you can just go back into your room and play."
Lynette,"Okay. Never mind. I'm leaving. First, I'm just gonna give your mom a hug."
Lynette,"Your association with my family is over. When Kayla comes to visit, you will drop her at the end of the block. You will never again see my husband, and if you try to, I will do to your spine what I just did to your front door. Nod if you understand."
Lynette,"And you, I'm gonna see you on Saturday, right? Don't forget your swimsuit."
Lynette,You will never again see my husband.
Lynette,"Hey! Mary Alice, are you okay?"
Lynette,Okay. See you later.
Lynette,I had the Mary Alice dream again last night.
Lynette,I haven't had it for months. I don't know why it came back.
Lynette,"It was awful, as always. I saw she was in pain, and I just walked away and--"
Lynette,"And that's what I did, nothing."
Lynette,Do you think he knows Mary Alice shot herself in his living room?
Lynette,"Whoa, what fresh hell is this?"
Lynette,"Whoa! Whoa, whoa! You have stepped onto my property, and you've talked to Tom. That's two rules you've broken, and I'm not sure that top doesn't make three."
Lynette,You're the lunatic if you think I'm letting you anywhere near my husband.Just drop Kayla off and go.
Lynette,She's Tom's daughter. You can't just take her out of the country.
Lynette,It's fine with me--soon as you figure out a way to leave your genitals here.
Lynette,"See?This is exactly what she wants.She takes Kayla,and I get blamed.Well,screw her.Let's sue for custody."
Lynette,You bet I would. Kayla will be much better off without Crazy in her life.
Lynette,I am right there with you.
Lynette,"I don't, but I didn't want the first four, and they're starting to grow on me."
Lynette,I'll look as soon as I get back from the store.
Lynette,"Well, you're gonna love the neighborhood. Are you all moved in?"
Lynette,"Oh, yeah, I heard she isn't well. Can I ask what's wrong with her?"
Lynette,"Oh, that's rough. Excuse me."
Lynette,"Hey, Nora. How's tricks? I thought it was your car I saw in the lot."
Lynette,"Ah, I see you've heard from our lawyer."
Lynette,Even you have to admit Kayla would be better off with us than in a dingy apartment over a Tijuana strip club.
Lynette,"You went after my husband. If anyone should be afraid, it's you."
Lynette,"Sweetie, it's Mommy. I need to talk to Daddy."
Lynette,Tell him I said to share. Now put Daddy on.
Lynette,"Put Daddy on, and I'll buy you a real robot."
Lynette,A big one with laser beam eyes. Now go get Daddy!
Lynette,Shh! She told us not to talk.
Lynette,"Nora, please!"
Lynette,I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We'll-- we'll be quiet.
Lynette,"Nora, shut up!"
Lynette,"No!I-- we're--we have--we're sharing custody,and then,she tried to seduce my husband, so--"
Lynette,"Okay, I gotta keep the pressure up to stop the bleeding!"
Lynette,You are gonna get through this just fine. There is a parking lot full of ambulances out there. You gotta let us take her out of here!
Lynette,"Oh, forget it! Forget it! We'll work that out later."
Lynette,"Okay, I'm listening."
Lynette,"Yeah, yes, I will, I will, I will. I will love her like she is my own. I will, Nora. Nora? Nora!"
Lynette,How can you say that?
Lynette,I did not want this. Don't you dare say that I wanted this.
Lynette,"No, I will not shut up! What's the matter with you?!"
Lynette,"Who cares?!Who cares?We all have pain! Everyone in here has pain, but we deal with it! We swallow it and get going with our lives! What we don't do is go around shooting strangers!"
Lynette,"Well, maybe you deserved to be cheated on!I'm.. I'm-- I'm sorry.I shouldn't have said that."
Lynette,"Hey! Mary Alice, are you okay?"
Lynette,Okay. I'll see you later.
Lynette,"No, you're not. I can tell. Please-- Tell me what's wrong. Let me save you."
Lynette,Why not?
Lynette,Isn't there anything I can do?
Lynette,He's a bachelor.
Lynette,"Hey.Hey!Oh, my gosh! You didn't have to do this!Hi!"
Lynette,"Yeah, um, listen, about that--the kids don't know what happened."
Lynette,"I thought they were little young to deal with their mother getting shot. All I told them is Kayla is staying with her grandmother, and I made up a story about how I got hurt."
Lynette,"Oh, here they are! Hey!"
Lynette,"Hello. Oh, this side. Hi!"
Lynette,Yeah--
Lynette,"Well, let's see how well you do on a morphine drip."
Lynette,"Fantastic! Lead the way, I'm coming in."
Lynette,"There she is! Hi, my little bunny!"
Lynette,I've gotta--
Lynette,Okay?
Lynette,"Hi, bunny. I'll be right there."
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,"Uh, yeah."
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,"I'm good. I just, how do I thank the man who saved my life?"
Lynette,I'm gonna make you a cake.
Lynette,Yeah. I never make cakes. This is huge.
Lynette,"Yeah, I'm gonna make you a cake."
Lynette,That would be great. I really appreciate it. Okay. Thank you.
Lynette,He said take as much time as I want with pay.
Lynette,"Hey, there they are!"
Lynette,Shot? Where did you hear that?
Lynette,"Okay, listen, kids. I am sorry. We shouldn't have lied, but sometimes parents wanna protect the kids from scary things."
Lynette,Or wherever.
Lynette,"No, no, afraid not."
Lynette,"Hey, sweetheart, you okay?"
Lynette,She won't.
Lynette,"Well, because she's--"
Lynette,Or wherever.
Lynette,"Okay, I should be back at around six o'clock. They can have one snack. Try and push apples, but if they threaten violence, I have an emergency candy bar under the sink."
Lynette,"Oh, jeez."
Lynette,To the market.
Lynette,"Hey, sweetie, it's a different market."
Lynette,"No, I won't. Lots of mommies go to the store every day, and they're fine. It's really not a scary place."
Lynette,"I'm only gonna be in there ten minutes, I promise."
Lynette,Thanks.
Lynette,"Hey, buddy, you've been reading comic books for a while. Don't you wanna go and play?"
Lynette,Yeah? Okay.
Lynette,"Hey, Art."
Lynette,"Good, uh, listen, as if saving my life wasn't enough, I have a little favor to ask."
Lynette,My kids are having a hard time. They're pretty freaked out by that whole supermarket thing.
Lynette,Not so much them.
Lynette,"But my other son, Parker. So. Back to the favor."
Lynette,"Hey, Parker. I want you to meet our new neighbor, Art. He lives in the house across the street. His sister has the cool wheelchair with the joystick."
Lynette,"In the daytime, Art coaches swimming at the Rec Center, but, please, I can tell Parker? Please?"
Lynette,"It's okay.You can trust him,really.Art is the one who saved me at the supermarket.He's sort of a superhero."
Lynette,He really did. That's why you don't have to worry. That's Protector Man's job. Your job is to run and play and have fun. Okay?
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,Shh! That's a secret. Hello? Hello?
Lynette,"Hey, don't touch anything. I'm just gonna write a note, and then we'll go."
Lynette,"Parker? Hey! Come back here! Honey? Come on, we're leaving. Parker. Parker, come on, we're leaving. Why didn't you come when I called?"
Lynette,"Parker, come on, we're gonna get out of here."
Lynette,"Oh, I just say so. Come on."
Lynette,Hello?
Lynette,"I am telling you, our neighbor is a pedophile, and I expect you to do something about it."
Lynette,He's a single man with a basement full of toys!
Lynette,"You don't get it. His house had this creepy vibe. Tell him, Tom."
Lynette,"Okay, he wasn't there. He doesn't know. Look, he had a wall full of pictures of half-naked boys in swimsuits."
Lynette,"What are you, his lawyer? You have to admit, it's odd."
Lynette,He wasn't technically home when I went inside.
Lynette,The door was open--I was bringing him a cake.
Lynette,It was a thank you cake. He sort of saved my life.
Lynette,"He doesn't care about the cake, Tom."
Lynette,I'm not snapping at you.
Lynette,"I am snapping because there is a monster across the street, and Barney Fife here is making me sound like the bad guy!"
Lynette,What are the Blake kids doing all the way over here? Pam needs to keep a closer eye on them.
Lynette,Take a nap.
Lynette,Hold on.
Lynette,"Hey, what's up?"
Lynette,Oh! Good.
Lynette,Bye.
Lynette,Sorry?
Lynette,I didn't notice.
Lynette,"Oh, sorry. Never made it past the living room."
Lynette,"Well, I don't."
Lynette,"Great, great."
Lynette,"Hey, hey, not now, Parker."
Lynette,I thought you were gonna mow the lawn.
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"I'm sorry, guys, I just--I guess I was really tired. Where's your brother?"
Lynette,"What--okay, watch her!"
Lynette,Watch her. I'll be back. I'll be right back.
Lynette,Hello? Open up! Open the door!
Lynette,I want my son.
Lynette,"He's not at our house, he's not in our yard. Do not jerk me around."
Lynette,Parker!
Lynette,Don't play dumb with me. I know exactly what is down here! Where's the pinball? Where's all the games?
Lynette,"Did you donate the photos, too? Parker!"
Lynette,Don't pretend you don't know. I'm calling the police. Parker!
Lynette,You're damn right there's a problem. I can't find my son.
Lynette,"Hey, hey! Where have you been?"
Lynette,That proves nothing. He knew I was on to him. He had to dump it someplace.
Lynette,What if Parker had been in there?
Lynette,Please don't bring up the supermarket again.
Lynette,You're right. I need to talk to someone.
Lynette,"He'd gotten rid of everything--the toys, the pictures, everything was gone."
Lynette,"I know! If something happened to someone's kid because I kept my mouth shut--the thing is, I promised Tom I'd back off."
Lynette,He's a bachelor who lives with his invalid sister.
Lynette,Our neighbor is a pedophile.
Lynette,"Well, believe me, Rita, he scares me, too. You know what? We should have a meeting, get all the moms together and figure out what to do about this guy. Saturday, your house. Sounds good."
Lynette,"Hey, Rita, I gotta go."
Lynette,"Sorry, I can't talk now. I have somewhere to go."
Lynette,I'm not sad. He shouldn't be around kids. I saw those pictures.
Lynette,You can defend him all you want. I know what I know.
Lynette,"Well, I am sorry that happened."
Lynette,"I have kids, okay? Better safe than sorry."
Lynette,I'll do the chips. You deal.
Lynette,"Guys, why has it been so long since we've played poker? I really need this."
Lynette,Hey! How you doing?
Lynette,"Hey, why don't we start that girl talk?"
Lynette,"Okay, okay, we've all made some excellent points and blown off a little steam. Whoo! Let's play some cards."
Lynette,"We're not gonna play cards, are we?"
Lynette,"Oh, I'm not taking sides."
Lynette,"Thanks so much, Rita. I think it's such a good idea that we all get together and talk and--Wow."
Lynette,Wow. What is all this?
Lynette,A protest?
Lynette,I'm sorry. I thought we were all gonna talk about how to keep an eye on this guy.
Lynette,"Well, that's what we think, but we don't exactly have proof."
Lynette,"But, see, the only reason they fired him is because people were gossiping, and the only reason they're gossiping is because of what I told Mrs. McCluskey."
Lynette,So that people could watch their kids and be vigilant.
Lynette,"Yep. Go ahead, say it. I know you want to."
Lynette,I know. But be fair. There is no way I could've anticipated this.
Lynette,"Excuse me, can you tell me what happened?"""
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,Stop it! Stop it! You can't do this to people! Have you lost your minds?!
Lynette,"Well, that's my home, and I don't feel very safe right now. Please, please, all of you, just leave this street. Please, I beg of you. Go! Just get off my street, please!"
Lynette,"Wait, wait! Art, wait, I'm sorry--I'm sorry."
Lynette,"I heard about Rebecca on the news. If there's anything I can do to help, I--With the funeral arrangements, or, uh--help you call relatives--"
Lynette,"Oh! Of course! I feel just terrible. I mean, if you knew, if you could just know how sorry I am."
Lynette,What do you mean?
Lynette,You can't stay here.
Lynette,Where are you going?
Lynette,I will love her like she is my own.
Lynette,"Well, the police did arrest Mike. I mean, I know you think he's innocent, but surely you can understand why Bree's feelings have changed."
Lynette,Of course you did.
Lynette,"Okay,they're here. Now listen, stand up. Kayla has been through a lot, so when she walks in the door, I want you to make her feel welcome, okay? Give her a hug and be really nice."
Lynette,"Well, nicer than that, or she's gonna get all your toys, too."
Lynette,"Hey, hey, hey!"
Lynette,"Hi, Kayla! We missed you! We're so glad you're here. Okay, boys."
Lynette,"Good.Yeah, okay.So give her some room.Hey,wow,look,are those presents for Kayla?Yes,they are."
Lynette,"Hey,look at that. Preston gave you a harmonica. Isn't that cool? Oh ""Harriet the Spy."" Sounds mysterious."
Lynette,"And what did you get for her, Porter?"
Lynette,"Porter! I--you know what? I got you something, too."
Lynette,"This is Nellie. My grandma gave her to me when I was little, and I was hoping you could take care of her for me."
Lynette,She didn't seem that knocked out by it.
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"Dinner's ready. Kayla, I made your favorite--tacos. Here you go."
Lynette,"Oh, sorry, sweetheart. He's working late, trying to get the restaurant ready. Oh, lovely, Parker. Go wash your hands. Go on."
Lynette,"Kayla, where you going?"
Lynette,"Oh, sweetie, we don't watch TV during dinner."
Lynette,"Well, I'm sorry. Those are the rules."
Lynette,Well--just this once.
Lynette,"Okay, okay, I know what you're thinking, but--Kayla's going through a hard time right now. Come and sit down. Letting her watch TV is like me letting you eat ice cream when you're sick."
Lynette,"Well, that's true, but she's sad."
Lynette,Eat your tacos.
Lynette,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Sit your butts down!"
Lynette,I don't care. We have rules.
Lynette,She is special. Now sit down. Come on.
Lynette,"No. First, she ripped off its arms, stuffed it with chili. Then she threw it in the trash."
Lynette,Nothing.
Lynette,"Well, I didn't know what else to do. I'm trying to win over a little girl who clearly doesn't want a new mother."
Lynette,You know what might solve something?If you were home once in a while.You're the one she listens to.
Lynette,"I know, I know. I know."
Lynette,Yeah. I should treat her as badly as I treat my own children.
Lynette,"All right, let's hit it. Now come on, Kayla."
Lynette,"Well, I'm sorry,but we gotta go. I have a dinner party I have to get to."
Lynette,"Well, they, you know, wolfed it down like kids are supposed to. So-- hurry it up."
Lynette,"Kayla, I'm not fooling around. We--we're going."
Lynette,"Mm-hmm. Okay. Boys, go to the car. I'll be out in a minute. Go. Listen, sweetheart, I don't blame you for being angry. Your mom's gone,and you're stuck with me. But--the last thing she said to me was, ""promise you'll take care of Kayla,"" and I am going to. But you're gonna have to help me, okay?"
Lynette,"Okay, let's go."
Lynette,"Hey,whoa!Whoa,whoa,whoa!Okay. What the hell are you doing?! Stop, stop! Stop screaming! Stop!"
Lynette,"Guys, how would you like to eat dinner in front of the television for a whole week?"
Lynette,Kids. They're always rough housing.
Lynette,So you have been in Canada this entire time?
Lynette,"Well, you gotta hand it to her. Just when you think Bree's thrown every conceivable theme party she hosts a ""shame on you for thinking my husband killed someone"" dinner."
Lynette,Okay. You go--
Lynette,"Oh, dear God."
Lynette,"Hey, stranger."
Lynette,You have good timing. I just got all the kids to sleep.
Lynette,"Well, you could tuck me in."
Lynette,Hi.
Lynette,Mmm.
Lynette,He already did.
Lynette,Too late. I looked--and it's great.
Lynette,"Yes. I love the font, the color, everything. I am so jazzed to see the restaurant."
Lynette,Ooh!
Lynette,So-- any idea when that might be?
Lynette,Hey. You open in two weeks.
Lynette,"Might there be a V.I.P. preview for people, say, who bore your children?"
Lynette,Yeah?
Lynette,Why not?
Lynette,"Ya think? 'Cause I just saw a take-out menu with a six-digit phone number, and I kept that to myself."
Lynette,"What? I am snarky because I point out one small, glaring mistake?"
Lynette,Fine! Good night.
Lynette,"Hey, you banned me from your opening."
Lynette,"Hey, it's me. You wanna meet for lunch?"
Lynette,"Oh. Yeah, that's right."
Lynette,Okay. Good. I'll see ya.
Lynette,Oh-- my-- god.
Lynette,"Andrew, hi! I thought you weren't starting until the opening."
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,"Yeah,I-I know.And hey,don't tell him I stopped by.I'm not supposed to be here.I just wanted to sneak a peek."
Lynette,Shouldn't you be working?
Lynette,Touch��_��_.
Lynette,"I think it's fantastic. It's really coming together. Ooh, I love the bar."
Lynette,What?
Lynette,"No, he didn't. Don't, um, restaurants make half their money on the liquor?"
Lynette,This is a nightmare. How did this happen?
Lynette,"Well,then why isn't he dealing with it instead of shopping for napkins?We could lose our shirts in this dump!"
Lynette,Every cent we have is circling the bowl and Tom never said a word. Why didn't he come to me?
Lynette,But I'm his wife.
Lynette,I'm gonna tell him. I'm gonna tell him I went to the restaurant And that I know he screwed up and that I'm gonna fix it.
Lynette,My husband is in trouble. I love him. Shouldn't I want to help him?
Lynette,"Mr. Gaunt? Hi, I'm Lynette Scavo. My husband is opening the pizzeria right down the block--"
Lynette,"Please, I've been at this for hours. Just hear me out."
Lynette,Oh!
Lynette,Thank you.
Lynette,Did you live in Las Vegas?
Lynette,I bet you were quite the player.
Lynette,"No, thanks. Two's my limit."
Lynette,"Look, I understand your concerns about the license. Your neighbors had them, too. But they signed the waiver once I explained to them that this is a family restaurant. No late nights, no loud music."
Lynette,"Come on, Harry. You are my last holdout. What's it gonna take? Cash? Uh, free pizza for the rest of your life? You name it."
Lynette,"Harry,my husband quit his job to start this restaurant,and if we can't sell liquor,we can't make a profit."
Lynette,"And whoa, whoa, whoa, Harry. Eyes up here."
Lynette,"This place is his dream, and if he can't make it work, then it's just gonna kill him, and consequently it's gonna kill our marriage."
Lynette,"And, Harry--Harry, what did I say?"
Lynette,"Really? Well, what if I were to very briefly refresh your memory?"
Lynette,Glad you thought so.
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,You're home early.
Lynette,Really? That's great!
Lynette,Good for him.
Lynette,"Okay, let's say just for the sake of argument, that someone else did. Someone who clearly loves you very much. What's wrong with that?"
Lynette,"Aw, come on, Tom."
Lynette,You can't drown in self-pity just because I helped you with one tiny little thing.
Lynette,Why haven't you told me about all of this?
Lynette,"Gambling with our life savings and not asking for help doesn't make you a man.It makes you an idiot. Come on,Tom,for god sakes, we are a team, and that restaurant is a huge undertaking. No one could do it alone."
Lynette,"I don't have to. You're always giving it to me, inspiring me. Remember the mouthwash jingle? You came up with the hook. And--And what about the Bartlett campaign? Would I have ever come up with tango-dancing fleas? All you. There's nothing that I have accomplished that I could have done without your help."
Lynette,"So tomorrow, first thing, we'll fix the plumbing, we'll call an exterminator, we'll rent some chairs and we will open on time, and it'll be a glorious success that you will have achieved with my help, okay?"
Lynette,"And tonight I'm gonna slap on some sex perfume and you're gonna get naked, and then we're gonna see who the man is."
Lynette,"Oh, I'm sure it will be."
Lynette,"Oh, deciding what to wear on my first day back to work. Do I look fat in this?"
Lynette,Wow. Your father has taught you well.
Lynette,Mrs. McCluskey. Won't that be fun?
Lynette,Come on. You and your brothers will be thrilled. Don't you get tired of me yelling at you to clean up your room and finish your homework?
Lynette,"Oh. Well, that's good to know. When you think about it, me going back to work is not that big a deal. We're only losing a little time together in the afternoon."
Lynette,"Oh,honey--jeez.Do you really mean that,or are you manipulating Mommy into feeling incredibly guilty?"
Lynette,Yep. Your father's taught you well.
Lynette,Your new manager? No.
Lynette,"Tom, no. You can't. You can't. The pizzeria opens in a week, and that street fair is the best advertising we're gonna get."
Lynette,"Well, you know, hire someone else."
Lynette,The future of the restaurant is at stake. It is time to get creative.
Lynette,"Well, whatever it is gonna take."
Lynette,"What?! No.Uh-Uh.Look,I'm wearing makeup.I am holding a briefcase.What does this suggest to you?"
Lynette,"I can't call in sick after eight weeks of sick leave, especially when I've been fine for three of them."
Lynette,"Crap, that's Ed."
Lynette,My boss is waiting for me outside in his car. What am I supposed to do?
Lynette,"Hey, guys."
Lynette,Yeah--it heals a little slower when the bullet's still in there.
Lynette,"No, it's too close."
Lynette,Everything.
Lynette,"Cereal? I didn't have any--oh, I know what that is. I get nauseous from the pain, So that's just a little residual vomit."
Lynette,Yeah! Don't be silly. I'm fine. Come on. Let's go sell some toothpaste.
Lynette,"Oh, son of a bi*ch!"
Lynette,"Don't touch me, okay?"
Lynette,My pills! My pain pills are in my bag.
Lynette,Thanks.
Lynette,"Oh, my pills! I need my pills, and now they're all dirty!"
Lynette,See ya next week! Thanks for understanding!
Lynette,"No, they're probably from Zach Young."
Lynette,"You haven't heard? He has been begging Gaby to go on a date with him. He's been sending her all sorts of stuff to bribe her, even a diamond bracelet."
Lynette,His grandfather left him all that money.
Lynette,"Until he turned eighteen, which was a month ago."
Lynette,Here you go. You can come back for seconds. Our famous pepperoni pizza.
Lynette,There you go. Great. Guess what? Our line is the biggest one at the fair. I counted. You know what I'm starting to think?
Lynette,"This restaurant is gonna be a big, fat hit."
Lynette,Here you go.
Lynette,"Load me up again, would ya?"
Lynette,"I'm gonna go poach some customers from that sausage-on-a-stick guy. Oh, I love it. Scavo's Pizzeria! Try the smoked chicken and sundried tomato."
Lynette,It's cornmeal.That's the secret.
Lynette,Hi--Ed.
Lynette,"Uh, on the mend, but I'm gonna be there bright and early Monday morning."
Lynette,"Wait, Ed! Ed, please don't go. Yes, I lied, and that was wrong, but my husband needed my help."
Lynette,"Like I said, really, really wrong, but if you take me back, I swear I will give you one hundred percent."
Lynette,"You got it, Ed."
Lynette,"Um, word on the street is you're looking for a manager."
Lynette,Here's my application.
Lynette,He did. I told him I wasn't interested.
Lynette,"I had so much fun at the fair today, working with you on something that was all ours. I want every day to be like that."
Lynette,"When I got shot and I was lying there bleeding, I wasn't thinking ""God, I'm really gonna miss advertising."" I think this could be the best thing that's ever happened to our family. We can make our own hours, we'll be together more, and, yes, the money is gonna be a little tight, but I think this place could be a gold mine."
Lynette,I can do that.
Lynette,Dinner is in an hour. You know the rules. And so do you.
Lynette,"You fell for the face. What are you, a rookie?"
Lynette,I feel nothing.
Lynette,I told you I wanted this floor to sparkle like your Mom's.Now does this floor look Bree Hodge clean to you?
Lynette,"Okay, just for that, you get to help me take out the trash. I know you think I'm being a hard-ass, But I'm just looking for a basic level of professionalism that--"
Lynette,Austin? What the hell's going on here?
Lynette,Are you high?
Lynette,Austin!
Lynette,Get your stuff. Get the hell out of my restaurant. You're fired. Go on.
Lynette,Austin?
Lynette,What are you doing here? I fired you.
Lynette,Hey! You hired him back? Did he tell you he was stoned on the job?
Lynette,"Look, I don't know what kind of hustle you pulled on him, but it's not gonna work on me."
Lynette,"No, I fired him, and you are gonna stay fired."
Lynette,"Well, I'm sorry, but you totally blindsided me out there."
Lynette,"Well, I'm sorry. Let's hear them. What are your reasons for bringing back Joe Bong hit?"
Lynette,What is--
Lynette,"Yeah. I just wish you'd told me before you rehired him. I mean, I am the manager."
Lynette,"Well, kinda."
Lynette,You pulling rank on me?
Lynette,I consult you.
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"Really. This place is your dream, so--consider them checked."
Lynette,Whatever you say--boss.
Lynette,"Yes, sir. Okay, that's enough."
Lynette,This could be the best thing that's ever happened to our family.
Lynette,"Hey, what are you doing?"
Lynette,"Oh, honey, you have had, what, four hours sleep in the past three days? You need rest. Who cares if we run out of breadsticks?"
Lynette,It's good.
Lynette,"If they're salty, we'll sell more beer. See? You're a genius."
Lynette,"Hey, chill out. You're acting like I did when I was six months pregnant."
Lynette,Only two.And the mailman had the good taste never to bring that up again.Come on.Let's go get some sleep.
Lynette,"I know. I'm the one that put in the order. I will handle anything that needs to be done. And you, take these and get some sleep."
Lynette,Come on. We need you at your best tonight.
Lynette,"Tom, I do not need to be pregnant to kick your ass. Now go. Go on."
Lynette,"Well, I'm so glad she has you to take care of her, and of course your mom comes first, Andrew. And I wouldn't even ask except, you know, we're opening tonight--"
Lynette,"Oh, God. Seriously? Fantastic. Thank you. It's just two quick hours, and then we'll get you right back home with your mom. Thank you, Andrew. Okay. Bye-bye."
Lynette,Did you finish folding the takeout menus?
Lynette,"I shouldn't have to tell you every little thing, you know. Show some initiative."
Lynette,Wait. Where are my chairs? I didn't order these.
Lynette,Yes.
Lynette,No. Why would I order fifty high chairs for the opening of a pizzeria?
Lynette,Give me that.
Lynette,"Animatronic rats. Where do they find you people? Okay, okay, here it is. See? I ordered fifty of item number seven three--"
Lynette,I switched the seven and the one.
Lynette,Now this place opens in five hours. How long will it take to fix this?
Lynette,"Hi. I need to rent fifty chairs by tonight at five o'clock. What? Why not? What do you mean, it's bar mitzvah season? There's no such thing. You still have five. I will take those. Scavo."
Lynette,"Okay, that brings us to 22. Javi, Rico, we got chairs to find. Move it."
Lynette,"Oh, hey, hon."
Lynette,Did you get some sleep?
Lynette,"Okay, little mix-up with the new chairs."
Lynette,"Okay, okay, we could point fingers, but what's important is forgetting about what we expected, and focusing on what we have, which isn't so bad. I mean, all the different kinds of chairs give the place a kind of bohemian vibe. Plus, if we get a lot of babies, look, we're just totally set. Tom, I'm sorry. I am. I'm sorry. I just, I realize it's not perfect. But--please say something."
Lynette,I'm happy for you.
Lynette,"Now it's ""us""? Because I thought I was the one who was trying to ruin everything."
Lynette,"Yes, you did. But I have customers."
Lynette,"I think what my husband is trying to say is, if you really want to test a marriage, open a restaurant together. Anyway, thank you for coming. Eat a lot and come back, 'cause our kids need braces."
Lynette,"Hey. It's after nine. Come on, Thomasina, it's time to get up."
Lynette,"More, but I'm tougher, and I complain less."
Lynette,Yeah?
Lynette,"Before I forget, you got a call from Chez Nous confirming your reservation for our anniversary."
Lynette,"Well, we've been going there for the last seven years. It's not exactly a surprise. Anyway, I hope you don't mind, but I canceled."
Lynette,"Honestly, I just don't feel up to going out this year."
Lynette,"I'm exhausted. Honestly, all I wanna do is pawn the kids off on somebody else, take a long bath and be in bed by eight."
Lynette,"Oh, thank you.Thank you, thank you."
Lynette,We can still have sex. Just try not to wake me.
Lynette,What was that?
Lynette,Let it go--that's cute. Start talkin'.
Lynette,"Okay. Okay. Okay. If we're doing this, I need to buy you something. What do you want?"
Lynette,"Well, you didn't have to plan anything, but you did, even though we had an agreement. You like ties? You're getting a tie."
Lynette,"I have been dragging my ass all day, and the only thought that's kept me going is the hot bath, and now I have do my hair and shave my legs."
Lynette,"I told you what I want. Hot bath, bed early, but you chose not to listen."
Lynette,Thank you.
Lynette,"Oh, I couldn't relax. I just kept replaying the fight I had with Tom in my head."
Lynette,Wow.
Lynette,Who could that be? Here.
Lynette,Please stop apologizing.
Lynette,"I appreciate what you were trying to do. It was a lovely thought that just went hideously, hideously, hideously wrong."
Lynette,Hideously.
Lynette,"Oh, don't you dare."
Lynette,"I had a lot of time to think tonight, and I realized you were right. We have to keep the romance going, no matter how tired we are. The only thing worse than just going through the motions is not bothering to go through the motions."
Lynette,Knock yourself out.
Lynette,"Well, after this year, I would be happy with any date that included food and shelter."
Lynette,Nine years--and I have loved every minute of it.
Lynette,"Jeez,are you crying?"
Lynette,"Oh, crap. I left it at home again."
Lynette,Thanks. Are you sure it's the right--
Lynette,"Listen--I was thinking, wouldn't it be better if the staff wore a uniform, and you and I wore regular clothes? That way it's like, ""Hi. Welcome to Scavo's. We're the Scavos."""
Lynette,"Oh, good point. Okay, here's another good point: I hate orange."
Lynette,Since always. You know my closet. Surely you've noticed I don't own anything orange.
Lynette,"Orange says, ""Beware. Something bad's gonna happen."" That's why they use it for life vests and traffic cones and convicts. Also, it washes me out completely."
Lynette,Are you speaking as my husband or as my boss?
Lynette,As well he should be.
Lynette,"Hey, guys."
Lynette,"No. No, don't be silly. Who am I, Tom? I'm one of you guys. Sit down. Hey--you know what we could use? A good old-fashioned bi*ch session, get some stuff off our chests. So what's bugging you guys? Okay, I'll go first. How do we feel about these uniforms? A little--eh?"
Lynette,"Good point, good point. But right now we're talking about these ugly-ass uniforms."
Lynette,"Focus, people! The subject is shirts. It's killing morale."
Lynette,"Really, Kim? 'Cause--I heard one of your customers say that when Halloween comes around, we should stick a candle in your mouth. See? Morale. You guys need to stand up for yourselves. It's your right-No, it's your obligation to go to management and demand new shirts. And if management doesn't like it, you tell him he can go screw-!"
Lynette,"Okay, okay. Break's over, people. I'm gonna go find Tom and talk. Oh! Good."
Lynette,"Well, you gave me no choice."
Lynette,"Because I need to win one, Tom."
Lynette,"You keep ordering me around and disagreeing with me and overuling me, and I'm sick of it. We have to do things my way at least every once in a while."
Lynette,Except we're never home. We live here. Our marriage happens here.
Lynette,"Later I'll be asleep, and then I will be back here before you wake up. We gotta deal with this now."
Lynette,No.
Lynette,I'm going home.
Lynette,I told you orange meant something bad was gonna happen.
Lynette,"Tom, it's me again. You should've been home thirty minutes ago. I know. You're still mad. I am, too, so why don't you come home and we can be mad together? See you soon."
Lynette,"Exactly, and I'm supposed to wear that every damn day."
Lynette,This isn't about the shirt anymore. This is about us working together. Every day it's a battle. It's hurting our marriage. You know what? I'll just tell Tom I need to step back.
Lynette,Yeah. We could hire a manager or something.
Lynette,"Well, once he decides to stop hiding, I can ask him. You know what? I'm tired of waiting. I'm gonna go down there and I'm gonna talk to him. See you guys later."
Lynette,I'm an idiot. Would you guys mind--
Lynette,Tom! Come on! I know you're still here. You realize what time it is? I know! You're mad. But you just--you can't avoid me all night.
Lynette,"Oh, my God! Oh, Tom. Tommy--Okay, okay, you're breathing. That's good. That's good."
Lynette,"Hello?Hi.There's something wrong with my husband. I don't know. He's unconscious. 357 Hawthorne place. Okay, could you please hurry? Thank you. Yes."
Lynette,"Listen to me. I forbid you to die. If you leave me with a mortgage and a restaurant and five kids, I swear I will track you into the deepest pit of hell and make you pay. Do you hear me? Come on, baby--Oh, please."
Lynette,"So that's it? He threw out his back? Oh, thank God."
Lynette,How much of a while?
Lynette,Three months?
Lynette,We run a restaurant.
Lynette,"Yeah, it is."
Lynette,"Hey, Andrew. Ah, thanks. He's gonna be okay. No. No, absolutely not. We will open tonight as usual. Hey, it's gonna be fine, Andrew. I will take care of it. It's my job now. Okay. See you soon. Bye."
Lynette,How much of a while?
Lynette,"I have to get to the restaurant early. Is there any you could come over and get the kids off to school? Yeah, they are ready to go. So what do you say? Oh, great! Thanks. I owe you big-time. Okay, bye."
Lynette,"All right, I am heading out of here. Wish me luck."
Lynette,"Yeah, but don't worry. I am gonna find you the assistant manager of your dreams."
Lynette,"Yeah, I know, I know. Bottom of the barrel, convicts and losers. You were clear about that last night."
Lynette,I'm the one that told you that.
Lynette,"Oh, for God sake, Tom! I'm gonna be late for this interview. I really should go."
Lynette,No.
Lynette,It's okay. I am gonna find a way to make this all work and you just get better.
Lynette,Mrs. McCluskey. Perfect timing.
Lynette,That is a great idea!
Lynette,Hi.
Lynette,"At some point, Tom's gonna ask you to look for this. You will not find it."
Lynette,Love you!
Lynette,"Arnie, thanks for coming in. We will definitely keep you in mind."
Lynette,He kept asking what we do with the food people don't eat.
Lynette,"Well, that's what we pay you, and you seem happy enough."
Lynette,My fault for asking.
Lynette,Rick Coletti?
Lynette,"Great. Come on over. Your application"""
Lynette,No. It's great you can spell. You are now officially the front-runner.
Lynette,How old do you think I am?
Lynette,Not afraid to shamelessly ass kiss. You are doing very well.
Lynette,"Well, I should probably take a look at your application first. Okay, don't be afraid if you don't have a ton of experience. I realize for what we're paying, we're not exactly gonna get a--you were a sous-chef at Cucina? That's a five-star restaurant."
Lynette,Which is four more than we have.
Lynette,"But seriously, why would a four-star chef wanna slum at a pizza joint?"
Lynette,Hi! I'm home! And I've got good news. I found a new manager.
Lynette,"Yeah, his name is Rick Coletti, And he was a sous-chef at Cucina."
Lynette,"Yeah, I had that exact same thought. And to be honest, he has a history."
Lynette,"You know how stressful it is working in a four-star restaurant, and he, like many chefs, started using cocaine just to stay ahead--"
Lynette,Clean for almost a year.
Lynette,"No, I know, but I've got a really good feeling about this guy, And all he wants is a fresh start."
Lynette,"I can't find somebody else. I've interviewed fifty guys and this junkie happens to be the best of the bunch. Seriously, Tom, I don't know how much longer I--"
Lynette,I'm sorry.
Lynette,"Fine. I'll, uh, keep looking."
Lynette,What? What? Why? Why? What happened?
Lynette,"Okay, I know that, uh, Tom has been a little cranky lately."
Lynette,"Look, I'll talk to Tom--"
Lynette,"Wait, wait, wait! Please don't do this. Please. I am at the end of my rope."
Lynette,"Okay, everybody, go on up to bed. Parker, you got the baby. Yeah, that's exactly right. You know what to do."
Lynette,"Well, you might also want to apologize to the customer who found a Lego in her pizza."
Lynette,I hope.
Lynette,It was so awful tonight.
Lynette,What?
Lynette,You wanna have sex? But you're immobile.
Lynette,"But you can't bend at the waist, and that pretty much leaves the heavy lifting to me."
Lynette,"Is that why you apologized, just so I'd-- service you?"
Lynette,"I have been doing everything I can to keep our heads above water. I can't do you, too."
Lynette,Here you go. Sorry for the wait.
Lynette,I will be right there!
Lynette,Don't cry. Just clean.
Lynette,"I swear, I will be there in one second."
Lynette,Here you go. Here you go.
Lynette,"Oh, my God, Rick. I never got back to you. I am so sorry."
Lynette,"Look, I think you're great, and we would be lucky to have you. It's just, my husband isn't really comfortable--"
Lynette,Could you excuse me a second? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What's up?
Lynette,Oh? What's wrong with it?
Lynette,"All right, all right. I will put you order in. But the kitchen's a little backed up."
Lynette,I can't do this. It's just--
Lynette,Why would a four-star chef wanna slum at a pizza joint?
Lynette,He has a history--using cocaine.
Lynette,"Well, but he's been clean for almost a year."
Lynette,I'm gonna be right there. Here you go.
Lynette,Of course! Absolutely!
Lynette,"Please, please, tell me we can still make pizza."
Lynette,"Oh, this is awful. On a good night, we barely break even. Tonight is gonna kill the whole week."
Lynette,"Oh, my god! You are a lifesaver!"
Lynette,For pasta? Are you crazy?
Lynette,"Oh, I don't wanna scare them away."
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,So--good news! Our chef is preparing his special spaghetti carbonara.
Lynette,And we're offering that for twelve dollars.
Lynette,For the appetizer portion. The entr��_��_e is twenty.
Lynette,Two. Twenty-two. Two.
Lynette,"Sorry. I'm sorry. But it's gonna be worth it. Okay, so tell Tom the secret of your risotto."
Lynette,"No, no, the profit margin."
Lynette,"And we charge twenty dollars! Four people who would've shared a fifteen dollar pizza are now spending eighty bucks. Okay, kids, dig in!"
Lynette,Yeah?
Lynette,"Um, Tom. . ."
Lynette,"It's delicious, huh?"
Lynette,Yeah? Rick learned how to make this in italy. Go ahead. Try it. I wanna see what you think.
Lynette,But?
Lynette,Us? What is us?
Lynette,"We've been open for three months now, and we've barely turned a profit!"
Lynette,Why are you being so stubborn?And you would rather see the restaurant fail than succeed with Rick's idea!
Lynette,I don't think so. I'm giving it a try.
Lynette,"Yeah? Well, then why don't you come down to the restaurant and stop me? Oh, that's right. You can't."
Lynette,"Hey, buddy, whatcha doing?"
Lynette,You seem a little mopey lately. Is everything okay?
Lynette,"Well, Parker really wanted to come visit you. I'm gonna put a little water in these."
Lynette,Yeah?
Lynette,"Oh, sure!"
Lynette,"Hey, they didn't have Jell-O, so I hope pudding is okay."
Lynette,What's this?
Lynette,Are you kidding? I should be thanking you. We took in three grand tonight.
Lynette,"Oh, wow. Candles, too?"
Lynette,"Oh. Oh, my god. If we serve this for tomorrow's special, will will clear four grand."
Lynette,"Why? You know he'll just shoot it down. I mean, I get it. He's in pain. He doesn't like being sidelined, but that is no reason to--you know what?Let's talk about something else."
Lynette,"I mean, unless you'd like to go. You're here so late all the time."
Lynette,Don't you have any friends to hang out with?
Lynette,"Oh, yeah. I gotcha."
Lynette,"What? Yeah, sometimes. Why?"
Lynette,"Oh, well--thanks. This is delicious."
Lynette,Sure.
Lynette,"I just heard on the radio the power company is still having problems, and there might be another rolling blackout today. Do you want me to leave Ida's number in case something happens?"
Lynette,Did you read our review in the paper?
Lynette,Okay. I'm off.
Lynette,Sometimes.
Lynette,Thanks.
Lynette,Thank you. So have you told Bree about your engagement?
Lynette,You're kidding.
Lynette,"I don't know how she does it. Hey, it's getting late. Let's break out the champagne."
Lynette,"I'm not, but Susan's written a poem."
Lynette,"She's reworked the lyrics to ""Wind Beneath My Wings."""
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,I've knocked twice. She's not answering.
Lynette,"Oh, great. Now we know she's watching us."
Lynette,"Oh, please, I don't want to think of how many times she brought them ice cream from that basement. I mean, jeez, if you want to keep your husband on ice, at least have a dedicated freezer."
Lynette,"Well, so far, she's only been charged with improper disposal of a corpse."
Lynette,"It's just-- it's something yucky, honey. Go on and play with your ball. Go on."
Lynette,We're trying so hard to protect them from this. There are just some things that kids don't need to know about.
Lynette,I think it's a shame you didn't make any for yourself.
Lynette,"Hi, honey."
Lynette,Aren't you sweet? What's that noise in the background? Are the boys still up?
Lynette,"Well, of course they don't. They're kids. You're the dad. Make 'em."
Lynette,"Ah, is this your way of guilting me into coming back home?"
Lynette,"Oh, Tom--I'm sorry. I can't come home. We're, um--doing inventory, so--it could be a while."
Lynette,I will. I love you. Bye.
Lynette,I know. I'm a horrible person. I just chose ravioli over motherhood. I should--I should go home.
Lynette,Those are shameless rationalizations. Keep them coming.
Lynette,"Those, too."
Lynette,"What do you mean, we?"
Lynette,Okay. Back to Edie--I'm not sure I'm comfortable ganging up on her.
Lynette,"Oh, my god. How do you botch a bikini wax?"
Lynette,Of course we're with you. We will give Edie the cold shoulder.
Lynette,Hello?
Lynette,"Hey, do you still want me to look at that book report?"
Lynette,Oh. Okay.
Lynette,"Well, I'm really busy at the restaurant. Believe me, I come home to daddy just as soon as I can."
Lynette,What?
Lynette,Why would you say that?
Lynette,"I stay late because there's a lot of work to do, and right now I'm the only person who can do it, and now I have to go to the grocery store because I am the only person who can do that, mm-hmm. So why don't you go upstairs and finish your homework?"
Lynette,"Hey, hey!"
Lynette,"Oh, really? My ringer must've been off."
Lynette,"Oh! The boys would love that, but unfortunately, I gotta work."
Lynette,Cater?
Lynette,"Wow, that many?"
Lynette,"Well, yeah, I guess I could work somethin' out."
Lynette,Such food exists? Don't tease me.
Lynette,And--and--and you want me to go with you?
Lynette,"No, I love it. It's--it's just that's a little late for me, and--"
Lynette,"No, it would be, but Sunday nights are kind of crazy. I'm packing lunches and checking homework--"
Lynette,"You know, maybe I should go. Um-- it's part of the job to check out the competition, right?"
Lynette,I agree.
Lynette,"Hey, guys, go check out the snakes. I'll give you some pizza later, okay?"
Lynette,"All right, I'll see you later."
Lynette,"Hey, you want some pizza?"
Lynette,There you go.
Lynette,"Edie asked me to cater. I know, I'm a total who*e, but please don't rat me out to Gaby."
Lynette,Looks like we're working the same corner.
Lynette,"Trust me, we can both relax. I talked to her this morning, and she's out with Victor all day."
Lynette,Down! Down! Down! Aah!
Lynette,Gaby's coming.
Lynette,I was wrong. I was wrong. Come on. Follow me. Follow me.
Lynette,No! Go ride the python! Come on.
Lynette,"Okay, okay, she's circling the park."
Lynette,"Oh, yeah, I'm more terrified of Gaby. Okay, good, good. We're almost home free--"
Lynette,Don't turn around. m.
Lynette,"Hey, Gab. Hi."
Lynette,"Well, Edie hired me to cater, so it's just business. I don't know what her excuse is."
Lynette,"Gaby, she asked me to make twenty pizzas. I couldn't turn it down."
Lynette,"Oh, come on, Gaby, be fair. You put us in a really awkward position."
Lynette,Gaby!
Lynette,What?
Lynette,I might take a little for Tom and--
Lynette,"Hi, Mrs.McCluskey. Would you like some cake?"
Lynette,You put him in the freezer and kept cashing the checks.
Lynette,"Yeah. Um, I told Kim that we'd be out the rest of the evening and she's gonna lock up."
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,Hey! Hi! What are you doing here?
Lynette,"So--what--well, how did you get here? I mean, you're not supposed to--drive."
Lynette,"Yeah, a little."
Lynette,"Oh, I missed you, too. Hey, why don't you guys go grab that big table, and I will have Rick whip something up for us?"
Lynette,Oh. It must be the basil. It has a kind of sweet smell.
Lynette,"Oh, hi. Uh, change of plans."
Lynette,But--I'm sorry. You could still go.
Lynette,Thanks. Thank you.
Lynette,"Hey, Mrs. McCluskey."
Lynette,"Well, it turns out our new babysitter isn't working out too well. Feel up to another tour of duty?"
Lynette,My kids know you're not a witch.
Lynette,We missed you.
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"I just talked to Mrs.McCluskey, and she is gonna start looking after our kids again."
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,What?
Lynette,"But--but the doctor said your recovery would take months, and it's only been six weeks."
Lynette,I don't mind.
Lynette,"Yeah, well, you know, it is, but I just don't want you to come back before you're ready. You might reinjure yourself."
Lynette,Rick? Why would we want to let him go?
Lynette,"Actually, he is bringing in more than enough business to cover his salary. I mean, with all those new dishes he's been cooking, he's got a lot of fans out there."
Lynette,Yeah. I think firing him would be a huge mistake.
Lynette,"Well, don't think so much. Just rest and get better. That's what you need to do."
Lynette,Probably.We got a big party coming in at ten. So--mm-hmm. I'll just see you in the morning.
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,The restaurant did close a half-hour ago.
Lynette,We're doing inventory.
Lynette,So this little ear-shaped pasta is called--
Lynette,Thank God for Italian. You can charge way more for 'orecchiette with pancetta' than you'd ever get for 'bacon and little ears.'
Lynette,Thank you. This is nice.
Lynette,"No, I mean--everything--the food, the wine--you. I swear, there are times this is all that gets me through my day, knowing at the end of it, I get to steal this little half-hour where I'm not a mom or a wife or a--pizza slave. I'm just a--tired lady with a nice man who cooks for her."
Lynette,"Oh, crap."
Lynette,"Oh-- my--God! Oh! Oh, my God! They locked us in here! It's forty-two degrees! We're gonna freeze to death!"
Lynette,"No, he won't. He takes a pain pill at ten. He's probably already asleep. Jeez. How are we gonna make it through the night in here?"
Lynette,Yeah. That helps.
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,A little. Thanks for not letting me freeze last night.
Lynette,No. That's just me. Tom's always kicking the covers off the bed. He calls me his little blonde furnace.
Lynette,Tom! In here!
Lynette,We were robbed!
Lynette,"Yeah. No, I'm fine."
Lynette,"No, no, I'm just cold."
Lynette,"I'm sorry. I would've called, but they took our cell phones before they locked us in there."
Lynette,"I was doing receipts, and Rick surprised me with this great idea for the menu. It's called--what are they called?"
Lynette,"And he makes them with pancetta and garlic and olive oil. It's really, really good. It's gonna be our special tonight."
Lynette,"Yeah, I guess we were."
Lynette,Good night. Come again.
Lynette,There. Hey--I made you an espresso.
Lynette,You okay? You've been so quiet all night.
Lynette,That's funny. He didn't mention it.
Lynette,"What? I'm so sorry. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. That paranoid idiot. You know, I knew it. I knew when we were watching the surveillance tapes that he would completely misinterpret it."
Lynette,Did he what?
Lynette,I don't know what you're talking about. There's nothing to admit.
Lynette,Stop! Don't say it! You cannot say these things.
Lynette,"Yes, flirting! That's it! It's what married people do, because we know there is a line you don't cross. And maybe I've gotten close to that line, and maybe I've enjoyed getting close to that line, but I have never once crossed it."
Lynette,And I have nothing to offer! I am taken! God!
Lynette,"Yeah, I'm mad! I am mad because I loved our nights together. It made me feel sexy and happy, and, God, how I needed that. And now it's over. You ruined it. You can't work here anymore."
Lynette,"Oh, jeez. What choice do I have?"
Lynette,"Don't touch me! You have to go now. Please, go. You have to go now. Go on. Go."
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,It was kind of dead tonight. Hi.
Lynette,"Ooh, sorry. By the way, we are gonna need to find a new chef. Rick gave notice."
Lynette,"Well, he got a better offer from some place across town."
Lynette,You sure you're ready?
Lynette,"Well, okay, then."
Lynette,"I missed you, too."
Lynette,You can't work here anymore.
Lynette,No. Why would you think that?
Lynette,"Well, when two people have known each other as long as mommy and daddy have, they don't have to always talk. In fact, a sign of a good relationship is being comfortable in silence."
Lynette,"Well, daddy probably didn't notice that I was unloading twenty-pound bags of flour 'cause he still can't lift them, so mommy didn't exactly have time to sit around and chew the fat."
Lynette,"You wanna know what's bugging me? I'm trying to have a lovely breakfast with my family, and you're picking a fight."
Lynette,"There's nothing to talk about, okay? Just leave me alone."
Lynette,Good.
Lynette,Yeah?
Lynette,You won the beer pong championship?
Lynette,"Yeah, and then you threw up in the trophy."
Lynette,"Oh, wow. Well, I'd love to chat, but I have cheese to grate."
Lynette,"Oh, sure, now and then."
Lynette,Tom--
Lynette,"Well, Scott, I'm not sure I would say, particularly not to someone I just met."
Lynette,I am not answering that. This is not a therapy session.
Lynette,"Oh, dear god you didn't."
Lynette,"Okay, okay. Give it up, Tom."
Lynette,"Really? And what do you call this, ambush therapy?"
Lynette,"No, no."
Lynette,"Cram it! Okay, yeah, Tom, I've been unhappy lately. I am working through some issues, but that is something I need to do on my own. Talking about it doesn't help--not to you, and certainly not to Dr. Beer Pong."
Lynette,"Yeah, a little."
Lynette,"Look, even if Gaby is in the wrong here--and she--she is hugely, hideously wrong--do you really want to boycott her wedding?"
Lynette,"I think her point--and again, I wish she'd express herself a little more tactfully-- was that marriage is unpredictable. We can't know what it'll be until we're in it."
Lynette,"Speaking of Carlos, I hear he got evicted."
Lynette,It could ruin your friendship. Are you willing to take that chance?
Lynette,What did he have to say?
Lynette,And what would that have to do with me?
Lynette,"Remember when I was giving birth to the twins and screaming in agony because Porter was dragging my uterus out with him? Well, I was more in the mood for sex then than I am now."
Lynette,Hmm?
Lynette,Fine. Let's have sex.
Lynette,Yeah. Let's get this off.
Lynette,I said I'd have sex. I didn't say I'd make love.
Lynette,Sorry. I'll try to be gentler as I move down south.
Lynette,You had lunch with Rick.
Lynette,Nothing was going on! He never touched me!
Lynette,You didn't make him quit! I fired him!
Lynette,"The idiot told me he had feelings for me, which he never would've done if you hadn't pushed him, and now he's gone. It's all your fault."
Lynette,Thank you.
Lynette,This whole thing is ridiculous. I bumped my head.
Lynette,"Well, I feel just fine now."
Lynette,"I said that it was totally inappropriate, and then I fired him."
Lynette,I would never cheat on you. You know that.
Lynette,Nothing happened. He's gone. It's over.
Lynette,Don't do this.
Lynette,That's me. I'll be back.
Lynette,Is it a concussion?
Lynette,Stop. Just--stop. What is it you think I have?
Lynette,Is one of them cancer?
Lynette,"Not yet, sweetheart. You go back to sleep now."
Lynette,I know her plane landed on time. She'll probably be here any second.
Lynette,"If you're that freaked out, just get married without the bracelet."
Lynette,"Hey, I'm starting to get worried about Bree. Maybe we should call."
Lynette,"Oh, good."
Lynette,Bree!
Lynette,"Oh, it's not as bad as it sounds. It's, um, Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and apparently, if you're going to get lymphoma, that's the kind you want."
Lynette,"Hey, you wanna hold it down up there, kids? I'm trying to talk to your Aunt Lucy! Thank you!"
Lynette,"Anyway, I know I said that we would come and visit you this June, but I'll be a little woozy and--bald from the chemo, so--thanks for understanding. Oh, one more thing--our insurance policy has a really high deductible, so we are strapped financially, and I was wondering if maybe you and Dave might be able to--oh, really? No, I am not asking mom. She doesn't know about any of this, so don't you tell her, okay? We'll be fine. I love you. Bye."
Lynette,"Yep. Dave lost his job at the plant, and he is now handing out flyers at a chicken restaurant, and--prepare to wince-- there is a chicken suit involved."
Lynette,So where are we gonna find this ten thousand dollars?
Lynette,"But, honey--"
Lynette,Should you even be playing tennis after your back surgery?
Lynette,"Well, in that spirit, as soon as I start chemo, I will be giving up shampoo."
Lynette,Mom--
Lynette,"It's been five years, mom. They don't remember you."
Lynette,Just say thank you.
Lynette,"Listen, mom, I really appreciate you coming to help, but as you can see, I'm perfectly fine."
Lynette,I'll manage. You got through breast cancer while raising the three of us alone.
Lynette,"Well, that's what you get when you mix chemo and vodka gimlets."
Lynette,"No! I am not leaving that woman in charge of our children. In three months, the twins will be chain-smoking, and Penny will be an alcoholic. We can manage. We've got McCluskey."
Lynette,"You said not to worry about money, that you'd find it somewhere."
Lynette,"What, someone loaned us ten thousand dollars?"
Lynette,"No! Tom, you didn't ask my mother?!"
Lynette,"Well, we're giving it back."
Lynette,"Tom, you don't know half the stuff she did to us. She would get drunk and smack us around. She would meet some new guy and then drop us off at her sister's for a week because he wasn't into kids."
Lynette,If you would just try to understand--
Lynette,What's that supposed to mean?
Lynette,"Great, so in the middle of everything I'm dealing with, you're gonna throw Rick in my face."
Lynette,So forgiving my mother--that's my penance?
Lynette,You are now officially the most beautiful bride that ever lived.
Lynette,"Until your wedding, of course."
Lynette,"Aw, I think it's so great, and we could not be happier for you. When's your due date?"
Lynette,"Nothing. Same old, same old."
Lynette,I'm fine. Everything's just fine.
Lynette,"Well, I don't know how you did it. The kids are asleep, and the cough syrup hasn't been touched."
Lynette,"Well, if history's any indicator, I won't have to wait long."
Lynette,"I think at a certain point, people just are who they are."
Lynette,How did you-
Lynette,You heard about this from my kids?
Lynette,"Nothing happened between me and Rick. Yes, he came on to me, but unlike you, I controlled myself."
Lynette,"Hey, Glen may have bored you, but the years we had a father in that house were the happiest in my life. You didn't care about that, though, did you? You just drove him away."
Lynette,No I don't.
Lynette,How can you say that?
Lynette,Stop comparing us. I never did what you did.
Lynette,You're leaving tomorrow. I don't want your money. I don't want you imy house.
Lynette,You can't stay if I don't want you here.
Lynette,Mom.
Lynette,What did the doctors say?
Lynette,What the hell happened? How could she pull a stunt like this?
Lynette,"Oh,sweetie."
Lynette,"I know it's her wedding night,but do you think we should call Gaby?"
Lynette,"Okay,honey.Just give me a minute.Give me a minute."
Lynette,Hey! Hey! My wig is gone.Where is it?
Lynette,"No! No,I'm looking at the nightstand,and all I see are a few stray hairs and this sports blooper DVD you thought would cheer me up."
Lynette,"Hey,I'm coming!Hey,don't just lie there like a lump!Come on! Help me look!"
Lynette,I found it.
Lynette,"Look,I can deal with the chemo.I can deal with people telling me my hair has never looked better.But what I cannot deal with is the pity,so we are doing it my way."
Lynette,"Hey,sweetie,what's up?"
Lynette,Yes.It proves they eat sitting down.
Lynette,"Okay,don't take this personally,but we hate you."
Lynette,Muriel.How are you doing?What's up?You look good.
Lynette,Yeah. Things have been a little weird lately--
Lynette,Okay.I'll jump right on it.
Lynette,I can handle it.
Lynette,Shhhhh!
Lynette,"It's my life.Some stupid disease is not gonna keep me from living it.Besides,Parker's expecting to see me."
Lynette,He's gonna be watching for me all day.He's one of the leads.
Lynette,I'm feeling a little.
Lynette,"Oh,I'm gonna be sick!"
Lynette,No! It's too late!
Lynette,Bravo!I'm sorry.I'll get you a new purse.
Lynette,Hi!How are you?
Lynette,"Oh,sorry."
Lynette,"And,Edie,you look great. Especially,you know,given the circumstances."
Lynette,"Aw,my hero. I can handle her."
Lynette,I'm in charge of decorations?
Lynette,I don't want to hear it.
Lynette,"I'm sorry,sweetie.I'm just-- I'm just too tired right now."
Lynette,I know.The timing is terrible.
Lynette,I just didn't realize how tired I would be when I took this on.
Lynette,"Okay,I'm gonna be honest with you.I haven't been feeling that great lately."
Lynette,Yeah.That's rough.By the way--I have cancer.
Lynette,"So I am halfway through chemo,and my doctor is very confident that I'm going to beat this,so you can all relax.I'm not going to die."
Lynette,"I just liked being able to throw on my wig and join you guys for a cup of coffee and a good gossip about the new neighbors.You know,for five minutes,I could pretend I wasn't a sick person.But once your friends know you're sick,you can't pretend anymore 'cause you can see it in their eyes--the fear,the pity."
Lynette,"No. No,of course not.You know what? Let's make a pact.No more secrets.From now on,we tell each other every shocking detail of our lives."
Lynette,You with us?
Lynette,I have cancer.
Lynette,"It's a little uncomfortable, but I'm fine. Take a card."
Lynette,"Hey, I told you I'm collecting queens. Pay attention."
Lynette,"Well, let's not compose my eulogy just yet. I'm still troupin'. Take a card."
Lynette,You're doing it again.
Lynette,"Hey, I told you I'm collecting queens."
Lynette,"Oh, my god. Are you letting me win?"
Lynette,By taking all the fun of the kill?
Lynette,Out.
Lynette,"You are supposed to be distracting me, not depressing the hell out of me."
Lynette,I'll see you at home.
Lynette,Just go. I'll cab it.
Lynette,Out!
Lynette,Please let me help. I feel so guilty just sitting here.
Lynette,Thank you.
Lynette,I don't mind.
Lynette,"Yeah, so far--not that bad. Though I did have to kick Tom out yesterday."
Lynette,"He was getting so emotional. It felt like the last 20 minutes of ""Brian's song"". So--I guess I'm in the market for a new chemo buddy."
Lynette,"Oh! My god, you guys. I'm so touched you're all willing to do this."
Lynette,Gaby?
Lynette,"Hey, Gaby."
Lynette,"Well--I felt a little weird about something that happened at lunch, and I thought we should talk about it."
Lynette,"Oh, not that. Okay, I don't know how to say this, so I'm just gonna say it. When everyone was offering to come with me to chemo--even Katherine, who I don't even know, you sort of clammed up. What was that about?"
Lynette,"Yeah, but between us, you're the one I really want there. Out of everyone, you're the most fun, and I need that now."
Lynette,"Nobody likes hospitals. Unfortunately, that's the place you have to go when you're sick, or your friends are. You are my friend, right?"
Lynette,Yeah--kinda. Can I pencil you in?
Lynette,"Gaby, where have you been? You went to the bathroom, like, half an hour ago."
Lynette,"""Top ten new hairstyles"". Yeah, well, I'm kinda bald right now, but thanks."
Lynette,"No, no, I don't need magazines. I need company. Sit down. You've been bouncing around since you got here. So--how do you like being the first lady of Fairview?"
Lynette,"I'm fine. So tell me something. When you go to a ribbon cutting, do you get to keep those gigantic novelty scissors?"
Lynette,"Boy, you really don't wanna be here, do ya?"
Lynette,"Yeah, in any way that gets you out of this room."
Lynette,"Yeah, you told me, but, jeez, Gaby,don't you care enough to make an effort?"
Lynette,I get it. You're uncomfortable. Just go. I'm fine. I'm fine.
Lynette,Thanks for that encouraging story.
Lynette,"Oh, my god."
Lynette,You're not gonna lose me.
Lynette,It's okay. Come here. Let it go.
Lynette,"Gaby, this was a wonderful idea. I cannot tell you how much it means to me."
Lynette,"Oh, I'm gonna be sick."
Lynette,"That's sweet, and totally accurate. But I'm really whipped from the chemo, so--Oh, there's my other line. Can you ask me next time, okay, hon? Okay, bye."
Lynette,"Hello? Oh, hey, Bree. Mm, what's up?"
Lynette,Wait--is Katherine going to Susan's charade night?
Lynette,"We should go, too. Get a few drinks in her, see if she loosens up."
Lynette,I don't know. You came out with some interesting things before you swore off the sauce.
Lynette,Didn't you tell me you lost your virginity in the backseat of a--
Lynette,"Yeah, I am feeling much better, so count me in. Will our new neighbor be coming?"
Lynette,"Oh. No, thanks."
Lynette,"I appreciate the effort, but I told you, I can't keep anything down, and F.Y.I. Mac and cheese is halfway to vomit. You might as well have given me a plate of creamed corn."
Lynette,"Yeah, I am taking it. It's just--not working."
Lynette,You're suggesting pot?
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,"""Kick-ass chronic""? Uh-huh. You're a grandmother. Shouldn't you be off somewhere knitting an Afghan?"
Lynette,"Well, thanks, but prefer not to get my medication from some guy under a bridge."
Lynette,Sorry.
Lynette,"Yeah, about that-- I don't think I'm gonna make it."
Lynette,12. And that's my point. I'm undefeated. Why spoil my winning streak by playing when I'm not up to it?
Lynette,"Tom, hair loss and constant nausea-- those are inconveniences. Losing at charades to Susan Meyer--that is just flat-out intolerable."
Lynette,"Wow, sweetie. Those really look delicious, but I just don't feel like eating right now."
Lynette,This really is delicious.
Lynette,"Are you kidding? It's genius. He's a sponge, but he talks!"
Lynette,Yeah. I guess that anti-nausea medicine finally kicked in.
Lynette,That's me! The ninja!
Lynette,Ya Ha I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--Okay.
Lynette,Who do you think you're talking to?
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"I know. Just, this is a really hard one."
Lynette,Movie. It's a western.
Lynette,Sorry.
Lynette,Yes! Yes! Yes!
Lynette,"Yeah, no, I'm good. Hey, do you think they have any grapes or lobster?"
Lynette,It's like chocolate love.
Lynette,"Oh, my god. ""Hang 'em high"" has three syllables."
Lynette,"Could you check on 'em for me, please?"
Lynette,You drugged me.
Lynette,"What is wrong with you? I told you, I didn't want any pot."
Lynette,"That's not the point. And what were you thinking, using my son as a drug mule?"
Lynette,Let me ask you something. Do you remember what I wore to the junior prom or what part I had in the play that year?
Lynette,"Parents who weren't stoned. My whole childhood passed in a blur because you were medicating yourself--pot when you were sick, booze when you weren't. I am not going to do that. I won't miss a second of my kids' lives, not if I can avoid it."
Lynette,I get it. But if you ever pull something like this again--
Lynette,Okay. Well--I think I'll turn in.
Lynette,What?
Lynette,You remembered.
Lynette,"We, it's amazing what a week without chemo can do."
Lynette,"Next month, so I have some time before I start feeling like total crap again. And I was hoping we could put that time to good use."
Lynette,"Well, it's back. And since when do you question the mojo?"
Lynette,"Okay, so here are your options. ""A,"" we could go romantic, play soft music, light some candles, or ""B,"" go straight to the--"
Lynette,"Well, it's just like riding a bike. You never forget. Now start pedaling. Hey. Hey. What are you doing?"
Lynette,Hey! Hey. Screw it.
Lynette,"Oh, I ripped it this morning. It's been itching the hell out of me--And this is much better."
Lynette,"No, I'm good. Hey, babe, what's going on? You still with me?"
Lynette,What?
Lynette,It's 9:30.
Lynette,"Oh, okay."
Lynette,"Yeah, and showers aren't just about presents. They're fun."
Lynette,A week? All right. You'll hurt if you can?
Lynette,I'm upset 'cause that salesgirl just walked away with my sex life.
Lynette,"After two months of puking my guts out, last night I was finally in the mood, but Tom��_��_��_not so much. Apparently, my bald head is a big turnoff for him."
Lynette,It was itchy.
Lynette,"Gaby, I am his wife. He's supposed to love me--not my body, me--my--my soul. Why can't he make love to my soul?"
Lynette,What are you saying?
Lynette,"Gaby, I'm not a redhead."
Lynette,Tom? The kids are asleep. Are you coming to bed anytime soon?
Lynette,That's too bad. I had a little fantasy thing planned of my own.
Lynette,"Lynette's not here right now. I'm Brandy, the slutty cheerleader."
Lynette,"You said ""no shower��_��_. But look around--men. So technically, it's a party, not a shower."
Lynette,Hi.
Lynette,Yeah. Good as new.
Lynette,"I do, and I'm up for that."
Lynette,"Oh, about Brandy--bad news."
Lynette,"Well, Penny wanted to play beauty school with the wig, and, well, let's just say she's got no future as a stylist."
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,"Brandy's history, Tom. Let her go."
Lynette,I'm not. Whatcha got back there?
Lynette,What are you doing?
Lynette,And that's only possible when you're pretending I'm someone else?
Lynette,"This--is me, Tom, not Brandy or Candy. It's just your wife, Lynette. Am I not enough for you?"
Lynette,"Yeah, because I'm bald. And I know that that's a big old turnoff, but, you know, I can't help it."
Lynette,"Escape from me, you mean?"
Lynette,Well-- I know that.
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,"Oh--my god. I haven't, have I? I am one of those--whiny, self-involved sick people."
Lynette,"No, I am. It's been months, and I have barely thought about what you're going through."
Lynette,Will you stop being so heroic?! I'm a cancer bi*ch! What?
Lynette,You suck. Well--I guess I could give Candy a whirl. Are the kids really asleep? 'Cause I think she might be a screamer.
Lynette,"Oh, I'd like that."
Lynette,"Hey, guys, I got your snack. What you playing?"
Lynette,"Thanks, sweetheart. Hello. Oh, yeah. Hi, Dr. Shiller. Okay, that's my white blood count. Uh-huh, but as long as it's higher than 4.0, that means I don't have neutropenia, right? Well, that's great. Thanks for calling. Yeah, you, too. Bye."
Lynette,What?
Lynette,"Well, that's a good rule. Although it wasn't bad news. It was actually--"
Lynette,"Got it. Sick talk done, okay? You guys have fun."
Lynette,"Uh, you mean Katherine 's homeowners thing? Yeah, I think I'll sit this one out."
Lynette,"See, this is one of the upsides of having cancer. You get to excuse yourself from petty neighborhood squabbles."
Lynette,Me? Why would she do that?
Lynette,I don't think Katherine will bother herself over a tree house.
Lynette,You're comparing Katherine to a Nazi?
Lynette,"After you get rid of this fountain, that's it, right?"
Lynette,I mean-- You're not gonna start checking everyone's yards for things that don't fit in?
Lynette,Uh-huh. And what if they don't?
Lynette,My kids' tree house. Can you promise you'll leave it alone?
Lynette,That sounds like a no.
Lynette,"No, actually, I'm nominating myself. I am now running for president--against you."
Lynette,"Tom, I don't want your opinion, just your vote."
Lynette,Because you'd never win. Bossy women rule this street. You know that.
Lynette,I'm sorry. I didn't catch that.
Lynette,"Look, this is not just about a tree house or a fountain. This is about what kind of neighborhood we want to live in. Do we get to make our own choices, or do we let the taste police make them for us?"
Lynette,"No! This is about personal freedom--Specifically, my personal freedom to take down that jackbooted hausfrau."
Lynette,"Hey, a tumor is a tumor whether it's in your body or living across the street."
Lynette,"Hey. Listen, I promised Tom I wouldn't knock myself out campaigning for this homeowners thing, so I was hoping you could help me--You know, ring some bells, talk me up, that sort of thing?"
Lynette,But what?
Lynette,You're picking her over me?
Lynette,"Yes, but that was before your best friend threw her scarf in the ring."
Lynette,"See, that's awkward for me. This is about personal freedom. You know? I'm running as a libertarian."
Lynette,But it's my kids' tree house. They really need it.
Lynette,Why don't you get earplugs?
Lynette,What? That doesn't even make sense.
Lynette,"Katherine, what are you up to?"
Lynette,Liar. You're campaigning. Cookies--nice touch.
Lynette,"Looks fine to me. It's hardly ripped at all. In fact, if you give me your support--"
Lynette,"Pay for a fence you don't even want. That's not how you make good neighbors, and I don't care if--"
Lynette,"You can keep that satellite dish. In fact, this is practically a first amendment issue. The way I see it--"
Lynette,Have I got your vote?
Lynette,"Fascism, Ida, not fashion."
Lynette,"It's up to you, hon."
Lynette,"Hey, Judas."
Lynette,Don't do that. I wanna be sad when they knock it down.
Lynette,What? You think you can just walk over here and cute your way out of what you did? We're supposed to be friends.
Lynette,You're right. I shouldn't have done that. But that tree house is the one place my kids can go and not hear about body scans and white blood cell counts. It is their getaway from this horrible thing that I've brought into the house.
Lynette,I know that--Here. But here--It feels like I've ruined their childhood.
Lynette,"Oh, jeez. Get over here."
Lynette,"Oh, look, it's our new queen-- Katherine of arrogant. Hey, where's the wrecking ball?"
Lynette,Thanks. Why?
Lynette,"Katherine. What's with you? Sometimes you act like an ice queen, and then you do something really nice. You are one complicated lady."
Lynette,It feels like I've ruined their childhood.
Lynette,Is that a hole?
Lynette,In the garden there. Has something been digging in there?
Lynette,"You saw a possum, and you didn't tell me?"
Lynette,"Well, we gotta do something about this."
Lynette,"I can't eat right now, Tom. I've got to go to the garden center and get some fencing. God, this is annoying! Can't believe you didn't tell me we have a possum!"
Lynette,Great. Here. Grab this.
Lynette,You know that possum that's been ruining our garden?
Lynette,Don't give him a name. He's not gonna be around much longer.
Lynette,"Honey, I put up a fence, and he burrowed right under it. The man at the garden center said these are crafty creatures, and there's only one way to stop 'em."
Lynette,"Sweetie, let me ask you something. If you had to choose between mommy's beautiful garden and a gross, mean, dirty possum, what would you pick?"
Lynette,"Okay, we're done talking here."
Lynette,Bree.
Lynette,"Huh? Oh, the PET Scan. No, not till Tomorrow. Listen, I need your help. There's a possum in my garden."
Lynette,"Not as much as me. I put out poison, but it ate around it. I got one of those humane traps, but all I trapped was Penny."
Lynette,I want a gun.
Lynette,That was the old Lynette. The new Lynette kills the possums and let's god sort 'em out.
Lynette,Wusses!
Lynette,Perfect. Where can I get one?
Lynette,Great.
Lynette,Shh!
Lynette,"Yeah. Now he's playing mind games with me, but I laid out some Halloween candy. Pretty soon he'll get hungry, and when he does--Trick or treat."
Lynette,Shh! Do you hear that? He's making his move.
Lynette,"No way. He's here, Tom. I can tell."
Lynette,Why?
Lynette,"This is not a joke, Tom. Something has attacked our home, and when that happens, you don't just stand by-- you fight it. Screw this creature that has come into our lives uninvited and is trying to destroy us. It will not defeat me."
Lynette,Thank you.
Lynette,I'm sorry.
Lynette,No.
Lynette,No. This is about the baby.
Lynette,"Well, the results are back, and while you can never actually say you're cured--"
Lynette,"I have to get checked every six months, but, yes, the doctor is very optimistic."
Lynette,"Oh, I was just telling everybody the good news about my--cancer."
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,"We need to talk about this Stan thing. Oh, is that his name? Stan?"
Lynette,"Well, it got me thinking about how much you've had to put your life on hold these past few months."
Lynette,"No, it was a big deal. You have taken amazing care of me. But I know you have so many things you wanna get back to."
Lynette,"Come on. It must be driving you crazy living with five screaming kids underfoot. I don't blame you for wanting a little peace and quiet. You need to leave, mom."
Lynette,It's not just that. It's the smoking and the swearing and the teaching the kids how to make a whiskey sour.
Lynette,I just think it would work better for everyone if you got your own place.
Lynette,"You have money, right? I mean, you loaned us that $10,000."
Lynette,Wait a minute. That was all the money you had?
Lynette,What do you mean? I thought you were living with Lucy.
Lynette,"Oh, you know her, always busy."
Lynette,"Ooh, look. The special is chicken. Doesn't that sound good?"
Lynette,Have fun.
Lynette,What? What? We're having lunch.
Lynette,Nobody is manipulating you.
Lynette,What have you got there? Are you reading from something?
Lynette,Give me that.
Lynette,She's so not like that now.
Lynette,Okay. Okay. Okay. Good for you. I'm sorry.
Lynette,"Oh, yeah. Where is that waiter? I'm gonna go find him."
Lynette,"I told you, if you're gonna have a tree house--you've gotta keep it clean."
Lynette,"Hey, what the hell are you doing?!"
Lynette,"Hey, hey, hey.No, no, no. You are not leaving those here. Hi, mom. Take her away."
Lynette,"Lucy, every fight we have ever had has ended with my foot on your neck. I guarantee that this one's gonna end the same way, too."
Lynette,"Guys, I can't be any clearer on this. I am not taking her back."
Lynette,"I also had cancer for four months, and if I could've asked one of them to leave, I'm not sure which I would've picked."
Lynette,I don't have any room for her. I already have seven people in four bedrooms.
Lynette,Why can't you take her? You are in that huge house all by yourself that you got from the divorce.
Lynette,"Well, we can't just throw her out on the street."
Lynette,"I really wanna meet this jackass. Okay, we all have our excuses, but we gotta figure something out. Come on. She is our mother."
Lynette,"Okay, but the point is, she went."
Lynette,"Okay, she wasn't perfect, clearly. But she gave birth to us. We owe her our lives, and now that she needs us, we can't just turn our back on her."
Lynette,It's like you're saying you don't care about her. At all? And I don't understand that.
Lynette,I don't need your money. I can take care of my mother all by myself.
Lynette,"Here's how you can help--Don't visit for the next few years, 'cause it seems fairly likely I won't have stopped hating you by then."
Lynette,Going?
Lynette,"Hey, Glen may have bored you, but the years we had a father in that house were the happiest of my life. You drove him away."
Lynette,"Yes, hi. I'm looking for my mom. She hangs out at your bar sometimes. Stella Wingfield? Uh, older lady, big smoker, talks like a teamster. Well, that's your fault for letting her run a tab. Look, if you see her, could you tell her to call Lynette? Thank you."
Lynette,She's broke and old and rude. That is not a winning combination on the street.
Lynette,"Lucy, Lydia and I fought over who had to take her. She was right outside. God only knows what she heard us say."
Lynette,"It is a lot easier to resent your parents when you know they're safe in some retirement village, but to know that she's out there, maybe lying facedown in an alley--"
Lynette,Okay. Okay. I guess you're right.
Lynette,"The morgue is listed under government offices, right?"
Lynette,You're waiting outside. Why are you waiting outside?
Lynette,"Oh, my God. It's the police?"
Lynette,Glen? I don't believe it.
Lynette,"Oh, God. Only three decades give or take a year, but who cares? Oh, gosh. You look great."
Lynette,"Oh, just a little cancer. No, but I kicked its ass. I'm good now. You come here. Oh! So why--why are you here?"
Lynette,She did? Is she okay?
Lynette,I didn't know you guys had kept in touch.
Lynette,"Yes, yes, thank you, but where has she been staying?"
Lynette,"Oh, my God."
Lynette,"Oh, well, good. At least she's not living like a hobo. Oh, my God. I'm so glad to see you again."
Lynette,"Once she shows up, you'll meet her and give her the money. Then ask her to walk you back to the car. I'll jump out, grab her, and while you open the trunk--"
Lynette,"Fine, the backseat, but you're just gonna spoil her."
Lynette,Yeah. It's the one good thing you get from a crappy childhood.
Lynette,Why? Mom cheated on you. No one blames you for leaving.
Lynette,"Hey, I'm not complaining."
Lynette,"Ah, there's Booze-illa now."
Lynette,"Oh, crap! Now where do you think you're going?"
Lynette,"Okay, enough with the drama. I want you to come home with me."
Lynette,"I am sorry about that, Mom. We were just venting. People who love you need to do that."
Lynette,"Drop it? Do you hear that? She wants me to drop it. And when she cheated on you, and when she wrecked our family, I bet she wanted you to drop that, too."
Lynette,Handle what?
Lynette,Oh. He seems nice.
Lynette,Kinda.
Lynette,Why didn't you tell me?
Lynette,What are you talking about?
Lynette,I don't think that's how it works.
Lynette,Are you kidding? It would've changed everything.
Lynette,"If I understood why you couldn't stay married to the only father, the only stable parent I'd ever known, yeah, I could've found a way to forgive you all sorts of things. We can talk about this later. Let's go home."
Lynette,Listen to me. I would be honored if you would come and live with us. Having you around these past few months was sort of--fun.
Lynette,Then why not come back?
Lynette,But where will you live?
Lynette,I'm sorry. You want this around?
Lynette,It does. It really does.
Lynette,Sorry. Can you say that again? I don't think I heard you right.
Lynette,"Gaby, you just got married."
Lynette,You can't be serious.
Lynette,"Hi. Did you hear they declared a tornado watch? Scary, huh?"
Lynette,"Oh, yeah. You're welcome. Um--can we stay in your basement?"
Lynette,"Well, if this tornado watch gets upgraded to warning, we're gonna need a place to wait it out."
Lynette,"We, me, Tom, the kids, that family you've come to know and love."
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,"Mrs. McCluskey, please?"
Lynette,We can be quiet--relative to the storm.
Lynette,That's in the middle of skid row. You think I want my kids around a bunch of winos?
Lynette,I am asking you as a friend. Please?
Lynette,Thanks. And don't worry. I'll have a talk with my kids. I promise they'll keep a lid on the destruction.
Lynette,Yeah. Mm.
Lynette,"Hey, we're here!"
Lynette,"Oh. Sorry. Kinda get used to it. Come here. Give that to mama. Hey, guys? Come on now. Knock it off. Here you go. And-- first base, second base, third base, sit. We gonna have a nice, quiet tornado watch, and nobody's gonna cause any problems."
Lynette,I didn't realize there'd be a cat. Tom's really allergic.
Lynette,"Ida, is there any chance that we could put little Toby upstairs?"
Lynette,Yeah. He'd be very safe. We could put him in a closet.
Lynette,what?
Lynette,"No, Toby's an animal, and my husband, a human being, will get very sick if he stays down here, so, please, put the cat upstairs."
Lynette,"No, that's ridiculous. Karen, come on."
Lynette,Knock yourself out.
Lynette,You okay?
Lynette,"No. No, no, no, no, no. You stay here."
Lynette,I'm not gonna sit and watch my husband suffocate.
Lynette,"Karen, after all our years of friendship, how can you choose a cat over my husband?"
Lynette,Of course.
Lynette,What are you talking about? I had you over for lemonade last week.
Lynette,That is not true. I genuinely care about you.
Lynette,"Hey, hold it! Hold it! You can't go out there!"
Lynette,Karen!
Lynette,Karen! You gotta get inside now!
Lynette,"Damn it! I'm not gonna let you die, so don't make me drag you!"
Lynette,"Oh! Hurry!Oh! Go! No! Come on! Come on! Come on, come on! Get in!"
Lynette,"Come on! Hurry up! Go! Get in, get in! Get in! Uhh! Hang on! Hang onto this!"
Lynette,"Oh, my god."
Lynette,"Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Tom! Help me! Help me, Tom!"
Lynette,"Oh, my god!"
Lynette,Why is it taking so long? They should be going faster.
Lynette,"Why can't we hear them? If my kids are alive, they would be yelling. Tom would be yelling."
Lynette,"Okay. You really, really, really think so?"
Lynette,"No. No, I guess not."
Lynette,Hi!
Lynette,"Oh, my god!"
Lynette,"Oh, my god."
Lynette,"Wow, the things you accumulate in a lifetime, huh?"
Lynette,"Hahaha, so her niece and nephew are taking all this stuff back to Nebraska?"
Lynette,What's all this baseball stuff? There's a mitt and a jersey. Was this her husband's?
Lynette,"Yeah, right. Oh, you're serious?"
Lynette,No.
Lynette,Ida? I have trouble seeing her as the leadoff hitter for anything other than osteoporosis.
Lynette,How did I not know this?
Lynette,"You realize we're cleaning, right? We're not eating candy."
Lynette,What do you mean?
Lynette,But that's not where they found her.
Lynette,"Well, we'd do anything for your aunt. I hope you know what an amazing woman she was."
Lynette,At about the rest of these boxes?
Lynette,"Um, well, there's a great diner right near Granville field."
Lynette,"Yeah, you stopping there anyway to spread your aunt's ashes?"
Lynette,You can't do that. Ida wanted her ashes scattered at the field.
Lynette,It doesn't matter. She was an amazing woman. You should respect her wishes.
Lynette,"Hey, I-if you don't have time to do it, I will."
Lynette,"Look, you're taking her pearls. The least you can do is honor her wishes."
Lynette,"Fine. And for what it's worth, you passed bi*chy ten minutes ago."
Lynette,Wait! You'll never find it I'll get it for you.
Lynette,Here you go.
Lynette,"Well, here's the thing. I called the general manager to ask if we could scatter the ashes here, and he said absolutely not."
Lynette,"Hey, you've abetted. Might as well aid."
Lynette,Do you maybe want to say something first?
Lynette,That was lovely.
Lynette,"She played third base, right?"
Lynette,"Oh, my goodness."
Lynette,"Oh, yeah. Okay."
Lynette,"Damn it, Karen. I'm running out of Ida."
Lynette,"Okay, split up, and I'll meet you back at the car. Go!"
Lynette,Oh!
Lynette,I'm just glad we gave Ida what she wanted.
Lynette,Then why don't I feel better?
Lynette,"Because it wasn't enough, not compared to what she did for me. She saved my kids. She's this amazing woman, and I never bothered to get to know her, so, yeah, I sprinkled her ashes, but it would have been nice to do something before she was ashes."
Lynette,Yep. Third strike? What were the first two?
Lynette,I got time for that.
Lynette,"Well, we heard you were having a rough time."
Lynette,"Katherine, we didn't come here to upset you."
Lynette,"No, we came here. We wanted to help you, to fix you lunch or clean your house. Or offer up our own houses for you to clean, if that's your thing."
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,We should go to church.
Lynette,"Ah, it's just--We've been through a lot lately, and we have a lot to be thankful for. Don't you think we owe the big guy a little face time?"
Lynette,Tom--I'm serious.
Lynette,"So I'm clear, you can't be bothered with saving your eternal soul because the pistons have no defense?"
Lynette,"Well, I haven't. I have some questions I would like answered. And I don't know anything about god or Jesus, and our kids don't either."
Lynette,"Well, I decided I should go to church today. Yeah, Tom said the same thing. Anyway, since you're the most religious person I know, I was wondering if you would take us to your church."
Lynette,"Great! Just give me a second to sell Tom on the idea. You know, he was raised catholic."
Lynette,"Okay. Well, I'll be right back. Oh, this is so exciting. I'm going to church. By the way, what am I now?"
Lynette,Right.
Lynette,I've got a question about his sermon.
Lynette,It'll just take a sec.
Lynette,"Hi. I'm Lynette Scavo. I'm a friend of Bree Hodge. And your sermon was lovely, especially the part about the trees."
Lynette,"But here's where you lost me--""God's love is as sure as the sunlight."""
Lynette,"The reason I ask is, there are wars all over the world, and it seems like every month, some dumb-ass walks into a school and starts shooting children. So I'm thinking, god's love? Not so sure."
Lynette,"Okay, I give you that one. But what about the tornado that just happened? You can't blame man for that."
Lynette,"Well, sure. I'm easy. Thanks."
Lynette,"Hey, church buddy. Look what I got."
Lynette,"Yeah, and I'm breaking her in tonight. Nothing like that new Bible smell."
Lynette,"Yeah, and I hope the Reverend's ready, ��_��_��_cause I got about a zillion questions for him."
Lynette,What isn't my fault?
Lynette,"Yeah, but how do you get the answers if you don't ask the questions?"
Lynette,I'm sorry. did I embarrass you on Sunday?
Lynette,"Well, what if I need to? What if that's the kind of church I'm looking for?"
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,What are you doing here?
Lynette,Weren't you the one who said I should explore other churches?
Lynette,"No. I just put 10 bucks in the collection plate, and I'm gonna get my money's worth."
Lynette,"I'm not Presbyterian. I'm a free agent. And if you're open to a little Q and A, you've got me."
Lynette,"Okay, what gives?"
Lynette,Bree--
Lynette,"Oh, then you won't get what you want?"
Lynette,"Well, forget it. Let someone else help you with your power grab."
Lynette,"Yes, and do you know why? Because out of all my friends, you are the one who had real faith. You had an actual relationship with god. At least, that's what I thought."
Lynette,"Because I have had a rough few months. okay? But I know you've had rough times, too, and I always assumed that your faith had helped you get through them. I envied you that, to be honest."
Lynette,Really? Okay. How?
Lynette,"Well, that's not a good answer. I have been through cancer and a tornado, and I don't know why I survived, and so many other people didn't. I don't understand, and I need to."
Lynette,"Why didn't you ask? Oh, that's right. You don't like asking questions."
Lynette,Hi there.
Lynette,Huh. that's nice of you.
Lynette,"Oh, you don't have to do that."
Lynette,"Well, maybe a little."
Lynette,Well--there are some things that are easy to believe in.
Lynette,Meh.
Lynette,"Oh, well, I'm pretty comfortable with the Catholics. They're the only ones who don't judge me for having so many kids."
Lynette,"I faced cancer and a tornado, but I'm running from this."
Lynette,"Oh, my god. Rick."
Lynette,"Great, actually. We're great."
Lynette,"Hey, Tom. Look who's here--Rick."
Lynette,"Oh, well, that's nice. Thank you."
Lynette,"Well, I-- I've got some work to do."
Lynette,That's you?
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,You were supposed to be home at 8:00 to help me wrangle the kids for bath time. It's--it's almost 11:00.
Lynette,"So where were you? You were stewing, weren't you? Come on. You're upset about Rick."
Lynette,"Oh, yeah?"
Lynette,So you're really okay with this?
Lynette,"Yeah, it's back."
Lynette,"Gaby, since when do you come to price warehouse?"
Lynette,"Oh, I've been unwashed for years."
Lynette,"Gaby, people don't come here for the amenities. They come because toilet paper's 3 cents a ton."
Lynette,"Yeah, we're crazy that way. I don't know why you're complaining about handicapped spaces. Doesn't Carlos have one of those blue placards?"
Lynette,"No, I'm pretty sure the blind qualify, too."
Lynette,"Uh, yes."
Lynette,Vandalism? Porter! Preston! Get over here!
Lynette,What?
Lynette,I didn't go into work that night.
Lynette,"Yeah. No, he was here."
Lynette,"Thank you. Oh, oh, hey, honey. Could you hold back a sec?"
Lynette,"Hey, guys, would you go play in the back for a while? I need to talk to your dad. Thanks."
Lynette,"And you made me lie to them, too, which brings up another question. Did you know that perjury is, like, this whole big thing?"
Lynette,"No, overreacting would be if I threw a brick through you. What were you thinking? Help me understand."
Lynette,"Okay. I know this whole thing with Rick-- it really caused us some damage. I know it hurt us, but we survived it, and it's over now."
Lynette,"Oh, Tom."
Lynette,But-- nothing ever happened between us. You have to believe me. Come on!
Lynette,"Yeah, we were sure one of you would end up killing the other."
Lynette,The obnoxious backstabber just called your name.
Lynette,"Hi, Andrew. Guess what? Your mom just won the founder's award."
Lynette,What? What? Is everyone okay?
Lynette,"Oh, my god! That's horrible! How did it start?"
Lynette,"Okay, I-I'm gonna--I'll call you back in about five. Bye."
Lynette,Whatcha doing?
Lynette,Need a little caffeine fix?
Lynette,"The open bar is no longer your friend, huh?"
Lynette,Is that where you were during Bree's acceptance speech - doing free shots at the bar?
Lynette,You go alone?
Lynette,"Yeah. I was thinkin', if anyone asks about that fire at Rick's, it'd be good if you had someone to account for where you were."
Lynette,"Right, right. It's just--if anyone thinks you did, it'd be handy if you could prove them wrong, wouldn't it?"
Lynette,No.
Lynette,"No, no. of course not. It's just, if the police came here to ask us about the brick, they're probably gonna ask us about the fire, so you might wanna be ready."
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"Hey, Andrew. What do you need?"
Lynette,"Oh, my god! Stop it! What are you doing? Stop. Hey, easy. Easy. Just stop it! Oh!"
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,"Andrew, do something! Do something! Stop it! Stop! Oh, for god sakes, what is the matter with you? What are you, 12 years old? Stop it. Jeez."
Lynette,So when are you guys gonna finish grilling my husband?
Lynette,"If you insist on questioning my husband about a crime he didn't commit, you should at least have all the facts."
Lynette,"Well, for starters, Mr. Coletti opened his restaurant to get back at me because I wouldn't have an affair with him."
Lynette,"No. I am saying that if anyone had an ax to grind, it's Rick. Maybe he set the fire himself so he could blame my husband."
Lynette,And Tom was at the founder's ball with me.
Lynette,"That's true. I saw him. I was mad that he ditched me, so I went to drag his ass back inside. But when I saw him shouting at the radio, I decided I'll just wait and make his life miserable when we get home. So unless there's a law against choosing Lebron James over your wife, I think we're done here."
Lynette,"Rick, look. You know me. If Tom had done something like this, do you really think I would protect him?"
Lynette,Didn't I? 'cause it kinda seemed like they had you against the ropes in there.
Lynette,"Sure, I do. It must've been some other random maniac with a grudge against Rick who burned down his restaurant."
Lynette,"Well, it wouldn't be the first time. You lied about the brick, and you were pretty smooth, too. Hell, I bought it."
Lynette,Excuse me?
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,"Okay, you are angry, so I'm gonna let that one pass, and I'm gonna say this for e very last time. Nothing happened between me and Rick."
Lynette,"Hey, you guys know you're not supposed to be out of bed."
Lynette,"Come here. Come on. Okay. Mommy and daddy are sort of-- fighting, but we're working through it."
Lynette,"Oh, something he did that made mommy really mad."
Lynette,"Yes, of course."
Lynette,Mm-hmm?
Lynette,"Oh, sweetie, I am so sorry. I bet that really scared you, didn't it?"
Lynette,You did what?
Lynette,"Oh, my god."
Lynette,How are they doing?
Lynette,"Well, gee, I'm kind of at a loss here, Tom. Dr. Spock didn't have a chapter on how to punish your kids for burning down a building."
Lynette,"Tom, they're not serial killers. They're two little boys who were afraid their parents were breaking up."
Lynette,No. We can handle this in house. We can make sure they never do anything like this again.
Lynette,Wait a second. Those are your chores.
Lynette,"No, sorry. I hope you find him."
Lynette,Boys? Who are you talking about?
Lynette,Kayla? Can I speak to you for a second?
Lynette,"I need to ask you something, and I want you to tell me the truth, okay? Did you have anything to do with the fire at Rick's restaurant?"
Lynette,"I'm looking for a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer here."
Lynette,"No, the twins did, but they say it was your idea."
Lynette,Kayla--why would you even joke about something like that?
Lynette,Do you have any idea what you've done? Someone could have been killed.
Lynette,But it doesn't matter! Intentionally setting a fire is a very serious crime. Don't you get that?
Lynette,I know. Turns out the whole thing was Kayla's idea.
Lynette,"Mm, no. I think it goes a little further than that. I think we have a seriously troubled young girl. She needs--professional help."
Lynette,"You brought it up before, and in this case, I really don't think we have a choice."
Lynette,"You didn't see her. She just sat there, playing with her doll with this kind of eerie calm."
Lynette,"No, you're missing my point."
Lynette,Well--yeah. Think of what that poor girl has been through. And on top of that--her mom was kind of a psycho.
Lynette,"I am just saying, apple--tree. Maybe not so far."
Lynette,"Well, actually, this is a different kind of doctor. You know, the kind you can talk to?"
Lynette,"Well, I thought you might like to have a safe place where you could share your feelings. You know? With your mom's death and moving in with us, you've been through a lot."
Lynette,"Well, good, but sometimes when you go through hard things, it changes the way you think. Maybe we have trouble telling the difference between what's right and what's wrong."
Lynette,"Actually, you do. That's why you're here. So let's just wait and talk to the doctor, okay?"
Lynette,Good.
Lynette,"What? No. Sweetie, we don't need to do that."
Lynette,You don't understand.
Lynette,"Actually, I think we're okay. We--resolved our problems just sitting in your waiting room. Boy, you're good. 'Kay. So we're gonna go."
Lynette,"And I wouldn't have done that unless I thought we had a serious problem, which we do."
Lynette,"Tom, it is one thing not to want to admit something's wrong with your kid. It's another to just bury your head in the sand."
Lynette,You are.
Lynette,There are opportunities that you can see that--I'm not! What would be my agenda?
Lynette,You're burying your head in the sand.
Lynette,There are so many opportunities that you could look and see what's going on. I am not!
Lynette,Come on. I do.
Lynette,"Oh, my god! Oh, my god! What happened? Is he okay?"
Lynette,Get up. Up.
Lynette,"Oh, we gotta take him to the hospital."
Lynette,Okay. All right.
Lynette,"It's okay, sweetie. You're gonna be just fine. There."
Lynette,Did you have anything to do with the fire at Rick's restaurant?
Lynette,I think we have a seriously troubled young girl.
Lynette,This is Dr. Dolan.
Lynette,"He's gonna hang out and watch us, you know, be a family."
Lynette,"So I like what you said about making the family stronger, but as I told you, Kayla's the one you wanna focus on."
Lynette,"Yeah, or a child with problems can lead to a dysfunctional family. I mean, Kayla's the one that got my kids to light a fire and jump off the roof."
Lynette,"I understand. It just seems like--at $140 an hour, we could skip straight to the part where you sit down with Kayla and tell her to stop being so evil."
Lynette,Yeah?
Lynette,"Oh, well, thank you. It's beautiful. thank you."
Lynette,She never does this.
Lynette,So we were sort of surprised to get your call. Don't you need to see Kayla a few more times before you report back to us?
Lynette,"Oh, go ahead. Shoot."
Lynette,Hmm?
Lynette,Oh. well--s-sure. I've been very good to her.
Lynette,"Do you have a diploma on your wall, Tom? I don't think so. Zip it."
Lynette,"Of course I do--as much as I can, given the way she joined our family. It's just--it's complicated."
Lynette,"Oh, god. Is this gonna be one of those therapy things where she hits me with a foam bat?"
Lynette,Could we revisit the foam bat idea for just a second?
Lynette,Ask me if I love Tom right now. Go ahead. I dare ya.
Lynette,"Hey, honey, could you get that? Thank you."
Lynette,"Hey, Bree, perfect timing. We were just getting ready to deal the cards."
Lynette,"Okay, first of all, you're, like, the greatest mom ever to wanna protect Danielle like that."
Lynette,I can't believe she was blackmailing you.
Lynette,Yeah. This woman is outta control.
Lynette,No. What are we gonna do?
Lynette,"She did, so you can kiss that little blackmail scheme good-bye."
Lynette,"We tried to be your friends, but you don't even understand what that word means, so now we're gonna be something you do understand."
Lynette,Mnh-mnh.
Lynette,Oh. Yow! It's a little pricey.
Lynette,"Well, I know, but we're supposed to be spending time together, not going into debt. Oh. How about this one?"
Lynette,I just--It's good for us to hang out. I enjoy it.
Lynette,No. All my idea. I just wanted to treat you to a real fun day.
Lynette,Mm-hmm.
Lynette,Okay. Good times.
Lynette,"Well, we've done enough damage for one day. Let's go home."
Lynette,"Honey, we're about to have dinner."
Lynette,"All right. Thank you. If you're hungry, I'll get you something healthy, and you can have it in the car."
Lynette,"At this point, because of the way you're acting. Please don't do this, Kayla. We have been having such a nice time."
Lynette,Are you-- threatening me?
Lynette,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that, but that was--that was horrible, what you said. And--you should never say that again. Okay, so--come on. Let's go."
Lynette,My gosh! That is so sweet. Thank you so much.
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,So--no Kayla?
Lynette,"Again, I know I crossed the line, and I am so sorry."
Lynette,"Tom, if you had been there and heard what she said--"
Lynette,"Well, Kayla loves waffles, and since she and I have been having some problems lately, I wanted to do something nice for her. Oh, you tell Kayla her breakfast is ready."
Lynette,Hi.
Lynette,"Uh, one second. Preston, you might wanna stop dropping your waffle on the floor, ��_��_��_cause I'm still gonna make you eat it. So, uh, what's C.P.S.?"
Lynette,"For what it's worth, I keep my floors incredibly clean."
Lynette,Abuse? That's ridiculous.
Lynette,"Okay--First, I'm not that kind of mom. And second, Kayla has a tendency to--exaggerate."
Lynette,Have a seat. I'll be with you in a second.
Lynette,My neighbors? God! I could strangle that girl.
Lynette,Wait. They could take my children?
Lynette,You have got to be kidding me!
Lynette,So what do I need to do to keep my kids?
Lynette,"Oh, Susan. He's adorable."
Lynette,Maynard?
Lynette,How did he die? Was he beaten to death 'cause his name was Maynard?
Lynette,"I guess that's why they didn't name you ""Einstein""."
Lynette,"Yeah. Which says ""kick my ass"" less--""May"" or ""Nerd""?"
Lynette,What's going on?
Lynette,What? Why? Wh--for what?
Lynette,Burn mark? What burn mark?
Lynette,Oh! Tom.
Lynette,"I--okay. Look, look, I-I will come with you. Please, just don't handcuff me in front of my children."
Lynette,And go where? I can't get within 500 feet of my children. Are you not up to speed on the people vs. Lynette Scavo?
Lynette,"No, you'll figure something out. I have to go back to my cell."
Lynette,How can you talk like that? What else has to happen for you to get what's going on here?
Lynette,"No, you are trying to stay on the fence while I fight to stop Kayla from destroying us. But look around you, Tom. Look where I am! You have got to do something now. Fix this."
Lynette,Kayla--I'm sorry how everything turned out.
Lynette,"Okay, then."
Lynette,"Oh, I'm with Gaby. I mean, you know me. I always like to give people the benefit of the doubt--"
Lynette,"No, I don't, but let's say I did. Katherine has this aloof quality. It's like she's always trying to keep us at arm's length."
Lynette,"Bree, you can talk Katherine up all you want, but she is just never gonna be one of us."
Lynette,Hey. You know what we haven't done in a really long time? Made 250 mini pizzas in one afternoon.
Lynette,"Bree's in a horrible jam, and I told her we'd help cater the commitment ceremony tomorrow."
Lynette,"Okay, so at the risk of cracking these eggshells I've been walking on all week, any idea when you're gonna stop being so angry?"
Lynette,"'Cause you know we didn't have a choice, Tom. We had to get her out of the house."
Lynette,"Fine. You can be as angry and sulky and pissy as you want, just so long as you're here tomorrow, helping me crank out 250 mini pizzas."
Lynette,"Oh, Tom. Don't you know an urban myth when you hear one?"
Lynette,"Mm-hmm. Uh, chicken Marsala, and pasta for the vegetarians."
Lynette,You sure you haven't been married before?
Lynette,"No, no, give me another chance. I will get it."
Lynette,Uh--there are no wings.
Lynette,It's--stunning.
Lynette,It's your ice sculpture.
Lynette,I don't care what you said. We have to fix this! Or do you want to tell bree that you torpedoed her ceremony?
Lynette,I'll get Lee.
Lynette,"Yeah, I can. Sit down. Earlier, my husband, in an attempt to help you with your relationship, mistakenly gave you some advice, which he would now like to take back. Tom?"
Lynette,What?
Lynette,Where the hell are you going with this?
Lynette,Could you give us a second?
Lynette,Answer him.
Lynette,"Good. Good, then--get out there and get committed, you crazy kids."
Lynette,What the hell is going on?!
Lynette,"We always knew he'd do something like this eventually, and he did."
Lynette,Why is there a police car in our driveway?
Lynette,"Again? I am so sorry, officer. We have talked to Porter till we're blue in the face. It's like he's determined to go back to juvenile hall."
Lynette,Preston?
Lynette,What the hell's going on here?
Lynette,"Oh, yeah? Why didn't you play at home? Why did you have to sneak in here?"
Lynette,"Asked and answered. Okay, that's it! Everybody out. Game's over. Can I have your chair for a second? Hey! Look up here! Mom's here. Party's over. Door's open. Out you go. Go on. Shoo! You guys have pulled a lot of stupid stunts. But this? This? Risking our liquor license, our livelihood?"
Lynette,Unbelievable. You guys are grounded for two weeks.
Lynette,"Yeah, yeah! Keep complaining. I'd love to make it a year. Now clean this place up. Now!"
Lynette,"Okay, you're not gonna believe this, but--she's back."
Lynette,What happened to your tenant?
Lynette,"Oh, let's make it a party. We could do it at my restaurant."
Lynette,"Please don't take this the wrong way, but--we love you."
Lynette,"And obviously I am not getting through to the twins, because no Matter what I say, they keep pulling this crap, and I am sick of it."
Lynette,Sorry.
Lynette,You have to. I am tired of being the bad cop. You walk the beat for a while.
Lynette,I really appreciate it.
Lynette,Sorry.
Lynette,Tom? Can I talk to you a sec?
Lynette,Don't you think you were kind of sending the wrong message in there?
Lynette,"Yeah? ""Creative"" like selling fake I.D.S was creative. And hot-wiring McCluskey's car-- that was a work of art."
Lynette,"Oh, my god."
Lynette,You think they're cool.
Lynette,"No, I mean you think they're cool in that you wanna be them."
Lynette,"You do! This is Tom, former high school nerd, living viciously through his awesome-ass kids."
Lynette,"Are we redefining ""cool"" to include playing trombone in the marching band?"
Lynette,But I told them they couldn't go.
Lynette,"Hey, Susan?"
Lynette,"I just need five seconds to bitch about Tom, and then I'll-- oh, my god. Your painter isn't done yet?"
Lynette,"Well, anyway, Tom refuses to acknowledge that the twins are turning into juvenile delinquents. Just the other day, I was��_��_��_"
Lynette,Have you been drinking?
Lynette,"Sorry to have barged in, and thanks for letting me get that off my chest."
Lynette,"And while I thought grounding you was an appropriate punishment, your dad convinced me. I was being a little too hard on you guys."
Lynette,And so we have decided to let you go to the homecoming dance tonight--
Lynette,--in your father's convertible.
Lynette,"Come on, Tom. I mean, we trust them, right?"
Lynette,"No! You don't want two cool kids pulling up to homecoming in a mom car, especially with that big dent they put in it last month."
Lynette,Don't thank me. Thank your father.
Lynette,"Tom, relax! You high-spirited kids do whatever it takes to have fun."
Lynette,Whatcha doing?
Lynette,"Actually, it's 32."
Lynette,Yeah. Remember when you spent the entire day on the internet trying to find a new gearshift knob? Worst anniversary ever.
Lynette,"I know. That car is your baby. If only there was something I felt that intensely about. Oh, wait! There is-- my actual babies."
Lynette,"I know you love them, but sometimes you find them so cool and entertaining, you forget to parent them."
Lynette,"No, listen. This is important. When they were little and they'd act out, and we'd always say, ""Relax! They're young. When they're older, they'll get it."" Well, Tom, they're 16 now. Not getting it. We have a lot of work to do in a very short time, And if you and I aren't in sync, I'm afraid it's not gonna happen."
Lynette,Thank you. But you didn't have to--
Lynette,Excuse me?
Lynette,Got a sec?
Lynette,So I assume you know about what happened to Jimmy Conrado.
Lynette,"Your friend gets busted for dealing drugs at school, and all you have to say is, ""I guess""?"
Lynette,You were on the same little league team.
Lynette,No. Not really.
Lynette,"Hey, Parker. Can I ask you something, just between us? Does Porter hang out with Jimmy Conrado?"
Lynette,His what on what?
Lynette,Really? Can anyone talk to him?
Lynette,"And, uh--how would somebody make that happen?"
Lynette,I am just--talking to Porter on silverfizz.
Lynette,Me. I'm 16 and cute. I like graphic novels and Tokyo police club.
Lynette,Our brooding son has a classmate who got arrested for selling drugs. I really think the end justifies the means here.
Lynette,"Well, the good news is he really doesn't hang out with Jimmy Conrado. But I am a little worried about Anita47, who told him Cherry fruit pops are an aphrodisiac."
Lynette,You're probably right. It's just--Did you know Porter writes poetry?
Lynette,"Yeah. Our Porter, the kid who communicates with grunts and shrugs, writes this--beautiful, heart-wrenching poetry."
Lynette,"Okay, Okay. You're right. You're right."
Lynette,"Oh, really?"
Lynette,Aw. That's sweet.
Lynette,Is that my Yeats book? I love his poetry.
Lynette,"Aah, this is the kind of poetry that melts a girl's heart. So romantic. Oh! Here's a great one--""The lover tells of the rose in his heart."" My first boyfriend gave me this poem. I was a junior in��_��_��_"
Lynette,Oh. Sorry. Enjoy!
Lynette,"Oh, crap on things."
Lynette,Porter sent me a sex poem.
Lynette,He may be in love with me.
Lynette,"Okay-- Remember how you told me I should stop talking to him online? Well, of course, I didn't, and I sort of told him I liked his poetry."
Lynette,Shh! He'll hear you.
Lynette,Calm down. I'm gonna break it off in an e-mail.
Lynette,"I know that you have only been the receiving end of break-up letters, but I've actually written a few, and I know how to let him down easy."
Lynette,Go away.
Lynette,Uh-- Thanks.
Lynette,"What? No, I didn't."
Lynette,"Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Why didn't you say something?!"
Lynette,"You said it was great. Way to bury the lead, Tom! Tom, don't you dare!"
Lynette,"Hey. Mind if I join you? Okay, I know what I did--was unforgivable. And I am not trying to make excuses, but--we used to talk all the time, and then one day it just stopped, and it killed me. I felt like I lost you. And then I was Saraj, and I had you back, and we were talking again, and you were telling me thin."
Lynette,"Okay. Well, for what it's worth, I loved our conversations, and I'm-- going to miss them."
Lynette,"Hi, Dave."
Lynette,"Hey, Tom?"
Lynette,Why are there two piles?
Lynette,You need unopened mountain climbing equipment from 1986? You don't climb mountains.
Lynette,"I know. You get winded just climbing out of the tub. You're never gonna climb a mountain. You know what else you're never gonna do? Learn German, make your own beer or--have 8 minute abs."
Lynette,"Toss it, and keep tossing until this 2-car garage can hold at least one car."
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,"I do, but I'm hoping I'm wrong."
Lynette,And I wasn't!
Lynette,"""Gigs""? Did you just say ""gigs""?"
Lynette,What?
Lynette,"Okay, I need to dial you in to some gigs you already have, which are running a restaurant, being a husband and a father. And I thought you were the one who said you wanted to spend more time with your family."
Lynette,Could you just--for a sec? Come on. You know I'm right. You're far too busy for this.
Lynette,Those of us with hearing beg to differ.
Lynette,"Oh, come on, Tom. This is not your--"
Lynette,"Ooh! Careful, honey."
Lynette,You could break your dad's guitar and--
Lynette,"Hey, is everything all right? Oh, my!"
Lynette,How in the world did that happen?
Lynette,"Now I'm sure it was an accident, Tom. Please don't yell at her."
Lynette,"Oh, Tom! She's up in her room."
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,Yeah. Sure. Come on in.
Lynette,You bought Tom a new bass?
Lynette,We can't accept this.
Lynette,"Well, sorry. But Maybe you could go skateboarding with Orson."
Lynette,And what makes you think you know what my husband needs?
Lynette,You mean his junk?
Lynette,"I'm married to a 45-year-old man who has a red convertible. Yeah, I think I know."
Lynette,"So--now my marriage is in trouble, and you're gonna save it by giving Tom a bass?"
Lynette,I thought you were the one who said you wanted to spend more time with your family.
Lynette,Hey. Congratulations!
Lynette,"Oh, and look, you signed it--""To Lynette, the sweetest, most wonderful friend I've ever known."""
Lynette,Ha ha ha .Could I see that? I'd love to read it.
Lynette,"Well, back before I consecrated my life to mozzarella, marketing was sort of what I did."
Lynette,I'm sorry. What?
Lynette,"Oh, god, no. Her agency really whiffed-- Hmm? So I'm coming up with a whole new campaign. I was looking through my old portfolio for inspiration."
Lynette,"You know, it's been years since I looked through this stuff. I'd forgotten I was--kinda great."
Lynette,"Well, Maybe I'm the lucky one. This could be a perfect way for me to stick my toe back in the business. Nothing big, Maybe just pick up some freelance work."
Lynette,"Well, gee, I don't know. I guess the same place that you find time for your garage band."
Lynette,"As you can see, the graphic works just as well on a free-standing display unit. Neat, huh?"
Lynette,"Well, who knew your marketing guys were such lame-os? What they came up with is so--tepid."
Lynette,"Well, they overshot and wound up in ""bland,"" right on the border of ""sucky."" You need to grab your audience, just grab 'em. I've gone for jazzier colors, bolder fonts. Oh, I have really played up the whole nostalgia angle."
Lynette,I see women really responding to that.
Lynette,Aw--Okay. Well--I've got a whole bunch of alternatives.
Lynette,"You don't have to. I'll be the bad guy. Just tell 'em you've hired me, and I'll go in there, six-guns ablazing. So--do we have a deal? Just give me the word."
Lynette,No?
Lynette,But mine is better.
Lynette,"Look, Bree--I think I know a little more about marketing than you do. When I was in it, I owned this town. I had every big account. Hell, I was even named businesswoman of the year."
Lynette,Really?
Lynette,She won't be glowing when that agency sinks her book.
Lynette,"I'm telling you, the only thing staler than that ad campaign is this dinner roll."
Lynette,Stu!
Lynette,"Hey! Everyone, this is my old assistant, Stu, um--"
Lynette,"Durber. Hey! Well, this was one great guy. He would schlep all the way across town just to get me my Chinese food. So--what are you up to?"
Lynette,Your company? You have a company?
Lynette,Huh.
Lynette,"No, I-- also went into business for myself."
Lynette,"Well, it's really my husband's. And I'm still doing some freelance stuff."
Lynette,Mm-hmm. Oh.
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,Oh!
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,"Yeah, mm. Great."
Lynette,You know what this tastes like? More.
Lynette,Stu? Stu is doing Bree's ad campaign? I rode in his hatchback once. It smelled like mu shu. I gotta warn her.
Lynette,"Guys, I am just gonna offer her a little advice. Geesh."
Lynette,Whoop. Still waiting.
Lynette,Coupons.
Lynette,"Do a cross-promotion with some of the major food companies. Knock off 20% on some of the items featured in your recipes, then they do the same towards the purchase of your cookbook."
Lynette,"Zip it, Stewie."
Lynette,"Yeah, that's immaterial. What do you think of the coupons?"
Lynette,"Oh. I know. You've got your book and--and your big fancy award, and I'm just a housewife."
Lynette,"You know, when I had a high-powered career, and you were just a housewife, I never looked down on you."
Lynette,"Fine. And don't worry. Even though I'd like to, I'm not gonna make some big, ugly scene."
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,"So--give me some guidance. Do I grovel, send flowers, or--"
Lynette,Drunk? Jealous?
Lynette,Don't give me that. You are having the kind of success I only dreamed of back in my ad days.
Lynette,"No. But watching you, I look down on me. When I held your book in my hands, I felt so jealous my stomach hurt. And I thought, if I could just hitch a ride, have a piece of it, I wouldn't feel so bad about your success."
Lynette,"It is. You're at the start of an incredible journey, and I am going to be there every step of the way, cheering you on, telling anyone who will listen that the Bree Van de Kamp is my friend."
Lynette,"And the rest of the stuff--you'll find a way to fix it. Just know that all your friends are very proud of you. Bitterly jealous, but proud."
Lynette,Fine. I'll get you a towel.
Lynette,Penny! Let's go! Time for bath!
Lynette,Penny!
Lynette,"Oh. Penny. If you're thinking of taking that for a spin, I've got bad news. You're 9. Hey, what's the matter, sweetie?"
Lynette,What? Of course not. Why would you say something like that?
Lynette,Oh. They're just being silly. They're always silly. That's why we won't be sad when they move out of the house. Come on.
Lynette,"Yes, but daddy's gonna live to a ripe old age unless he doesn't get home in time for Mrs. McCluskey's party, and then all bets are off. Oh, daddy's gonna be fine. Come on."
Lynette,Hi. My husband--I'm Lynette Scavo. Dr. Baron called me--
Lynette,Oh. Hi. What happened?
Lynette,Uh-huh.
Lynette,Oh. Is he--
Lynette,So he's okay?
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,"So I'm thinking no more electrical work, okay?"
Lynette,"The kids know everything's fine. They send their love. Don't worry about anything, okay? Just rest. I'll come back soon, okay?"
Lynette,But it doesn't matter because you're not dying.
Lynette,"Okay. Okay. We'll find more. Just rest now, okay?"
Lynette,What the hell is this?
Lynette,"And when I was 12, I had a poster of Shaun Cassidy, but you don't see me driving around in him, do you?"
Lynette,"What, do machine guns come out of the headlights?"
Lynette,"Where have you been? So help me, if McCluskey gets there before us, I will brain you."
Lynette,"Well, sheesh. Oh. Sweetie, we already got Karen a candle. An R.V. might be overkill."
Lynette,"Oh, don't. I like my mind the way it is."
Lynette,"Well, I might not say anything. I might just put my finger to my ear and twirl it in small circles. We can't do something like that, Tom."
Lynette,"Okay, let me ask you one tiny question about this big adventure plan of yours who's gonna be running our restaurant while we're off doing the electric kool-aid acid test?"
Lynette,"Just so I'm clear, you want us to sell our thriving business so we can live in a bus, like carnies?"
Lynette,"And when we start stealing to support ourselves, The kids can see the inside of a prison. You're right, Tom. It's a brilliant idea."
Lynette,Fine. I'll get you a towel.
Lynette,How about the crazy married couple throwing drinks? How are they gonna be?
Lynette,"No, I get it. The sports car, the garage band--Maybe what we need now, Tom, is for you to get it."
Lynette,And I had cancer. I get it. I get it. You want your life to count for something.
Lynette,"Scavo's was the adventure. We changed our whole lives so you could live out your dream, and now you're bored. We can't keep doing this, Tom. We can't keep throwing all the cards up in the air every time you get a little restless. Let's call it a night. We have to work tomorrow. Are you coming?"
Lynette,"Amy, don't worry about the lunch specials. I am only two blocks away. I'll take care of it once I--Actually, you do them. I'm gonna be a while. Tom? Tom?"
Lynette,"So funny. I was gonna ask you the same question. But I was gonna start with ""What the hell?"""
Lynette,Right. So--what the hell?
Lynette,That's right. You're a realtor.
Lynette,I think--it's great.
Lynette,"Well--It's a little dumb, but compared to what I was thinking--"
Lynette,"Well, it's just--I saw you two together, and I--I didn't know that you were-- And she looks so--For god sakes, Tom, the woman has to be somewhere. Just sign the damn lease."
Lynette,Hi. What's that for?
Lynette,"Ha ha ha, come on in."
Lynette,"Oh, right. And, Kirby, tell your mom thanks. That place she found for tom is already paying off."
Lynette,Sh-she was there? Why?
Lynette,Hum.
Lynette,Okay. Drive safely.
Lynette,Um--neat or rocks?
Lynette,"Not a bed-- a futon, like a couch."
Lynette,What are you saying?
Lynette,How do you know he didn't?
Lynette,No.
Lynette,"Tom, where are you?"
Lynette,Yeah?
Lynette,Okay. Bye.
Lynette,"Oh, my god."
Lynette,You said you were rehearsing.
Lynette,Why can't you do that at home? What the hell is this? You moving out on me?
Lynette,"So you can have your affair--You know, the one that follows the sports car and the garage band and wanting to quit your job, the final stage of your midlife crisis. Oh, and then--when I hear Anne Schilling has been dropping by--"
Lynette,So you'll come home?
Lynette,"Good. Maybe when you come home, you could teach me how to play that video game."
Lynette,Okay.
Lynette,Yeah. What's wrong with you? You've been antsy all night.
Lynette,You sure?
Lynette,Okay. Hurry back.
Lynette,What's wrong with you? You've been antsy all night.
Lynette,Liar.
Lynette,"I always knew things could change between us, Tom, but no matter what, the one thing I always thought I'd get is your respect."
Lynette,I followed you to the warehouse. I know everything.
Lynette,"Yeah, at this point, I think I'm gonna need a little bit more than that."
Lynette,Huh?
Lynette,That's what you were afraid of?
Lynette,I think-- I have to sit down now.
Lynette,You know what? I have to kill you now.
Lynette,Who?
Lynette,What are you talking about?
Lynette,What are you talking about?
Lynette,You're having sex with your best friend's mother?!
Lynette,I want you to call that woman and tell her you are never seeing her again.
Lynette,"Her name is Mrs. Schilling. She was your T-ball coach when you were 6. By the way, does your best friend know you're sleeping with his mother?"
Lynette,"Okay, that's it. I'm calling her."
Lynette,"Gee, Porter. That's just one of the pitfalls of dating a married woman."
Lynette,"Well, then you have put her in a very dangerous position, haven't you?"
Lynette,I am not promising anything.
Lynette,"Oh, please! You would never do that."
Lynette,"But if you don't end this, you won't have to leave. We will throw you out."
Lynette,I don't know.
Lynette,"I know everything, okay?"
Lynette,"So do I. And if you ever lay a hand on him again, you will find out just how much."
Lynette,"Hey, breakfast's on the table. Porter, this whole hating me thing that you've got going on right now--Believe it or not, I get where you're coming from."
Lynette,"But one day, you are gonna meet someone more--appropriate. Someone who want the same things that you do out of life. Then you are gonna know what real love is. And when you do, I hope you will finally see where I am coming from."
Lynette,Good. I'll see you downstairs.
Lynette,You're having sex with your best friend's mother?
Lynette,I do. Why do I have a sense you're gonna take it away from me?
Lynette,"Oh, yeah, I'm great. That's it?"
Lynette,"Okay. Well, your minute's up."
Lynette,"No, I have to talk to someone else first. Remember when you left that soda can on the coffee table, and it left a ring, and I yelled at you I take it all back."
Lynette,Are you really pregnant?
Lynette,Don't. Don't try and justify this. This is sick. You are sick.
Lynette,"Warren, I'm sorry that��_��_��_"
Lynette,Damn it.
Lynette,Get off of her! Get off of her! I'm calling the police!
Lynette,"Okay, well, just so you know, I hit back."
Lynette,"Oh, my god! Oh, my god!"
Lynette,Oh! She's asleep. She's fine.
Lynette,I went over to talk to Anne about recent developments.
Lynette,"Yes, I did, Porter. I had to talk to Anne. I didn't know that her husband was there, and he overheard us and--the doctors say she's gonna be fine. Porter, wh-- where are you going? Damn it!"
Lynette,"Excuse me. Gaby, have you seen Porter?"
Lynette,"No. So if you see him, please tell me."
Lynette,Thanks.
Lynette,Don't you touch him! Don't you touch him! Go home now!
Lynette,Stop it! Go on! Go on! Go on!
Lynette,Hitting women and children? You must be so proud.
Lynette,What were you thinking? You could've gotten hurt in there!
Lynette,"Aah! Porter, I told you to go home. What are you doing here?"
Lynette,Thank you.
Lynette,I saw a grown man beating up on my teenage boy. What else do you want to know?
Lynette,No.
Lynette,"Well, I was right there, Detective. My son said no such thing."
Lynette,Absolutely.
Lynette,"You might wanna go ahead and give him those pain pills, Doc. He's gonna need them."
Lynette,"Tom, I was 6 feet away. Porter looked Warren Schilling in the eye and said, ""You're dead. I don't care what it takes. You're dead."""
Lynette,"Maybe he didn't. But ten minutes later, that nightclub was on fire."
Lynette,What about Rick's restaurant? Porter and his brother burned that down.
Lynette,"Yes, that time, the building was empty."
Lynette,I'm telling you I heard him threaten Warren Schilling. I don't know what happened next.
Lynette,We're going to protect our son.
Lynette,We're going to protect our son.
Lynette,I hear you're getting discharged today. Are you going back home?
Lynette,I'm sure you heard about the nightclub burning down.
Lynette,Your husband's blaming Porter.
Lynette,"I'm helping you help me. This way, you get to start a new life, and I get to not have you around while my son is going through all this."
Lynette,"Well, then you can face statutory rape charges without the money. Your call."
Lynette,I'll pick you up tonight. I'll give you a ride to the bus station. You can count it then.
Lynette,"Good luck. Anne? When the baby comes, you don't contact Porter. You can contact Tom or me, and we'll do what we can for you from a distance. Understood?"
Lynette,Who's that?
Lynette,"Oh. Listen, we need to talk."
Lynette,"I have to ask you something, and it is very important that you tell me the truth."
Lynette,"Did you set that fire at the nightclub? Before you answer, let me say that if you did, I promise, your father and I will stand behind you and try and find some way out of this nightmare. But if you lie to me, and I find out later that you--killed--those people--Well, I will love you. That will never change, but I won't believe in you anymore, and if I--don't believe in you--I can't help you. We have to tell each other the truth from here on out."
Lynette,"Of course it wasn't. Of course. Then we're gonna be okay, as long as you keep telling the truth. Everything's gonna be fine."
Lynette,What?
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,"No. Sweetie, I don't."
Lynette,The first person who steps foot out that door will lose a leg.
Lynette,"Oh, you are such a gentleman. Sit your ass down."
Lynette,"Look, this family has been through a lot lately, and your dad and I feel we'll be better parents if we know what's going on in your lives. So, Parker, how's that science project you've been working on?"
Lynette,Wait. What's going on?
Lynette,A witness? I--
Lynette,A witness? What are they talking about?
Lynette,"Yes, sweetie, we are."
Lynette,Like why do the police have a witness?
Lynette,The D.A. says you were spotted coming out of the storage room right before the fire started. What gives?
Lynette,"You are up for manslaughter, and you're worried about being embarrassed?"
Lynette,"Okay, we're gonna talk about that later. You were saying?"
Lynette,Why would you do that?
Lynette,Did anyone see you do this?
Lynette,Then this is really not an alibi. It's more a confession to another crime.
Lynette,"Tom, if you're gonna freak out, can you do that in the other room? I'm kind of busy here."
Lynette,"If Edie reports this gun missing, you don't have to be the sharpest cop on the force to figure out where to start looking, and that's the last thing we need right now."
Lynette,"Well, I try."
Lynette,"Tom, your rock is trying to get fingerprints off a weapon. You mind? Thanks."
Lynette,What's going on? Is there news?
Lynette,"Oh, thank god. How much?"
Lynette,That's high. Where are we gonna get that kind of money?
Lynette,"Oh, sure."
Lynette,Wait. Slow down.
Lynette,"You're my lawyer, so anything I tell you is in confidence, right?"
Lynette,"I gave that money to Anne Schilling so she'd leave town, and Tom has no idea."
Lynette,Hey. Whose lawyer are you anyway?
Lynette,What am I supposed to do? Where am I gonna get that bail money?
Lynette,No. The house is mortgaged to the teeth.
Lynette,"I guess I have no other choice. But again, this is all in the strictest confidence. Remember, you are my lawyer, not Tom's."
Lynette,Shut up!
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,"Well, actually, I wanted to borrow Edie's yellow sweater for the, uh, arraignment."
Lynette,"Well, is it okay if I go up and get it?"
Lynette,Thanks.
Lynette,What took you so long?
Lynette,That's because he's Preston.
Lynette,"Hey, Preston."
Lynette,What the hell is going on? Where's Porter?
Lynette,"Do you have any idea how bad this is? We had to post bail. If the judge finds out porter skipped town, we're gonna lose--a lot."
Lynette,Tom��_��_��_
Lynette,It's not just money.
Lynette,"Okay, look--you know how you're always saying I know what to do in a crisis?"
Lynette,Here's what we're gonna do. You��_��_��_no questions. You--you're Porter now. Let's go in. Come on. Come on.
Lynette,"Bob, you've been going at this for over an hour. Why don't we take a break?"
Lynette,"Honey, that's Porter."
Lynette,"Bob, we're so sorry. We meant to tell you. We really did."
Lynette,That's why we've been trying to get you to postpone the hearing date until we could find him.
Lynette,What do you mean?
Lynette,No!
Lynette,"But if the judge finds out that porter's gone, we have to forfeit the bail."
Lynette,Thank you so much. We are so sorry that we-
Lynette,"Tom, I talked to every kid in his English class, the entire debate team. Porter hasn't contacted any of them. Well, hurry home. We gotta decide what our next move is. All right. I love you. Bye."
Lynette,"Preston, why didn't you pick up when I called you?"
Lynette,"I called you, like, five times."
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,"Porter, it's mom. Where are you?! Porter!"
Lynette,You know where he is!
Lynette,"But you have been talking to him. What the hell, Preston?!"
Lynette,Fine. You know what you're going to do with it? You are going to call your brother and tell him to come home.
Lynette,"What? What?! That's why he ran away? I thought he was afraid of going to jail. Well, I'm sure Warren Schilling was just trying to scare him."
Lynette,"Okay, we'll get a - we'll get a restraining order."
Lynette,"I can handle warren schilling. But if Porter doesn't show up for court, we're gonna lose our restaurant!"
Lynette,"Before I became a mother, I didn't know it was possible to love another human being so completely, and with that love comes this need to protect you. It wasn't a decision I made. It's--primal. It's just something in my DNA Whatever it is, it makes me not care about myself, and it reminds me that my reason for being on this planet is to look after you kids."
Lynette,"Yesterday, you said Warren schilling will kill Porter if he gets the chance. I will never let that happen."
Lynette,"You see that bar? Warren Schilling goes there every night. All right, come on! Tonight, when he leaves--I'm gonna do what I have to, to make sure my family is safe. So--I need you to get out now. You can't be in the car when this happens."
Lynette,"Like I said, it's in my DNA That could be him. Get out. Get out! Get out!"
Lynette,And you will convince him to come back home. Shut the door.
Lynette,"Sweetie, where are you?"
Lynette,Porter--You have got to come home. Everything will be fine. I promise.
Lynette,"We can get a restraining order to protect you, and Bob thinks there's a good shot at getting the case dismissed."
Lynette,"There is not a shred of evidence against you. When people see that, they will be on your side just like we are. Sweetie, you have to trust me."
Lynette,"Sweetie, where are you?"
Lynette,"And if Porter doesn't show up for court, we're gonna lose our restaurant!"
Lynette,What?
Lynette,"I am so happy for you, but we're gonna miss you."
Lynette,"Oh, hello, Mr. Fishman."
Lynette,"Uh, is everything okay?"
Lynette,Porter?
Lynette,What are you talking about?
Lynette,What?
Lynette,Ah.
Lynette,"Tom, I know where Porter is. He's hiding at my mother's."
Lynette,I'll take care of it. Thank you.
Lynette,Call Bob. Tell him we can make the hearing tomorrow.
Lynette,"Look, Tom, I can't talk now. Just call Bob. I'm going over there now. Okay. Bye."
Lynette,"Parker, I'm gonna be back in an hour. Mr. Fisherman, thank you so much."
Lynette,Where is he?
Lynette,Do you know what's going on with Porter? The fire? The arrest?
Lynette,"No, no. We have this great lawyer. He thinks he can get the case thrown out."
Lynette,Okay. I know you're mad. I know we have a lot to hash out between us. But don't take your hate for me out on your grandson. Now where is he?
Lynette,Mom--this is wrong. Please.
Lynette,"Porter wasn't there, and she won't tell me where he is."
Lynette,Of course I did.
Lynette,She's so angry at me. She's never gonna tell us where he is.
Lynette,No. No. It means she outsmarted her mom.
Lynette,"No, sweetie. I was driving home last night, talking with your dad on the phone, and two cars in front of me had an accident. And I thought, damn, that could be me. And then I thought, that could be me."
Lynette,"Porter, listen to me. Bob talked to the judge. He thinks he can get them to drop the charges."
Lynette,You're gonna have to.
Lynette,"Yeah, well, what can I tell ya? I learned from the best."
Lynette,"Hey, mom. I just came by to tell you that the judge threw out porter's case for lack of evidence. Isn't that great? Mom--I did not put you in here to punish you. I didn't have a choice."
Lynette,"No, I didn't. From the moment Glen died, you were out of control. It's true you lost all that money in Vegas. You started drinking again. And how many times did I go to your condo, only to find you asleep on the sofa with a cigarette in your mouth? No, I won't apologize for bringing you here. I did it because I love you."
Lynette,It's not a very pleasant experience.
Lynette,"Last time I came, you threw pudding at me."
Lynette,Here's a thought--stop being angry.
Lynette,"The ball game is going to end whether you like it or not. I would like to be here with you for whatever time you have left. But for that to happen, things have to change."
Lynette,"At least twice a week, and sometimes I'd bring the kids."
Lynette,I have no idea.
Lynette,"Speaking of cashing in your chips, anyone know when Eli's funeral is?"
Lynette,Poor Eli. We should make sure he's got flowers at his funeral.
Lynette,Oh. That's what it means.
Lynette,"Well, you've certainly had quite a glamorous life."
Lynette,"Well, we watch the kids play soccer."
Lynette,That's so nice. We were just--
Lynette,"No, you don't have to do that."
Lynette,"All right, time for my luck to change. This hand is for Eli. Hmm, next hand is for Eli."
Lynette,How about we pick something from your cookbook?
Lynette,"Yes, 'cause that's what women in their eighth month really crave--more stove time."
Lynette,"It's not happening, Tom."
Lynette,I'll sew anything you want if you just stop getting me pregnant.
Lynette,"I wish I could say the same for my uterus. Oh, yeah. I ruined the brunch."
Lynette,That's Penny. I'll be right back.
Lynette,"Hey, sweetie. What's up?"
Lynette,Oh. I wish you'd caught me two chardonnays ago.
Lynette,"I know, but mommy's still planning Eli's memorial. Start without me. I'll be there in a little while."
Lynette,The doctor just called. I'm pregnant.
Lynette,Yeah. Whoop-dee-doo.
Lynette,I was planning to go back to work.
Lynette,"I had it in the back of my mind for a while, and then yesterday, I got a ph--"
Lynette,"Jeffrey Cuevas is retiring in September. I am the perfect person to step into his job, and that is exactly when Parker starts kindergarten. The timing is like a dream."
Lynette,"Oh, please. You know it's gonna be a boy. It's always a boy. It's just gonna pee in my face and hide dead things in my shoes. I am doing this, Tom. I am going after this job."
Lynette,"Well, I was hoping you could cut back on your hours at work."
Lynette,You did not just say that.
Lynette,"Tom, I cannot just stay at home wiping noses. I need it for my sanity, and I need you to back me up."
Lynette,My hero.
Lynette,"Jeff Cuevas is fantastic, but I know I could take his department to a whole new level."
Lynette,"Oh, my water broke. Take the overnight bag out to the car. Oh, three weeks. That's a little soon, but, uh, sure, I could make that work."
Lynette,In a minute. I'm trying to lock this job down. What kind of perks are we talking about here?
Lynette,"I swear, if you touch this phone, I will have this baby right here and then beat you with it!"
Lynette,Could you hold on one second?
Lynette,We agreed I could go back to work after I gave birth.
Lynette,"I'm sorry. Is there any way we could finish this conversation tomorrow? L-l-later in the day works better for me, too. Well, thank you very much. Bye."
Lynette,I got the job.
Lynette,"Tom, I am in pain. Do you mind? You'll see, Tom. I know. People say that you--you can't have it all, but I know we can."
Lynette,"Oh, Mr. Swenson, I can't tell you how excited I am. Maybe you could schedule a staff meeting so I could hit the ground running on Monday. No, no. No, it can't be Friday, because, remember, we agreed that we would start next week? So again, thank you so much for this opportunity."
Lynette,Yeah?
Lynette,Could you hold on a second?
Lynette,"Oh, my god. Oh, my god. I was on the phone. I was talking to my new boss, and I--"
Lynette,But it's 85 degrees outside. I've never done this before.
Lynette,"Yeah, I do."
Lynette,"No. I'm gonna go help my daughter with her homework. Hey, Penny! Wait up!"
Lynette,Who knew he had so many friends?
Lynette,I can't help feeling there's more we could have done to honor him.
Lynette,A witness? What are they talking about?
Lynette,"Hey you go, Walter. She's all yours."
Lynette,"He's inside, but between sobs, he wished you happy driving."
Lynette,"Oh, that man is Walter Brotski, and he just bought it."
Lynette,"Sadly, we can no longer afford Tom's midlife crisis. Okay, here's the deal. We're-- Sort of broke."
Lynette,Between Porter's legal fees and that ghost town that we call a restaurant--
Lynette,"When times get tough, people do without things like pizza and sports cars."
Lynette,It's okay. Just keep it under your hat. It's a little embarrassing.
Lynette,"Actually, I have to go to work. But congratulations, Bree. It's a beauty."
Lynette,What's this?
Lynette,"No. Thank you, but I can't accept this. However, I would like to know how much I'm not accepting. $20,000? How many cookbooks are you selling, woman?"
Lynette,That must be nice. But--I can't accept it.
Lynette,"Because the people that you love may not be able to pay you back, and then you stop loving them."
Lynette,And so do you. And I'm gonna feel real crappy when you unwrap your lavender bath beads.
Lynette,It would. But I can't. I wouldn't want it to affect our friendship.
Lynette,Although--how would you like to own a piece of an Italian restaurant?
Lynette,"It wouldn't be a loan or a gift. It would be--an investment that would buy you, say--15% of Scavo's."
Lynette,"If we do well, you get a cut of the profits. If we go belly-up, we liquidate, and you get the first $20,000. And then, of course, my family moves in with you. So--do we have a deal?"
Lynette,Hi.
Lynette,This will just take a sec.
Lynette,Tom and I are so grateful for your investment that we want to do something special for you.
Lynette,"We'd like to shut Scavo's down for the night and throw a party in your honor. Just family and friends. We'd toast your success and have a night of fun, just like old times. What do you say?"
Lynette,"Yeah, yeah."
Lynette,"Well, we've filled the place many times, but it's your party. Whatever you want."
Lynette,I don't know what to say.
Lynette,Right. Glad I thought of it.
Lynette,Yep. Just adding the parmesan.
Lynette,So?
Lynette,"Oh, no. It's fine. We use it all the time."
Lynette,"Bree, no one will notice. Parmesan is the fourth cheese in a four cheese pizza. It's the ringo of these cheeses."
Lynette,"Oh, for Pete sake. I'll be right back."
Lynette,Son of a--
Lynette,"Hey, can I borrow you a sec?"
Lynette,You'll still be a celebrity in five minutes. Come on.
Lynette,You want to explain this?
Lynette,We use that parmesan all the time. You can't go changing things without asking me.
Lynette,"Well, they probably would have loved my pizza, too, but we'll never know, because my partner threw it in the garbage. What a waste."
Lynette,"Oh, sure. It's only money, right?"
Lynette,"We all know how well you're doing, Bree. You have made that very clear. But you shouldn't be lording it over everybody just 'cause you've caught a couple of breaks."
Lynette,"I've worked my ass off, too. I just wasn't as lucky as you."
Lynette,Meaning that I've created my own failure?
Lynette,"Whoa. Talk about luck. When I offered to throw you this little thank-you party, I never imagined that it would turn into an opportunity for me to learn from the great Bree Hodge."
Lynette,"No, you're the one who's never gonna let me forget it."
Lynette,Home. Tell me how the party I threw for you turns out.
Lynette,"I know you don't, but five years ago, you would've."
Lynette,"You know that was an accident, right?"
Lynette,A check for the damage to your car. I can't afford to go through my insurance company.
Lynette,"Yes, I do. And the minute we're back on our feet, I am gonna pay back your investment--Every penny, with interest."
Lynette,Yeah--I think it's a little late for that.
Lynette,We're sort of broke.
Lynette,"When times get tough, people do without things like pizza."
Lynette,"Tom? Come here. We haven't had a customer in about a half an hour, so maybe we should just--close up early."
Lynette,What is this?
Lynette,"So now we have pretend customers? Gee, let's think of something to do with all the pretend money we're gonna make."
Lynette,"Okay--as much as I love Tommy Scavo's improve theater, we need to face some facts here."
Lynette,"It's not a slump. In this economy, people aren't eating out as much. Between that and Porter's legal bills and paying Bree back, we are about a week away from going bankrupt."
Lynette,"I did, for seven years. Now I'm gonna be a realist, and I need you to be one, too."
Lynette,"If we sell this place now, we can escape with some dignity and maybe even some money. But if we keep on going like we are, we're gonna lose everything."
Lynette,"If you're looking to get fed, it's gonna be a while."
Lynette,"Oh, boy. I think I know what this is about. Listen, kids, things have been tough down at the restaurant, and I think your dad has finally decided to sell it."
Lynette,I know.
Lynette,I don't know that's why we all have to be really supportive. Are you with me?
Lynette,Not yet.
Lynette,Just know we're 100% behind you.
Lynette,"Tom, what the hell are you talking about?"
Lynette,"I thought maybe after our conversation today, you'd realize it's time to pack it in."
Lynette,But having the kids work there?
Lynette,Really? That doesn't sound like me.
Lynette,Okay. Fine.
Lynette,"Kids, we are going to support your father by working in his restaurant."
Lynette,"You're putting us in the cheapest nursing home you can find. Yeah, I got it."
Lynette,"All right, that's a large mushroom pepperoni pizza and two salads. I'll get that started. Tom, I got need a large---"
Lynette,Thanks. And do you have the calzones for table three?
Lynette,"Sweetie, I need two dinner salads. What's the matter?"
Lynette,"Well, clearly, that's not true because you're not a baby. You're 15, remember?"
Lynette,"Okay, you fill water glasses. I'll make the salads."
Lynette,Yeah?
Lynette,"Oh, thanks. You didn't give them enough change."
Lynette,"Okay, you make the salads. I'll handle the register."
Lynette,What's going on?
Lynette,"So? Take another one. What's the difference? Well, since I'm the only one here who c wait on that table without knocking over a glass with my pants, how about I take it? You handle the cash register. You bus tables. Go on."
Lynette,"Finally. Oh, great. They're kids. 1 ate of spaghetti and 15 baskets of free bread."
Lynette,What's going on here?
Lynette,"Guys, easy."
Lynette,"Tom, it's fine. I'll take the table."
Lynette,Tom!
Lynette,"All right, that's enough! Let go of him! Let go of him! Let go of him!"
Lynette,I think this can all wait until morning. Don't you?
Lynette,"What? It's a $12,000 oven."
Lynette,"Not a dent. A fist print. My husband's been a little frustrated lately. On the plus side, it matches the shoe print on the dishwasher."
Lynette,Fine. Congratulations. You just stole a pizza oven.
Lynette,"Hey. I got $6,200 for the oven."
Lynette,"Yeah, well, putting an ""everything must go"" sign kind of eroded our bargaining position."
Lynette,"Well, by the end of the day, we should be able to pay off our creditors, give Bree back the $20,000 that we owe her and have enough to live on for--45 minutes."
Lynette,"Look, I know this is a crappy day for you, but we need to start thinking about what our plans are going to be."
Lynette,And that is so great. So when do you think that great thing might happen?
Lynette,Sorry.
Lynette,You--ah. Hey. I think you better stop with the bargain hunting unless you want your face to match the oven and the dishwasher.
Lynette,"The hard part was when my friend tried help me with a loan, and I thanked her by becoming a lunatic and denting her car."
Lynette,I think we have the kind of friendship where you don't have to say anything. Let's just hug and move on. Okay?
Lynette,He's doing great.
Lynette,Yeah. He's up early today. He just doesn't know what he's doing next.
Lynette,Seriously?
Lynette,"Oh, my god. That would be great. And if he gets the job, you can actually cash the check."
Lynette,Thank you. This will really cheer Tom up.
Lynette,Could you call him now?
Lynette,"Because I vividly remember yesterday, and I wasn't born during it."
Lynette,Does she know you painted it?
Lynette,"Bye-bye, high road."
Lynette,"That's how I got rid of tom's last bottle of ""musk, the cologne for men."""
Lynette,What are you doing?
Lynette,Susan!
Lynette,"Mwah. Ohh. You couldn't shave? Come on, Tom. You need to look nice. Bree's going to a lot of trouble for this dinner."
Lynette,"Okay. I was going to wait to tell you this when you were in a good mood, but I realize that's not gonna happen, so Bree has a special guest tonight, her publisher--and as luck would have it, he's looking to hire a new marketing executive."
Lynette,You're grieving. I get it. But this sounds like a fantastic job. Please just hear the guy out and make a nice--impression.
Lynette,And brush your teeth. My eyes are watering. And don't just wet the toothbrush. I can tell.
Lynette,Hi.
Lynette,He's being modest. He was the best.
Lynette,"Well, Tom was just running a very successful restaurant, and he just sold it at a handsome profit. So he's waiting for the right opportunity. You might have to do a little selling here, Bruce."
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,That sounds--amazing.
Lynette,"You can have mine. Stop saying, ""I don't know."""
Lynette,"Yes, like the greatest city in the world."
Lynette,"Oh. Actually, I have 12 years of experience."
Lynette,"Yeah. I was account executive for eight years, VP for four more after that, and by the way, I wrote my graduate thesis on the rise of the nonfiction novel."
Lynette,I know. So what kind of starting salary are we talking about?
Lynette,"Okay. Bruce, could you hold that thought? I'm gonna be right back."
Lynette,I'm getting this job. That's what I'm doing.
Lynette,"Well, you're not acting like you want it very much, mister--""Uh, I don't know. Are there any more potatoes?"""
Lynette,"Okay, you lick. I'm going to Paris."
Lynette,Your job? The one you're magically gonna get by sulking and acting like a brat? You had a shot. You blew it.
Lynette,Yeah.
Lynette,I-- Ugh!
Lynette,"You know, Tom, you're right. Bruce does care about this job. That's why he wants to make sure he gets the perfect person for it."
Lynette,"Oh, you were. You were the best person who ever worked for me. I used to be his boss."
Lynette,"So I said to him,""Je crois que c'est l'homme qui fait les chez d'oeuvres."" And he said to me,""Non, Lynette. Ce sont les chez d'oeuvres qui font l'homme."""
Lynette,"Yes. Tom was very good at his job, right up until he got fired."
Lynette,"Well, we've all had our troubles as bosses, haven't we, Tom? I was sort of sugarcoating it when I said his restaurant was very successful. The truth is, he mismanaged that pizza joint right into the ground."
Lynette,So dinner--Wow.
Lynette,"I do, and it's okay. Besides, did you hear what came out of my mouth? Like I said--Wow."
Lynette,Idea--Check local mental hospital for escaped married couple.
Lynette,"I was talking about that job tonight and trying to convince Bruce I was good, and I remembered something. I am good. And I would like another chance to prove it."
Lynette,Really?
Lynette,Oh! Mwah.
Lynette,"Hey, Tom. No, still waiting. Big surprise. They're running behind at an ad agency. So did any of those other places call back? Seriously? Six interviews and nothin'? Well, I should probably try and keep my game face on here. I'll--I'll call you later. I love you. Bye."
Lynette,"Coming. Do me a favor. If you hear a gunshot, tell my four kids I love them."
Lynette,"So was it a good, old-fashioned American kiss or are we talking the infinitely superior French variety?"
Lynette,"Well, that doesn't make any difference. Right, Lee?"
Lynette,"She's your boss? Let her kiss you again, then sue her."
Lynette,Congratulations. You're now dating a lesbian.
Lynette,"Hey, Gaby? I'll see ya. I wanted to ask you something. Feel free to say no."
Lynette,"Yeah, this isn't about that. Um, I wanted to say I heard about Carlos' g promotion. Congratulations."
Lynette,Absolutely. Now you know I'm looking for work?
Lynette,"Not great. See, while I was working at Scavo's, I got seven years older, which is weird, seeing as how all the C.E.O.S got seven years younger. The bottom line is, no one wants to hire someone who could have made out with their dad on prom night. Anyway, I hear Carlos is looking for a new director of marketing. Think you could put in a good word for me?"
Lynette,Y-you don't know?
Lynette,"Yes, I helped advertise what companies decided to market. It's the same thing. Come on. You know I'd be great."
Lynette,You guess? Gaby--
Lynette,Enough with the shrugging. Come on.
Lynette,You think I'm a big risk?
Lynette,"Okay, that's it. Four shrug. I'm out. Thanks for your help."
Lynette,Yep. Thank you.
Lynette,"Mr. Vivinetto, I'm not obligated to answer. It's the law."
Lynette,"Well, if I was dumb enough to answer that, I never would've gotten into Northwestern."
Lynette,"Okay, I'm gonna stop you. What is this obsession with age? I am a vital woman with passion and a library of knowledge when it comes to this industry. Why doesn't that count for something?"
Lynette,I'm 54.
Lynette,"He didn't even flinch. I said I was 54, and he bought it. There was not a ""Wow, you look great for your age!"" Not even a courtesy gasp."
Lynette,"It matters because I'm only 43, and I look like I'm 39."
Lynette,"Nobody cares how old you are, Tom."
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,Yeah! How'd you hear about it?
Lynette,Oh. That job. I don't know what to say.
Lynette,"Well, thank you, greatest friend, but I just accepted another job."
Lynette,Why?
Lynette,"I'm confused. Before, you didn't even want to talk to him. You weren't even sure I was good."
Lynette,"I--don't know. Well, he'd have to match my current offer."
Lynette,"$100,000 a year."
Lynette,"The problem--how to attract high net worth clients in a down economy. The solution? Be creative. Christie's is hosting its first ever ""sea auction"" on a yacht in ST. Barths. I see a boat full of millionaires waiting to be wooed."
Lynette,"Okay. Okay. Not to pry, but when you said Carlos took you to ST. Barths--"
Lynette,Gaby didn't mention that.
Lynette,"Yeah. Yeah, that Gaby's a real class act."
Lynette,Hey. What are you doing here?
Lynette,"Oh, that is so thoughtful of you. You're such a good friend."
Lynette,"Yea, I do."
Lynette,Actually--I am kinda tired. I think I'm going to head inside.
Lynette,What? No. I'm sure she's just affectionate.
Lynette,"Well, it's probably nothing. But when Carlos works on his computer at home, does he take his shirt off there, too?"
Lynette,"No, you won't get the chance 'cause I'm gonna kill you first. The houselights are up, Gaby. You can drop the act. You only helped me get this job because you needed a spy."
Lynette,Gaby!
Lynette,"Because you used me! At least when I asked you for a favor, I was up-front."
Lynette,"Oh, you found out about that?"
Lynette,"Okay, it's true. I used you to get more money, but you used me first."
Lynette,Do I spill my salary?
Lynette,Big deal. So is this coffee mug.
Lynette,"Um, I have a tiny scheduling conflict. I coach my daughter's basketball team on Friday nights. So if I could--"
Lynette,"Isn't she fun? Hey, Carlos. Did I ever tell you that Tom a I seriously considered you and Gaby for Penny's godparents?"
Lynette,Then do something about it. You're the president. Put the brakes on Lucy.
Lynette,"But she makes people crazy. Can't you talk to her, get her to dial it down a bit?"
Lynette,"Oh, yeah. I plan to get drunk and bitch about my boss."
Lynette,You busy?
Lynette,I brought you a little gift.
Lynette,I thought it would be a nice addition to your collection.
Lynette,Pardon?
Lynette,I'm--not sure what you're talking about.
Lynette,"Okay, yes, Carlos and I spoke briefly, but I thought he blew me off."
Lynette,"Well, I'll admit it's kind of flimsy, but until I got something better--"
Lynette,"Hey, I got you sodas, didn't I? And I let you feed the paper shredder."
Lynette,No. I got a hole puncher. Sorry. That's the best I could do. Come on.
Lynette,"Oh, sweetie, those aren't to play with, not unless you wanna see someone go completely bonkers. Actually, they do look like a lot of fun. If only I had the power to stop you--"
Lynette,I don't know. I'm just as worried as you are.
Lynette,Don't forget your little animals!
Lynette,"I mean, it really is the kind of thing a relative should do. Maybe it is, but we're in the car, on our way there, so stop your bitching."
Lynette,And say what?
Lynette,Mm. Why don't you start with the time she tried to steal your comatose boyfriend? That was fun.
Lynette,"Well, if she knew what you're about to do for her, she'd forgive you for everything."
Lynette,Mm. I'll take her. Kinda looks like cat litter.
Lynette,"Or what, I'll turn to stone? She's all rough and gritty."
Lynette,"Oh, please. We're talking about Edie. A little more irreverence is what we need."
Lynette,Hey.
Lynette,"Eh, same."
Lynette,Thanks. I'll watch it during chemo if I'm not too tired.
Lynette,Thanks. I can't get comfortable. Could you fluff my pillows?
Lynette,"Before you go, would you put my socks back on? My feet are cold again."
Lynette,It's fine.
Lynette,Why? Chemo's not until 5.
Lynette,Been here before?
Lynette,Love it? I have cancer. I probably shouldn't even use the ladies' room
Lynette,"Um, I--Edie, I have chemo in half an hour."
Lynette,I'm not supposed to drink.
Lynette,"No, thanks."
Lynette,"No, I can't. Uh, see? Cancer."
Lynette,Can you excuse us for one second? I need to go to chemo. I have cancer.
Lynette,And what do you want from me?
Lynette,I'm doing the best I can.
Lynette,Now--where's that one-armed friend of yours? I'm--wanna shoot some stick.
Lynette,She never let me forget it either. She always insisted it was the tequila shooters that killed the cancer.
Lynette,Less yakkin' more draggin'.
Lynette,How do you think?
Lynette,Isn't that what she did for the last 15 years?
Lynette,She called me a baby factory?
Lynette,"Hey, Travers. Remember us?"
Lynette,"Come here. I'm afraid we have some bad news. Your mom was in a very serious accident, And I am so sorry--but she passed away."
Lynette,Unless that's a little weird for you.
Lynette,"Okay, we're here. Guys--wake up. Guys? We're home. Get out."
Lynette,You bet.
Lynette,Urn is empty. Let's do it.
Lynette,Mm. Here's a thought--we all say one word that sums up what we thought of her.
Lynette,Then we dump her.
Lynette,Strong.
Lynette,All right.
Lynette,"Go ahead, Susan. What are your four words for Edie?"
Lynette,Maybe they did. Anybody seen any dead squirrels around here?
Lynette,I say we keep showing up here until he lets us help him.
Lynette,"So who can come by later and check on him? I'd do it, but I'm working late."
Lynette,You're in a garden club?
Lynette,"Wait. There wouldn't happen to be actual gardeners in this club, would they?"
Lynette,That'd be great.
Lynette,"Yeah, 'cause he hasn't suffered enough."
Lynette,"Sweetie, I'm home. Hey."
Lynette,"Don't make plans on Tuesday. We're having dinner at the Solis' and--what's that look on your face? You didn't eat dairy again, did you?"
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,Hmm. That's okay. I can see it from here. Thrilling. Mwah.
Lynette,"Mm. I just took a shower, And I know where you're going with this--"
Lynette,But I am exhausted.
Lynette,"Ooh. Whining-- that's hot. Fine. Let's have sex. But I warn you, I'm just gonna lie here, resenting you the whole time, waiting for this hell to be over."
Lynette,Tom!
Lynette,Come on!
Lynette,At work.
Lynette,I don't. Carlos does.
Lynette,"No, I went into Carlos' bathroom, closed the door, then stripped naked and took a shower."
Lynette,Then maybe I'd get that raise I've been asking for.
Lynette,Hours? It was two minutes. It's not like I'm lighting candles and putting on Barry White.
Lynette,Fine. I should've just had sex. I'd be asleep by now.
Lynette,"Carlos, you're early!"
Lynette,"Oh, crap. I'll be right there! Aah!"
Lynette,"No, I'm fine. I-I want to go."
Lynette,Mm-hmm.
Lynette,"Hey, Carlos, quick question for ya. Last thing I remember, I was in the shower, naked, reaching for the soap. Then I was here on the bed, under a blanket--still naked. And my question is, how did I get from there to here?"
Lynette,Uh-huh. Which means you saw me--
Lynette,"Oh, well, I appreciate that. And here's something else I'd appreciate--Could we not tell anyone else about this?"
Lynette,"If Tom finds out, he'll freak. He has this weird thing about being the only guy who gets to see me naked."
Lynette,Could you maybe step outside? I only do one show a day.
Lynette,This dinner is delicious. You really didn't have to do this.
Lynette,"Hear, hear. To friendship. So I want to hear more about the garden club. Tom says he's meeting all kinds of nice people."
Lynette,Mm.
Lynette,"Hey, is this gorgonzola?"
Lynette,You told her? I asked you not to.
Lynette,"I was just afraid you'd overreact, like you're doing--right now."
Lynette,What little friendship?
Lynette,Tom?
Lynette,Cause it's Patty Rizzo. She's a total slut. You should be on antibiotics just for sitting in her car.
Lynette,"Drop it, Tom. We'll continue this at home."
Lynette,"It's my fault. I should have just told Tom the truth, although it turned out to be kind of a wash with the whole Patty Rizzo thing."
Lynette,"Yeah. But just to be on the safe side, if I fall in my tub again, let me die there."
Lynette,Yes. And we shall never speak of this again. I am embarrassed enough.
Lynette,I got it. I'll be right up.
Lynette,Tom and I are reading this book that suggests couples make a pact to have sex every night for a month.
Lynette,"We've been having some problems, so the theory is it creates intimacy and brings you closer."
Lynette,I've gotta say it is. You become more attuned to each other's needs and more sensitive to--
Lynette,Jeez! Two seconds!
Lynette,"No, we're in our third week. We got this down to a science. Just deal me out a few hands."
Lynette,"Hey, honey. How's your day going?"
Lynette,"Did you remember to get my, um--my special deodorant?"
Lynette,"I'm totally slammed, which is why I'm calling. It looks like I'm gonna be here late tonight, and by ""late,"" I mean past midnight."
Lynette,We'll--double up tomorrow.
Lynette,"I know, and I'm really sorry. Listen, I gotta go. I will call you later. I love you. Bye."
Lynette,Tom. What are you doing here? Is everything all right?
Lynette,"Well, then what are you doing--here? Oh, no. Are you crazy?"
Lynette,"But I have so much to do, and I'm not gonna be done till 2:00 a.m. Possibly 3:00. Whoo!"
Lynette,"No, this is a really bad time for me. Well, you did buy me that deodorant. Ooh!"
Lynette,"Uh, tell him I'll call right back."
Lynette,Hello?
Lynette,Now? I'm kind of busy!
Lynette,Yes?
Lynette,"Sorry. Just had the handyman in here, but he's finished. Thank you, handyman."
Lynette,So--Carlos--where were we?
Lynette,What are you doing?
Lynette,Oh. Didn't we already do it tonight?
Lynette,"Oh, they're all starting to blur. Look, I worked till 3:00 a.m. last night. I'm exhausted. How about we take a rain check?"
Lynette,Mm.
Lynette,"Tom, I have a 7:00 a.m. meeting. How about I take a long lunch, and you do me twice at work tomorrow?"
Lynette,Okay. Okay. We'll have sex. But can you make it quick?
Lynette,"Morning. Oh, sorry. I don't have time for breakfast."
Lynette,"Oh, okay. Uh, coffee will be fine."
Lynette,Is there a problem?
Lynette,After?
Lynette,Oh. Was it good?
Lynette,I'm sorry. I was exhausted.
Lynette,"Oh, okay. I'm gonna let that one go, 'cause you're upset."
Lynette,"Tom, you're being completely irrational. We've had sex 23 days straight. I've seen more ceiling than Michelangelo."
Lynette,"Oh, would you stop with the book? You bought it at a car wash along with a pack of gum and an air freshener."
Lynette,Don't just walk away.
Lynette,"See this? My third espresso. I'm wired. No way I'm falling asleep tonight. Hey. How about we throw a pizza on the front lawn, and when the kids run out to get it, we lock the door and do it in every room in the house? Tom, I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say. If you wanna stay mad, I guess you're gonna stay mad."
Lynette,Then what's wrong?
Lynette,Tell me.
Lynette,That is so sweet.
Lynette,"I thought you wanted to do this, to take a break and stay home."
Lynette,So--what do you want to do? Hmm? What are you passionate about?
Lynette,No. No.
Lynette,What are you doing?
Lynette,"Well, think inside. I made porkchops."
Lynette,"Oh, right. How'd that go?"
Lynette,And what'd you say?
Lynette,It's a social networking tool where you send instant updates to anybody who signs up for them.
Lynette,I didn't keep it from you. It's just one of those tech things that you don't care about. It's for young people.
Lynette,I didn't say that. You're not gonna get a whole lot of sympathy from me. I just went through the same thing. Remember?
Lynette,"I think you mean ""ttering."" Sorry. Please, don't hit me."
Lynette,"Oh, for god sakes, knock it off! I am not gonna let you feel sorry for yourself. You are Tom Scavo, damn it!"
Lynette,Sorry. I got nothing else. Come inside and eat your pork.
Lynette,Really?
Lynette,Back up a second. You guys were classmates?
Lynette,Meaning you were in the same class at the same time?
Lynette,"You're older? I'm sorry, I just cannot believe--that they're out of stuffed mushrooms. Excuse me."
Lynette,"Okay, I went a little overboard. You know me-- two margaritas, and I need a muzzle."
Lynette,"I know, right? He must take care of himself."
Lynette,"No, you're not having plastic surgery."
Lynette,"Uh, we live in a community property state, so half that face is mine."
Lynette,"Tom, men don't need plastic surgery. They look better as they age."
Lynette,"Okay, that's a lousy impression of me."
Lynette,"You don't need a face-lift. What if I went out and got a boob job and came home with big, giant sideshow boobs? How would you like that?"
Lynette,You're not doing this. We can't afford it!
Lynette,I'm not getting a boob job.
Lynette,"Oh, my husband wants to spend money we don't have on a face-lift he doesn't need, so--not great."
Lynette,And? How's he look?
Lynette,Really? Poor Bruce.
Lynette,What's his extension?
Lynette,"Honey, I'm glad you're home. I brought someone home from work I want you to meet."
Lynette,Yeah. It turns out he got the same procedure that you're thinking about getting. So I thought maybe you could chat him up about it.
Lynette,"Well, like you said, it's your face. Come on, I'm dying for you to meet Bruce."
Lynette,"Bruce, I want you to meet my husband Tom. Tom, this is Bruce."
Lynette,"Isn't it exciting, Tom? In a few weeks, you are gonna look just like Bruce."
Lynette,I wanted you to see the face they don't put in the brochure.
Lynette,That's my point. You don't know how these things will turn out.
Lynette,Why are you being so stubborn?
Lynette,Because I don't want to have plastic surgery.
Lynette,"Tom, if you're unsatisfied with your looks, someday you're gonna be unsatisfied with mine."
Lynette,"Yes. You are going to look at me someday with your brand-new face and say, ""When did she get so old?"" We won't look like we belong together anymore."
Lynette,"But I don't see your wrinkles, Ttom. I see our whole life together. This--is you worrying about how you're going to provide for us. This is Penny falling out of the tree house and breaking her arm. This is my cancer. These are the millions of laughs that got us through all those tough times. It's like a map of our marriage, and I don't want to lose it."
Lynette,"You're gonna get a job, and it'll be because they're impressed by your experience, not your wrinkle-free face."
Lynette,"This isn't about me, Tom. Come on."
Lynette,You know what would be more educational? You going to college like we talked about.
Lynette,"Well, it seems like, based on your last visa records you've already been on vacation."
Lynette,"Oh? Well, good luck paying for it, because if you so much as apply for a passport, we're cuttin' you off."
Lynette,"Tom, why didn't you help me out there?"
Lynette,What?
Lynette,"Hey, focus. Our son is throwing his life away. We have got to keep him on track."
Lynette,"I know you're discouraged, but-- letting our son make a huge mistake is not gonna help anything."
Lynette,"I am just trying to help Preston avoid the way marked ""unemployable loser."""
Lynette,I want you to get this stupid Europe idea out of his head. Take him on a tour of the campus. Get him excited. Show him college could be fun.
Lynette,"If you're really stopping by there, bring home some onion rings."
Lynette,"Hey, hey, how was the campus tour?"
Lynette,Oh!
Lynette,Oh.
Lynette,Really?
Lynette,"Good. Good. I knew if you saw the campus, you'd have a change of heart."
Lynette,What was that? I thought you said the tour was fantastic.
Lynette,Wh-what's that now?
Lynette,So--you would be a college student-- again.
Lynette,25 years after the first time.
Lynette,Which is?
Lynette,Chinese?
Lynette,"Uh. We didn't get that far. I felt faint, and he left to go buy a backpack."
Lynette,"Well, it's just so random, and the worst part is if I point that out, I'm a bitch."
Lynette,I know Tom. He's going to learn how to count to ten in Chinese then he'll get bored and move on to his new dream of becoming a beekeeper.
Lynette,"Please, sensei, instruct me in your ancient ways."
Lynette,That's your advice hope an opportunity just drops in my lap? Might as well start shopping for beekeeper suits.
Lynette,Coming. I'm coming.
Lynette,So I was thinking this whole going back to school thing deserves a little celebration.
Lynette,"I wanna be supportive. Let's go for a nice dinner, get a bottle of wine--maybe two, since we don't have to wake up early tomorrow."
Lynette,"Oh, Tom. You and tequila? What a great idea."
Lynette,"Okay, whoa, whoa, easy. You're a little drunk there."
Lynette,"I love you, too, baby. Here you go."
Lynette,"Who cares what time it is? We were celebrating a big change in your dad's life. Hey, someone called."
Lynette,"Oh, Jeezs."
Lynette,"Hey, babe. How'd the test go?"
Lynette,I'm sure it wasn't that bad.
Lynette,"Hey. Don't sweat it. You wanted to learn Chinese--mm, we'll get you a book."
Lynette,Marketplace?
Lynette,That's--a brilliant plan. Why didn't you tell me this?
Lynette,What's going on?
Lynette,Really? You passed the test?
Lynette,"I'm so proud. Porter, aren't you gonna congratulate your father?"
Lynette,"Okay, that's everyone."
Lynette,"This is Lynette Scavo. May I please speak to Dr. Rushton? Tell him it's important. Dr. Rushton, I need to come in and see you as soon as possible. I think the cancer's back."
Lynette,Do you know what they are?
Lynette,Come on. I know you know. It's cancer again. Am I right?
Lynette,"If it's cancer, and I find out you knew, I won't be dying alone."
Lynette,"So it is the cancer. Oh, god, I can't go through this again!"
Lynette,Excuse me?
Lynette,Are you sure it's not cancer?
Lynette,I went to the doctor today.
Lynette,I'm pregnant.
Lynette,How long have you been sniffing those markers? Of course with a baby.
Lynette,"Well, apparently, not old enough."
Lynette,What am I gonna do about my job?
Lynette,"Actually, I have an addendum to that."
Lynette,"No, Tom. We're having twins--again."
Lynette ,I'll do it.
Lynette ,Absolutely.
Lynette ,"Okay. So, now that I'm going to do some, heavy lifting, I believe I have a right to talk about the changes made to the script?"
Lynette ,All right. Off you go. Thanks.
Lynette ,Oh!
Lynette ,Why didn't you ever tell me this?
Lynette ,"What, a nanny cam?"
Lynette ,"All right, hold your water."
Lynette ,I'm not the one who forgot my mitt.
Lynette ,Really--
Lynette ,Could you hold her?
Lynette ,Please tell me that's not a purple wall clock. Pack your bags. We're moving.
Lynette ,Right.
Lynette ,Oh really? More steak?
Lynette ,"Please Christy, there is no way that I can get another babysitter this late in the day."
Lynette ,"Parker, knock it off."
Lynette ,"Parker, I swear I will spank you, knock it off."
Lynette ,"Hi, Mrs Binks, is Patty there? Thank you."
Lynette ,"Well, these are trained technicians and I've got a roast in the-freezer."
Lynette ,"Honey, I'm hating you a little right now."
Lynette ,"Uh-huh. Is that why you didn't open the door? Because of your hands? Mrs McClusky, do you have anyone who could help you out? A relative? A friend?"
Lynette ,"I just told them to paint something nice, the sentiment is all theirs."
Lynette ,"Okay, great. Like your dad said, it's time for bed."
Lynette ,Hi.
Lynette ,Huh?What's going on?
Lynette ,"Oh, yeah.I'll bite you good."
Lynette ,"Hell, yeah.First, I want you to touch yourself."
Lynette ,"Oh, yeah!"
Lynette ,I'm on my way.
Lynette ,For someone with your coloring.
Lynette ,I'll see you at home.
Lynette ,You better not be apologizing for me!
Lynette ,"Yeah, that's it. Give it to me."
Lynette ,"Seriously, stop or I will hurt you."
Lynettte,I hardly think the kids are going to suffer without a clump of fur on their heads.
Susan,"Well, sometimes people are so unhappy they think it's the only way they can solve their problems."
Susan,"Yeah, sometimes people pretend to be one way on the outside and they're totally different on the inside."
Susan,"I don't like that word, Julie. But yeah, that's a great example."
Susan,Sorry I'm late.
Susan,"You'll love this, he said it doesn't mean anything, it was just sex."
Susan,"Yeah, and then he got this Zen look on his face, and he said, you know Susan, most men live lives of quiet desperation."
Susan,"No, I said, really? And what do most women lead, lives of noisy fulfillment?"
Susan,"I mean, of all people, did he have to bang his secretary? I had that woman over for brunch. GABRIELLE: It's like my grandmother always said, an erect penis doesn't have a conscience."
Susan,"I don't know. I'm sorry you guys, I just-- I just don't know how I'm going to survive this."
Susan,"Sure, that's fine."
Susan,"Yeah. I'm just so angry. If Mary Alice was having problems, she should have come to us; she should have let us help her."
Susan,"Gabby, the woman killed herself. Something must've been going on."
Susan,"Oh, I wouldn't eat that if I were you."
Susan,"I made it, trust me. Hey, hey, do you have a death wish?"
Susan,"Yeah, I get that a lot. Here you go."
Susan,"Susan Mayer, I live across the street."
Susan,Yeah I'm very big with the under 5 set. What do you do?
Susan,"Now that everybody's seen that I've brought something, I should probably just throw this out."
Susan,I can't believe you went over there.
Susan,"Julie, I like Mr. Delfino, I do. It's just, I don't know if I'm ready to start dating yet."
Susan,"No, I'm just trying to remember. I don't wanna talk to you about my love life anymore, it weirds me out."
Susan,What?
Susan,"Hi Mike. I brought you a little housewarming gift. I probably should've brought something by earlier, but--"
Susan,Really?
Susan,"Oh, I'm late for an appointment anyway."
Susan,How would you feel about me using your child support payments for plastic surgery?
Susan,"You're right. So, is that your project for school? You know in 5th grade I made the white house out of sugar cubes."
Susan,Tell me again why I fought for custody of you?
Susan,"Oh, that're right."
Susan,Oh god.
Susan,Hi.
Susan,Are you busy?
Susan,"Well, I., I just was wondering, if, um, if there was any chance that, um, you would uh-- I just-- wanted to ask if--"
Susan,Edie. What are you--?
Susan,Uh-- I have a clog.
Susan,And you're a plumber. Right?
Susan,The clog's in the pipe.
Susan,"Well, I've got one."
Susan,Now? You wanna come over now? Y-you have company.
Susan,"That's it, just stuff the hair down."
Susan,"Here, here, look. Put in this peanut butter. And this cooking oil. And these olives!"
Susan,"Uh, oh god. That's him. How am I gonna stuff up the sink--"
Susan,"I've told Julie a million times not to play in the kitchen. Kids, y' know?"
Susan,"Oh. Mrs. Huber, how you doing?"
Susan,It's upset?
Susan,Oh.
Susan,He's spending the night?
Susan,"I can't believe it. This can't be happening. Mike can't like Edie better than me, he just can't!"
Susan,Edie?
Susan,Edie? Hello..?
Susan,Anybody home? I need to borrow sugar?
Susan,Oh-- Oh! Oh!
Susan,Oh..
Susan,I'm fine. I'm fine. I just feel really bad for Edie.
Susan,Mike!
Susan,"I, I thought you were-- um. Where were you?"
Susan,"Yeah. Yeah, but she's fine now. Everything's fine now."
Susan,I brought some champagne. I thought we should all have a toast.
Susan,"Alright ladies, lift 'em up. To Mary Alice, good friend and neighbor. Wherever you are, we hope you've found peace."
Susan,What does this mean?
Susan,"Oh Mary Alice, what did you do?"
Susan,"Gabby, the woman killed herself. Something must've been going on."
Susan,"Oh Mary Alice, what did you do?"
Susan,I think we should give it to Paul.
Susan,"It doesn't matter, she was his wife. He deserves to have all the facts."
Susan,"No, this was serious, I know it was. We gotta find out what was going on."
Susan,"Well, isn't it worse to be in the dark, imagining she did all these horrible things?"
Susan,Shut up.
Susan,I keep hoping he'll ask me out.
Susan,Shouldn't you be making brownies for your nerdy friends?
Susan,The measuring cup?
Susan,"Hm. Uh, well it's gotta be here somewhere. Just keep looking."
Susan,Mike!
Susan,"I didn't realize anyone was gonna be out here, I just sorta rolled outta bed."
Susan,Oooh.
Susan,"No, it's fine, I get it."
Susan,Do you wanna have dinner with me?
Susan,"Heh, well, and Julie. Uh, it's a thing we do when somebody new moves into the neighbourhood, we invite them over for a home-cooked meal. Sort of a tradition."
Susan,Well. I order takeout.
Susan,"Yeah, it's sort of a new tradition. I'm working out the kinks."
Susan,Oh. Great.
Susan,I'll be there.
Susan,"Bye, Bongo."
Susan,Julie? Mike Delfino just invited us to dinner Friday night.
Susan,But only I'm going. Because you're gonna come down with something semi-serious that requires bed-rest and fluids.
Susan,Hey you. What're we having?
Susan,"Oh yeah, I love my steak."
Susan,Edie.
Susan,"Oh, it's sort of a new tradition."
Susan,"Edie, would you like to join us for dinner?"
Susan,It's not like that. The more the merrier.
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,Right.
Susan,"Oh, no, no. No, Edie's definitely a carnivore."
Susan,I thought that was a look she was going for.
Susan,Zach? Is your dad home? I need to talk to him.
Susan,Hey Paul.
Susan,I hope I'm not interrupting.
Susan,"I just wanted to come by and say hello, you know, see how you guys are doing."
Susan,I can only imagine. Not knowing why Mary Alice?
Susan,Why she did it. Oh! Let me help you.
Susan,Sorry if I upset you.
Susan,Of course.
Susan,"Yeah, well, if Edie's gonna be there, I'm gonna need emotional support."
Susan,"I don't know, I was gonna take her out at the knees, but it all happened so fast."
Susan,"That's a good idea. Edie will get there at 5:45, which means her breasts will arrive at 5:30, so I should shoot for 5."
Susan,I'm gonna keep my one little bag and go home.
Susan,That is a beautiful rose. Where did you get it?
Susan,"John? Your gardener, he gave you a rose?"
Susan,"Oh. Okay. Sure is beautiful, isn't it?"
Susan,"I hope you don't mind, I thought I'd come by early and help you set up."
Susan,Oh.
Susan,"Mm, that's Mr. Mullin. And just so you know, if he invites you in, you have to meet all of his pets."
Susan,He's a taxidermist.
Susan,"Uh, yes, yes he was."
Susan,"No, Julie, she wasn't married to Xavier. That was just one of her special friends. I think we should change the subject, you know, unless you wanna keep talking about it."
Susan,"So, you know what? I am gonna go get dessert."
Susan,Here's your dessert.
Susan,"Ooh, we just got off on the wrong foot, we're really best buddies now. Oh, what a good boy! Bongo, are you okay?"
Susan,Is there anything I can do?
Susan,Hey.
Susan,How's Bongo doing?
Susan,"Oh, god. Uh, I-stopped and I got this, uh. I am just so sorry for this."
Susan,"Oh no, it's okay."
Susan,"Oh, that's great."
Susan,"Uh, I'm gonna say no."
Susan,Wow. You must be so relieved.
Susan,"Well, it was your dog, I get it."
Susan,"No, it doesn't. Not at all."
Susan,"This is for you. No, for Bongo. You give it to him."
Susan,I keep hoping he'll ask me out.
Susan,"Oh Mary Alice, what did you do?"
Susan,"Be nice, I come bearing snacks."
Susan,"Hello, sorry I'm late."
Susan,Really?
Susan,So when is this shindig?
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,How could we have all forgotten about this?
Susan,I think we should go through with it.
Susan,"No, it's sort of a way to honour Mary Alice. It was so important to her."
Susan,Lynette?
Susan,"No, it sounds very, very wrong."
Susan,I have an idea.
Susan,"It's tomorrow night, so if you could just keep Julie an extra day."
Susan,What cabin?
Susan,"You can afford a cabin, but you can't scrape up child support?"
Susan,"Uh, no, it's not!"
Susan,We are being as nice as we possibly can to one another.
Susan,Excuse me. Brandy. Do you mind?
Susan,"I could, but she's the one who threw it."
Susan,No.
Susan,"Honey, stay out of this."
Susan,"Oh, sorry. Was that petulant too?"
Susan,"Yeah, well you just go to hell."
Susan,Uh-
Susan,"No, but god, you should've seen the look on his face."
Susan,"I left three messages. Oh, he's not gonna come. Big surprise. I did everything but foam at the mouth. God, I hate when I get that way. It's like every time I get within 10 feet of Karl, I just become this monster."
Susan,"What, you mean forgive him?"
Susan,"You know, I've lived with this bitterness so long, I think I'd be lonely without it."
Susan,"Hey Karl, it's me. I was hoping you'll be there. Um, listen, we need to talk. So, maybe when you drop Julie off tomorrow, we could have a moment. It's important. Give my best to-Brandy. Call me."
Susan,"I'm coming! Karl, what are you doing here? I asked you to come tomorrow."
Susan,Tomorrow! I'm in a towel!
Susan,"I'm not really ready for this, I was gonna have a whole speech prepared."
Susan,"Oh. Um, okay. Here's the thing, Karl. I was thinking about what happened in the driveway yesterday. And I just don't wanna, I don't wanna live like this. I don't wanna be that kind of person. And I just thought, if the two of us had a nice calm-I need an apology, Karl."
Susan,An apology. For the way you ended our marriage. You never took any responsibility for your behaviour.
Susan,What does that mean?
Susan,While you were married to someone else!
Susan,"Yeah, well, my heart wants to hurt you, but I can control myself."
Susan,You know what? I don't need an apology. I don't need anything from you.
Susan,"No, you're the one who's been humiliating yourself, Karl, why don't you see that? You walked out on your family. People think you're scum, not me. So worry about yourself, I'm okay with me. I can walk down the street and walk my head high."
Susan,Locked myself out. Naked.
Susan,And then I fell. So how are you?
Susan,It's a date.
Susan,"Yeah, it's-it's casual."
Susan,Thanks for helping me break in. Do you think it's gonna be hard to replace that screen?
Susan,"Okay. I know what just happened is funny, in theory, but I am nowhere near ready to laugh about it. So please, no jokes."
Susan,Pretty much.
Susan,"Hey, are you okay?"
Susan,"Well, you're probably not wearing the right shoes."
Susan,"Okay, I gotta break the ice here. So you're in counselling, big deal. You want humiliation? I'll give you humiliation. I locked myself out of my house stark naked and got caught by Mike."
Susan,Today. Right before the party.
Susan,What? When was this?
Susan,I was thinking we left too late.
Susan,"I don't know. God, I hope not. I mean, they're always been wound a little tight, but I've never seen him like that. Then again, who am I to judge?"
Susan,"Okay, you have got to know that I only get that angry around Karl. He just treated me so badly at the end, I-I haven't been able to get past it."
Susan,What do you mean?
Susan,"Listen, Mike, I-about the whole seeing me naked thing. I don't know, I just, I wanna thank you for being such a-perfect gentleman."
Susan,Oh. Goodnight.
Susan,Just a sec.
Susan,"Don't worry, I'm not packing heat. Hi."
Susan,"I'll be quick. Brandy, I'm sorry for the way I treated you. It was uncalled for, and childish, and it won't happen again. I have built up a lot of anger towards you, both of you, and I realise now that I just can't carry that around anymore. So, apology or no apology, I'm moving on."
Susan,Please. Call me Susan.
Susan,Thank you.
Susan,"Bree, what does it say on the rest of the tape?"
Susan,I think we should show Paul the note.
Susan,We've all sort of felt it.
Susan,Huh?
Susan,I'm trying a new strategy. I'm playing hard to get.
Susan,"Oh, maybe until noon. Then I'm going to have to run over there and beg him to love me ."
Susan,You've got to be kidding me! She washed her car yesterday.
Susan,"Oh, no, she did not!"
Susan,"Well, she's bringing out the big guns."
Susan,"What am I supposed to say to Mike, ""I saw you half naked so I thought I'd drop by?"""
Susan,What's that?
Susan,God bless you!
Susan,Hi.
Susan,"We, uh, got this by mistake."
Susan,I hope it's not important.
Susan,Oh.
Susan,"Well, I guess I've done my good deed for the day."
Susan,So I guess I'll just head back home.. Bye.
Susan,I love old movies!!
Susan,Mrs Huber.
Susan,"Oh, wow. Why?"
Susan,"Actually, I just had dinner."
Susan,What's so funny?
Susan,I don't know that people really say that anymore.
Susan,I'm fine.
Susan,"Oh, you don't have to apologise about Carl. Really, Carl and I are over. I've moved on."
Susan,"Um, sure. As a friend."
Susan,No. Thank you.
Susan,What?! I am not desperate.
Susan,"Mrs Huber, with all due respect, you're crazy."
Susan,What's that?
Susan,"Well, that's not-"
Susan,Mrs Huber .
Susan,"No, like I told you before, we're just friends."
Susan,"By the way, if I didn't make it clear yesterday, I absolutely did not do that thing that you accused me of doing."
Susan,"Um, I'm not really a fan."
Susan,"I just, ah, don't."
Susan,Will you please just drop it?
Susan,Well th-
Susan,"What exactly is it you want from me, Mrs Huber?"
Susan,Ring it up.
Susan,"We talked to Paul, told him we need to show him something."
Susan,"So Paul, we noticed that you're selling the house."
Susan,"Well, before you move, we thought there was something you should know."
Susan,"You can see from the postmark, Mary Alice probably got it the day she died."
Susan,"Paul, are you going to be alright?"
Susan,"Julie? Julie ,honey, wake up. We need to talk.."
Susan,I think I'm being blackmailed.
Susan,"And when I realised I couldn't put out the fire, I ran. I must have dropped the measuring jug in the process."
Susan,Obviously I can't let her get away with this. The only thing to do is to go to the police and tell them everything that happened.
Susan,"Julie, I don't think they'll throw me in jail. I mean, it was an accident."
Susan,"OK, let's run through it one more time."
Susan,Oh god. I hate that I'm turning you into a thief.
Susan,"Hey, that's right."
Susan,Technically we have nothing to be ashamed about.
Susan,Wear these. I don't want you to leave any fingerprints.
Susan,"There she goes. Okay, move."
Susan,"Oh, I am so glad to be playing Frisbee again. Here you go, coming atcha."
Susan,"Alright, back up a little more. There you go. Wooo! Alright, here we go."
Susan,Oh my! Whoops!
Susan,You'd better go get that.
Susan,Mike!
Susan,"Uh, yeah. Um. Julie and I are just out tossing the Frisbee around and it flew off into Mrs. Huber's back yard."
Susan,"NO! no, no, no. Julie's got it."
Susan,Distant? What do you mean?
Susan,"No. No, no, not at all."
Susan,You are so sweet. I would love to go.
Susan,Edie! I thought you'd be at work.
Susan,"Well, don't just run off. Come and hang out with us."
Susan,What?
Susan,No! It's not like that.
Susan,Edie wait! Um-Mike and I were gonna go see the movies on Wednesday-and I just thought it would be fun if you joined us.
Susan,"Yeah. Yeah, that's okay ,isn't it, Mike?"
Susan,"Edie, wait! Um, you should take my ticket."
Susan,"Good evening, Mrs Huber."
Susan,"I don't know what you're talking about, Mrs Huber."
Susan,"Again, I don't know what you're talking about. But- yeah, I did."
Susan,"You're a piece of work , you know that?"
Susan,"I will keep my lawn looking nice. And I will make sure that my music isn't playing too loud and if I get some of your mail. Heck, I'll run it right over, because that's what good neighbours do. But from now on, when I run into you on the street and I say ""Good morning, Mrs Huber"" or ""How are you, Mrs Huber"" just know that inside I am quietly but decidedly hating your guts."
Susan,"Good evening, Mrs Huber."
Susan,He actually said Mary Alice was crazy?
Susan,"But remember what the note said ""I know what you did. It makes me sick. I'm going to tell"". That's not the kind of thing that someone writes to themselves. That's a message, sent by an enemy."
Susan,Mr Whiskars.
Susan,"Dinner time. Here kitty, kitty, kitty!"
Susan,"Cats can open drawers, can they?"
Susan,Noway.
Susan,Mr. Whiskers!!!
Susan,Actually I do have a question. Do you have a second?
Susan,"Well,I'm the one who discovered the break in and I think I found some evidence."
Susan,I think this is a screwdrivert left behind by the burglar. And I didn't touch it.
Susan,"I tried! But they sort of laughed at me, because apparently nothing was taken from Mrs Fome's house."
Susan,Thank you! So do you think it should be dusted for prints?
Susan,Great.
Susan,Bye.
Susan,I thought we were too. But he's been giving a lot of mixed signals.
Susan,You noticed that?
Susan,It's a shame. They used to be such a happy family.
Susan,"Oh,really? That's great."
Susan,Okay.
Susan,"Whoops,sorry."
Susan,"Oh!Uh, you seem like a really sweet guy, in an interesting line of work. But I um I'm not really available."
Susan,Yeah.Sort of.
Susan,It's hard to explain. Even to myself.
Susan,Oh wow.
Susan,I'm sorry.
Susan,Blame myself???
Susan,"Okay, fine I'll go out with you."
Susan,"Now that you've gotten your date, can you tell me what that really mean -that 907A?"
Susan,Well thank god for the thin blue line!
Susan,"Hey,Mike."
Susan,Good.I just came by to say hello.
Susan,So you member that cop from the neighbourhood watch meeting ? He agreed to run a fingerprint check on the screwdriver I found at Mrs Fome's house.
Susan,"Still somebody broke in, it is a crime. So the weird thing is, the cop asked me out.On a date."
Susan,And I sort of said Yes. I was sort of curious what you thought about that.
Susan,"No.no. I just uh, was wondering your opinion."
Susan,Okay.Great. Fine.Thank you.
Susan,You don't have to explain.
Susan,It's complicated. I get it.
Susan,"I told him another man asked me out, it was the perfect opportunity for Mike to be jealous. And nothing."
Susan,"Honey, I batted everything that wasn't nailed down. I'm telling you, nothing."
Susan,So what's going on there?
Susan,Wow.
Susan,"Aw,maybe it's my fault. Maybe I just imagined an entire relationship with this man that didn't exist."
Susan,"Yes,and the flirting made me think that he was kind and trustworthy and honest and hygienic. That's how it is with me. A guy just smiles at me three times and I'm picking out wedding china. I'm a mess."
Susan,That's what happened with Carl. I only dated him a couple of months. I filled in the blanks; I married him. It was a disaster!
Susan,I dunno. What does that mean anyway? My life is complicated?
Susan,I can't believe Zach said that. What else did he tell you?
Susan,You couldn't get any more out of him?
Susan,"Then you're going to have to get Zach to tell you something, so we have more to go on."
Susan,I've got one. Kelly Holstatter. In eighth grade she used to spit in my gym shoes.
Susan,"How tragic! By which I mean, yay?"
Susan,"Well,time flies when you're on a stakeout in crack town."
Susan,So when does our official date begin?
Susan,But what if I like him?
Susan,"Hey,I thought this went to the lab."
Susan,And that means what?
Susan,So why couldn't you just tell me that?
Susan,"Well,if you'd only lied to me about it once, it wouldn't be."
Susan,I know who you are. You're a Carl in disguise. I'm done with you: all of you.
Susan,"I'd rather take my chances on the street, thank you very much."
Susan,Excuse me. I think I'm lost.
Susan,"Oh!Uh, yes, and a lovely corner it is too. I hate to bother you while you're working but I was just wondering if you could point me in the direction of a pay phone. Oh, and if you had some change for this five , preferably quarters?."
Susan,Right!Okay. Thank you.
Susan,"Oh,thank you so much! You're saving my life!!"
Susan,"Oh,yeah, sure, go ahead. Do what you've got to do."
Susan,"Oh,thank god. Listen, don't ask any questions, just get somebody down here to pick me up at the corner of Ninth and Foster."
Susan,"Thank you,no, I'm on a break. Hurry Please!"
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,I cannot believe Julie sent you. She is soon going to be dead.
Susan,No.The cop lied to me.
Susan,I don't want to talk about it.
Susan,I'm not mad at you. I mean I'm not just mad at you-I'm mostly mad at myself.
Susan,I'm mad that I like you so much without knowing anything about you.
Susan,What's your favourite food?
Susan,What's your favourite sport?
Susan,Favourite band?
Susan,That's a guy not a band.
Susan,What do you think of me?
Susan,"I'm sorry, could you repeat that?"
Susan,Hi.
Susan,"Hey, Paul."
Susan,"I got to say, I was a little surprised to see Mary Alice's award for sale. She got it for doing charity work, from the Chamber of Commerce."
Susan,"That makes sense. Still, I just want to make sure you didn't want to keep it, for Zach, something to remember his mother by."
Susan,"Great. Speaking of Zach, I haven't seen him around lately."
Susan,"Oh, which ones?"
Susan,"So, how'd you get the fat lip?"
Susan,"No, but I can tell you this much. He's not staying with relatives."
Susan,No. That's why we have to find him. It's the only way we'll know the truth.
Susan,Mrs. Greenberg. Do you remember those two eggs I let you borrow last Christmas?
Susan,I need those back.
Susan,"Oh, forget about it, it's not that important, but since I'm here, do you still have that old hatchback sitting in your garage? Can I borrow it tomorrow?"
Susan,Just for a couple of hours.
Susan,"Yes, I think so. I learned in college. It's like riding a bike, right?"
Susan,It's not big deal. It's just for a couple of hours. I let you borrow my eggs for a whole year.
Susan,"It's going, finally. We have our first official date next week. I think he's taking me to see a play or something."
Susan,"Oh, that's right, the twins-stage debut!"
Susan,"It hasn't really changed since Girl Scouts. Girls smile at you to your face, and then behind your back, they make fun of you because you're the only one not shaving your legs yet."
Susan,And a lot less sneaky.
Susan,Pull up a chair.
Susan,Oh!
Susan,I checked upon this Silvercrest place. It's a treatment center for troubled kids. Who's gonna notice one more? I create the distraction. You blend in and find Zach.
Susan,"I don't know, Julie. You pretend to be bulimic. Gag a little. Come on, work with me here!"
Susan,"Okay, fine, if you don't want to help me, I'm not going to force you."
Susan,"Because Mary Alice was a wonderful person, and now all anybody thinks about her is that she went off the deep end and did this terrible selfish thing, and I think there is more to it than that. She was my friend, Julie, and I owe it to her to find out the truth."
Susan,"Hi, I'm Susan Mayer. I have an appointment to see Dr. Sicher."
Susan,I sure am.
Susan,I don't get it. I've gone through all your yearbooks and you and Zach never went to school with anybody named Dana.
Susan,Did it sound like a relative?
Susan,"Okay, gimme a break here. I'm just grasping at straws."
Susan,"Honey, it's up to his father."
Susan,I don't think that's a good idea either.
Susan,I just have a feeling.
Susan,I saw the movie. It was really good.
Susan,He's at a rehabilitation center. Julie snuck in and actually talked to him.
Susan,"There wasn't enough time. He did say one thing that was kind of mysterious. He said something happened to someone named Dana, and that he could never ever talk about it."""
Susan,I figure Dana has something to do with what Mary Alice was trying to hide.
Susan,"I know, but I wanna look really sexy."
Susan,Hmm. How about midnight?
Susan,Oh my god. We are so not having this conversation.
Susan,Are you finished?
Susan,"Okay, you can leave now."
Susan,"Hey, Edie!"
Susan,"Oh this?"" ""Well, I have a date. Right now. With Mike. We kissed. FYI."
Susan,"Ooo, love that jacket. Good choice."
Susan,Susan.
Susan,Old friend?
Susan,"Yeah. Yeah. No, actually no, I don't know. So, by old friend, do you mean college pal, bowling buddy, saved you from drowning?"
Susan,Could you give it a shot?
Susan,Thanks.
Susan,Mike had to reschedule.
Susan,"Oh, here it is."
Susan,"You shelled your own crabs? Okay, I don't want to butt in, but are you doing too much? Because you look exhausted."
Susan,"Oh my god, look at this embroidery."
Susan,Paul Young's garage sale.
Susan,"I just wanted to say goodbye to Mary Alice's house, before somebody else moved in."
Susan,I beg your pardon?
Susan,You don't know what you are talking about. They're just friends.
Susan,So friends can do that.
Susan,Where did you say they were going tonight?
Susan,I don't know why I let you talk me into coming here. There is obviously nothing going on between them.
Susan,I'm going to the bathroom and I'm going home. I don't want Mike to catch me here.
Susan,It's not a competition.
Susan,"Good night, Edie."
Susan,And why would you root for me?
Susan,"Mike! What a small, small world."
Susan,"No kidding, is she here?"
Susan,"Oh, well, yeah, we, we did, uh, I just thought she left."
Susan,"What? No, no, I just came here, you know, with Edie. We, just, love to ride that bull."
Susan,"Yeah, yeah, it's a real rush."
Susan,"No, you give me a break! I did not follow you here, and even if I had followed you here, it's because you've been so secretive about Kendra."
Susan,And I came here to ride the bull!
Susan,Oh fun. I'm a doggie.
Susan,"Oh, yeah, I'm here to ride the bull. Check it out! Okay! Yeah! Woo! Baby! Woo!"
Susan,"Everybody's looking at me, aren't they?"
Susan,"Oh God, why couldn't I have just have been knocked unconscious?"
Susan,"Absolutely. Oh. Ow! Ow, ow."
Susan,We've been introduced.
Susan,"Me, too."
Susan,"Well, you sort of interrupted our first date. But up until then, smoking hot tension. Sounds pathetic, I know."
Susan,Any particular reason?
Susan,Thanks.
Susan,Julie and I went over this morning.
Susan,She's been in a coma ever since she came out of ER. Nobody knows when or even if she'll wake up.
Susan,I hope she wakes soon. Maybe she can tell us who was driving that car.
Susan,"Wow, that's quite a pitching arm you've got there."
Susan,"Knock, knock!"
Susan,You're a mess.
Susan,"Sounds like a job. So, Julie said that you came by before?"
Susan,What time do you want me to be ready?
Susan,Six is good.
Susan,"Sounds great. Um, you do know that it's like a two-hour drive up there. And isn't that kind of late to be coming back?"
Susan,Oh? Like a hotel room?
Susan,"Of course, of course, yes. So, maybe we should make reservations, you know, just in case."
Susan,"Hey, Bongo, come here. You want a treat? Hey, Mike, where do you keep the dog biscuits?"
Susan,"Oh, never mind! We'll just find them ourselves. We'll go find them ourselves."
Susan,Nothing. It's not important.
Susan,I could let him in.
Susan,"No, it's fine, just give me the key. I'll be around all day."
Susan,"And then I opened the cabinet and there was all this money in it. I mean, there was wads of it."
Susan,"Well, what? Realistically, I've known this guy a few weeks. I mean, he could be a hit man for the mob!"
Susan,I never get out of the house.
Susan,"Yeah, and he retired. I try not to take that personally."
Susan,"Maybe I am being silly, but going to a hotel with a man is a big deal to me. What if Mike is hiding something?"
Susan,I don't know.
Susan,Why do you care so much?
Susan,"Oh, of course."
Susan,Here you go. Have a nice weekend.
Susan,"Hello! I need help, I'm up here, I'm trapped in the floor, hello?!"
Susan,"If you came in here to judge me, you can just leave!"
Susan,"Wait! Wait! No! Wait, don't, don't go! Wait, I have an idea. Here! Here! Here! Here, grab the towel, Bongo! Come on, grab the other end! Come on, boy! That's it! Get the other end! Come on, Bongo! Pull the other end! Come on, Bongo! What are you doing? Bongo, over here!"
Susan,"Bongo? Oh, oh! don't do that! Bongo!"
Susan,What is wrong with you? Lassie would have had a fire truck here by now! Stupid dog.
Susan,"Good boy, Bongo! Run, Bongo, run, go get help!"
Susan,Ooooeeewwwoooohhh--
Susan,Mike? I'm upstairs. Sorta.
Susan,"Well, you see, this bird, um, flew in your bathroom window, and, I, tried to save it, but, uh, it died."
Susan,"I don't think so, either."
Susan,"Thank you, oh, you have no idea what that was like--"
Susan,"What? Oh, I can explain."
Susan,Mike--
Susan,"I just came over to say I'm sorry, and I'll pay for all the damage."
Susan,"Well, so, in your mind, is the date off?"
Susan,"Hold on a minute, now. I started snooping around because I found all that money by accident. And, and then, I found a gun. Are you a drug dealer or something?"
Susan,"Well, I wouldn't know because you never let me in. You know, there's this whole part of your life that you keep completely walled off."
Susan,"Well, every little detail is one thing. You know, weird creepy secrets, that's another."
Susan,"Well, maybe we shouldn't be dating."
Susan,Do you mean that?
Susan,"Well, I hope that, your, you know, little secret keeps you warm at night because you're throwing something really great away to protect it!"
Susan,"Lynette, it's just, this really isn't the time--"
Susan,"Lynette! You know, when are you coming back? Lynette! Lynette!"
Susan,I hope the kids aren't too much for Danielle to handle.
Susan,"I don't know, but I'm scared. Something's very, very wrong."
Susan,Are you okay?
Susan,"No, it's not! So you got addicted to your kids' ADD medication. It happens."
Susan,"That's just not true. When, when Julie was a baby, I, I was out of my mind almost every day."
Susan,I think it's just that we think that it's easier to keep it all in.
Susan,"It helps, huh?"
Susan,You just told me everything I need to know.
Susan,Give me the dress.
Susan,Trouble at work?
Susan,"Julie, you'll never guess who you got a letter from. Zach. Isn't that weird, him writing you?"
Susan,"Well, open! Open, open, open! He could have said something about Dana!"
Susan,Later? What's wrong with now?
Susan,"Julie, what's going on?"
Susan,"No, it's just when I was your age, my pen pal lived on a farm in Ohio, not in a mental institution. You know, that letter is one notch above prison mail."
Susan,"Hey, do you need any help?"
Susan,"Oh, that's okay. I've got it."
Susan,Ow! Oh!
Susan,Sure. Do you want to tell me why you had your foot in John Rowland's crotch yesterday?
Susan,"You're sleeping with him, aren't you?"
Susan,"Gabrielle, he's in high school, and, it's illegal, and you're married. If Carlos found out, this would kill him."
Susan,How can you call something like this harmless? After everything you know about what I went through with Karl?
Susan,"Yes it is. It's about me, and about every other person who was screwed over by somebody they loved. When Karl ran off with Brandy, you saw what a basket case I was. I was crying, I, I was tearing up his clothes, I couldn't get out of bed all day. You were right there. How could you do the same thing?"
Susan,"Well, why don't you enlighten me? You're beautiful, you have more money than you could spend, and you have a husband who adores you!"
Susan,That's a rationalization and you know it! See you at the show.
Susan,What are you doing here?
Susan,Listen to me. There is no future for you and Gabrielle. She's not going to divorce Carlos and run away with you.
Susan,Because he has money. A lot of it.
Susan,Exactly. You are not mature enough to have a realistic perspective on this relationship. You would be so much happier with a girl your own age.
Susan,Sorry I'm late.
Susan,Really? I look okay?
Susan,"Oh no, isn't Helen Rowland going last?"
Susan,"Helen, Helen, you're here! Did they tell you about the change in lineup? I'm going to go last if that's okay."
Susan,"I'm sorry, it wasn't my decision."
Susan,What is wrong with you?
Susan,"Oh! Ow! For God's sake, Helen, this is for charity!"
Susan,What?
Susan,I thought that--
Susan,"Okay, you want me to talk? You're going to find Helen Rowland, and you're going to tell her the truth, before everyone in this neighborhood thinks that I'm the one sleeping with an underage boy."
Susan,Why not?
Susan,So what? You obviously don't love him.
Susan,"God, you are so weak!"
Susan,What did you expect-a hug?
Susan,"Honey, what's going on?"
Susan,"Well, yes, they were writing to each other."
Susan,"Julie, in the letters, did Zach say anything about running away?"
Susan,There's your answer.
Susan,"If we hear anything, I will let you know right away. I understand how worried you must be."
Susan,"Paul, my daughter doesn't lie."
Susan,"What are you, storing up for winter?"
Susan,"Oh, how awful!"
Susan,Am I? Hmm.
Susan,"Oh great, our romantic weekend is off."
Susan,No.
Susan,"I just, I just want it to be special."
Susan,"Okay. I know this sounds weird, but I just need to have my things around me."
Susan,"Perfumes and oils. And I want to pick out the outfit that you are going to tear off me. And plus, I need to be in complete control of the lighting."
Susan,You are just the sweetest guy.
Susan,"No, me neither."
Susan,"Oh, no good. My publisher's got me under the gun for something. What about Friday?"
Susan,"Damn, Karl, I'm not even married to him anymore and he's still keeping me from having sex."
Susan,Mike.
Susan,My oven's out.
Susan,Come over and help my find my pilot light.
Susan,"Oh, candles, candles!"
Susan,"Mike? Mike, is that you? I'm up here!"
Susan,Mike?
Susan,Oh my god!
Susan,"I'm so sorry, I thought there was someone in the house."
Susan,No. My clothes were already off. I was going to seduce you.
Susan,"Oh, I'm sorry, are you okay?"
Susan,"Julie, what else can I do? He can't stay here!"
Susan,"He's right. Sorry, guys!"
Susan,"Listen, if Paul sees Zach and freaks out--"
Susan,Thank you.
Susan,"Young lady, we need to talk about what you did."
Susan,Here's the candles I borrowed. Thanks.
Susan,"I cannot believe that after everything you did, you're mad at me."
Susan,"Yeah, well, someone had to be responsible, and like it or not, I've got a birth certificate that says I'm your mother."
Susan,What is that supposed to mean?
Susan,Julie!
Susan,"Yeah, but--"
Susan,I was in bad shape back then.
Susan,I had to send Zach back. We could have gotten in a lot of trouble.
Susan,Thanks for your help with Zach before.
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,Not well. She accused me of not being a good mother.
Susan,"Well, she was sort of right. After my divorce, I really leaned on her a lot."
Susan,"And I still kinda do it. I just want somebody to talk to about all my adult stuff, and she's right there, and she just acts so mature, I forget she's thirteen."
Susan,"Well, I can't talk to you about everything."
Susan,What if I want to talk about the big crush I have on the plumber that lives across the street?
Susan,"Oh, yeah."
Susan,"Well, um, he's got a smile that's to die for, and don't get me started on his tattoo."
Susan,Thanks.
Susan,You walked out on your family.
Susan,Has anybody talked to Bree? How's Rex doing?
Susan,"Well, I don't know how he had a heart attack. He was so young."
Susan,"Oh no, I'm sure she's fine. We're talking about Mrs. Huber. She's like a roach!"
Susan,"So, I had a really good time."
Susan,Gotcha.
Susan,For you? Of course it is.
Susan,We've been divorced over a year.
Susan,"Well, please. Just come on in. Uh, Mike, I don't think you've officially met my ex, Karl Mayer."
Susan,"Yeah, he is. So what do you want me to sign? Oh, I see."
Susan,"Yeah, we're going to a restaurant downtown. A guy who plays piano and an open mike. Julie got a bunch of her girlfriends together, so we're just going to make a night of it."
Susan,Here you are.
Susan,Give my best to Brandi.
Susan,You're not? What happened?
Susan,"No, no really, I'm, I'm sorry you had to go through that. I am."
Susan,Uh--
Susan,"Uh, try ripping up old photos. It helps."
Susan,"Karl, do you want to join us?"
Susan,"Oh, well--"" ""I am the best, aren't I."
Susan,Hold on a sec.
Susan,"Okay, now I'm good."
Susan,What?
Susan,"Oh! Well, that's great!"
Susan,"No, No! It's fine. It just kind of caught me off guard. I mean, I want to say it back."
Susan,"You're not mad, are you?"
Susan,Good.
Susan,"No. No, no, no. You obviously think you have some insight into my soul, so please, go ahead, dazzle me."
Susan,Big insight. The postman knows that.
Susan,"What? I loathe Karl, and the postman will back me up on that, too."
Susan,Where are you getting this?
Susan,"Okay, the analysis part of this evening is now over."
Susan,"Well, you know what? You're going to come to Julie's party tomorrow night, and you're gonna see Karl and I together, and you're going to understand once and for all that I have no feelings for him whatsoever."
Susan,"Actually, you're coming to the party tomorrow. And that's the end of it."
Susan,What?
Susan,"Yeah, people fake their own abductions all the time."
Susan,"Well, here's something. Mike told me he loved me."
Susan,"Yay! Oh, you guys were fantastic."
Susan,"Okay, have fun."
Susan,What the hell is she doing here?
Susan,"Of all people, you picked that tired piece of - Edie!"
Susan,"Uh, Edie, it's not his birthday."
Susan,Only when I'm alone.
Susan,I don't think so.
Susan,You want to hear me sing?
Susan,Okay.
Susan,"New York, New York."
Susan,What do you mean?
Susan,I think I'll take my chances--sort of like you did--on those high notes.
Susan,Yeah. He's a great guy.
Susan,"Thanks for your concern, Karl, I'm fine."
Susan,"Yeah, that part when you slept with your secretary was really exciting."
Susan,What?
Susan,"You're an ass, you know that?"
Susan,Top of the heap--
Susan,"Karl, don't you turn away from me. Look at me! You know, what else were you doing during our marriage? How many other women were you sticking it to? As God as my witness, it will snow on the hills of hell, before I ever feel sorry for you again!"
Susan,"What is it? I'm really, really busy."
Susan,"Oh, well, in that case, come on in. I'm not doing anything."
Susan,"Yeah, me too. And just so you know, I'm sorry for flipping out. I shouldn't let you get to me like that."
Susan,What?
Susan,A spark?
Susan,A moray eel would seem safe after you.
Susan,News flash! I hated all of that!
Susan,What are you saying?
Susan,You want me back?
Susan,Wow. Just so we're clear. You want to move back in here and be faithful to me and love me with all your heart and soul?
Susan,Oh my god. This is so wonderful!
Susan,"Oh god, no. Karl, um, no, what I meant by wonderful was that I wondered inside if I still had feelings for you, if deep down I still loved you--"
Susan,"And, there's nothing there."
Susan,"Well, actually, I do, yeah. Excuse me!"
Susan,"Mike, guess what? I love you!"
Susan,Yes!
Susan,Did I come at a bad time?
Susan,"Well, I just called to say hi, and I love you!"
Susan,How creepy is Mrs. Huber's sister!
Susan,I absolutely did not do that thing you accused me of.
Susan,"Hello, anybody home?"
Susan,"Good news. I finished my book, so I thought to celebrate, you could take me out to lunch."
Susan,"Well, if anyone can go the distance, he can. I should know."
Susan,You did? What'd you talk about?
Susan,"I'm just, you know, busy. Stuff."
Susan,Hi. Mrs. Mayer. I saw you from across the street. I thought you might need a hand.
Susan,"I, I'm sorry for what happened. It must be really hard, not knowing who did it, or why. You must feel helpless."
Susan,Journals?
Susan,"Oh. So, she must have written a lot of things in them?"
Susan,"That's smart, that, that's good."
Susan,That's good to hear.
Susan,I am so screwed.
Susan,Everything about the fire and the measuring cup is gonna be in that journal. Everyone is gonna think I'm an arsonist.
Susan,"What, you think there's a chance Mrs. Huber didn't write about it in the journal?"
Susan,Are you high? Edie hates me.
Susan,"Hey, Edie!"
Susan,"Boy, I gotta say, I envy you."
Susan,"Well, you get to build your dream house, for free. I mean, in a weird way, your house burning down was really a good thing."
Susan,"Okay, here's the deal, Edie. I, I -"
Susan,"I just wanted to see how you were holding up. You know, with Mrs. Huber and everything."
Susan,"I'll go with you, Edie."
Susan,My junior year. How'd you know?
Susan,"Well, you know high school. Thank God we leave that behind!"
Susan,I just know Mrs. Huber's death's been hard on you. I want to help.
Susan,Why would you think I was lying?
Susan,"Okay. Look, uh, I, I just haven't always treated you well, and I want to make amends."
Susan,"You know, for what it's worth, I would have talked to you in high school."
Susan,Do you need help with the container?
Susan,"So, what are you waiting for?"
Susan,"Oh, of course, take your time."
Susan,Are you okay?
Susan,"I know, I know. Mrs. Huber was a good friend to you."
Susan,Me?
Susan,"Well, it's, it's really no, no big deal."
Susan,"Well, Edie, you're not that bad, and, and, and believe me, I'm, I'm not that good."
Susan,"Oh, please don't do this."
Susan,"Edie, I burned your house down."
Susan,"I was scared that you were sleeping with Mike, and so I let myself in, and I, I snuck around, I accidentally knocked a candle over, and the whole, just, I'm so sorry! Can you ever forgive me?"
Susan,"Edie, please talk to me."
Susan,"I've been thinking about this for the last ninety miles and you don't have to forgive me. You can go to the police, kick me, you can burn my house down. You just have to know that I am so racked with guilt, I don't think it's possible for me to suffer any more than I'm already suffering."
Susan,"Well, whatever you want to do, Edie, just know that I'm sorry."
Susan,You're not?
Susan,Thank you.
Susan,"Of course, anything. Uh, you name it! What?"
Susan,Our poker games?
Susan,"Well, we meet on Tuesdays, and it's potluck lunch. Everybody has to bring something."
Susan,"Oh, you don't have to. Well, this is good. Thank you. I guess I should go take a shower and wash Mrs. Huber off of me."
Susan,"Well, Edie, I, I have to clean up."
Susan,On my front lawn?
Susan,I don't think so.
Susan,What is going on here? Were you just kissing my daughter?
Susan,What are you thinking?
Susan,She's only fourteen!
Susan,You think?
Susan,What is he talking about? What's happening on Friday?
Susan,"Oh, no he's not."
Susan,"Don't tell me to chill, I have no intentions of chilling."
Susan,"You're not going, you're going to stay here and talk about this."
Susan,"Just so we're clear, you are not allowed to see him anymore."
Susan,Right at my kitchen table.
Susan,"Well, I'm glad you can laugh about this."
Susan,"This is easy for you. You're the father of the boy. I'm the mother of the girl. You know, if things get out of hand--"
Susan,"Well, I want to know that I am not the only one who is worried about this, and I want to know that if the two of them are over here, that they are going to be supervised, and I really want you to stop looking at me like I'm crazy."
Susan,Really!
Susan,So you're moving! We're all going to miss you.
Susan,Mrs. Van de Kamp needed volunteers. She begged me.
Susan,"Anyway, you won't even know I'm there."
Susan,"Well, not too much. Julie, you know you can tell me anything, right?"
Susan,"So if you had a problem, or some sort of secret was weighing on you--"
Susan,What's Paul doing here?
Susan,Really?
Susan,"Well, the other day he could have cared less about Julie and Zach dating, and now, all of a sudden, he shows up at the dance?"
Susan,Maybe.
Susan,Paul.
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,I'd love to.
Susan,I have a little confession to make.
Susan,I've been so concerned about Julie lately that I sort of eavesdropped on her the other day when she was having a phone conversation with Zach.
Susan,They were having a very interesting conversation.
Susan,Zach was telling Julie about what happened to Dana.
Susan,Yes.
Susan,Everything.
Susan,"Oh, of course. I assumed as much."
Susan,"No, of course he didn't. So, what happened exactly?"
Susan,"Paul, I am so sorry."
Susan,So you and Mary Alice just kept this to yourselves all these years?
Susan,Sure.
Susan,She's in the shower.
Susan,What's that?
Susan,What?
Susan,"Okay. Wow, uh, wow. You know, uh, can you sit down? I need, uh to talk to you."
Susan,Really.
Susan,"Zach, um, Julie is only fourteen years old, and sometimes girls, when they're that age they just don't always make the right decisions. And, um, as her mother, it is my responsibiliity to protect her."
Susan,"No, I, I just, I think that you should slow things down. I, I, I want you to not see her for awhile."
Susan,No?
Susan,Zach was telling Julie about what happened to Dana.
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,"Well, whatever it was, that boy is seriously disturbed, and I've forbidden Julie from hanging out with him."
Susan,I wish I could. I still feel like something's not right.
Susan,"Well, we've all been in their house. Have you ever seen a picture of another kid there? I mean, why keep Dana's baby blanket and throw out all the photos?"
Susan,We've never answered why Mary Alice referred to herself as Angela in that therapy session.
Susan,Ooh. Valentine's Day card. It's pretty.
Susan,And meticulously hand painted. Whoever sent you that must really love you.
Susan,#NAME?
Susan,So we still on for tomorrow night?
Susan,Ooh. That place is so pretentious. I've been dying to go there.
Susan,"Oh, poor Lynette. She doesn't get a new nanny soon, she's gonna implode."
Susan,Pretty impressive.
Susan,Mike wants babies.
Susan,"He wants to have kids, and he had that look that men get that says 'I'm ready to procreate, point me to the nearest cervix'."
Susan,"Oh, I can't have another baby. I mean I'm so grateful I had you, you know I don't regret a minute of that, but I found it to be completely overwhelming. Sometimes I even wonder how I got through it."
Susan,"Oh, I can't tell him. This could be a deal breaker. Julie, I really love him. I don't want to lose him."
Susan,What if he doesn't?
Susan,Are you okay?
Susan,"Oh, um, so can I come over? I, I really need to talk to you about something."
Susan,"It's kind of important, um, yeah I guess it can wait. So I'll see you at seven?"
Susan,"Oh yeah, this dress is just riding up as it is. If I walk any faster it'll be happy Valentine's Day for everyone."
Susan,Thank you.
Susan,I am so sorry! Is everyone okay?
Susan,Don't even think about it.
Susan,"Oh, that's so wonderful what you wrote, thank you. Okay, I'm not gonna be any kind of company until I get something off my chest. Do you remember the other day when you said that you wanted to have kids?"
Susan,"Here's the thing, I don't think I'm ready to have another baby. I think we need to have a serious conversation."
Susan,"I mean, I understand why you would want to have kids, but that chapter of my life is just closed. I don't think I can go back there. And so, you know, given the way I feel and given the way I think you feel--"
Susan,"Oh god, you're not taking this well. Oh I was afraid of this."
Susan,What?
Susan,What?
Susan,I don't believe this. You're leaving without even trying to talk me into having your baby? I mean how do you know I wouldn't cave. I always cave.
Susan,Mike?!
Susan,"Oh, okay. Thanks."
Susan,"Ah, please. I'm just glad you're okay. So, you shot yourself?"
Susan,"Well, I could see why you would be."
Susan,We don't have to talk about that now.
Susan,Yeah. I'm gonna go outside and let you rest for a while.
Susan,"Hey, Lynette."
Susan,What's wrong?
Susan,I'm so sorry.
Susan,So?
Susan,"What, what does this mean?"
Susan,You shot yourself?
Susan,Get out.
Susan,Is that blood?
Susan,"He was embarrassed. He said it was an accident. Oh, don't look at me like that. Accidents happen."
Susan,"Now, did he? We don't know that for sure. All we know is that Lynette's kids turned up with it."
Susan,"I'm saying that is about as likely as Mike having done it. He's a good guy. I know him. I mean, he's, he's Mike."
Susan,"Okay, call."
Susan,Will you just call?
Susan,"Don't be silly. Why would I do that? No, I've just been really busy grocery shopping."
Susan,"Uh, dinner, tonight?"
Susan,Can you hold these a sec?
Susan,I said no.
Susan,"You can see boys in a couple years, just not that boy."
Susan,I don't hate Zach. I just think he's sort of crazy.
Susan,"Well, I'm adorable crazy, and he's rampage crazy."
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,Is the seventh important?
Susan,What day was that?
Susan,"Oh. Oh, my God, yes. Yes, yes, I was with Mike that night."
Susan,"Yes, I was. It was a big night for us, relationship-wise. It was the first time that we--"
Susan,Julie!
Susan,How did you know?
Susan,"Oh, don't write that down. Oh, but this is good. You can let Mike go. He's innocent."
Susan,"Mike! Mike, are you okay?"
Susan,"No, not really, no. So guess what? I'm your alibi. I told the police that we were together the night that Mrs. Huber was killed and that I could never forget that night."
Susan,"No, no, of course not. I could never think you killed anybody, even I wasn't your alibi, which I am."
Susan,Sure. When?
Susan,Okay.
Susan,Hi.
Susan,"Now? Well, I'm, I'm sorry, my daughter and I were going to go see a movie tonight."
Susan,"Uh, let me get my purse."
Susan,Are you sure?
Susan,I'm sure I won't be late. Bye.
Susan,"Um, am I supposed to talk into the camera?"
Susan,"Okay. Uh, yes. He came over around ten o'clock."
Susan,No.
Susan,"Yes, on Valentine's Day."
Susan,"He dropped his gun, cleaning it."
Susan,"Well, I wouldn't know about that."
Susan,No.
Susan,The stomach.
Susan,What? What does that have to do with -
Susan,"No, he didn't. He was with me and Mike wouldn't kill anybody. I'm sure of that."
Susan,"Oh, God, you scared me."
Susan,"It went just peachy, and humiliating, and shocking."
Susan,"How could you? God, 'Susan, do you trust me?' Yes, of course I do. Oh, I'm such an idiot, and you're such a liar. Oh, and apparently a killer, and a drug dealer. That's just quite a personal ad you've got going there."
Susan,"Stop! Stop Mike, just stop. If you keep talking, you're gonna work your way into my heart and I just don't want you anywhere near my heart. Ever."
Susan,Julie? Mommy needs a hug. Julie?
Susan,Is Julie in there? Julie Mayer?
Susan,Julie Alexandra Mayer!
Susan,"Oh, Julie, Zach, this is ridiculous. You can't hold your breath forever."
Susan,"Oh, you might as well just stay under there and never come up for air because when you do, I'm gonna choke the living daylights out of you."
Susan,"Oh, um, is my daughter under there?"
Susan,Oh.
Susan,"Oh, I, okay, I'm, I'm sorry. Uh, I'll just, I'm just gonna leave those right there."
Susan,"Oh! I'm fine, it's good, you just, you know, uh, did, did you see - no! Oh, good bye!"
Susan,"I'm such an idiot! And you're such a liar! Oh, and apparently a killer!"
Susan,Hi.
Susan,"No, no, no. Now, I know how much you were looking forward to this weekend with your dad. I'm fine."
Susan,Well--I'm a little sad. Mike and I were just a fling. And not even a full fling. Sort of a borderline fling.
Susan,"Well, I also loved junk food, and I gave that up, and I survived."
Susan,There's your father. Go have fun.
Susan,I'm sure. Now go.
Susan,Who is it?
Susan,"Oh, Edie, not now. I'm kind of busy."
Susan,Or just come on in.
Susan,"I decided that my life is way too complicated, and so I'm simplifying. I am getting rid of the clutter."
Susan,"I was on vacation. Made sense at the time. Okay, not to be rude, but is there a reason you're here?"
Susan,Doesn't matter anymore.
Susan,I got to learn to keep my doors locked.
Susan,"I don't know. Five minutes, give or take three hours."
Susan,Why?
Susan,Why would I go anywhere with you?
Susan,Wow.
Susan,Why do you even care?
Susan,Okay. All right. Give me a minute. I'll go change my clothes.
Susan,Not my type.
Susan,"I hate 'em all. Look at them just leering at us. They're so damn cocky, like they know they have the upper hand."
Susan,"Maybe fifteen years ago. Not anymore. Now we're just lonely and desperate, and they know it, and they just sit there, ready to pounce, waiting for us to take any crumb they're willing to throw our way. I don't want crumbs. I want Mike."
Susan,I'm sorry. It's just so hard to find a guy like Mike. I know in my heart he didn't kill Mrs. Huber.
Susan,"I don't know. Obviously, a bad guy. Somebody really awful, somebody like -- somebody like Paul Young."
Susan,"I'm telling you, he's hiding something. He clams up every time we try to ask him about Mary Alice. And then when we found out about Dana--"
Susan,Paul and Mary Alice had a baby that died.
Susan,Zach killed her.
Susan,"Paul. You know, he said it was an accident,but I'm telling you, I think that's why Mary Alice was being blackmailed."
Susan,Yeah. The girls and I found a threatening note in her stuff.
Susan,I don't know.
Susan,"See? Shifting blame onto someone else -- that's classic criminal behavior. Oh, I'm telling you, he's up to no good."
Susan,"Oh, my god, yes. We should do that."
Susan,"No, Edie, this is our chance. We should just go in for ten minutes."
Susan,"Martha Huber was your best friend. If we could find out who really killed her, wouldn't that be worth the risk?"
Susan,I don't know. Just something suspicious.
Susan,"Do you believe in evil, Edie?"
Susan,I'm serious. There's something about this house that's just so cold and creepy. You couldn't tell when Mary Alice was alive. She just brought so much warmth and light. Now there's something--I can just taste it. Can't you sense it?
Susan,"No, something happened in this house, something so awful we can't even imagine it."
Susan,Are you okay?
Susan,"Oh, my god -- Angela."
Susan,Angela -- that's what Mary Alice used to call herself.
Susan,"We heard it on this tape that Bree stole from her therapist's office. It's a long story. I'll tell you later. Oh, we got to put this in."
Susan,What was that?
Susan,You said he was going to be gone.
Susan,I've got to get the tape.
Susan,Oh! Oh! Oh!
Susan,"Mike, it's not a good time. I'm a little drunk and a little freaked out."
Susan,We're broken up. I thought I made that pretty clear.
Susan,You lied to me.
Susan,The police showed me your rap sheet. You killed a man.
Susan,"No, of course I don't believe that, but I also didn't believe that Karl was going to cheat on me, and I didn't believe that Mary Alice was gonna kill herself. I mean, let's face it, Mike -- blind faith is not my friend."
Susan,"See? Now that's a lie, too, because there were plenty of right moments."
Susan,"Every time we went out for pizza, you could have said, ""oh, and by the way, I once killed a man."" Or when you said, ""hey, let's go jogging,"" you could have said, ""well, by the way, I once killed a man."" Every time we went to the movies and the hero shot the bad guy, you could have turned to me and said, ""oh, and by the way, I did that once."" You didn't."
Susan,"It doesn't matter, because I will never believe anything you say ever again."
Susan,The police showed me your rap sheet!You killed the man!
Susan,"It doesn't matter, because I will never believe anything you say,ever again."
Susan,I know.
Susan,Shut up.
Susan,That it explains everything.
Susan,I haven't read it.
Susan,I just can't.
Susan,Yes. What if it just a bunch of far-fetched stories.
Susan,"No, no, I won't. I don't trust Mike anymore. And without trust--no, no. I'm just gonna go in and rip it up and throw it in the trash."
Susan,"No, no no. That's okay, I don't wanna, you know, litter."
Susan,"Great, just great!"
Susan,I think this is yours.
Susan,I don't suppose you have any idea where I found it?
Susan,"Thanks, I will."
Susan,"All right, I promise."
Susan,Lunch?
Susan,Are you asking me out on a date?
Susan,Aren't you dating Edie?
Susan,Oh.
Susan,"Yeah. I just got out of this relationship with this guy, Mike, and it's kind of complicated. Anyway, I'm just not even sure where I am right now emotionally, I'm just all jumbled up and I don't think I could leap right into something new, relationship wise, you know, at the moment."
Susan,Sorry.
Susan,I do. I really do.
Susan,"Oh, Edie. Wait up, I, I want to ask you something."
Susan,I was just wondering how you'd feel if I went out with Bill.
Susan,Um. Bill asked me out.
Susan,"Well, see that's the thing, he doesn't think of himself as ""your Bill"" cause he said that date was just a one time thing. Which I know because when he asked me out, I told him I thought you guys were involved."
Susan,"No. No, I wanted to check with you first."
Susan,"So, can I?"
Susan,"Edie! Edie, why can't I go out with him?"
Susan,"Come on, that's a really 3rd-grade thing to say."
Susan,"Well, you know, technically, I don't need your permission!"
Susan,Edie.
Susan,He just wants to buy me a burrito.
Susan,"Okay, I won't go out with him. I mean obviously you have feeling for him."
Susan,"So what then? If you can't have him, nobody can?"
Susan,"I can't believe Edie. She doesn't have dibs on every man on the planet. If I want to go out with Bill, I should be able to."
Susan,"Well, neither is she. And if she's not into him, why can't I not be into him."
Susan,Hey!
Susan,"Thank you. I know, I'm going to. It's on the top of my list."
Susan,Would you like a glass of water and maybe an excuse to come in and talk to me?
Susan,"Bill, um, I have my reasons."
Susan,"Oh, God, no. No! You are just so incredibly not hideous."
Susan,"See now. Maybe it's the word ""date"" that's throwing me off."
Susan,"Okay, I'll go out with you."
Susan,"I mean, one minute we're making out in his truck and the next thing I know, we're at the hospital and the doctor's digging a bullet out of him. It's just that when I started dating Mike, he seemed like such a normal guy, you know?"
Susan,"I mean obviously I am not going to read the letter. At some point you just gotta let it go, right?"
Susan,I don't mean to be babbling. It's just really complicated and there is so much about Mike you don't even know.
Susan,You tracked us down?
Susan,"No, we didn't. You know I just said what you wanted to hear because you guilted me into it."
Susan,Edie!
Susan,"Well, excuse me, but that, that kinda makes it sound like it was my fault. You can't possibly blame me. I'm not the one who fired you."
Susan,"You know, this is between you and Edie. I just got sucked into the drama."
Susan,What does that mean?
Susan,That's not true!
Susan,"Well, no, he didn't."
Susan,"Okay, Mr. let's-just-have-fun-cause-I'm-the-charming-casual-contractor-man. You chased me, so own it, my friend!"
Susan,I was meaning to. I guess I do invite the drama in. Just a little.
Susan,Now that is just perfect. Stay put.
Susan,Hey mom.
Susan,What happened?
Susan,"Mom, Mike and I aren't together anymore."
Susan,"Yeah, you really did. So let's go call the insurance company."
Susan,Okay.
Susan,Let's go.
Susan,Mom!
Susan,Let's go inside and call the insurance company.
Susan,And then the police showed me his mug shots.
Susan,Yes! Mike served time for selling drugs and manslaughter
Susan,"Well, it's true."
Susan,I know.
Susan,I think I would have given up entirely if it weren't for you and Morty.
Susan,"Yeah, you know, it's the third time around for both of you, and you're really clicking. It gives me hope."
Susan,What's wrong?
Susan,You're not tired. You took a nap. What is it?
Susan,What? Why?
Susan,Morty? No!!
Susan,Why would he shove you?
Susan,"Oh, you can't be serious? Morty?"
Susan,"Alright, maybe you just feel that way because every year you get older and older."
Susan,I'm sorry.
Susan,I said I was sorry.
Susan,"Well, that's because you tell people that."
Susan,"Okay, look; I'm just saying I don't think Morty cheated on you."
Susan,"Alright, alright."
Susan,"Oh, come on!"
Susan,I mean-He shouldn't have done that.
Susan,Ante up.
Susan,The rules are simple. We play for cash. The dealer picks the game and unsubstantiated gossip is encouraged.
Susan,"Wow, I'm just dragging today, shall we put on another pot of coffee?"
Susan,Okay girls.
Susan,Lynette!
Susan,Usually poker is more fun than this.
Susan,"My pleasure. So I was thinking maybe you should call Morty- You know, get a start working things out."
Susan,"Oh oh oh. You don't have to gasp, my mother exaggerates."
Susan,"Okay, can we focus? What I want to know is have you thought about what's going to happy if you don't go back to Morty?"
Susan,"Well, you don't have a place to live. You don't like to work. I mean, you didn't want to marry Morty, so he doesn't have to pay you alimony. I- I- it's just if you don't go back to this man who allegedly shoved you once in five years, what are your options?"
Susan,What?
Susan,Are you alright?
Susan,"Oh, I'm so sorry. Here lean your head back."
Susan,"No, no it's just banged a little."
Susan,"Mom, can we talk about this later?"
Susan,"No, it's just a nose bleed, she's fine."
Susan,It's not that I'm not excited?
Susan,That's not true.
Susan,"Mom, don't go. Mom, come back. I need to. We're good, right?"
Susan,"Hey, Millie, hi, Morty."
Susan,Mom. I brought her over.
Susan,She said she won't come in until you go out and apologise to her.
Susan,For shoving her.
Susan,Why was she hitting you?
Susan,Morty!
Susan,"Well, even so!"
Susan,"That's okay, that's okay."
Susan,"Yeah, I understand. So could you, uh, just go out and apologise?"
Susan,Why?
Susan,Morty!
Susan,"Yeah, I sympathise, I really do. But you have to take her back."
Susan,Because she wants to move in with me.
Susan,"Morty, I'd like to have a relationship again. And at my age, with a kid, if she moves in to my house, even for a couple of years, I'm doomed."
Susan,"I am - I mean, I was. It didn't work out."
Susan,"If she moves in she will burn up all my oxygen and I need it. Please can't you give her another chance? You guys are really good together, you know, when-when-when there's no violence."
Susan,Absolutely.
Susan,"You don't have to sell me. Go, just go talk to her. Now."
Susan,**Sigh**
Susan,"I just keep thinking it's coming, Millie, and I can't stop it."
Susan,The day my mother will need to come and live with me and I won't have a choice.
Susan,"I know it's years away. She's youthful and vibrant, thank god. But time flies and one day she won't be able to take care of herself and I'll have to step up."
Susan,"I think it's natures little joke, that children ultimately end up parenting their parents."
Susan,What are you doing?!
Susan,"Oh, for Pete's sake."
Susan,Mom. Mom.
Susan,The kids are waiting.
Susan,"Mom, would you please not flirt with the ice cream man."
Susan,Do you need a reason beyond the fact he's the ice cream man?
Susan,You just broke up with Morty two weeks ago. Don't you think you could at least pretend to mourn the relationship.
Susan,Mom!
Susan,Argh!
Susan,"Oh uh, that's okay. I just didn't expect to see anyone up at a quarter of one."
Susan,"Um, mom. Could I just talk to you in the family room for a minute?"
Susan,"Alright, we get it. She looks young."
Susan,What are you doing? I have a teenage daughter in the house! You cannot just bring strange men you meet in bars back here in the middle of the night!
Susan,"Look, I know you're trying to get over Morty, but this is not the way to do it.So can you please just go out there and tell him to go home?"
Susan,I've been plenty supportive.
Susan,I have not been furious with you.
Susan,"Mom, I don't hate you."
Susan,What?
Susan,Forget it.
Susan,"Mom, I'm sorry. I'm just not in the mood to hang out these days."
Susan,"Of course you can, just call them up and tell them not to come over."
Susan,Tim!
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,"Yeah, it can be rewarding."
Susan,No.
Susan,"Mother, don't you think it's getting a little late?"
Susan,"Agh! The perfect capper to the perfect evening, so good night, it's been lovely. And Lamont, good luck with all your inventions."
Susan,"Mom! Hold it! you are not getting in a car with those two, you hardly know them."
Susan,You've been married four times.
Susan,Mother!
Susan,"Oh, I'm embarrassing you."
Susan,And your idea of helping is to let Tim just grope you?!
Susan,"Tim, can you just stay out of this?"
Susan,"Let's go back inside?! Lamont, give it up, you're not getting any!"
Susan,Will you stop acting like tonight was all about helping me? You wanted to go out and have fun and Lamont needed a date.
Susan,Yes! It is!
Susan,"Yeah, I do and that's what makes me so crazy. The difference between you and I, that you could be heartbroken and you can just move on and I am just broken."
Susan,"No, mom, I'm not sad. And I'm not crabby. I'm devastated. And you keep acting like all I need is a couple of aspirin. Morty was just one guy in a series of guys for you. And Mike? He was the one. Why don't you get that?"
Susan,What was that?
Susan,"You're so cute, yeah."
Susan,Oh! Oh! How did you get down there? That's not funny.
Susan,I am so sorry. How did I forget you?
Susan,"Julie, what is Zach doing out there? I thought I told you not to speak to him anymore?"
Susan,I'm going to handle this once and for all.
Susan,Zach! What do you think you are?Argh! argh!
Susan,Ow ow.
Susan,How? Are you going to give me your corneas?
Susan,"Well, you just threw rocks in her mother's face. How's that for a start?"
Susan,You're welcome.
Susan,Thanks.
Susan,I'll talk to you girls later.
Susan,"No, no. What do you want?"
Susan,Who told you that?
Susan,"Well, yeah, we did. We were just looking. It doesn't matter, it was dumb."
Susan,"Well, I was planning on doing that anyway."
Susan,"Mike, I know why I was planning to stay away from him, but why do you want me to stay away from him?"
Susan,I won't . I promise.
Susan,You didn't have to do that.
Susan,"Yeah, well, that's not going to happen."
Susan,"Aside from you nearly blinding me. Several weeks ago you freaked out in my house: you screamed, you threw furniture around."
Susan,For Julie's sake?
Susan,"Zach, Julie does not think of you as her boyfriend. In fact I don't think she wants anything to do with you."
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,Believe whatever you want.
Susan,Uh!
Susan,"Paul, hi."
Susan,Huh?
Susan,That's it? That's the explanation?
Susan,She changed her name because of her aunt? That just doesn't seem like something Mary Alice would do.
Susan,"No. I'm good, thanks."
Susan,"Although if you wouldn't mind, I'm really like to see that video tape I found, the one marked ""Angela"". It'd be nice to see Mary Alice when she was young."
Susan,Alright then.
Susan,I couldn't agree more.
Susan,Are you okay?
Susan,Are you okay?
Susan,I'm so sorry.
Susan,But you know what they say about kids: that you can't imagine having them until you do and then you can't imagine life without them? It's true.
Susan,All I'm saying is that maybe this is a blessing in disguise.
Susan,What?
Susan,So you mean you and John have still been?
Susan,Gabby!
Susan,"Oh my god! Oh my god, that's my house!"
Susan,Yes! That's my house!
Susan,"Oh oh oh, my, look! my kitchen! Oh, it's a big fire!"
Susan,"That's not possible, we don't burn candles during the day."
Susan,"Don't worry, we will be."
Susan,Window.
Susan,Do you think you can help me?
Susan,Morty? What are you doing?
Susan,Now?! Are you drunk?
Susan,Are you crazy? It's one o'clock in the morning. She's sleeping.
Susan,What?
Susan,"Ah, Morty. I just don't think it's going to happen. She's moved on. Why don't you sit down, I'll call you a cab."
Susan,You gave her your dead wife's ring?
Susan,Really???!!!!
Susan,Us too. The house will seem just empty without you
Susan,Oh no. No no no. They want to get their new life together started. We don't want to hold these two crazy kids back.
Susan,"Bye, Morty."
Susan,"She did, huh?"
Susan,Did she tell you that he served time in prison for manslaughter?
Susan,I don't suppose she told you he was a drug dealer?
Susan,Mother!
Susan,What? What were you thinking?
Susan,"Yeah, what did he say?"
Susan,"Oh god, really?"
Susan,What about Dana?
Susan,It was all true. Everything he said. How could I have been so wrong?
Susan,"Oh, of course."
Susan,"Actually, before you go I need you to check into someone else's background. There's this plumber I know?"
Susan,"I can't trust Mike, and I wanted to find out what really happened. From a source that doesn't have an agenda. Now open it up."
Susan,Go.
Susan,Stop.
Susan,"If you find out something that's really bad, just try and put a positive spin on it."
Susan,Give me the bad news first.
Susan,Oh my god! Oh my god!
Susan,"Okay, give me the good news."
Susan,What?
Susan,"Oh, forget it. Just let me look at it myself."
Susan,I don't believe it.
Susan,I know her.
Susan,"Oh, hi. I'm looking for Kendra Taylor-"
Susan,"Oh, oh, you don't understand. I can't just drive away."
Susan,"Look, um Bob, let me try to explain."
Susan,You see the thing is. This is probably the last chance for me to find out if I can be with the man I love.
Susan,"And Bob , I can't even begin to tell you how much that means to me. So, I'm going to walk up to that house, and you're going to let me. And you know why? Because behind that badge and that big, you could crush me like a fly, chest, there's a heart. A heart that believes in love."
Susan,"It's not my fault, you don't have love in your heart."
Susan,"Hi, Kendra."
Susan,"And despite the evidence, despite all that's been laid out in front of me, I can't help feeling that there's more to the story. Does that sound stupid?"
Susan,But Mike's lawyer pleaded self defence and if that's the case-
Susan,Right. I appreciate you talking to me.
Susan,What?
Susan,It was self defence.
Susan,I knew he was good. I just knew it.
Susan,Thank you.
Susan,"Um, um-She, she-I uh."
Susan,I need you to check into someone else's background.There is this plumber I know.
Susan,"Hey there, Edie."
Susan,Mike and I got back together.
Susan,I knew you'd be happy for us. So what's going on?
Susan,"How sweet, thanks. Why don't you go put these on a plate? Oh, and save me one with sprinkles."
Susan,I cannot believe you are still coming onto him.
Susan,And that was your cue to come over and flirt? You wasted your time and your doughnuts.
Susan,"You know, I'm gonna run home and get some milk to go with those doughnuts."
Susan,"Well, I can't have doughnuts and juice. It's unnatural."
Susan,"Um, I say, oh! Hold that thought. Edie, Edie stop! Stop! Hang on."
Susan,"Oh, I was just rude back there gloating and everything and I apologize."
Susan,"And on a completely unrelated topic, Mike and I are moving in together. See ya."
Susan,We need to talk.
Susan,"When I was packing up your stuff in your bedroom, I found a box of bullets."
Susan,"Look, I feel really bad about Deirdre, and I know that you must want to find out who killed her, but if we're gonna move in together, we can't have this stuff hanging over us. You've gotta get rid of it. All of it: the file, the map, the gun, especially the gun and leave this to the police. They're the professionals."
Susan,"Oh. Really? Well ,that was easy. Maybe after lunch we can talk about your leather bean bag chair."
Susan,"Bonjour. Oh, hi, I didn't know that the cooking lesson was gonna be a group activity. Well, the more the merrier, right? As long as nobody makes fun of my lousy crepes. How come I'm the only one wearing the apron?"
Susan,"I appreciate what you guys are trying to do, I really do. Um, I'm not gonna change my mind. In my life, I've been hurt a lot, Karl, and uh, well, it's just taught me to be cynical, and to expect the absolute worst from people, and I don't want to live like that anymore, and when Mike asked me to move in with him, I was just happy, just ridiculously happy. I mean, I still am and I want to go with that feeling. I love him and I love him! So I'm gonna expect the best from Mike, and I know that he is gonna deliver that in return. Okay?"
Susan,"So, what do you think we should do for dinner?"
Susan,"Okay, I'll keep it warm for you."
Susan,I wasn't talking about dinner.
Susan,"No, no, I got it. Um, I got it. So, if you've got a plumbing emergency, shouldn't you get going?"
Susan,"Well, I'll just get back to work."
Susan,"Well, that's before I found Mrs. Huber's journal in his truck."
Susan,"It's not about what's in it, it's about the fact that he had it at all. I would bet you anything he is not going on a plumbing job and we're gonna find out."
Susan,"I don't have time to explain adult relationships to you. Oh, duck down."
Susan,He's six cars up. We have to stay this far back or he'll see us.
Susan,Oh yeah? When your father was cheating on me I used to follow him all the time. I know my stuff. There he is.
Susan,"I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Wait here and lock the doors."
Susan,"All right, what the hell are you up to?"
Susan,"Oh my god, wow, um, okay oh, wow um, bye."
Susan,"No, no, it wasn't."
Susan,"Okay, next time I won't bring my daughter to stalk my boyfriend. It was a slight error in judgment. Honey, please don't give me the silent treatment."
Susan,"Yeah, part of it. Why?"
Susan,"Gabby, the woman killed herself.Something must have been going on."
Susan,"Oh, Mary Alice, what did you do?"
Susan,Hello?
Susan,Bree.
Susan,We heard Rex had a heart attack. How is he?
Susan,I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.
Susan,"Oh, I know. Uh, I found Mrs. Huber's journal in some of Mike's stuff, and I think she knew Mary Alice's secret and was blackmailing her."
Susan,"Mike, Hi, sweetie. I hope the job's going well. Um, so I hope you're not mad, but I found Mrs. Huber's journal in your truck, and, well, I couldn't exactly not read it, so I did, and, um, I know all about the blackmail, so call me. We'll talk. Love you. Bye."
Susan,"I haven't heard back, and I was getting a little concerned. The girls and I were talking, and, we think that maybe Paul Young killed Mrs. Huber, and if he did, then maybe he killed your old girlfriend, too, so we should really talk about this, so call me. I love you. Bye."
Susan,"I thought the whole point of having a cell phone was so someone could reach you when they needed to talk. How can we move forward as a couple if you won't communicate with me? Mike, I need you to call me back! I mean it! Love you. Bye."
Susan,"I am so sorry for that last phone call. Um, let's just say it was the worry talking. I just really need to talk to you, and-"
Susan,Can you hang on? I got another call. Hello?
Susan,"Oh, my God. Where have you been?"
Susan,"Well, I'm really sorry for that last message. I was just, uh--"
Susan,"Yes. Let's call it stressed out. Uh, so how did you get Martha Huber's journal?"
Susan,I just really think we need to give it to the police.
Susan,Really?
Susan,Great. That's great.
Susan,"Okay. Hurry, though. I just have a feeling that Paul Young is in the middle of all of this."
Susan,"Oh, thanks. I'll go do that now."
Susan,It's funny you should mention sin. I think adultery still falls in that category.
Susan,He's a good person.
Susan,You heard the girl.
Susan,"Now, you be a good boy, Bongo, or you're gonna go to bed hungry."
Susan,I'm just gonna go get some water.
Susan,"Edie, what a pleasant surprise."
Susan,"Uh, no, he's on a big plumbing job. What's up?"
Susan,Why?
Susan,She was?
Susan,Just get the hell out of here.
Susan,Why?
Susan,What'd she say?
Susan,"Can I at least get you something to eat, Zach?"
Susan,"I gotta say, I think you're making a mistake. Mike couldn't kill anybody. I mean, this could just be a misunderstanding."
Susan,"Listen, I know you're upset, but is this really what you think your mother would want you doing?"
Susan,Exactly. Because she raised you right. Look you have been through a lot. you've lost your mom. you're still carrying around the guilt over what happened to your baby sister.
Susan,"Honey, I know about Dana."
Susan,"Look, Zach. I know you're upset. Let's just, let's just sit down and talk."
Susan,No!
Susan,"Not so tough now, are you?"
Susan,"Uh! Ow! Oh! Bongo, no! Bongo! Bongo! Oh!"
Susan,I look like hell. I need a hairbrush.
Susan,"Uh, and I turned around, and there was Zach Young - and that's Zach with an ""h"" - pointing a gun at me."
Susan,Ouch.
Susan,"Yeah, he's crazy!"
Susan,"Uh, hello! Uh, he was waiting there for you to come home so he could kill you."
Susan,"Okay, that's because I was wrestling it away from Zach so that he wouldn't shoot you."
Susan,"Oh, God! Oh, there's blood."
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,Thanks.
Susan,Ow! That hurts.
Susan,Okay.
Susan,I thought they were gonna operate. What happened?
Susan,"Oh, my god. So when can we see Bree?"
Susan,"Honey, you can let it out."
Susan,Why?
Susan,Is that?
Susan,"We're not. It's a deterrent in case Zach comes back. I told Mike I didn't sleep last night, so he got me this sign. That guy is so supportive. You know he's out right now in a ride-along with the police searching for Zach?"
Susan,"Yeah. He's determined to see that kid behind bars. So tomorrow at school, I want you to let everybody know that we got this new, expensive security system."
Susan,"Just work it into the conversation. You know, put the word out there."
Susan,Emphasize the motion detectors.
Susan,What? What is it?
Susan,My fault?
Susan,Fine. Is Mike here?
Susan,No.
Susan,No.
Susan,It wasn't like that.
Susan,Edie!
Susan,Good. There's a rumor going around that you don't wanna press charges against Zach. Is that true?
Susan,"Wow. Um, I find that confusing."
Susan,"He held a gun to my face, so I'm thinking, good."
Susan,Who cares?
Susan,"Well, you should care more about me. I'm your girlfriend. We're moving in together. He's just a neighbor. You don't even know Zach."
Susan,"Mike, he wanted to kill you."
Susan,You never asked me why Zach wanted to shoot you. Aren't you curious?
Susan,Zach said you kidnapped his father so you could kill him.
Susan,I didn't think you did. Now tell me why Zach does.
Susan,So Paul killed her?
Susan,"Oh, my God."
Susan,That's not Zach.
Susan,He had a gun in my face for six hours. I know what he looks like.
Susan,Can you give us a minute?
Susan,"Zach is your son, isn't he?"
Susan,How long have you known?
Susan,I see.
Susan,"Wow. I'm gonna take a cab home, okay?"
Susan,"So it occurred to me that I was really rude at the morgue. When you told me about Zach, I was so busy freaking out, I never actually congratulated you."
Susan,"I know how much you've always wanted a child, and now you have one."
Susan,"Obviously, um, it was quite a shock, but it's good news any way you slice it."
Susan,"So naturally you'll be wanting to have a relationship with him, and that, that takes time, a lot of time."
Susan,"And out of all the mixed-up teenagers in the world, Zach is just the one kid that I can't be around. I can't have Julie around him. So, um, what I'm trying to say is--"
Susan,"But I am so happy for you. Really, you have a child, and that is good for you."
Susan,"No. No, I'm so sorry. I'll, I'll, um, I'll see you around."
Susan,So it looks like Mary Alice killed Zach's birth mother in order to keep her from taking Zach away.
Susan,"No, not really. I mean, what do we actually know about our neighbors? I mean, we can tell if they keep their lawns nice or they take their trash cans in, but when they do those things, we stop asking questions 'cause if people are good neighbors--"
Susan,You want me back?
Susan,"Zach is your son,isn't he?"
Susan,Wow.
Susan,"Hey! Karl, I see you. Just stop right there!"
Susan,What are you doing?
Susan,"That's Edie's paper, and this is Edie's house!"
Susan,"Did you spend the night with Edie? Oh, my god!"
Susan,You are forbidden from ever seeing her again. Do you hear me? Forbidden!
Susan,I live on this street. Your daughter lives on this street. I will not have you flaunting your sexcapades in front of us.
Susan,Forbidden!
Susan,"Well, I just bet she is!"
Susan,"Oh, now is not a good time, Danny."
Susan,"I'll take care of it, I promise."
Susan,"Hi, Ida."" ""Can we talk about this later? I just found out my ex is dating my neighbor, and I'm really ticked off."
Susan,"What do you mean, you know?"
Susan,"What are you saying, that your father actually told you he was gonna be having a one night stand with Edie Britt?"
Susan,What? How could you not tell me that? We share everything. That's what we're known for. That's our thing.
Susan,"Oh, I've never applied that concept to your father's sex life and you know it."
Susan,"No! I have not even begun ripping into Edie Britt yet. Oh, that peroxide vulture! I just know as sure as I am standing here that she went after your father just to tick me off."
Susan,What?
Susan,You lie.
Susan,The one at the piano bar?
Susan,"Oh, um, your father just came over that day and told me some stuff. You know, some stuff that I haven't and can't tell you."
Susan,"Um, actually, I think what we're known for is sharing clothes. Yeah. I think that's our thing."
Susan,"Yeah, I know. Come on in."
Susan,"Oh, it's fine. They're in the garage."
Susan,So how have you been doing?
Susan,"Sure, what is it?"
Susan,Where are we?
Susan,"I don't know. Since the guy who held me hostage turned out to be your son, I think logic dictates that I should move on. The problem is, I'm crazy about you."
Susan,"So, I'm thinking we should keep it casual."
Susan,"Uh, well, I, I don't, I don't think there's anything wrong with us seeing a movie once in awhile."
Susan,Jogging? There's no law against jogging.
Susan,Shopping. That's casual. That's fun.
Susan,"Mmm, brunch. Brunch would be nice."
Susan,"Uh, Betty? Betty? Oh, Betty, can I ask you a question?"
Susan,"Yes, hi. I was just wondering, are you having some remodeling done on your house or something?"
Susan,"Well, uh, I work at home, so I'm home a lot working. And I just keep hearing these noises lately. Uh, it's hard to concentrate."
Susan,"Really? Well, it sounds like it's coming from your house. You know, it's like a clanging, clanging."
Susan,"There! There, that was it. Did you hear it?"
Susan,Even at two o'clock in the morning? 'Cause that's kind of hard to miss.
Susan,"Hi, Matthew."
Susan,"Hey, Edie."
Susan,What?
Susan,"Yes, yes, I do."
Susan,"Well, etiquette is a lost art for a lot of people."
Susan,Circumstances beyond your control. I get it. So if you'll excuse me.
Susan,"Honestly, Edie, I don't mind. You can skate off into the sunset with Karl. Be my guest."
Susan,"Actually, I'm glad that you shared that, because here's a tidbit for you. Karl said he's still in love with me."
Susan,"Edie, what are you doing?"
Susan,We're in the middle of the street. Would you get out of here?
Susan,"Okay, Karl asked me to get back together the day after Julie's birthday. I said no, which I'm guessing is the reason for the now legendary tequila bra-popping incident. Please let go."
Susan,"Well, yes, we are. I'm gonna go."
Susan,"In five seconds, I'm gonna punch it."
Susan,"Not if you're sucking my exhaust, you won't."
Susan,"No, I won't!"
Susan,"Edie, for god's sake. Why would I care if you end up with a man I despise?"
Susan,"Edie, come back here! We're not finished yet!"
Susan,"It was an accident, Karl. Edie knows it was an accident, right?"
Susan,"Oh, my god. I'm so sorry. I sent roses. Did she get the roses?"
Susan,"Oh, my god."
Susan,"Well, she was gloating about sleeping with you, and I just wanted to shut her up."
Susan,"No! No! It's just, we were married. And, and she's trying to make this tawdry little affair you guys have going on par with that and it's just, I got mad."
Susan,Just give me a moment. I'm asking God to kill me.
Susan,Are you in love with her?
Susan,I want you to be happy. I even sort of want Edie to be happy.
Susan,"I wanna be happy first! Mike and I were supposed to move in together, you know? This was supposed to be my time."
Susan,I don't know. It's really complicated. So you never answered my question. Are you in love with her?
Susan,You walked out on me.
Susan,"It's Karl's weekend to have Julie, and they're always back by six. That's our custody agreement, back by six, and it's after six."
Susan,"Well, see? There you go."
Susan,"Well, I have a court order. It's out of my hands."
Susan,"Oh, I'm being nice. I could have him arrested. I mean, don't get me wrong. I am all for Julie spending time with Karl. He is still her dad, and she loves him."
Susan,"But he's with Edie. I mean, she's not exactly the maternal type. I wouldn't be a good mother if I wasn't concerned. I mean, who knows what passes for a kid-friendly, good time in there? Drugs? Porn? Smoking?"
Susan,I'm sorry. What?
Susan,"So you and Edie are, are gonna be an act."
Susan,"No. No. I mean, I'm a little surprised that you didn't ask me to accompany you first."
Susan,I play the piano. You know that.
Susan,"Well, I played in high school."
Susan,"It was the early eighties. Well, I'm not gonna argue with you. You want to do the show with Edie, and I think that's super. So she's really good, huh?"
Susan,Hmm.
Susan,"Oh, my daughter is singing a song at church and I want to accompany her on the piano and I haven't played in years. Oh, you were just so amazing at Rex's funeral the other day, I was wondering--"
Susan,"Oh. Oh, okay."
Susan,"Oh. You have a little, uh, on your--"
Susan,Thank you so much for changing your mind about helping me. I really appreciate it.
Susan,"Really? Oh, I thought it made it sound more professional."
Susan,"Boy, your son really likes to play his hip-hop music loud."
Susan,"Hi. I'm sorry to interrupt. I knocked, but I guess you guys didn't hear me."
Susan,"Well, I have good news. Um, I've been taking piano lessons with Betty Applewhite, and, uh, well, I just thought maybe I could join you guys. You know, like a trio. Doesn't that sound fun?"
Susan,"Well, I don't mean to be technical here, but this show, I mean, it really is supposed to be a family thing, and I hate to point out you're not family."
Susan,"Well, what makes you so sure I don't have talent?"
Susan,"Yeah, well, we've all seen your talent, which is a nice way of telling you why don't you put some curtains on your bedroom window?"
Susan,That is so not true!
Susan,"She did not pick you. It just didn't occur to her that I would agree to do it. Well, now she knows, and if she had it to do over again, she'd pick me."
Susan,"Well, why don't we put it to a test? Julie, who would you rather have play with you?"
Susan,"No, it's okay, honey. Who do you want to be with you in the family talent show?"
Susan,"Yep, I am. I think I'm going to make another push for using that pedal. I think it adds grandeur."
Susan,I'm busy now.
Susan,I did not kick Edie out. Julie made that call.
Susan,"Well, it is a family recital, and Edie is not family."
Susan,"Oh, don't even joke like that."
Susan,"It was not murder, it was manslaughter, and that's totally different. Mike and I aren't even living together, and he cares about Julie."
Susan,"If you think Edie Britt cares about anybody other than herself, you are living in a fool's paradise. You don't know her the way I do, and the only reason she's interested in Julie is to mess with my head."
Susan,I'm sorry you had to witness that.
Susan,"Well, I hope it wasn't as ugly as me and Karl."
Susan,"I'll be right back."" ""Oh, um, I'm just gonna need a couple of seconds, so feel free to pray."
Susan,"The other day when I saw you making music with my family, I got a little jealous and I went a little crazy and I pushed you out. Seeing you sitting here today, well, I can see how much you care about Julie, and she comes first, and it should be you up there playing with her, not me. So I'm sorry."
Susan,"Well, like I said, I'm sorry. I wish it could be you up there."
Susan,"Yeah, well, I try."
Susan,Poor Julie.
Susan,"No, not at all."
Susan,"You come within 10 feet of her,I will have you arrested.Now get out."
Susan,"Zach is your son,isn't he?"
Susan,"What, that's it?"
Susan,"Yeah, but that doesn't mean we have to act like brother and sister. I mean, you bought me ribs. I have gratitude to express."
Susan,What's wrong?
Susan,"No, no, it's not. We're just gonna pretend like it was when we first started dating. We'll just see each other occasionally. You know, until we get this Zach thing resolved. You know, we'll just be easy about it. No commitments. Except, of course, neither of us is allowed to date anybody else."
Susan,"Mike, wait!"
Susan,I accept.
Susan,"Zach's your son, and, and I have Julie and you're totally accepted her. I mean, granted, she's been the model child, so far, but she's almost fifteen. She's gonna turn on me any minute. You better be there to help me when it gets ugly."
Susan,Good night.
Susan,Yeah?
Susan,I can be naked in twenty seconds! That includes travel time.
Susan,"Oh, sorry. I'm helping Mike find Zach. You know, so we can all rest easy at night."
Susan,You know?
Susan,"Well, thanks for your discretion."
Susan,"You know, Edie, could you just back off? I mean the truth is we're probably never gonna find Zach, anyway. It's a needle in a haystack."
Susan,I'm just happy to be spending the day with you.
Susan,Okay.
Susan,"Have you seen this boy? Hey, missing kid. Anyone? Going once, going twice--"
Susan,Oh. Do you mind keeping those and pass them out when people get their ice cream?
Susan,What?
Susan,Oh. Zach. Zach!
Susan,"Whoa. No, no no. No, no no, oh. Don't, don't, don't. Don't, don't, Zach, don't run away. Wait! Come on, just, would you just get back here? Come on really, just, let's just talk."
Susan,"Damn it, Zach. It's enough already."
Susan,I got you some ice cream.
Susan,But then I got hungry.
Susan,"So then I just threw my ice cream at him and ran. Well, somebody say something."
Susan,"I should have told Mike I saw Zach. I'm a horrible person, right?"
Susan,"What do you think, Bree?"
Susan,But-
Susan,"Okay, please, please don't run."
Susan,How?
Susan,Just to talk to you.
Susan,"Because, I have a lot of things to say so you can just listen. I'll buy you some food. When was the last time you ate?"
Susan,"I don't know. He, he disappeared."
Susan,I swear.
Susan,"Zach, you know what I think? I think you should come back with me."
Susan,Because there are still people at home who care about you and there's things that you need to know.
Susan,"Well, I can't tell you. You know, you messed up a lot of people's lives. You can't run away from that."
Susan,What?
Susan,"Yeah, well, Julie's a really special girl."
Susan,Do you know what I think? I think you were right. I think you should try to find your father first.
Susan,"Yeah. Now that you know he's okay, you should go to him. He'll want to take care of you. That's what parents do. Let me help. How much money do you think you'll need to get to Utah?"
Susan,You should find your father first. Let me help.
Susan,Lonnie. What are you doing here?
Susan,I can't believe I let you talk me into this. I am so behind in my work. But I'm glad I came. This is fun.
Susan,Oh?
Susan,You're leaving Muir and Hunt? You helped build that place.
Susan,"Well, of course."
Susan,I'll just call the agency and let them know I'm going with you.
Susan,"Really? Ah, I think it might be rude not to. Lonnie, what's going on?"
Susan,Why?
Susan,You had to move money? What does that mean?
Susan,Really? 'Cause it sorta sounds like embezzlement.
Susan,Who else is using that word?
Susan,"Oh, my god. Lonnie, did you move some of my money?"
Susan,"Well, I don't hate you. I couldn't hate you. You're my Lonnie."
Susan,"You know what? This is one of those times when you find out who your real friends are, so yeah."
Susan,You must be so relieved.
Susan,Absolutely.
Susan,I told you. Lonnie wants me to sign with his new agency.
Susan,"I know. I know. It's just, Lonnie's family. You know he's always been there for me. He paid my rent when I was waiting for my first royalty check. He called me everyday when Karl left. I mean, I just owe him so much."
Susan,"Okay, who in this room has not committed a felony, raise your hand. Ah, ah, ah. Not so fast."
Susan,"Well, it's possible because I have faith in people. I mean, Lonnie knows he messed up and he's sorry. He's making restitution. What, you don't believe people deserve second chances?"
Susan,Really? So that's it with you. You just get one shot and you screw up and you're out. I didn't know you were such a cynic.
Susan,"Julie, I did something bad. Something really, really bad. Aren't you gonna ask me what it was?"
Susan,"Last week, when Mike and I went to the park searching for Zach, I sort of found him."
Susan,"Yes, and I gave him money and I sent him away and I didn't tell Mike."
Susan,I don't know. What would you do if this happened to you?
Susan,Will you stop judging and help me?
Susan,"Well, I can't do that. You heard what he said about his wiring. I betrayed him. He'll never forgive me."
Susan,"Well, how can I not? I feel so guilty, I can barely look him in the eye when he talks about Zach."
Susan,Utah. Oh lord. Why did I do this?
Susan,"Lonnie, are you here? It's Susan. Lonnie?"
Susan,"Well, I just came over to give you the contract. Your door was open."
Susan,Where's Jeannie?
Susan,There's no electricity.
Susan,"Lonnie, how much financial trouble are you really in?"
Susan,I'm gonna ask you a question and I want you to tell me the truth. Did you steal from me?
Susan,Please don't lie. Just tell me.
Susan,I'm sorry. I just can't trust you anymore.
Susan,"No, I can't."
Susan,Can't.
Susan,No!
Susan,What are you doing? Are you trying to take me down with you?
Susan,You should have just come clean.
Susan,I do.
Susan,Wow.
Susan,"Well, I'm sorry, but you have."
Susan,"You'll never lose my friendship, though. I mean that."
Susan,Of course. You're my Lonnie.
Susan,Oh! What the hell are - is wrong with you?!
Susan,Not like that!
Susan,No! There has not been and there never will be.
Susan,"Oh, my god!"
Susan,Bree! Where have you been? We were starting to get worried.
Susan,Why?
Susan,What did he do?
Susan,What?
Susan,Hi. We're just going to a funeral.
Susan,How much money do you think you need to get to Utah?
Susan,"Mom, why don't you just go see a dressmaker?"
Susan,Since when?
Susan,Mom!
Susan,You can?
Susan,"Yeah, it did."
Susan,"He's right, mom. Oh, I want it to be just like you do. You know on your own terms and you get down on one knee and the whole production."
Susan,Well. Then I can wait. I can wait. I'm a good waiter.
Susan,"I was just wondering if, if there's a ball park of how long I will have to wait. A week, a month, after lunch?"
Susan,"Right, right, I'm sorry."
Susan,Mom.
Susan,"Oh, my god. Paul."
Susan,Why--are you doing here?
Susan,"No, don't come near me."
Susan,I don't want my pie filling.
Susan,"No, stop! Put that pie filling down. Slowly. I'm calling nine-one-one."
Susan,"Oh, I think I do. You're a cold-blooded murderer."
Susan,"Oh, thank god, they're here."
Susan,"Uh, he's my boyfriend, and, and he told me that Paul confessed everything to him. Oh, and Mike has Martha's journals, which clearly prove that Paul had a motive."
Susan,"Uh, he's, follow me."
Susan,"Mike, Paul Young is back. Look."
Susan,"Mike, what are you doing?"
Susan,We need to talk.
Susan,I'm sorry. I've been waiting for you. I'm just a little upset because everybody thinks I'm crazy.
Susan,"Yes, definitely. I mean, I can understand why you wouldn't want the cops to know that you kidnapped Paul. I mean, that definitely looks bad."
Susan,"Well, right. I mean, there's that."
Susan,"Well, okay--"
Susan,"But why don't you want 'em to know about Martha Huber's journal? I mean, she says right in there that she was blackmailing Paul's wife."
Susan,"Oh. I forgot about that. I just can't believe it. I mean, there he is, a murderer, just living right on our street, and there's nothing we can do about it because you're a convicted felon and I burned down that stupid house. It's unfair."
Susan,"Well, that's comforting to know there's a silver lining."
Susan,Come in!
Susan,"Oh! Oh! Uh, uh, Paul, you, you can't just waltz into people's houses."
Susan,"Well, that's 'cause I assumed you were someone I would let in my house. What do you want?"
Susan,"No. No, I didn't. Sorry I can't help you out."
Susan,"Well, he's not here."
Susan,But he's not here. I swear.
Susan,A knife. I just want to slice some tomatoes.
Susan,"I don't know how I know this, but I, I think that he's in Utah. He, he took a bus to Bountiful. You have family there, right? Okay, I gave him the bus fare."
Susan,Why don't we both stop getting divorced? That would be a nice family tradition.
Susan,Hey!
Susan,"Oh, no, mom, stop! What is it?"
Susan,What?
Susan,"He was talking so much about Julie. I tried to get him to come home with me, I mean, to, to you, but he just kept going on and on about her, and I got scared."
Susan,Yes. Mike.
Susan,"I, I should have told you right away. I, I know that. But you know now, so can we please talk about it?"
Susan,"Mike, stop."
Susan,"No, no, no, no, no!"
Susan,"I screwed up, okay? I want to fix it! Please let me fix it! Tell me how to fix it! Mike, I love you!"
Susan,"Please, no, please, please. No, Mike! Mike!"
Susan,"No, Mike, Mike! Come back! Come back!"
Susan,"No, no, no."
Susan,You walked out on me.
Susan,"Oh, Gabby, I didn't know you got a sonogram. Let me see. Oh!"
Susan,Thanks.
Susan,"Actually, I think I'm starting to feel pretty Zen about the whole thing."
Susan,"No, I came between the man and his son. There's a huge betrayal. I, I can't even blame him for hating me."
Susan,"Over the past couple of days, I gave myself a long hard look in the mirror and I did not like what I saw."
Susan,"I just think if I start acting like an adult for once, maybe, who knows, somewhere down the line, Mike and I at least can be friends."
Susan,I'm fine. You got any pie?
Susan,I can wait.
Susan,"Hi. Okay, so I got the box on things you left on my porch."
Susan,"Thanks. That's great. 'Cause if you decided to hang on to my Joni Mitchell CDs I'd have to come after you with a club. You're right, it's not funny. Actually, I did want to see if you were aware that you gave me back the Valentine's Day card that I made you."
Susan,"Oh. Well, I mean when two people split up, normally they don't give things back like Valentine's Day cards. If, if, you can throw it away. Just please don't give it back to me, it's tacky."
Susan,That's okay. People make-
Susan,#NAME?
Susan,"Look, are you sure this is what you want to do? I mean, I understand that you don't want our relationship to continue, you have made that clear. But I sort of thought down the long corridors of time, maybe you and I could be friends, and if you keep acting like this--"
Susan,"Well, I'll say one thing for us. Even with all our problems we're not acting like that."
Susan,Who is it?
Susan,"Oh, Karl. What do you want?"
Susan,"Oh. Well, come on in."
Susan,"Oh, that's okay. Julie's staying at a friend's tonight. You can sleep in her room."
Susan,So am I allowed to ask what happened?
Susan,Why not?
Susan,"Karl, did you cheat again?"
Susan,Did she cheat?
Susan,You finally saw her without her makeup?
Susan,I'm sorry. Are you okay?
Susan,"Well, these days anybody going through a break-up gets my sympathy."
Susan,"No, I made the plumber furious. That is definitely over. So there will be no gloating from me."
Susan,"Actually, I'm trying to keep a positive outlook on the whole thing. Um, last night I started writing and, well, I think there's a book in there."
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,Nope. This one's for adults about all my failed relationships.
Susan,"You're, like, the first fourteen chapters."
Susan,I'm gonna be honest.
Susan,"Oh no, no wait, no wait, no wait. Four glasses is my limit."
Susan,Hit me.
Susan,What was it?
Susan,Why would you--?
Susan,Wow.
Susan,"Oh, that's just you rebounding from Edie."
Susan,Karl. It'd be so weird.
Susan,Oh. Julie! I thought you were going straight to school.
Susan,"Oh, uh, Julie, uh oh, Julie, uh--"
Susan,"Okay, there is a good explanation for what happened."
Susan,You probably don't know that your father and Edie broke up last night.
Susan,"Well, I said it was a good explanation, not a great one."
Susan,"Oh, Julie."
Susan,"Oh, now I feel really awful."
Susan,We should not have done what we did.
Susan,"Wasn't it, though? You were fantastic!"
Susan,Why do you think we got so good all of a sudden?
Susan,Maybe.
Susan,"Well, I'm gonna take a shower."
Susan,Us? What do you mean? There's no us.
Susan,"Karl, last night was two old friends helping each other through a rough patch. That's it."
Susan,"Karl, I want to move on. I don't want to go backwards. I'm sorry, but thank you for the explosion. I really needed it."
Susan,"Uh, the big news?"
Susan,What?
Susan,"I'm sorry, what?"
Susan,"No, Edie. I mean, this is so unexpected on so many levels. I don't know what to say."
Susan,Why are you giving it to me?
Susan,You won?
Susan,"Believe me, I don't feel superior."
Susan,You're right. He made his choice.
Susan,We all cleared our schedules. We thought maybe you could use some company.
Susan,Okay.
Susan,You'd be an amazing mother.
Susan,"Hey, Mike. So my mom's wedding is in a couple days, and I know you sent back that little card saying you were coming and that you preferred beef, which, actually I changed to fish for you 'cause I tasted the beef. Anyways, I know that was before we, you know--"
Susan,"Oh. I hope that's not just because of us not being us anymore. I mean, we could be together at a wedding and it wouldn't have to be weird."
Susan,"Of course. Yeah, I see that."
Susan,"Oh, uh. So what have you been doing lately?"
Susan,"Well, I've been writing a book. It's sort of autobiographical. Really been forcing me to reexamine some of the different things that have made me me, like the fact that my mother had me so young, and I never knew my dad. Big stuff like that. I told you about my dad, right? He was a Merchant Marine, and his platoon was killed in the Battle of Hanoi?"
Susan,Why?
Susan,Are you sure? That's what my mom said.
Susan,"Oh. Well, clearly I have more research to do. So, what do you think? My life story, would you rush out and buy a copy?"
Susan,Yeah?
Susan,"I'm here. Hi, Morty, Reverend Hopkins. I'm sorry I'm late to your rehearsal."
Susan,"Mom, can I ask you a question?"
Susan,"Oh. Oh. I was just researching my book and I, I found the strangest thing. No one with my father's name was ever a Merchant Marine."
Susan,"Oh, well, yeah, I thought you probably did. So I checked that, too, and he wasn't there and so I called the V.A., and there is not a single record of anyone named Harrison Ross in Vietnam."
Susan,"Well, I'm sorry to upset you, Mom, I just, don't you think that's weird?"
Susan,"Well, there's no record of anyone with my dad's name in the armed services."
Susan,There what is?
Susan,"Mom, I need answers."
Susan,"Well, you've been married four times. I think you got it down."
Susan,"Mom, don't walk away from me."
Susan,Mom! Mom.
Susan,"Morty? Morty, have you seen my mom?"
Susan,I need to you tell me the truth about my father.
Susan,"Yeah, well, I know what R and R means. So what does this have to do with my father?"
Susan,"Morty, can, can we just move this along?"
Susan,"Okay, again, what does this have to do with my father?"
Susan,"Well, why would my mother tell me that?"
Susan,Are you saying that I'm the result of my mother having a one-night stand?
Susan,"Of course I am. I'm not gonna pretend like I'm not still a little freaked out. I am. But I did a lot of thinking about it this morning, and I, I think I understand. You wanted to protect me, and you thought I needed a hero. I had one. You."
Susan,"Well, I am screwed up, but it wasn't your fault. Entirely."
Susan,"Oh, my god. Do you know where he is?"
Susan,Is that him?
Susan,"Are you saying that all this time my father has been alive, and just right across town running the supply and feed store?"
Susan,I can't believe this!
Susan,All this time my father has been right across town running the feed store?
Susan,Apparently he owns the place.
Susan,What do you mean?
Susan,"Oh, I'm not. Julie, the man abandoned me before I was born. I don't have a desire to have a relationship with him."
Susan,I just want to see what he's like. And satisfy my curiosity and get it out of my system.
Susan,Oh?
Susan,"Oh, oh, no. That's okay, you don't have to give me anything, really."
Susan,I have a Dad! He's great! He gave me a hat!
Susan,Soon. I don't wanna ambush him. I'm gonna ease into it.
Susan,"Well, actually, there's a 'help wanted' sign in the window so I was thinking about getting a job there. And, you know, he would get to know me and I'm sure he would like me and I would like him, and then one day he would say, 'You're like the daughter I never had' and I'd say, 'Well, actually, now that you've mentioned it.'"
Susan,Why?
Susan,Thank you.
Susan,"I know. But I gotta find out if there's something there. I've always wanted a dad. I mean, I know not having one affected me."
Susan,"Why, cause I went to college?"
Susan,"Well, I just want to change my life and every since I was a little girl I've always liked horses and the outdoors. Well, I'm just fascinated with feed."
Susan,"Oh, no. I was just looking at the color of your eyes."
Susan,"Yeah. They're just like mine. They're, they're nice."
Susan,What? Who's Carol?
Susan,I don't know what you're talking about. I just came in to get a job.
Susan,Oh! I'm your daughter!
Susan,"Back in the sixties, you had a brief relationship with a young girl, Sophie Bremmer. She got pregnant and had a baby and that baby was me,which makes you my father. Hi."
Susan,"Mr. Prudy, I'm sorry. I didn't want to spring it on you like this. Where are you going? You see when I found out you were alive, and, and that we both lived in the same city, I just wanted to meet you."
Susan,Mr. Prudy!
Susan,Mr. Prudy. Hello.
Susan,Hello!
Susan,I just wanted to see if you were okay.
Susan,"Oh, okay."
Susan,What? I just got here.
Susan,Charming.
Susan,"It's, it's Susan. My name is Susan. And, no, that's not good enough."
Susan,"It's not like I want an invitation to Thanksgiving. I just wanna have coffee, or a lunch now and then."
Susan,"Oh, that's funny. So, all the times you were cheating on her, that was okay, but having lunch with your daughter, that just crosses the line? I just want a chance to get to know you."
Susan,"Well, I wasn't consulted on that little arrangement."
Susan,Is that what you think of me? I'm a mistake?
Susan,"Do you want to tell her, or should I? I'm your husband's guardian angel."
Susan,My name's Susan. I was buying some horse feed when Mr. Prudy had an attack behind the counter. I gave him CPR and called nine-one-one.
Susan,"Well, I'm gonna get out of here. Mr. Prudy, I want you to hurry up and get back on your feet."
Susan,I'm not giving up.
Susan,I'm gonna be back in the store next week. I never got that darn horse feed.
Susan,You do that.
Susan,I just want a chance to get to know you.
Susan,"Bree, I'm so sorry."
Susan,"I know this sounds awful, but I'm kind of glad the guy's dead."
Susan,How do you think he's gonna react?
Susan,You came!
Susan,"Well, sure."
Susan,"That was just the heat of the moment, and once you get to know me, you'll understand that I am not the kind of person who could ever, ever resort to blackmail."
Susan,So are you coming in?
Susan,That was my first Halloween. I was two. What do you think I am?
Susan,"Oh, come on, just guess. You can tell."
Susan,"No, Addison, I'm a chicken. See? Those are feathers hanging around."
Susan,You haven't even finished your coffee.
Susan,"Oh, well, we, we haven't even finished the high school years. I wanted to show you this one. This was from the father-daughter dance. I had to take my mother's hairstylist."
Susan,"Well, I, I just want to share more than our DNA I, I wanted to have a relationship with you. None of this means anything to you?"
Susan,"Actually, it was--fine."
Susan,Uh-huh. What's up?
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,Solicitation? You were arrested for solicitation?
Susan,But you were with a prostitute.
Susan,"Addison, you just got caught paying for sex. Now is not the time to wrap yourself in the flag."
Susan,I'm sorry. How is trying to pick up a hooker not your fault?
Susan,Can't you just go home and have sex with your wife like a normal person?
Susan,"Oh, my god. Stop. Right now. I'm gonna go pay this thing."
Susan,What?
Susan,"Thursday, coffee at two. Be on time."
Susan,"Okay, I didn't exactly love what I found out about you today, but the goal was to learn, not to judge."
Susan,"Oh, hi, Alberta. How are you? Were you the one that sent out those neighborhood watch pamphlets? I was wondering if maybe you had any extra copies. Or I'll just borrow one from somebody else. Thanks."
Susan,"This is ridiculous. What does she think, we're having an affair?"
Susan,"Well, now you're gonna have to tell her the truth."
Susan,"Oh, so you want me to catch it for you? I mean, you, yourself, said she's crazy. I don't want to wake up tomorrow morning and find my tires slashed."
Susan,"Hello, Edie. Do you have something you'd like to say?"
Susan,Did Addison talk to you about me?
Susan,Oh! I guess not.
Susan,"No, wait! Wait! It's not what you think!"
Susan,"Carol, if you would just stop throwing things at me, I'll explain!"
Susan,"No, I'm not screwing him! He's my father!"
Susan,"I'm so sorry. I thought you should know, but he didn't want to tell you."
Susan,"Oh, no."
Susan,"Oh, Carol, you don't have to clean that up. They have clerks for that."
Susan,Thirty-eight.
Susan,"Believe me, I didn't want to hurt anyone. I just wanted to find my dad."
Susan,"Well, let me see. Painting in the rain or letting the whole world think I'm a whore? I don't know. What do you think?"
Susan,Yep.
Susan,"So, you are hereby released of any further obligation to be my dad."
Susan,Good for you. Bye.
Susan,You don't have to do this.
Susan,Sweet.
Susan,Really?
Susan,"Okay, one more."
Susan,That was a good one.
Susan,I'll wait for your call.
Susan,"Hey, what happened to the Applewhites?I thought you were gonna invite them."
Susan,"I like 'em, very nice."
Susan,"Right, interesting."
Susan,"Well, that's not what we're saying."
Susan,What kiss?
Susan,"Oh, you guys,we're all friends.This isn't something to get worked up over."
Susan,Uh--oh!
Susan,Zach is back!
Susan,You do?
Susan,"Well, that's great,isn't it?"
Susan,I thought you'd be happy about it.I thought that's what you wanted.
Susan,And he doesn't want you anywhere near him.
Susan,"Well, it's your word against his."
Susan,"You know,despite what I did--sending Zach away,I want you two to connect.I hope you know that."
Susan,Zach.
Susan,Okay.
Susan,"Well, thanks.We appreciate that."
Susan,"Well,what do you think?"
Susan,"Yeah, I can't believe I'm about to say this,but I feel sorry for him.It's like he's so fragile."
Susan,"I think he should spend some time with decent role model,don't you?"
Susan,Hi.
Susan,"Oh, sorry!Are you okay?"
Susan,We have an idea how to bring you and Zach together.Bowling.
Susan,"No, and we're not planning on telling him."
Susan,"Mike, I'm part of the reason things got so screwed up.I just want a chance to make things right."
Susan,Go!
Susan,"Zach,I'm glad you could make it."
Susan,"Oh!Okay, write that down--nine!"
Susan,You okay?
Susan,"We don't hate you, Zach.You had an incredibly hard year.And you shouldn't have done what you did,but we just wanna help you move on."
Susan,"You know,I'm gonna go, uh,help Julie with the food.So you guys just keep talking and bowling.Talk and bowl.Bowl and talk."
Susan,"Oh, my god!"
Susan,I'm fine.
Susan,"So I swerved to avoid hitting his car,and I hit this parked car instead,and that's when the trunk popped open,and when we got out, we found this dead body and--"
Susan,"Well, I told him everything I know,which wasn't much."
Susan,I don't know. I saw his face when he looked in the trunk.And he looked just as shocked as I was.
Susan,And there were the noises.
Susan,"Oh, a couple of weeks ago,um, I heard some noises coming from the basement,like a clanging.And I asked Betty about it.She lied right to my face."
Susan,I don't know.
Susan,Are you Jim?I'm Susan Mayer.
Susan,How old do you think I am?
Susan,Why don't we get our table?
Susan,Oh! Oww! Oh!
Susan,It was an accident.
Susan,"Dr. Mccready,can I talk to you about my head?Away from--the draft?"
Susan,Dr. Ron--I need you to pretend there's something wrong with me and admit me for the night.
Susan,This is the worst date I have ever been on in my life.
Susan,"That man is the most obnoxious,offensive,annoying human being.And you're looking at me like I'm crazy right now,but I will be if I spend one more second with him.So you gotta help me.You gotta do something."
Susan,It's my mental health.My mental health!You took an oath.
Susan,"Oh,sorry."
Susan,Right. Right.
Susan,"Thank you so much,Dr. Ron."
Susan,"Great,she caught me staring."
Susan,I just know those two have something to do with that dead body.
Susan,"Well,the paper said the police are withholding the details."
Susan,That's a great idea.You could have him do a background check on the Applewhites.
Susan,Why not?You said he was nice.
Susan,"Well,somebody has to do something,'cause I'm losing sleep."
Susan,Super.
Susan,He needs to see me or he wants to see me?
Susan,"Oh,he could be cuter--but I don't know how."
Susan,"Oh,no,I can't do that."
Susan,He's young.
Susan,Younger than me.
Susan,"Let's just say if I was a senior in high school,I'd be saying,""wow,you're a hot fifth grader."""
Susan,"You mean,I'm not gonna see Dr. Ron?"
Susan,"Oh,well,maybe I should go ahead and see him anyway,just to be safe."
Susan,"Yeah,but now that I think about it,I bet it's just all the coffee I drink.I drink way too much coffee.Do you like to drink coffee?"
Susan,I should switch to juice.I know the best juice place.You would love it.Do you drink juice?
Susan,"Oh,oh,not that often.I probably just need a good massage."
Susan,Yeah?
Susan,"Oh,oh,no,I don't think that's necessary."
Susan,I got high marks in math and science.
Susan,So is Dr. Ron gonna be here for this?
Susan,Okay.
Susan,"Oh,uh,I-I,uh--then why did you put out a gown?"
Susan,"Yeah,it's pretty troubling."
Susan,"Hey,Dr. Ron?I just have a feeling that everything's gonna turn out fine.And when it does--I'd like to buy you dinner to celebrate my health.You know,I was thinking maybe Italian?Oh,what the heck,maybe we can call it a date.If you like.Dr. Ron?"
Susan,Okay.Thank you.I'd like to get out now.
Susan,Dr. Ron?What are you doing here?
Susan,"Oh,are you sure?Um,because I would look a lot better over the phone right now."
Susan,Symptoms?
Susan,"Oh,no,no,no,no."
Susan,I am so sorry.But I'm not sick.
Susan,"Your nurse wouldn't let me see you,and I--really wanted to see you,so I sort of faked all my symptoms.The dizziness,the chills,you know,all of it."
Susan,"I know. I know.I feel really awful.I am just not the best at meeting men.And I thought you were cute,and I sort of thought that maybe you thought I was cute,and you're a doctor,and that's so sexy."
Susan,Really?You were up all night?
Susan,You like me?
Susan,What about your girlfriend?
Susan,The one who called in the MRI Room?
Susan,Oh.Maybe we could go out sometime?
Susan,I love sushi.I'm available tomorrow night.
Susan,"Oh,uh,Friday's good."
Susan,A what?
Susan,Wandering what?
Susan,Thank you.I had a fabulous time.
Susan,"Oh, um, well, uh,Julie's staying at her father's house,and, um, I'm all alone here."
Susan,Yeah.Sometimes it actually makes me a little nervous.
Susan,"Oh, that's a good idea.I forgot.I have a bottle of wine.It's already chilled right in the refrigerator,and that'll just really relax me."
Susan,"Uh, yeah, yeah,Thursday's great."
Susan,Do I just repulse you?
Susan,"You know,we've been on three dates,and you just keep acting like a perfect gentleman,and, uh-- It's getting a little old."
Susan,A-and you're stopping yourself why?
Susan,Oh. So why are we dating?
Susan,Okay.
Susan,"Oh! Mmm.Okay, that sort of felt unethical."
Susan,"Oh, well, okay.I mean,I guess-- I guess you guys probably have all sorts of new, exciting techniques where you don't even cut open the body."
Susan,"No?So--we're talking surgery?Yeah, well, I guess I can handle that.People get cut open every day."
Susan,You?
Susan,"Oh, uh, well, um--uh--"
Susan,"The first time you'll see me naked,I'll be on an operating table."
Susan,I'm curious. Um--why were you so congratulatory?
Susan,"So this whole splenectomy thing--you feel good about it, huh?"
Susan,"Right, right.Actually,I sort of meant, um--do you personally feel confident?"
Susan,"Well, you know,you're gonna be--hacking into me,and I just wanted to make sure that you feel ready."
Susan,"Okay, red flag! See, I didn't go to medical school,but I'm thinking--not all the same."
Susan,I would like to.But I gotta be honest--the fact that you can't even cut that steak isn't helping.
Susan,"Well, neither am I.I've got 35 years on that cow."
Susan,I'm sorry.I don't mean this to sound the wrong way. I just--I would be more comfortable with an experienced surgeon.
Susan,Thank you.
Susan,What?I didn't even serve dessert yet.You said you understood!
Susan,What? You want me to put my life on the line to service your ego?
Susan,Jim--
Susan,We need to talk.
Susan,"I've been waiting for three hours.After you stormed out the other night,I started to doubt myself.I started to think,""gee, you know, maybe I should just ignore my better instincts,and I should let Dr. Ron gut me like a fish."""
Susan,"I mean, why not?'Cause all my life,I have jumped through hoops to keep men from leaving.But I'm not doing it anymore.So tough luck, pally.You just missed out on a good thing."
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,Really?
Susan,Wow.I wouldn't want you to hate yourself.
Susan,And I am so sorry about that-- snap thing.I was just trying to be theatrical.
Susan,Bree?we have a question for you.
Susan,"Well, we were just wondering--actually, we were curious about, um--"
Susan,"Yeah, that."
Susan,"She makes it sound like we're angry, and we're not angry."
Susan,Edie!
Susan,Can't you sugarcoat it a little?
Susan,"Bree, we know that you have a good reason for wanting Betty to hang out with us.We just-- wondered if you could clue us in a little."
Susan,"Edie, can you--"
Susan,"Hi. I need an operation on my spleen,and I just found out I don't have medical insurance.Is there anyone I can sue?"
Susan,"After the embezzlement,Lonny let the policy lapse.And now he's in jail,and I'm gonna die."
Susan,"No, there isn't time for you to deal with the red tape.My spleen is going careening into my heart.I need that operation now."
Susan,"I don't need a loan.I need coverage.I mean, what if there are complications?I don't have a safety net.Oh, my god, please!"
Susan,I'm saying a little prayer.
Susan,"Well, what? I'm desperate here.Do you have any other ideas?"
Susan,What?
Susan,"No, no,I think she's onto something."
Susan,The surgeon is slicing me open a week from tomorrow.What other choice do I have?
Susan,Hi!
Susan,I came as soon as I got your message. Is this--?
Susan,"Wow, nice to meet you."
Susan,Oh.
Susan,Hi.
Susan,"Oh! oh, ah. sure, that's--Wednesday's great.I'm--I'm just curious--how did Edie convince you to do this so quickly?"
Susan,Why would you need a fake bride?
Susan,Really?
Susan,So what changed?
Susan,"Oh. oh,so by marrying me--"
Susan,"Uh, likewise."
Susan,"Hi.I thought you should know,I'm getting married."
Susan,"No! No. Ha!No, to-- to a gay guy.How did you know about the doctor?"
Susan,"I need health insurance,um, 'cause I've got this wandering spleen and--That sounds funny,""spleen wandering,"" but--actually, it's not funny 'cause it can bang into things--so I need health insurance,so I'm getting married tomorrow.And you probably think I'm crazy, right?"
Susan,No. It can't wait.
Susan,"Oh, yeah.No, I'm sorry.L-- that was really-- it."
Susan,Hi.
Susan,Okay.
Susan,"Oh, hi.It's nice to meet you."
Susan,Cancer?
Susan,"Oh, yes. No, no,I do need insurance.I just don't have cancer.I have a-- wandering spleen."
Susan,Is there a problem?
Susan,Oh! Uh--
Susan,"Well, it is.L-I could die."
Susan,"Oh, no,it's a serious illness.See, it just sounds silly 'cause of the word ""spleen."""
Susan,"Oh, oh! No, no,stop right there.Okay, I would love to see you two crazy kids get hitched in Holland more than anyone,with the tulips and the clogs,in front of a windmill,the whole shebang.But unless I get this surgery,my spleen is going to slam straight into my heart and explode.So, you know, seeing as I am just a nice person and I always support gay rights,let's just do this.And then I'll have a husband and insurance.Nobody gets hurt."
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,I didn't get married.
Susan,"We got to the altar,but the whole fake wedding thing sort of imploded."
Susan,I still don't have insurance.I need to get that operation.I'm--I'm really screwed.
Susan,What?
Susan,But-- we were actually married.
Susan,Karl--
Susan,What the hell?
Susan,What are we gonna do about Edie?
Susan,She'd kill us both.
Susan,I know.I was listening to you.
Susan,"11:30, Wednesday morning. Right?"
Susan,Yep.
Susan,"Don't worry,honey.This time,it is strictly a business arrangement."
Susan,"So we shouldn't expect a wedding gift,huh?"
Susan,"Uh,is that really necessary?I mean,do we have to do the whole ring thing?"
Susan,"Yeah,okay.Well,I'll just grab something out of my jewelry box."
Susan,I don't know--exactly.
Susan,"Well,I trusted you not to cheat on me and break my heart."
Susan,I threw it out my car window somewhere on route 7.
Susan,The night you abandoned me.
Susan,"Karl,you are so not allowed to get angry.I mean,I might've been the one to throw away the wedding ring,but you threw away the whole marriage.There was plenty of bad behavior that went on back then,so just get off your high horse.We're on the same page now,so we should just focus on that."
Susan,"Karl,I think there might be snakes in here."
Susan,Mostly.
Susan,Hi!Happy Valentine's Day.
Susan,It's okay. She knows that you make house calls.
Susan,Great!I'll have a light lunch.
Susan,"Oh,I have a wedding that day."
Susan,Yeah.Wednesdays are becoming very popular with brides.It's like the new Saturday.
Susan,"Your mother is a rotten,sneaky person."
Susan,"Thanks,hon.That really helps.Okay,now I want you to go over and slip this ring to your father.And just so you know,if Edie catches you,I'm expecting you to swallow it."
Susan,"Oh,yeah."
Susan,What?
Susan,Okay.
Susan,"You mean,like,marriage?"
Susan,"No,no. I'm okay.I-I'm just-- surprised.Well,congratulations.What makes you think he's gonna propose?"
Susan,A ring!What did it look like?
Susan,"I think I know that ring.That's his grandmother's ring.It's a family heirloom.And,you know,he might just be having it cleaned or something."
Susan,"Well,Karl is a lawyer,and it could just be a prenup for another client."
Susan,"Oh,no,Edie--"
Susan,"Oh,hi. Um,do you see that man over there?Dark hair,handsome.I need you to slip this to him without anybody noticing."
Susan,Karl. Karl!Come here!Why didn't you answer your damn cell phone?
Susan,Where's Edie?
Susan,She found the ring and the prenup in your briefcase.She thought you were gonna pop the question tonight.
Susan,"Oh,yes.You know,this whole fake marriage thing was okay when nobody was getting hurt.What are we doing? It's a lie!I lost Mike over a lie,and now I'm doing the same thing to Dr. Ron,and--and look at Edie.She was devastated.I don't think I can go through with this."
Susan,"I don't know.You know,I'll just--I'll sell the car."
Susan,Karl--
Susan,"How? How are you gonna handle Edie?That poor woman's dreams exploded in her face tonight.You know,it's not like you can just go out and buy her flowers,and everything will be better."
Susan,"Well,that's a little extreme."
Susan,Nothing. I just--I didn't know that you loved her like that.
Susan,"No,of course not.Well,okay,this is good because--you know,if this experience helped you to realize your true feelings,then,uh--then we did something good here."
Susan,I can't believe you thought I was jealous.It's not like I still have feelings for you anymore.
Susan,Thanks.I owe you one.
Susan,Have you seen Bree since?
Susan,"Hey,Bree.How you doing today?"
Susan,I'm checking myself into the hospital.I'm finally gonna get that surgery.
Susan,Just in passing.
Susan,I sure did.
Susan,And I'm really hoping you're a lefty.
Susan,Funny. So what about my surgery?
Susan,Then I'm on board.
Susan,"What ""little thing""?"
Susan,"Oh,my god,they're beautiful."
Susan,Oh.
Susan,Wow.Wow.
Susan,"Oh,it's sort of private."
Susan,Oh. Um--okay.There's more on the back.
Susan,What are you doing here?
Susan,Give me that. Aah!
Susan,"Okay,that part sounds better when you don't read it out loud.And what are you doing reading it anyway?"
Susan,So?
Susan,Of course I do.He's smart and funny and kind.
Susan,"Well,that's a big word.We just started dating,and we have a connection,and I'm gonna follow it through and see where it goes."
Susan,As opposed to the 12 I wasted on you?Why are we talking about this?I don't recall asking you your opinion.
Susan,"Okay,you know,you can leave now."
Susan,Out!It's not funny.
Susan,"Oh,sure.Oh,that's a little tight.Does it have to be that tight?"
Susan,"Oh.Okay. Ow,ow. That's actually starting to be painful."
Susan,Ow! Ow!
Susan,What the hell are you doing?
Susan,I am not!
Susan,"Oh! Yeah,oh--no,no,he just said that 'cause we used to be married.It's just a force of habit."
Susan,"Oh,no. No,no.No,no,nurse hisel.Ow,ow,ow,ow!"
Susan,"Ow,Nurse Hisel!Ugh! Nurse--oh!"
Susan,"Nurse Hisel,I can explain."
Susan,"Yes. Okay.I am married,but it's only because my insurance ran out.My ex-husband has a really good coverage plan,so he said that he would remarry me so I could get my operation.Only I didn't wanna tell Dr. Ron 'cause I didn't want him to be an accomplice to fraud."
Susan,"Yeah. It--yes,I am."
Susan,I know. I read the card.
Susan,What do you mean?
Susan,Really?
Susan,"Oh,yeah,I'll be surprised.So I guess we have the whole insurance thing worked out."
Susan,I think I have to break up with Dr. Ron.
Susan,Because he's a gem.And apparently he loves me.
Susan,"Lynette,he is everything I could possibly want in a boyfriend,and I just don't know if I feel that--spark."
Susan,And he keeps telling me how special I am and how much I mean to him--how he wants to hold my beating heart in his hand.
Susan,"Mmm.Maybe it's because I just haven't felt that thunderbolt yet.You know,with Mike,it hit me.With Karl,it hit me.I didn't have to worry about how I felt because the thunderbolt told me."
Susan,"Do I,though? I mean,I do.But I don't trust it anymore.You know,those relationships turned out to be disasters.Maybe I should stick it out with Dr. Ron,and I should try heading down a road that's growing and slower into a sort of kind of love that would sustain itself for 50 years. Right?Stability,comfort,endurance--I deserve that."
Susan,That's not helpful.
Susan,"Mike!Oh,wait,stop! Go back!Stop! Stop a second.Hey!What are you doing here?"
Susan,"Aw,that's so sweet.You came all the way down here just for me."
Susan,"Oh,it means a lot to me that you came."
Susan,Okay.Bye.
Susan,Super-duper.How you feeling?
Susan,"Aw,thank you.I love Mike."
Susan,Mike is love. Mmm.
Susan,"Mmm,Mike,Mike,Mike--"
Susan,"Aw, thank you."
Susan,I love Mike
Susan,Great.I'm about to be released.
Susan,Why do you ask?
Susan,"I did?Oh, is that why you han't been in to see me since my surgery?"
Susan,I don't even know a Mike.
Susan,"Yes, everyone does know a Mike.Actually, you're right. I did know a Mike in college.We did this play together, ""pippin."" it wasn't very good.Anyways, I never thought of him,so you shouldn't be accusing me.I was probably just hallucinating."
Susan,Damn that Nurse Hisel!
Susan,"Okay, yes,I did remarry my ex,but it was only because he has great health insurance.Did Miss Blabbermouth tell you that, too?"
Susan,Only in the legal sense.And I just didn't tell you because I wanted to protect you.
Susan,"Okay, you know what?You should come over to dinner and meet Karl,that there is absolutely nothing between us."
Susan,"Oh, yeah, that's the plan.I swear."
Susan,Sure.
Susan,"Wow, she's-- gorgeous."
Susan,"Um, we'll just be a second.Just wheel me.Be right back."
Susan,I need you to ditch Edie tomorrow night and have dinner with Dr. Ron and me.
Susan,"Well,for starters,because you banged your secretary,and you owe me for the rest of your life."
Susan,"Okay,will you shut up?It's not funny. I was drugged."
Susan,I lied and I told himI didn't know a Mike.
Susan,I am aware of that.
Susan,"Because I panicked,okay?Dr. Ron hadn't come into see me since the operation and I was feeling insecure and--Yes,go ahead.You may resume laughing."
Susan,What?
Susan,"Yeah,well,believe me,behind all the laughs,there's still plenty of bitterness and resentment."
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,"No,no. I got it,I got it."
Susan,"All right,but if I catch you guys in there talking about me,you're gonna be the one in a wheelchair."
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,Where's he going?
Susan,So you sent him over to Mike's?
Susan,"Karl!Oh, god!"
Susan,"What were you thinking?Oh,oh!"
Susan,"Oh,ah,okay.I made it."
Susan,Ah! ooh!
Susan,Oh!
Susan,That smarts! Aah!
Susan,I take it you met Mike.
Susan,"Please,please let me explain."
Susan,Ohh!
Susan,Okay.
Susan,I'm fine!
Susan,"Okay,Mike,just--it's okay.Just go home."
Susan,Okay.
Susan,"Ron,what are you doing?"
Susan,"Oh,my god!Guys,stop it.Stop it,right now!"
Susan,"No,Ron,don't go!"
Susan,"Oh,Ron!Oh! Ugh!What the hell is wrong with you?"
Susan,"Well,he wasn't!And nowmy boyfriend is gone.Thank you very much."
Susan,"I can see that.So,what,did you run out of strangers to beat up on the street,and you're going house to house now?"
Susan,"If you don't wanna be my boyfriend,fine.Don't beat up the only guy who wants to volunteer for the job."
Susan,"I deserved it,believe me.After what I did--god,this is such a mess.He won't even return my phone calls."
Susan,"I said something to Dr. Ron before the operation,and it just--devastated him."
Susan,I can't tell you.
Susan,Oh?I need to take this.
Susan,"No.No,not really. Um--what's the point?"
Susan,Hi.
Susan,"I did remarry my ex,but it was only because he has great health insurance."
Susan,Omelettes. You want me to make you one?
Susan,Try the cheese.That's the best part.
Susan,Yeah-- congratulations.What happened to waiting six months?
Susan,It poured.I could have murdered that weatherman.
Susan,It was hysterical.I thought the whole wedding day was ruined.
Susan,"Her,too."
Susan,"Oh,wait! Why don't you let me walk with you?"
Susan,No! I'm fine.The doctor said I should actually keep my blood flowing.
Susan,Okay--
Susan,"Wait a second,we're--we're not flirting."
Susan,"Okay,yes,I am closer to your father than I have been in the past.The bitter hatred's now settled into a respectful disgust.That's the kind of thing most children of divorce dream about."
Susan,"Hey,Edie.What's all this stuff for?"
Susan,A surprise?
Susan,"Oh,cool. But that's not the surprise."
Susan,"Oh. No,Edie,wait.Um,no,it's just that--you know,I was married to Karl,and I used to--try to surprise him,and he would always,always,always say--""No,Susan. Don't surprise me.I don't like it."""
Susan,"Karl!Karl,stop! Stop!Oh! It's an emergency."
Susan,Edie is gonna marry you tomorrow.
Susan,She's planned this whole secret wedding.It's a surprise.
Susan,"I know. I told her that.I said,""He always,always hates surprises."""
Susan,That's great.
Susan,You're gonna make me take the hit?
Susan,"Uh,just talking."
Susan,"Oh,no,that's okay."
Susan,"Wait until I leave to tell her,'cause she's gonna kill me."
Susan,"Well,I should go."
Susan,Oh! Get out! Get--
Susan,Hi. What's going on?
Susan,Exactly how ugly is this gonna get?
Susan,"He's right.We behaved like children--naughty,stupid children."
Susan,"At this point,I'd like to point out that,uh,it was Karl who proposed."
Susan,"Okay,now remember,I'm broke."
Susan,"No. No,of course not.And anything I can do to help--uh,you know,I would--I could help with the engagement party.How's that?"
Susan,A what now?
Susan,This is your father's bartender bible.See if you can find a recipe for a Rusty Nail.
Susan,Where'd you find that?
Susan,"Oh.Well,why is your father keeping this?"
Susan,"Karl,this marriage--our marriage,this fake marriage,that's what it is,right?Fake."
Susan,What's this?
Susan,"Yeah?Okay,then,repeat after me.""Our marriage is fake,""and I'm going to marry the woman I really love--Edie Britt."""
Susan,"No,no,no,no! It's not about what I want you to say.You have to want to say that you want to marry Edie."
Susan,Why are you hanging on to that?
Susan,Why?
Susan,"Oh. Oh,no,no,no.This is not happening."
Susan,"Oh,Karl!Oh! Will you--are you crazy?!"
Susan,Karl!
Susan,Whoa!
Susan,I just saw Edie drive off.How long is she gonna be gone?
Susan,Move.
Susan,You mauled me in Edie's bed last night.I think that deserves a conversation.
Susan,"Oh,no!You don't mean that."
Susan,A little?Ugh--the helium hasn't even gone out of the balloons from your engagement party.
Susan,That the wedding's off.
Susan,"Well,isn't it?"
Susan,Are-- are you saying--that you're gonna go through with this wedding--unless I tell you not to?
Susan,This is insane!
Susan,"Oh,no!No,don't you dare!"
Susan,You're--sick!
Susan,So how you holding up?You must be exhausted.
Susan,"Well,you guys are busy.We should go."
Susan,"Okay,let's go. I don't wanna be late for the movie.Oh,those are pretty.Who sent those?"
Susan,What?
Susan,"No,his feelings.He's the one with the feelings,not me."
Susan,"Okay,don't ""uh-huh"" me. You're not old enough to do that."
Susan,You're gonna make me go by myself?
Susan,"My ex-boyfriend's here.If he sees me alone,I'll die.I'm begging you,please,act like you know me."
Susan,"Mike,hi! what a surprise."
Susan,"Good.Oh!God,I--I'm being so rude.Um,Mike,I-I want you to meet--"
Susan,Thank you so much for helping me out.
Susan,"Well,I definitely pickedthe right person to sit next to.Actually,is this seat taken?"
Susan,"Okay,you can share my popcorn."
Susan,"I'll just wait till the lights go out, and then I'll--"
Susan,"Oh,my god!Oh,thank you so much."
Susan,"Orson,I'm flattered.Uh,really.You--you don't wanna date me.I-I mean,my love life is just so complicated right now.Well-- no,I won't bore you with the details."
Susan,"Did I call Edie a slut?Well,that's overstating it.Edie's not a slut.She's just-- popular with indiscriminate men.Anyway-- yes,those are the relevant players."
Susan,"Now I'm absolutely horrified that I'm about to say what I'm about to say,but there's nobody else I can talk to who won't judge me.And since you're a complete stranger, I'll probably never see you again unless I randomly run into you on the street,in which case,you'll ignore me'cause you know how crazy I am."
Susan,Lay it on me.
Susan,He lives three houses down.
Susan,"That's why you brought me down here?Karl,you made it sound like it was an emergency."
Susan,Karl--Uh-oh!
Susan,"No,don't bother,'cause I'm going."
Susan,That was not a coincidence.
Susan,I remember.I also remember that you are planning on marrying someone else.
Susan,"Okay,you want the truth?I don't knowhow I feel about you,but I keep looking at you,trying to see if you've changed,if you've grown up.You know what I see?I see the same weak coward that walked out on me three years ago."
Susan,I don't think so.So I think you should probably stay with Edie.And the band is good.You should hire 'em.
Susan,Karl. What's going on?
Susan,It is?
Susan,"Wow.Why did you change your mind?I mean,I hope it wasn't because of me,because I told you--"
Susan,No?
Susan,Karl--you look pretty beat up.Why--why don't you--why don't you come in and--we'll crack open a bottle of wine.Come on.
Susan,"Now I wish I hadn't torched our wedding photos.Who would've thought, after everything that's happened,that we would've ended up back here again?"
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,About us?I feel good.I feel happy.
Susan,I can't believe you actually want to talk about feelings.You really have changed.
Susan,"Hello?Oh,hi,Edie.Uh--yeah,he's here.Hold on. How does she know you're here?"
Susan,Are you getting juice for her?
Susan,You ripped the woman's heart out.Why would she want juice from you?
Susan,She doesn't know?
Susan,"So if Edie doesn't know,then that means that you just cheated on her-- with me!You made me the other woman!"
Susan,"Get out of my house,you miserable son of a bitch!"
Susan,"No,just get out!Get out!"
Susan,"Our marriage was garbage!Stupid,disgusting pile of garbage!"
Susan,And I regret everything that came of it!
Susan,"Ugh! Ooh,out! Get out!"
Susan,Don't bother!I won't pick up.
Susan,"If Edie doesn't know,then that means that you just cheated on her with me."
Susan,I'm sorry I'm late.
Susan,What's going on?
Susan,"Oh, my god."
Susan,Really?Did he say who it was?
Susan,"Yes, like you wouldn't believe."
Susan,"Oh, look, the baby's doing something really cute."
Susan,She's sleeping.
Susan,Like an angel.
Susan,"Well, every situation is different,and it's hard to judge until we know all the details."
Susan,"Which--obviously I don't know,because how would I know?"
Susan,"She's a slutty, slutty whore.Absolutely."
Susan,"And this one,I ran out and got the day I found out Karl was doing it with his secretary.I think you'll find this particularly helpful.It's got a chapter called,""Revenge: You're only hurting yourself."""
Susan,"Oh.Well, um, why don't we get you out of here?Let's go see a feel-good movie."
Susan,"Well,I just wanna help.So how about that movie?"
Susan,"Uh-- well, um--then I should just go and let you get started with that."
Susan,Oh! Uh--okay.
Susan,"Edie, why are you torturing that girl?"
Susan,"Okay, let's not make a scene.It's not worth it.For the sake of argument,let's--let's--let's say that it's someone else.You know, probably it would be a vulnerable, lonely woman who Karl just took advantage of,and what if--this poor, confused soul begged your forgiveness?What would you say?"
Susan,Oh.
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,You know what?It is her.
Susan,She just--spit in your wings.
Susan,Uh-- sure.
Susan,"Oh, it's still a little red,but I think I got all the hot sauce out."
Susan,"Yeah,I kind of figured that."
Susan,Thank you.thank you for having my back.
Susan,So do I have to worry about you attacking any more waitresses?
Susan,"Okay,Stop that."
Susan,Where'd all this food come from?
Susan,Hi. I got your message.What's up?
Susan,Edie hired A-- P.I.?
Susan,How you doing?
Susan,Me and Karl?Why would you think that?
Susan,Well--that is Karl being nostalgic.
Susan,"Okay,um--first of all,it was not the best sex I ever had.I just said that to make him feel better.Obviously,you were the best sex I ever had."
Susan,I know that this looks bad--
Susan,"No,no,no!No,Karl lied to me.He told me that he and Edie had split up before--"
Susan,Mike--
Susan,"Hey! Hey,you,wait,wait,wait. Um--okay,you cannot tell Edie about this.Whatever she's paying you,I'll pay you double."
Susan,"$2,000?Jeez! I gotta get into real estate.Okay,I don't have that kind of cash."
Susan,"Okay,let's try this another way.You are about to unleash a nuclear explosion.Lives are going to be ruined."
Susan,Yes!
Susan,What if I can't?
Susan,Who is it?
Susan,Hi. Sorry.I'm just on the lookout for Edie.
Susan,Why?
Susan,What did you say?
Susan,"Well,wait.Why would you do that?"
Susan,Hey there.You look thirsty.
Susan,"And you know why? Because we're all so busy and detached from each other.You're at my house every day,and sure,we wave and we say hello,but we barely even know each other.How long have you been delivering my mail,for god's sake?"
Susan,Really?It seems like forever.Let me top you off.
Susan,"Well,you probably wanna use the bathroom before you leave,huh?"
Susan,"Are you sure?Uh,I mean,you have such a long route,and that ice tea's gonna go right through ya.It's better here than Mrs. Mccluskey's hydrangeas."
Susan,"Great! Oh,the one down here is broken.Why don't you use the one upstairs?It's right off my bedroom."
Susan,Gus? Are you okay up there?
Susan,Gus!
Susan,Uh.
Susan,"Yes,honey!Gus the mailman is here!He's using the bathroom.He'll be down in a minute.Oh! darn it.Guess we'll have to take a rain check,huh?"
Susan,"Tu-Tuesday?No,no,Tuesday's not good,'cause Tuesday's the day I,um--become a lesbian."
Susan,"Hi. I made you a thank-you pie,and by ""made,""I mean ""bought."""
Susan,For keeping Edie from smashing my face in.That's the nicest thing anybody ever did for me.
Susan,"Well,you keep telling yourself that.I know why you really paid that guy off.You still care about me."
Susan,"You're always worried about Julie and me,and you beat up my new boyfriend.And now you're protecting me from Edie.Do you know what all that means?"
Susan,"All right,you go ahead and be coy. Fine.I'll be the one to break the ice.I've never stopped caring about you."
Susan,"I would've never even gone there if I had thought there was a chance with us.You just closed the door so completely,I--ugh,can we just not talk about him?Have some more pie.I know you like pie.I know you like me.Listen--I'm not asking for us to get back together.I just want us to be friends."
Susan,Yes?
Susan,My whole house is-- on fire!
Susan,"Oh, thanks. No, that's okay.We'll stay at a motel."
Susan,I don't deserve friends like you.
Susan,"Thanks, Orson.Thanks for coming.You know,you didn't have to do this."
Susan,"Oh, it's nice to meet you."
Susan,"No. No, it isn't.So when am I gonna get the check?'Cause I have a lot of rebuilding to do.I need to get started."
Susan,Arson?
Susan,Who would wanna burn down my house?
Susan,"No. No, look,the whole neighborhood turned out to help.I'm very popular."
Susan,"Oh, no, no.Everybody's been very helpful.Um, everybody likes me.Absolutely--"
Susan,#NAME?
Susan,"This is a little awkward,and I apologize in advance for how this is gonna sound,but um--by any chance,did-- you burn down my house?"
Susan,What?
Susan,Edie!Why would you do that?!
Susan,Letter? What letter?
Susan,You weren't supposed to get that.I stole that back from the mailman.
Susan,"This is not what we should focus on right now.The point is, you maliciously set fire to my house."
Susan,"A tad?Edie, I have no roof!You can't just go around burning down people's homes."
Susan,"That's it.I'm going to the police,and I'm telling them what you did."
Susan,What? You just confessed.
Susan,"Uh, no. No, I was up."
Susan,Bree-- are you okay?
Susan,I need Edie to spill her guts.What do you know about wearing a wire?
Susan,Mm.
Susan,"Oh, okay."
Susan,"Um-- no, that's okay.They're fine."
Susan,"Yeah. I'm sort of up against the wall.The insurance company needs proof fast,and things are sort of weird at Bree's.I don't wanna over stay my welcome."
Susan,I'm sorry. Did you just invite me to move in with you?
Susan,Oh.
Susan,"You sure that won't put a crimp in your, uh, dating life?You know, that girl you were at the movies with?"
Susan,"Yeah, he just heard about the fire and came over to help.We're friends."
Susan,Guess not.
Susan,Hey.Cleaning up after the big party?
Susan,"You know, it's late.Why don't you, uh,go to bed and, you know,let Julie and I help you with that in the morning?"
Susan,Are you-- okay?
Susan,"Yeah, when you flip out in front of the pep squad,word travels fast."
Susan,"Bree, I'm worried about you.Do--do you think that you should see someone?"
Susan,"Okay, well, then why don't you stop and go to bed?"
Susan,Why not?
Susan,"Okay, what are you talking about?"
Susan,"Hey.You know,I am not even tired.So-- why don't I stay up and help you?"
Susan,"No, Edie, wait.Um, I don't wanna fight.I know that we've had our differences,but, you know, we had a friendship going there,and I just think we owe it to ourselves to talk about what happened."
Susan,What?
Susan,"Okay, wait.Could you just swallow?'Cause I couldn't really--what you were saying--"
Susan,"Well, see, you were chewing,and so I didn't really hear what you said.Could you just say it again?"
Susan,"So, uh, y-you then a-admit burning down my house on purpose?"
Susan,Huh?
Susan,What?No!
Susan,"Oh, good, then you'll be prime meat picking when you go to jail!"
Susan,Bite me!
Susan,No!Give it! No!
Susan,Hi.
Susan,"Okay, first, let me say,I'm really sorry about the yellow jackets.And-- also, no matter how mad I am about what you did,I don't want to see you go to prison.So I came with a solution.Why don't you just come forward and tell the police that you saw some vagrant lurking by my garage with a can of gasoline?And if you do that,then I'll destroy the tape.And then the insurance company will pay the claim.Nobody gets hurt.Does that sound good?"
Susan,"Oh, ah."
Susan,Edie--
Susan,"Okay, I'm just gonna think that this is the meds talking,and I'll come back tomorrow."
Susan,"Okay, Edie,I'm in trouble here."
Susan,That's not true.
Susan,Hi.
Susan,"Oh, yeah, that. Um--look, I really appreciate the offer,but I think I'm gonna have to pass."
Susan,"Yeah.I think it's best. I don't wanna get a rep around here for being a charity case,you know?"
Susan,"I know, but I can figure this out on my own.At least I'm gonna try.You know, I'm stronger than people give me credit for.I really am."
Susan,You know what would be nice?Why don't you just stop over for coffee sometime?
Susan,"I mean, that is after I get running water and electricity again--and a coffeemaker."
Susan,"I think I'm gonna have to pass.You know, I'm stronger than people give me credit for."
Susan,"Ahh.Okay, break times over."
Susan,"Oh, Oh."
Susan,"Oh, help!Can anybody hear me? Julie?I, I need you to try to unlock the door. Oh, what am I saying?Okay , I need you to unbuckle yourself and try to find a neighbor."
Susan,But don't cross the street!Just tell the neighbor that your mommy's stuck in a big truck!
Susan,"Oh yes! My god, I have a genius baby!!"
Susan,Oh hi.I have a normal baby.
Susan,"Susan Mayer.Thank you so much.If my husband had to rescue me, I just, I would have never heard the end of it.He thinks I'm a total klutz."
Susan,"Oh, wow! I have a neighbor who just asked me over for coffee.I'm sorry.You must think I'm a lunatic."
Susan,"Oh, she is and we're gonna be so happy here. Look at your new home."
Susan,"Of course not, but when you see it for the first time, I want you to get the whole impact. Ta-da!"
Susan,"Okay, now I know it's a little more cramped than we're used to, but we can't stay at Bree's forever.She's gonna be coming back from that spa vacation soon.Besides, it's gonna be fun."
Susan,"Honey, I am trying my hardest to stand on my own two feet. All right, I've got six book proposals in the works.I'm gonna try to supervise the rebuilding of this house, but you know, I can't do it without your support. And I want you to be proud of me."
Susan,Ohh! that's my girl!
Susan,"No! no. It's all good. Oh! But you should know that your bed doubles as the dining table, and the toilet's in the shower."
Susan,"Uh, no.Have you tried her cell?"
Susan,"Oh, no, I'm sorry."
Susan,"I really don't, Tom.Is everything okay?"
Susan,He was just here. I think you should call him.
Susan,"Hey, what's going on?"
Susan,Oh.
Susan,Wow.
Susan,"Oh, hi."
Susan,So I can't believe you caught me spraying for ants. I must look like a wreck.
Susan,You've gotta be kidding.
Susan,"They're just ants, and they're tiny.Of course, they do outnumber me."
Susan,Thanks.
Susan,"Oh, did I say that?"
Susan,"Well, sometimes I say things I don't mean. I blame it on my frequent exposure to ant spray."
Susan,"Karl, what do you want?"
Susan,"It's temporary, and if you don't mind, I'm having coffee."
Susan,Mmmm.
Susan,"Well, actually, I think that twins are genetically determined by the mother."
Susan,"No. No, I write children's books."
Susan,Welcome to the neighborhood.
Susan,"Julie, what are you doing?I'm trying to sleep."
Susan,Karl! What are you doing?
Susan,"No, no, no, no.No, turn my house around."
Susan,You bought us a house?
Susan,What's the catch?
Susan,I can't accept this.I just--I gotta get out of this mess on my own.
Susan,"Hey, it's Susan.Just wanted you to know I let the electrician in your house.I hope you're having a great time at the spa."
Susan,Careful with those.The last of the crystal.Okay.
Susan,"Oh, hi.Um, we're just moving."
Susan,"Uh, well, he's not moving in with us."
Susan,"To be fair, you just had a spare room, and this is a whole house."
Susan,You bought me a ring?
Susan,"Uh, Mike, about that ring--"
Susan,"Stop it! oh, my--What are you--Just stop it!Oh, that's enough!Just get off! Get off! go! go!"
Susan,"Oh, my god.What? Stop! That's enough. enough, enough. Back up.And that ring-- that was for me, right?"
Susan,"Oh, my-- ohh!Karl, are you okay?Are you okay?Let me see.Oh, my god."
Susan,Can you sit up?
Susan,Oh. Are you all right?
Susan,"Oh, oh, you know, you should, um, call my friend Orson.He's a dentist.I'm sure he'll see you right away."
Susan,"So--about that ring you bought, is there anything particular you'd like to ask me?"
Susan,"Okay, that's ridiculous. Karl doesn't have me wrapped around anything."
Susan,"He's Karl.He's playing me. But that house is gonna be a great place for my daughter to live.And when he makes his move, he's gonna realize that I was really playing him.So-- about that ring--"
Susan,"Mike, my heart is in the exact right place."
Susan,Of course.Okay.You don't even wanna know what my answer would have been?
Susan,Mike still hasn't seen the invitation.
Susan,You really think that's what's gonna happen?
Susan,"Oh, there he is."
Susan,We're in.
Susan,"Karl, we've been through a lot together.We will always be connected by Julie, but-- I know why you bought me that house, and I'm not moving into it."
Susan,"Karl, we are not getting back together.Not ever. You need to just stop and realize that it's over.I'm gonna marry Mike.So I need you to sign these because I have to be divorced first."
Susan,"No, he was going to, but then you clocked him in the mouth with a salad shooter, remember? Actually, I'm going to pop the question to him tomorrow night."
Susan,"You would think so, but, no, it doesn't."
Susan,"I know.But if you really do-- love me, you'll let me go."
Susan,"Oh, shut up."
Susan,"I've got everything ready to go-- flowers, candles,Elvis Costello CD all cued up."
Susan,He does.
Susan,Then I'm gonna have to find a way to force it on my finger.
Susan,"Hey, it's just me again. Um-- when you got the invitation, I thought that you gave me the thumbs up, but I guess if that was actually-- some other type of finger gesture, uh-- well, I apologize for leaving you all these messages and wasting your time."
Susan,But I like doing it.I think Mike would want me to.Oops.
Susan,So you got the results of his latest MRI yet?
Susan,"Oh.Well, how long until you can do another one?"
Susan,"Look, I know it's been six months but he could still come out of it, right?I saw on the news there was this woman in Peru, she woke up after ten years."
Susan,You might think I'm naive but I know he's coming back to me.
Susan,Don't say it.You just keep doing your job and I'll keep doing mine.Oops.
Susan,"Two, three.Oh, itch, itch, itch.Oh, itch, itch, itch."
Susan,"Oh, hey, you weren't supposed to see that."
Susan,"Oh, I would love to but I think I'm in a rush here.I'm supposed to meet my girlfriends for lunch at 1:00.Is it 1:00 yet?"
Susan,"Oh, wow.Um, um, I can't accept this.This is too extravagant."
Susan,"Ha, still I--"
Susan,"Well, in that case, thank you for my cheap knock-off.Oh, my god, I'm late."
Susan,So you were very mysterious on the phone.Why did you want to have lunch?
Susan,So you asked us to a meal to announce another meal?That's so Bree of you.
Susan,Let me see.Oh.
Susan,The coffee machines was broken so I got us a couple of smoothies.They had strawberry and strawberry.
Susan,Hi Jane.
Susan,"Um, you mean like outside the hospital?"
Susan,A date?Ahhhh.
Susan,"Sorry.Ah, well, that sounds, ah, just, ah, that sounds great."
Susan,"Yeah, ah."
Susan,"Yes, you did."
Susan,Jane looked cold.
Susan,"All right.Well, I am really hungry."
Susan,"Oh, um, you might want to give Jane a sponge bath cause she had a little accident."
Susan,"Hi.Um.So I need to ask you something. Ian, you know, from across the hall.You met him.Anyway, he sort of asked me out on a date.I know you're thrown, I was thrown too.But he's really nice and I could sort of use someone to talk to, who also talks back.The thing is I'm sort of lonely.The past six months have been really hard on me.So what I need is, I need to know if it okay with you if I go out with him.Because if it's not, I won't.In fact I'd like nothing better than for you to just wake up right now and tell me not to go out with him.Just wake up and tell me!Wake up! Please!"
Susan,Oh.All right.I'll see you tomorrow.
Susan,I love you.It is really just dinner.
Susan,Bree?
Susan,He sort of asked me out.
Susan,It's okay with you if I go out with him?
Susan,"Well, I think a ten-foot train is great, but a shorter one would be just as nice and you wouldn't have to worry about people tripping on it."
Susan,"Well, ah, I'm not sure that I've ever seen this shade of green before."
Susan,Then why the rush?
Susan,Here's a job. How about talking you out of marrying a homicidal dentist?
Susan,His wife vanished and he didn't even tell Bree. How much more proof do you need?
Susan,"Well, I'm sorry I cannot sit here on my key lime ass and watch Bree make the worst mistake of her life!"
Susan,Well. Um. Honestly--
Susan,These dresses are hideous.
Susan,I think I will have the Mescaline Salad.
Susan,In that case I'll have the lobster bisque and the veal with the black truffles. Is that okay?
Susan,Oh my god!
Susan,"Oh, well, it's been a long time since I've been in a mood to, thank you."
Susan,Did I squeeze too hard?
Susan,"Oh, oh, wow. Oh, is this going to be awkward?"
Susan,Susan Mayer.
Susan,"Well, yes, and how nice that would have been, huh? Um, but, no, no, I'm a brain specialist."
Susan,What an excellent question.
Susan,"And this is the, uh, spinal cord. And it, of course, attaches to the brain."
Susan,"Oh, good. Um, I'm, um, well, then let's get technical."
Susan,"Uh, well, I, it just, wow. I hear my phone vibrating. I'm sorry, duty calls."
Susan,Dr. Mayer?
Susan,Oh please.
Susan,"That's a really lovely excuse, but it isn't the whole story, is it?"
Susan,A part of you feels like you'r cheating on her.
Susan,It's all right. 'Cause I feel guilty too. That's why we should just stop this right now because it's all way too complicated and I think we'd both be happier if we just went back to being friends.
Susan,"Well, if we can't be friends than I guess we'll be nothing."
Susan,"Hi, my name's Susan Mayer. Your neighbor told me I could find you here."
Susan,"Well, I was at my friend Bree's engagement party the other night. You know when you came in and you did that whole 'Orson killed his wife' thing. I was just wondering if you could elaborate."
Susan,"Well, what makes you so sure? Do you have any proof?"
Susan,"My friend is marrying that man in two hours. Please? Okay, I need, um, ten dollars in unrolled pennies and I need to see you count it. 'Cause last time you stiffed me.'"
Susan,The police? What did they find?
Susan,And that's bad why?
Susan,So when I left the bank I called the detective that worked the case and he said that the only reason Orson was never charged was because they never found a body.
Susan,He was the only suspect.
Susan,"Well, you know what we have to do."
Susan,"Bree, we have to talk."
Susan,This is your day. You can push the ceremony back an hour. Now get that detective on the phone and talk things out with Orson.
Susan,"Bree, we are just doing this because we love you. But, if you can honestly tell us that you don't have the slightest doubt--"
Susan,"Hi, Edie. Nice party, huh?"
Susan,"Well, it's nice to see you two getting along again."
Susan,Really? Does that mean you're gonna be getting back together?
Susan,"Wow, is that shrimp?"
Susan,Ian!
Susan,What are you doing here?
Susan,Ian?
Susan,Hmm? So what are you really doing here?
Susan,Ian.
Susan,I can't 'cause I have bridesmaid stuff.
Susan,"No, I'm good."
Susan,"Oh, well, it's been a long time since I've been in the mood to. Thank you."
Susan,"So that's my number and if there's any change in Mike's condition, I'm going to the mountains with a friend. And, ah, just in case you were wondering, it's strictly platonic."
Susan,"Ah, wow, look at the view!Oh.Don't you just love when the leaves change color."
Susan,"Yep, scenery's great.So, um, maybe I should unpack.Where should I do that?"
Susan,"Oh.A guest room.Well, that's handy."
Susan,"Oh, ah, no, no.I should take the guest room because I am the guest."
Susan,Yeah.And I think I have yours.
Susan,Hide pathetically in your room?
Susan,Me too.
Susan,Great piano. Do you play?
Susan,Right.
Susan,"So-- Brandy, a roaring fire, what could be more romantic?"
Susan,"Wow, my heart is pounding."
Susan,Your heart is beating even faster than mine.
Susan,"Me, too. So was that, uh, okay?"
Susan,Different?
Susan,"Oh, yeah. But, I mean, you kissed other girls before that, right?"
Susan,Are you saying that Jane is the only woman you ever--
Susan,Why not? I think that's adorable.
Susan,"Oh, Ian. It's okay. Some people have a lot of lovers, and some just a few. It doesn't matter."
Susan,Huh?
Susan,Ian.
Susan,"It's not that it's rude. It's just immaterial. I mean, it's just a number. It doesn't mean anything."
Susan,Ian!
Susan,Nine.
Susan,Nine lovers is not a lot! Nine lovers does not make me a slut!
Susan,"Because it was really eleven, and I knocked off two, and you're still judging me."
Susan,"Okay, just so you know eleven is not a lot for a woman my age."
Susan,"What is this, the Gallup Poll?!"
Susan,"To bed, alone. You know, it's something that I've always wanted to try, but I've just never gotten around to."
Susan,I'm with a client. Take a number.
Susan,"I was gonna stay mad at you another hour, but your damn accent gets me every time."
Susan,Don't push it.
Susan,"Oh, no, I don't mean to break the flow, but I just, um--Look, I know that I'm only your second lover ever, and that, I, I know that means a lot, and I just don't want it to mean--too much."
Susan,"I mean, the last time you did this, it turned into a lifetime commitment, and I'm just, I'm not ready for that."
Susan,I have never had meaningless sex.
Susan,"Don't judge me, Mr. Virgin--plus one!"
Susan,Get out!
Susan,"Why? You know, every time we do, we just get angry."
Susan,"Okay, Ian, you know what? This is not happening.I am just going to sleep, and you can just drive me home in the morning."
Susan,What could be more romantic?
Susan,Are you sure it's okay if we stay another day?
Susan,"That we work hard, and we deserve to relax."
Susan,"Uh, fresh air is good for us?"
Susan,"Okay, here's one--Julie needs to spend more time bonding with her father."
Susan,"If we keep this up, We could stay here till Christmas."
Susan,What? What were you gonna say?
Susan,Shh. Do you mind? You're kind of drowning out the bells.
Susan,I love this music. What's it about?
Susan,Cigarettes?
Susan,I'd love to go to France someday.
Susan,Are you serious?
Susan,"Oh, Ian, I just took a week off. I couldn't possibly justify taking another."
Susan,"Well, okay. You gotta promise me we'll actually leave the hotel room."
Susan,Mmm.
Susan,I thought you said you didn't get reception up here.
Susan,"Oh, it's Julie. I have to. Hello? What's up? Hey. Uh, I can't, no, can you say that again? The signal's really bad. What? Oh, my God."
Susan,"Mike woke up. Um, Julie, when, when did he--Julie? Julie! Oh, damn it! Oh, my God. Oh! Oh, my God! Um, uh, I, I, I have to go. Um, I gotta get out of here."
Susan,"Uh, I, I think that you're sitting on my bra."
Susan,"Ian, can you please hurry?"
Susan,We should've been on the road ten minutes ago.
Susan,Can't you do that stuff later?
Susan,Mike is awake! He's lying there and he's wondering where I am.
Susan,I bet you'd move faster if Jane were awake.
Susan,I'll pick up my bags later.
Susan,What?
Susan,"How could you possibly know what I was feeling? For six months, I have prayed every day for that man to wake up, And you made me give up on him."
Susan,"Okay, not on purpose, but you did. You were sweet and charming and English.And that's why when my prayers were answered,I was a hundred miles away, naked in someone else's arms.This should never have happened."
Susan,"Ian, I'm, I'm sorry. I know how you feel. It's Mike. It's my Mike."
Susan,Thank you.
Susan,"Oh, my God. You are awake."
Susan,"Oh, God! It's so wonderful to hear your voice again."
Susan,"Yes! Yes, I have. Almost every day. I can't tell you how much I'm kicking myself for not being here when you woke up."
Susan,I was in the country. But I'm back now.
Susan,"Is something wrong? You, you don't seem happy to see me."
Susan,What?
Susan,Oh. But you're gonna be all right. And I'm gonna help you remember.
Susan,"Oh. Okay. Right, you, you, um, you sleep. I'll come back tomorrow."
Susan,Okay.
Susan,"So the doctor said I should use as many things as I can to jog your memory. And not just pictures.He said I could use tastes and smells and sounds, so tonight is sounds of the seventies."
Susan,"Well, you know, let me set the scene. Um, we were at this funky little fish joint that you'd been dying to take me to--Cappy's. Do you remember Cappy's? Okay, well, we were there, and, uh, we were just wolfing down the most delicious trout ever--"
Susan,"Oh, it's coming. Um, and--and this 70's cover band, well, they started to play, and--that's how we got our song."
Susan,"At the car wash, whoa, whoa--"
Susan,"Yeah! See how much fun we were? So I dragged you out onto the dance floor, and, well, you were giving me this look--sort of like the look you're giving me right now--and, um, I started to do this--and then you did this--"
Susan,"Oh, Mike. Come on, you're not even trying to remember! It was fun! Oh, I know. Okay, sing with me. Car wash, talkin' about the car wash. Whoo, car wash, yeah."
Susan,"Okay, Mike, I-I am not doing this to upset you. I'm doing this to help."
Susan,"Okay, well, I'll go, but I am not giving up on you. You know, you are going to remember the night that we danced to ""Car Wash,"" and not just because it was fun, but because later that night, we did some things that, trust me, are worth remembering."
Susan,Hi. You're new. Where's Marcy?
Susan,"Oh, I'm just going to see Mike Delfino."
Susan,"Uh, that's my macaroni and cheese. I-I was hoping it would trigger Mike's memory. I made it the first time we met two years ago."
Susan,Edie?
Susan,"Uh, yeah. What is she doing here?"
Susan,You!
Susan,I've been wondering why Mike's been so cold to me. Now it all makes sense.
Susan,"Oh, that's my mac and cheese. Don't change the subject. What have you been telling him about me?"
Susan,Me? But why doesn't she leave? I-I'm the one who's been here every day for the last six months.
Susan,"Girlfriend?! Okay, you know what? I want Marcy's number in Honolulu, and I want it right now."
Susan,What?!
Susan,"No, what are you-- Oh, this is ridiculous! I mean, who am I disturbing? It's a coma ward! Don't you want them to wake up?!"
Susan,"Julie, there you are. I think I found a way to get through to Mike."
Susan,Shh! I thought you could use some fresh air.
Susan,"Oh, this is Hank, and he has very kindly offered to take us on a little field trip today for bucks an hour."
Susan,"Uh, just a little jaunt down Memory Lane."
Susan,"No, no.What we're doing today is a little more low-key. Don't worry. You're totally safe. We're not doing anything wrong."
Susan,Punch it!
Susan,"And when I locked myself out of the house, that's where the bush was that you found me in. Naked. Surely you remember that."
Susan,"Ouch, that hurts.Um, okay, remember this spot?This is where we sat in your truck and had our first kiss."
Susan,"Mike, why are you being this way?"
Susan,"Okay,I know it's hard, but you gotta make an effort,and, you know, if your head is a little foggy, then don't look there. Look in your heart, because I'm in there, just like you're inside mine. Okay, um, this is Mary Alice's house, and this is where we first met. I was setting out my macaroni and cheese, and you were invited--Oh! Ow!"
Susan,"I'm good. Finally, a smile."
Susan,"Well, yeah, I've been known to take a spill or two, but, you know, my doctor says it's an inner ear--wait, you remember that?"
Susan,"Yes! That's progress! See? Oh, it's all gonna come back. We're gonna be us again!"
Susan,"Mike, I don't know what Edie's been telling you, but Ian and I, we're just friends."
Susan,"Yeah, now. Look, you gotta understand. The doctors were telling me that you would probably never wake up, and I just needed somebody to talk to.Mike: And that's what you were doing in the country, talking?"
Susan,"Oh, but you--I was just trying to help him remember.Tell her, Mike.We were-- we were making progress."
Susan,"Oh, uh, Mike!"
Susan,"No, no, no, no! No, no, this--this is not how this ends. No, evil does not triumph over good."
Susan,"Damn straight! You lie, you cheat, you scheme! You ruin people's relationships! I mean, how do you sleep at night?"
Susan,See? Evil! Evil!
Susan,No! You--you--Mike? You don't even want him! You're just doing this to hurt me.
Susan,This should never have happened!
Susan,How do you sleep at night?
Susan,I just dropped my trowel. Thanks.
Susan,Ian! What a surprise.
Susan,"Uh, a little. I-- Just, the last time we saw each other, it was so awkward and complicated."
Susan,"Oh, uh, they're moving along. It's a process."
Susan,"Uh, Edie? Oh, she's just a neighbor. She visits Mike after her Hepatitis C treatments."
Susan,I just--I just don't think that's a good idea.
Susan,You have--
Susan,Mike? It's me. Are you decent?
Susan,Whatcha doing?
Susan,"Believe me, I would love to, but, um, I gotta, I gotta get dinner started for Julie."
Susan,"Oh, you know, what the hell? She's sixteen.If she hasn't figured out how to feed herself by now, I've failed."
Susan,Ahh. That's nice. So where were we?
Susan,"Oh, right. Oh, I wish Paul young was still around. He'd know what to do."
Susan,It was spur-of-the-moment.
Susan,Don't worry. It won't last. You're just fooling yourselves!
Susan,"Oh, I just thought of something. I'm never gonna celebrate a fifty-third wedding anniversary. I'd have to live into my nineties. Oh, my god. I'm gonna die."
Susan,Ah.
Susan,I had passion with Mike. And drama. Lots of drama. Love isn't supposed to be that hard.
Susan,"But, you know, with Ian, everything was always easy. You know, that's the kind of guy I could see myself living into my nineties with."
Susan,I'm Ida Greenberg!
Susan,"Of course I came. Oh! Oh, I just love your house. It always smells like you. Oh, my gosh! What, is the thing, is that tonight?"
Susan,"No! No, no! Actually, I just, I just had something to tell you."
Susan,"Oh, I don't think that's a good idea, 'cause I, I didn't really bring my A game. Is it hot?"
Susan,"Nothing. I just had a few drinks with my girlfriends, and thank god, because it gave me the courage to come over here and tell you really in my heart."
Susan,"But first, I think I should use the powder room."
Susan,"Oh, I'm so sorry that you had to see that."
Susan,Oh!
Susan,Oh. Did you stay here all night?
Susan,"Please, keep the food references to a minimum."
Susan,Bless you. Mmm. So what else happened?
Susan,Mm.
Susan,Susan.
Susan,Susan.
Susan,"Oh, I didn't say that."
Susan,"A little of both, so, Boozan."
Susan,I'd love to go to France someday.
Susan,"Hello, Carolyn."
Susan,What is this?
Susan,Edie's nephew? Since when are you friends with him?
Susan,Did you have any?
Susan,"Oh,I cannot believe your timing.I'm about to fly off to Paris,and you're inviting boys over for Oktoberfest."
Susan,"The last time I checked, I was the parent."
Susan,"Okay, I know I--And don't play the parent card with me."
Susan,"Well, a simple ��_��_��_No, I didn't drink any beer' would've sufficed."
Susan,"Nope, we're fine. Besides, I can't leave until Julie gets back with my toothpaste."
Susan,Really?
Susan,"Okay, I'm gonna need some help with this big baby. Go! Zip, zip, zip!"
Susan,"It's my first time in Paris. I want it to be magical, and that means accessories, so back off."
Susan,"No, no, I am not gonna spend your money."
Susan,And you just tell me this now?
Susan,"Hello? Yes, this is her mother. What?"
Susan,You told me you weren't even friends with him. Now you're shoplifting together?
Susan,"Yeah, I wanna believe that, but suddenly you're having boys over, you're drinking beer--"
Susan,"Listen, I have somebody in the car who's late for a plane. Can you give me two minutes?"
Susan,I am so disappointed in you.
Susan,"Hello, Carolyn."
Susan,"I'm sorry. I know, Julie picked a lousy time to rebel. I just can't fly off and ignore it."
Susan,You have a lot of meetings anyway. We'll go some other time. I can't leave Julie right now.
Susan,"Oh, that's responsible parenting. Stealing whiskey? ��_��_��_That's it, young lady. I'm taking you to Paris.'"
Susan,I'm sorry.
Susan,What the hell's going on?
Susan,What?
Susan,"Excuse me, what's going-- what's going on?"
Susan,Carolyn! Open up! My daughter's inside!
Susan,"Yeah, but there's a crazy woman in there!"
Susan,"Excuse me, my name is Susan Mayer."
Susan,I would like to trade places with one of the people inside.Don't-- don't you do that?
Susan,"Okay, you don't have to be nasty. My daughter is inside there."
Susan,"Attention! Attention, Carolyn Bigsby!"
Susan,"This is Susan Mayer-- again. First of all, I'm sorry for the ""crazy lady"" remark. Second, I have a proposition for you."
Susan,"Let Julie go and take me instead. Repeat, take me. I will be a model hostage. If we have a deal, signal by sending Julie to the--"
Susan,"No, take your hands off me! Carolyn, Carolyn! Call my cell! It's 572--"
Susan,"Thank you. I'm sure Lynette's gonna be fine, too."
Susan,Right.
Susan,The last thing I said to her was that she disappointed me.
Susan,You're going back to modeling?
Susan,"We are. We're just gonna miss you, that's all."
Susan,"Oh, my gosh.Lynette."
Susan,They don't?
Susan,Wait. Julie's gonna know we came home early from the restaurant to check up on her. I don't want her to think I'm overprotective and clingy.
Susan,"Yeah, it's been a week. I'm getting on her nerves."
Susan,"Okay. Wait, if we hated the restaurant, then why are we bringing home food?"
Susan,"Wait, wait, wait, wait! Are you kidding?! That's lobster! Okay, I thought the restaurant was fantastic, and you were the fussy snob who was impossible to please."
Susan,Because you're British.
Susan,"Oh, let it go. We came home because I was worried about you, and with good reason. You, put on your shirt and get out."
Susan,Who cares? Go!
Susan,"Yes, and I am grateful, but I found a way to say thank you without taking my top off."
Susan,"No, Ian, am I overreacting here?"
Susan,"Julie,that boy drinks,he steals,and now I find him mauling you on my couch?That's it.I forbid you to see him."
Susan,"Yeah? Well, I choose to ground you. Two weeks, baby."
Susan,"Well, then you won't go to school. I'll home school you."
Susan,"Yes, and you will be poorly educated, and you won't get into college, and you will work for minimum wage for the rest of your life, all because of that boy! I hope you're happy!"
Susan,"Julie Mayer, you get back here! You're grounded, remember?! Edie Britt, I wanna talk to you."
Susan,You keep your nephew away from my daughter or else.
Susan,"Are you crazy?! If we don't do something, those two could end up having sex!"
Susan,"Oh, my God. You don't--"
Susan,How can you be so calm about this?
Susan,Mike--You're out of the hospital.
Susan,"Before we begin, would either of you like some cookies, milk, lemonade, perhaps?"
Susan,"Ah, cutting to the chase. I like it. I have a confession to make. This whole dating drama has been keeping me up at night, and I hate being the bi*chy, naggy Mom. When it comes to parenting, I am much more comfortable playing the good cop. Do you see where I'm going with this, kids?"
Susan,"Well, in that case. Meet the bad cop."
Susan,Yep! Get him.
Susan,"Look, you defied my wishes, you broke my rules. Did you really think I was just gonna throw in the towel? Face it. I outsmarted you."
Susan,What?
Susan,How did that come up?
Susan,"Big picture, Karl. His hand up our daughter's shirt."
Susan,That is the subject!
Susan,I don't know! It's complicated.
Susan,It's not what you think.
Susan,What? No! I don't take orders from you!
Susan,"Exactly. Thank you. Wait, no, that does not apply to you."
Susan,"Your feelings? My God, you are the worst bad cop ever! Go to your room. Not you! Get back here!"
Susan,"No, I'm not!"
Susan,"No, I'm good. Thanks."
Susan,Sixteen years of being perfect. You were due.
Susan,Relationships have nothing to do with good judgment. It doesn't matter how smart you are. You can still get hurt. You do your homework. I'm gonna finish the laundry. Okay.
Susan,"Hey, you're back! I'd give you a hug, but I'm really sweaty. So how was New York?"
Susan,Bree said you got a job on the first day. You're such a star! I want details.
Susan,So you're not gonna move to New York?
Susan,"Oh, thank God! We were all so worried we were losing you. Okay, now I'm hugging you. Oh, it's amazing. Your life is such an adventure. Can't wait to see what you do next."
Susan,I'm just saying that we never spend the night at your house.
Susan,"Oh, it's also a disaster area. I didn't get a chance to clean it today."
Susan,Oops!
Susan,"All right, oh--but let's make it a quickie 'cause you are wasting water."
Susan,Who are you?
Susan,"Oh, no, I'm your boss' girlfriend. Surely he mentioned me."
Susan,Loving that idea.
Susan,"Um, yeah, that sounds great. You pick."
Susan,"Well, of course."
Susan,Is the coast clear? I don't wanna flash the help again.
Susan,How long has Rupert worked for you?
Susan,"So you're that close, and you never told him about me?"
Susan,"Well, that explains why he was a little cold to me this morning."
Susan,"Oh, no, don't do that. That'll just make it worse. I get it. He loved Jane. He doesn't know me. You know, I'll just have to charm him, warm him up a little."
Susan,"Great. Nine o'clock in the morning, and I have to put on a slinky, black cocktail dress. Hey, here's an idea. You keep some things in a drawer at my house. Would it be okay if I had one here?"
Susan,"Your shower has six power nozzles. With or without you, I'll be back."
Susan,I don't need much. One of those will do.
Susan,Wow! Your timing's perfect.
Susan,"Yeah, Rupe, I hope we can be good friends, 'cause you're gonna be seeing lots more of me."
Susan,"Hi, Rupert! I went to the mall and bought a change of clothes for the weekend, and while I was there, I got something for you. I thought you could wear it on your day off. Do you like it?"
Susan,"That was good. You. I wanna party with you. Hey, I was thinking this afternoon maybe we could go look for that drawer."
Susan,"Well, let me help you, and we can talk. There is so much I wanna know about you. Who is Rupert Cavanaugh? What makes him tick?"
Susan,"Oh, isn't the master bedroom down that way?"
Susan,"Okay, well, you certainly didn't have to go to all that trouble."
Susan,"No, I just, um--well, all I really needed was just a little-- little drawer, and, uh--this is just so far away and what is that smell?"
Susan,Did you consider removing the body?
Susan,Why do you have to be this way?
Susan,"Listen, I know how you feel about Jane, but if you could just give me a chance--I mean, come on, you can't possibly hate me this much, can you?"
Susan,"Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine."
Susan,I am Ian's girlfriend.
Susan,"Okay, you are not allowed to call me that."
Susan,"I'm so sorry. I'm, I shouldn't have done that. But, Rupert, you have to admit, it's just a drawer."
Susan,"Okay, you know, that is for Ian to decide."
Susan,But--
Susan,Jane has some beautiful things.
Susan,I get it. As much as I have tried to pretend that it's just you and me. There's three of us in this relationship.
Susan,"No, please, listen--the last couple of months, I thought we've gotten really close, and I have been loving that. I just feel like lately--there's this limit to how far you'll let me in."
Susan,You don't have to push Jane out to let me in.
Susan,No.
Susan,"Okay, well, give me a minute, and I will change into something nice."
Susan,"No, not just yet."
Susan,"Ian, you don't have to do that."
Susan,You have to kiss me. It's the law.
Susan,Your parents? Really?
Susan,"Absolutely. So, I assume this means they know about me?"
Susan,"And they know about me as in ""Mum, Dad, bloody good news. I've got myself a smashing new girlfriend."""
Susan,"Right. So, um, do you want me to make reservations at that little French place?"
Susan,"Okay, I guess it's time we have the conversation. Ian, haven't you ever wondered why I've never cooked for you?"
Susan,I wish. My cooking is not good.
Susan,"Will they be expecting stomach cramps, acid reflux, night sweats?"
Susan,Is it really important that I make them a home-cooked meal?
Susan,"Okay, I'll give it a shot."
Susan,Right--like an ambulance.
Susan,"So I'm cooking dinner for Ian's parents tomorrow night, and it's the first time I'm meeting them, so I sort of wanna impress them."""
Susan,"Well, that's the thing. Uh, so I was hoping, you know, if you're not too busy--"
Susan,Thank you. You are a lifesaver.
Susan,Oh?
Susan,"Bree, you have got to go to the police with all of this."""
Susan,"His wife goes missing, then his mistress turns up dead. What is there to think about?"
Susan,"Sweetie, we all wanna believe the best of the people we care about, but you cannot let your feelings for a man blind you to cold hard facts."""
Susan,"Oh, my God!"
Susan,What's going on?
Susan,What?!
Susan,Is Edie getting you a good lawyer?
Susan,What? Why?
Susan,"Still. It's tacky. Well, okay then, uh--I'll help get you out. Uh, what's your bail?"
Susan,Oh.
Susan,I want to.
Susan,What?
Susan,I don't have to. I know you didn't.
Susan,"There's an explanation for this, and we're gonna figure it out. Don't worry about a thing."
Susan,Come in.
Susan,"Hey. Wow, oh, those are gorgeous."
Susan,Don't worry. Dinner's all taken care of. We're having blanquette de veau and a grand marnier souffl��_��_.
Susan,Five-thirty. But I am rewarming it all by myself.
Susan,Mike was arrested for murder.
Susan,"I mean, of course he's totally innocent. I'm just trying to help him find a lawyer."
Susan,"Yeah. Edie dumped him. Okay, I know how this looks but I just feel bad. He's just a friend now."
Susan,"You are the only one allowed to ravish me these days, so stop worrying."
Susan,"Hi, ladies!"
Susan,So did you tell the police that you think Orson killed Monique?
Susan,"But Mike is in jail, and you said yourself you thought Orson did it."
Susan,What are you saying? You think Mike is guilty?
Susan,Her teeth were pulled. You don't think that's worth telling the cops she was messing around with a dentist?
Susan,Mike is innocent. I know that in my heart.
Susan,"If you're so sure that Orson is innocent, why don't we go through his things? Where's his desk?"
Susan,"I don't know. A blackmail letter, a necklace made of teeth?"
Susan,"Well, I am certainly not playing with a woman that is willing to let Mike take the fall for her psycho husband."
Susan,Fine. I'll cook myself.
Susan,"And if you take Orson back, you do the same."
Susan,Hi! I'm sorry I'm late. Where are your folks?
Susan,"Oh. Well, that's too bad. Well, no harm done then, huh?"
Susan,But they're not here.
Susan,"Uh, Bree and I sort of had a fight. Look, I'm awfully sorry that I'm late. I had an emergency."
Susan,I'm pretty sure that Bree's husband murdered the woman the cops think Mike killed. I went to his office--
Susan,"No, I found evidence. Look. Orson was committed to a mental institution for over a year. I mean, doesn't that suggest- he's some sort of--"
Susan,"I said I was sorry, Ian. I have to help Mike. I'm all he's got."
Susan,What?
Susan,You would do that for Mike?
Susan,Why?
Susan,"As jealous ultimatums go, that's very flattering, but, I don't think that's necessary. Mike and I are done."
Susan,You would really get him the best lawyer in town?
Susan,"Well, okay then. You know, Mike barely remembers me. What makes you so sure he would fall in love with me again?"
Susan,I am not playing with a woman that is willing to let Mike take the fall for her psycho husband.
Susan,Bree let Orson move back in.
Susan,Yesterday.
Susan,"Well, mine haven't, and I know something that Bree probably doesn't. When Orson was seventeen, he spent time in a mental institution."
Susan,I snuck into his office and rifled through his things.
Susan,"No, but it's a piece of the puzzle. I mean, he did have an affair with her. And when you combine that with the fact that his first wife went missing--"
Susan,I'm out of lipstick. Can I borrow yours?
Susan,Cherry Berry?
Susan,"Oh, I so did not need to know that."
Susan,Down to the jailhouse to talk to Mike.
Susan,"Yeah. But somebody's gotta tell him about his new lawyer. Otherwise, the guy's gonna show up,and he's gonna go, ""who the hell is he?"" Ian gets that. Besides, why would it be a big deal? Mike and I are over."
Susan,"Yeah, and he is fantastic. You cannot believe the scum he has gotten off. Not that you're scum. But, you know, if you were, you'd be sitting pretty."
Susan,"Oh, well, you know, we'll figure that out later."
Susan,"Um, yeah, about that--it's Ian. He's not crazy about me spending time with my ex."
Susan,"I remember, and I guess that's enough for him. I'm sorry."
Susan,"Take care of yourself, Mike."
Susan,"Detective Ridley, my name is Susan Mayer, and I'm calling to ""drop a dime"" on someone. That's the expression, right?"
Susan,"Good.Uh, his name is Orson Hodge, and he had an affair with the woman that you think Mike Delfino killed."
Susan,"Well, he does, and so he's pretending he didn't. That's suspicious, right?"
Susan,"Oh, uh, can you hold on?"
Susan,Hello?
Susan,Bree? Uh--hi. Can you hold on a second?
Susan,It's Orson's wife. She can't know I called you.
Susan,"Right. Sorry. Uh, I'm just new to this whole snitch thing. Hold on, okay?"
Susan,"Bree, hi. Sorry about that. Damn telemarketer. So what can I do for you?"
Susan,"Bree, I am so relieved."
Susan,"Oh, uh--sure."
Susan,"Bree--I just want you to know that no matter what, your friendship means the world to me."
Susan,It's me again. You should also know that Orson spent a year in an asylum.
Susan,Hi. I brought you a bundt cake. Don't worry.I didn't make it.
Susan,I was really touched by your call. It was so big of you.
Susan,So Alma's alive. Big deal. We still don't know what went down between Orson and Monique.
Susan,It may be a little late for that.
Susan,I didn't know they were gonna come tonight.
Susan,"Well,obviously,you weren't going to.They needed to know that that dead woman was Orson's mistress."
Susan,"Did you seriously think I could sit on information that would exonerate Mike? I mean, if you had seen his face in jail the other day--"
Susan,Yeah. I--just to tell him about the lawyer. I know that Mike is innocent.
Susan,We do. Can we talk about this later?
Susan,Ian. Wait!
Susan,Excuse me?
Susan,Bree!
Susan,"Okay, Bree, I know you're angry, but for the sake of our friendship--"
Susan,"Ian, please, I just lost one of my best friends. I can't lose you, too."
Susan,But you had to know that I would go one more time to just explain everything.
Susan,"Well, that's just crazy! Why are you acting like a crazy person?"
Susan,Things are different now! I-I love you! You--you don't have to worry about that anymore. If we're gonna make this relationship work then you have to trust me and why are you smiling at me?
Susan,Yeah? So?
Susan,"Yes, I have."
Susan,"Well, I'm saying it now.I love you. Do you have a problem with that? No, ma'am."
Susan,You--you--you can't kiss me now. I'm yelling at you.
Susan,"Well--don't--don't think that you can get out of this, you know, by just--oh, god. Oh, yeah, uh, oh, yeah, right--right there. Oh, right there."
Susan,Hi. Bye.
Susan,"Oh! I was just, uh--I lost an earring."
Susan,"Oh! I found it. Austin, I would like to talk to my daughter privately."
Susan,Why were you two talking about condoms?
Susan,"Don't change the subject. Are you two having sex? Because I thought that I raised you to be smarter than that. Don't you realize that sex is not fun and games? It's dangerous. Every time you turn around, there's a new disease. Do you want it to burn when you pee?"
Susan,Sex kills!
Susan,What?
Susan,Really?
Susan,"Oh, thank god. If you're not having sex, why were you talking about condoms?"
Susan,Yes. That's right. A condom alone will not protect you.
Susan,So I was in the middle of totally freaking out when Julie assured me that she's not having sex. I can't tell you how relieved I was.
Susan,"Don't say ""uh-huh"" like that.Julie wouldn't lie to me.If she says she's not having sex,then she's not having sex."
Susan,"You can't say ""ooh-kay"" like that, either. Julie's not like other girls. She's a straight-""A"" student."
Susan,"Ok, you search the closet. I'm gonna look under the bed."
Susan,You are gonna make a really good mother someday.
Susan,"Uh, it's small. It's got a plaid cover. Oh, and when you find it, you have to read it because I promised her that I would always respect her privacy. Now help me flip this mattress."
Susan,You found it?
Susan,"No, you cannot borrow it."
Susan,To watch movies.
Susan,See? It's just a tape.
Susan,"Is this Dr. Marvin Tashman? Hi. My name is Susan Mayer. Um, my daughter Julie came in to see you--Yes, about birth control. So I'm just curious--Where do you get off prescribing that without my consent?! What?! No, I most certainly was not there. What do I look like? I don't have blonde hair."
Susan,"Wait, did my blonde hair have dark roots?"
Susan,You got my daughter the pill?!
Susan,Don't you walk away from me!
Susan,"Yes, we do. You might have gotten your first diaphragm with milk money, But that doesn't give you the right to corrupt my daughter!"
Susan,You do not get to decide this for her! What were you thinking?!
Susan,"Oh, you know what? It wasn't till your rotten nephew came to town that Julie was a perfect kid, And now she's lying and scheming and having casual sex! She's just a boob job away from being you!"
Susan,"Don't worry, I'm not gonna get mad. Just sit down. You know what upset me the most? That you didn't trust me enough to tell me the truth."
Susan,"Well, of course I freaked out. I'm a parent. You know, we hope that our children will wait to have sex till after we're dead."
Susan,"Okay, that's the other thing. That cannot happen anymore. You and I have always had an amazing relationship. Let's not mess it up now."
Susan,"Yeah, um--about that--God, I wish there was a pill you could take to protect your heart."
Susan,"Honey, I was over at Edie's today and I walked in the door and--"
Susan,He's not crazy about me spending time with my ex.
Susan,"This is your new lawyer, Alan Marcus. Alan, this is Mike Delfino."
Susan,Don't you love this guy? What's the strategy?
Susan,Pleading guilty? What kind of a strategy is that?
Susan,That's still ten years in prison.
Susan,"With a better lawyer,he could be out in zero.We need to find a lawyer who believes that he's innocent."
Susan,My feelings for him? Are we gonna do this again?
Susan,I have told you I love you a thousand times. Where is all this jealousy coming from?
Susan,"What? No, Ian, we have to talk about this."
Susan,Is it Gaby's birthday?
Susan,What?
Susan,Zach Young? Our Zach Young? How does he afford diamonds?
Susan,"Yeah, I thought it was in a trust, and he couldn't touch it."
Susan,"Wow. So Zach Young is loaded, huh?"
Susan,"Oh, come on. Mike needs a great lawyer. Zach can afford a great lawyer."
Susan,It's one little date.
Susan,He's matured-- to the tune of a billion dollars. Please do this--for Mike.
Susan,"Okay, I deserve the pimping remark, but let's not pretend that, you know, we're above teenagers. Gaby, you're all I've got."
Susan,Thank you! This is a noble thing you're doing.
Susan,"Oh, 'cause he's a great kid, and he's gonna want to help Mike--and you're not gonna be wearing a bra when you ask him out."
Susan,"Ian, I'm sorry, too. We've got to stop fighting like this."
Susan,Oh. Ian--
Susan,The hospital?
Susan,"Um, no, actually, I'm a friend of Ian's. He asked me to come--for Jane."
Susan,"So, Erika, you were fighting with that guy when I came in. Have you had a lot of those organ donor people around today?"
Susan,No. What about them?
Susan,What?
Susan,Jane cheated on Ian? When was this?
Susan,"I'm just stunned. So I guess they worked it out, right?"
Susan,Poor Ian.
Susan,Hi.
Susan,"Uh, sweetie--I don't think she's gonna make it that long."
Susan,You've done everything you could. She knows that you love her.
Susan,"I'm gonna put the phone up to Jane's ear, and you can tell her whatever you need to, okay?"
Susan,Hey. You're back.
Susan,Maybe a little.
Susan,"Actually, yeah, there is."
Susan,I can't see you anymore. I want you to understand it doesn't have anything to do with you. It's just--
Susan,It's not--
Susan,Good luck with everything.
Susan,What do you think of this one?
Susan,You're right. I'll keep looking.
Susan,"No, it'll be fine. Ian wants me there."
Susan,"Okay, yes, it'll be weird. But it's not about me. This is about Jane and Ian. What if I wore this one?"
Susan,"I have got to get more depressing clothes. Okay, I just need to keep a low profile through the memorial, 'cause once I get through this, Ian can officially introduce me as his girlfriend, and we'll finally be a normal, non-adulterous couple. What does this one say to you?"
Susan,Sold.
Susan,So how are you holding up?
Susan,"Oh! No, I wanna, um, keep a low profile."
Susan,"Okay, that's enough."
Susan,I sure as hell do.
Susan,Oops. Watch yourself.
Susan,"I'm sorry for eavesdropping, but don't you think your conversation is a little inappropriate? I mean, we're here to grieve, not cruise."
Susan,Susan Mayer. I'm-- a friend of the family.
Susan,"Look, just to save you the embarrassment, Ian's seeing someone."
Susan,"I'm not at liberty to say. Under the circumstances, they'd prefer to keep it quiet. I don't believe it. If there was some bimbo in the picture, I'd have heard about it."
Susan,"Okay, it's me."
Susan,I'm the bimbo. He's my meat. All righty. I just wanted to clear that up. And now I'm going to go find myself a seat with a--better view.
Susan,"Oh, dear God."
Susan,Hey.
Susan,Yeah. I'll be having night terrors from now on--which I deserve.
Susan,I'm so sorry I ruined Jane's funeral.
Susan,"Yes, I did. It's just--"
Susan,"I thought after we got through this really--painful day, things would start to get better. I thought I could be more a part of your world. Now all your friends and family are just gonna think of me as the crazy lady from Jane's funeral. Oh, God. Oh, Ian. Okay, this is not supposed to be about me. You should be upstairs--saying good-bye. I'm just gonna hide out here with the departed until everybody leaves."
Susan,"Ian, are you proposing to me?"
Susan,"Well, well, uh, before you say another word--take a look around."
Susan,"I hadn't really thought a lot about this moment,but when I did--the table we were at didn't have a blood gutter."
Susan,Yes. I accept your proposal to propose.
Susan,For the sake of our friendship--
Susan,You doing okay?
Susan,"Andrew, what are you doing at the hospital?"
Susan,Hey.
Susan,"I just heard from Andrew what happened. I had to come see you. If you want me to go, uh--"
Susan,"I know we've been fighting. Something like this happens, it just puts everything into perspective. I am so sorry. It was all my fault. If I hadn't got so caught up in protecting Mike--"
Susan,Do you know something?
Susan,"Oh, my God. Does this have something to do with Orson's accident?"
Susan,Of course. I should let you rest.
Susan,We never really stopped.
Susan,"Ian! Ian, you're not gonna believe this. Bree just told me she can prove Mike's innocent."
Susan,It's true. He's gonna be a free man. Isn't that great?
Susan,Here. I'm gonna go get Bree some flowers. I'll be right back.
Susan,"The place came out great, huh?"
Susan,"Yeah. Except for Orson, who fell off a roof. You know anything about that?"
Susan,I heard you talking to Carlos. Now answer the question.
Susan,It always is with you.
Susan,"Absolutely, yes!"
Susan,Hey. Where were you off to so early this morning?
Susan,"Ian, oh, you can't be serious. Oh, oh, that's just--too much. It's huge."
Susan,"Oh, no. No one's saying smaller. No, that's crazy talk. Rock me."
Susan,"Oh! Oh, my! Oh, it's so beautiful!"
Susan,"Oh! Oh! Oh, okay, nobody move. I got it."
Susan,"No, it's okay. I can get it resized."
Susan,Reception?
Susan,What's the rush? Am I pregnant?
Susan,Are you sure? 'Cause you seem a little anxious.
Susan,"Mike, what are you doing here?"
Susan,Was that the ring that you bought for--
Susan,"Uh, yeah, I, uh, have to get this sized. It's--it's a little loose."
Susan,No.
Susan,Thanks.
Susan,"Oh, no, th--"
Susan,It's perfect.
Susan,"Oh! Oh, s-sorry."
Susan,How was the game?
Susan,Yes!
Susan,"God, I'm so nervous."
Susan,"Oh, thanks. I needed to hear to that."
Susan,I'm so sorry.
Susan,Here they come.
Susan,"It's so great to finally meet both of you. Oh, this is for you."
Susan,Anyone hungry?
Susan,"No, it is. It's vittles. So, can I get you something to drink?"
Susan,"Um, guys? Don't worry. She's all right."
Susan,"Dahlia, I am so sorry about the--"
Susan,"Oh, not that chair. That's the wobbler. I'm saving up for a new set. Here, sit here."
Susan,"Julie? No, she's at her father's this weekend. Is something wrong?"
Susan,"No, Karl's alive and kicking, sadly."
Susan,No. Of course not.
Susan,Just adultery?
Susan,"Yeah, well, with Karl, I was more, ""Divorce the ass and seize the assets."" So you better watch out. Betrayal makes me vengeful."
Susan,Your father's been up there for twenty minutes. Are you sure he's okay?
Susan,I set your mother on fire.
Susan,"Oh, my God! I'm so sorry! Are you all right?"
Susan,Let me get you a towel.
Susan,Hello!
Susan,Were you also thinking of getting her a lace bra?
Susan,Just take the robe off. And whatever you have on underneath--consider that yours.
Susan,"So, uh, what won't you ask me?"
Susan,You mean a prenup?
Susan,"Well, who's getting divorced? I'm in this for keeps."
Susan,"Okay, stop this. We invited you here to celebrate our engagement. Now I'm divorced, and Ian's disinherited?"
Susan,"Trust him, he's not."
Susan,I should probably get these inside.
Susan,"Mike, it wasn't a movie. That was us."
Susan,Yeah. That was the first night that we spent together. I wanted to surprise you.
Susan,"They weren't all raw. I was trying to spell ""Mike,"" and the ""m"" was goopy, but the ""ike"" was delicious. You loved it."
Susan,"Actually, no, it was gross. But you were really sweet. You just gave me a lot of kisses and said not to worry, I'd get a lot of chances to make you pancakes 'cause--"
Susan,You remember.
Susan,I should go 'cause Ian's parents are here.
Susan,"Oh, please. It's not that bad. I once worked at this fish-and-chip place. I had to wear an eye patch and a stuffed parrot on my shoulder. ""Would you like to hear arrr specials?"""
Susan,How do you think Tom's gonna feel about that?
Susan,"So I guess this means we're babysitting the kids, huh?"
Susan,We got it. Just go.
Susan,What's that?
Susan,"And you brought it to bed? Okay, romance tip number one--"
Susan,Thank you. I don't want your family's stuff. What am I gonna do with half a castle?
Susan,Huh?
Susan,"Well, the difference is huge. I mean, one way you're trusting me, and--And the other way, you're trying to make it official."
Susan,"Ian, do you really want to start our life together making me feel like--I'm on probation?"
Susan,Really? I think it's about someone else. He just wanted me to help him remember something.
Susan,Mike. I saw you watching us. We were just talking.
Susan,"Okay, I'll sign it."
Susan,I don't need to. I trust you.
Susan,"I'd like you to say, ""We don't need this. We trust you."" But you don't, so I'll sign it. And once I do, I am going to earn your trust by being a good wife to Ian."
Susan,"I mean it. I am going to be loving and faithful and above all, honest. There'll be no secrets with Ian. I'll tell him everything."
Susan,"What I'm trying to say is, there'll be no topic that I need to--skirt. No issue that I won't--address. I won't conceal my true thoughts under garments of secrecy."
Susan,You can count on it.
Susan,"Mike,it wasn't a movie.That was us."
Susan,That was the first night that we spent together.
Susan,I saw you watching us.We were just talking.
Susan,You've been awfully quiet since we left the market. Is everything okay?
Susan,Really?
Susan,Oh. Okay.
Susan,To London? Permanently?
Susan,"Yeah, it's sudden. My whole life is here. I mean, my friends. You know, Julie is still in school--"
Susan,"Oh, my God. Are you okay?"
Susan,I can feel the car sinking. We're gonna have to get to shore.
Susan,Deep enough. Come on! Let's move!
Susan,What?! You said you played water polo!
Susan,How can you not know how to swim? Didn't you go to summer camp?
Susan,"Okay, don't panic. Just grab onto my neck, and I'll swim for the both of us."
Susan,"If you stay here, you'll definitely drown. You see how my plan is better?"
Susan,"Look, there's somebody on the shore! It's Mike! He's here."
Susan,"Oh, my God. Mike, you saved our lives."
Susan,"And our cheese! Ian, can you believe it? Mike saved our cheese!"
Susan,"What, you've never heard of a midnight snack? Unless you can think of something else that I can nibble on."
Susan,It's a thank-you gift for Mike.
Susan,I don't think you can really thank somebody too many times For saving your life.
Susan,Saying what?
Susan,You?
Susan,"Okay, that's a good point."
Susan,"But we were in a bit of a jam there, and--I don't think you should be embarrassed for needing a little help."
Susan,Emasculated? Who said emasculated? And why are you not kissing me now?
Susan,I guess we're gonna cut right to the--
Susan,Don't worry. Happens to everybody. Maybe it would help to talk about it.
Susan,All right. We won't talk about it. Want some cheese?
Susan,"Well, he's busy. Isn't he debating the mayor tonight?"
Susan,And why don't you put your water on that lower shelf?
Susan,Move away from that topic.
Susan,"Oh, come on."
Susan,It's true. She has a little room with magazines and an aquarium.
Susan,"I think if you really like this guy, you should just be honest. You should tell him that you feel a little hurt--"
Susan,"I just bought it. But if you don't like it, feel free to rip it off me."
Susan,"Well, that's okay. You gotta work, you gotta work. So, um--I was thinking about London. Julie's gonna be applying to college as soon, and, um, a year abroad could give her a real boost. So--let's do it."
Susan,"Yes. I wanna spend time in your world. I wanna play cricket, and I wanna eat crumpets, And I want to use the word ghastly."
Susan,My thigh's getting an inkling.
Susan,"Not mine, okay? That way, we can use it when we visit."
Susan,I don't want sell my house. Everybody I love is on this street.
Susan,What happened?
Susan,You weren't tired a second ago.
Susan,Why not?
Susan,"Well, I'm not used to guys bailing on me in the middle of foreplay."
Susan,What?
Susan,"You're not actually--okay. That's it--I've had it. Really, I can't have this conversation one more time. I've done nothing but prove my love to you for the last year and you cannot shut up about Mike."
Susan,"Well, you don't have to trust Mike! You have to trust me, and you don't! That's what going to England's about, isn't it? You're just trying to get me away from Mike. Well, you know what? Screw it. I'm not going. And if you ever bring up his name again, we're over. Got it? Over!"
Susan,This is from me and Ian.
Susan,"Yeah, well, you know, you try to think of a more appropriate ""thank you for saving my life"" gift."
Susan,Good. I should go.
Susan,I'm good.
Susan,"Yeah, it's just, um--you know, Ian and I had a had a little--thing."
Susan,"Hi. Ian, about what I said--"
Susan,Don't panic.
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,Ow! Damn! Thumbtack!
Susan,"No, no, I got it. Oh, wait. Here we go."
Susan,"Well, at least it'll keep me from stabbing myself while I look."
Susan,Mike?
Susan,"Sure, but we can't keep leaning on him for everything.""Mike, we're drowning. Save us."" ""Mike, it's dark. Give us a flashlight."" Let's go ask Gaby."
Susan,Dinner?
Susan,"Well, Ian, you've tasted my cooking. It's not a thank-you. It's revenge."
Susan,"Well, let's not bother him tonight. You know, I don't really even need a flashlight. My eyes have totally adjusted to the dark."
Susan,"Don't walk in the kitchen. Anyway, where is your sense of romance? It's a blackout. You have a defenseless lady. Getting any ideas?"
Susan,Kiss me.
Susan,"Yeah. Yeah, why not? Sure. You know what? Do you wanna run this ice cream side before it melts?"
Susan,"Look, Ian is going to come invite you to dinner friday, and you are not--I repeat--not going to accept."
Susan,"He wants to thank you for saving us, and he wants to show that he's not jealous of you. How's that for irony?"
Susan,I was in shock.
Susan,Because we had just had a fight--about you.
Susan,"Mike, I am marrying Ian. We have hired a caterer. We are going with the salmon, so just back off!"
Susan,"Hi, Ian. I just asked Mike. He can't make it."
Susan,"Mmm! God, that is so good!"
Susan,"No. No, I'm gonna go with the crab cakes and the little quesadillas. Well, all we need is a wedding cake, and we're done."
Susan,I just guess I'm in a rush.
Susan,"Oh, no, no, no. No, I'm not pregnant. No, I just know know what I want, which is Ian. So I'm just eager to you know, no- not get it over with, per se, but just to get to the good part, which is the marriage to Ian."
Susan,"Oh, so you're not seeing anyone?"
Susan,"Well, are you free for dinner tomorrow?"
Susan,"Well, there's this guy coming to dinner, and he is single and handsome and charming and--"
Susan,"Oh, uh--he's just a neighbor."
Susan,"Hi. Um, Mike, I want you to meet Maggie Gilroy."
Susan,"You need to move on, okay?"
Susan,"Well, I'm not available, so if you feel like kissing someone tonight, point those lips at Maggie."
Susan,Did I mention that Maggie is an amazing chef? We're embarrassed to be cooking for her.
Susan,He was totally innocent.
Susan,But he was cleared. All charges dropped. Here. Eat this.
Susan,Sorry.
Susan,Great.
Susan,Thanks a lot. Now Maggie thinks you're Charles Manson.
Susan,Don't say that.
Susan,I don't wanna talk about it.
Susan,You know what I would have said. It doesn't matter now.
Susan,"Maggie, these cakes are fantastic."
Susan,Themes?
Susan,Wow. It's kinda hard to decide.
Susan,I don't know.
Susan,"No, I know what they taste like. I'm just torn, okay?"
Susan,It's not just a cake. It's a major decision!
Susan,"How would that look? ""Oh, hey, everybody! Here's my wedding cake. Oh, and what's that over there? It's my other wedding cake. I have to pick, and I will! So just stop pressuring me, okay? I'm sorry. I think I was just having a little sugar rush."
Susan,No. It's nothing.
Susan,No. It--it was days ago.
Susan,No! He--he pounced.
Susan,You bet me in a game of poker?
Susan,And if he won?
Susan,Get out!
Susan,"You, too. I've had it with both of you. You're tugging at me like I'm some kind of wishbone."
Susan,"No, I am beyond upset. You two want a decision? Well, here's what I decide. There will be no kissing, and there will be no wedding, and there will be no damn cake!"
Susan,You bet me in a game of poker?
Susan,"Get out. There will be no kissing,and there will be no wedding."
Susan,"Testing. One, two, three, testing."
Susan,For ten years? It's crazy. Has anybody talked to her?
Susan,"Oh, I saw the curtain move. I think I saw a hand."
Susan,"Oh, that's right. She babysat your kids."
Susan,Do you think she actually killed him?
Susan,"Hell, there's some things we don't need to know about."
Susan,Who is it this time?
Susan,No.
Susan,I don't care.
Susan,"Oh, good. I hope the thorns rip him to shreds."
Susan,They bet me in a game of poker. They made decisions about my life over a hand of five-card stud. Wrong does not even begin to cover it.
Susan,"Yes. I don't need a man. I don't even need sex. I went without it the first sixteen years--twenty-two years of my life, and I can go a few more."
Susan,What?
Susan,Don't soft-pedal it. Let 'em know I mean business.
Susan,Rip 'em!
Susan,And support you means--acting like we're in junior high?
Susan,"Yes, and do you know who I blame? I blame Karl and Mike. Why isn't anybody mad at them? I mean, let's face it. The men-- they get away with murder. They're scum!"
Susan,"Oh, Gaby, that's not fair. Nobody really liked Patty to begin with."
Susan,"Excuse me! Uh, hey! Excuse me. That's my space!"
Susan,"Hey, uh, I waited for that spot while the guy made three phone calls and flossed his teeth. You can't just steal it."
Susan,"Yeah, and I'm about to do this on purpose, too."
Susan,I'm taking my damn space!
Susan,Say you're sorry.
Susan,Say it!
Susan,"Say, ""I'm a rude, arrogant bastard who needs to treat women with courtesy and respect!"""
Susan,"Oh, all right, take his side!"
Susan,"Look, whatever that court report says, I do not have anger issues. I was just having a bad day."
Susan,A very bad day.
Susan,Work is great. You could just sign that paper and tell the judge I'm fine.
Susan,"Family's terrific. Seriously, you're just wasting your time here."
Susan,"Can you imagine? I mean, finding out that two men you trusted bet you in a poker game. I mean, how demeaning is that?"
Susan,I told you--hurt and betrayed.
Susan,"Well--I was engaged to Ian, so--obviously I loved him."
Susan,How we doing on time?
Susan,"Okay, fine, I loved him. I still love him, and I love Ian. So I am totally, hopelessly in love with two men."
Susan,"No, this is horrible! This wasn't supposed to happen! I only let myself fall for Ian 'cause I thought Mike was lost to me. And then bang! Suddenly he wants me back, and now I have this choice that I can't possibly make."
Susan,"It's devastating! If I go with Mike, Ian's heart will be broken, and Ian does not deserve that. But how can I reject Mike after all he's been through?"
Susan,Stupid?
Susan,Lynette! What are you doing here?
Susan,"Yeah, only I didn't know Edie was gonna have the party in a park. What if Gaby see us?"
Susan,"Oh. Well, that's a relief."
Susan,"Lynette, what is wrong with you?"
Susan,What? I thought you said she was with Victor.
Susan,Ugh. I wish she'd hurry. I'm terrified of snakes.
Susan,What?
Susan,"Uh, what are we doing here?"
Susan,You are so dead.
Susan,"No, Gaby, be reasonable."
Susan,"Oh, come on!"
Susan,Who was?
Susan,"Probably weren't expecting to see me, huh?"
Susan,"About that, uh, obviously, have been very confused. I finally saw a therapist. Actually, it was sort of a court-ordered thing.Anyway--well, I need to talk to you."
Susan,"I am. I'm gonna marry Ian. Believe me, this wasn't easy, especially when you started to remember how it was between us. Maybe if the timing had been different--"
Susan,"I'm sorry, Mike."
Susan,Deal.
Susan,"Oh, I'm gonna lock up down here. Why don't you go upstairs and warm up the bed?"
Susan,I know.
Susan,Where are you going?
Susan,To England? What's wrong?
Susan,"What? But just ten minutes ago, we were making plans, and you were saying how great we were gonna be together."
Susan,"Well, Ian, I made my choice."
Susan,That's not true. I will get over him.
Susan,"Ian, I love you."
Susan,"Hi, Ida.What's up?"
Susan,"Oh, poor Mr. Henley. He does seem to be getting worse. Thanks for stopping by."
Susan,"No. Uh, what about him?"
Susan,Moved? What do you mean?
Susan,"Well, that doesn't make sense. Mike wouldn't leave without saying good-bye."
Susan,I love you.
Susan,"Hey, Carlos! Wait. Hi. Look, there's some crazy rumor going around that Mike moved."
Susan,"Oh, my God. What--where is he now?"
Susan,"Okay, look, I know that I've put Mike through the wringer, but that's why I have to talk to him--to make it right. He's not answering his cell phone."
Susan,"Okay, Carlos--tell me where to find him."
Susan,"Come on. Just for my peace of mind, I have to know he's okay."
Susan,What am I gonna do go hunt him down? I have a daughter. I have responsibilities.
Susan,"Okay, Julie, I'm out of here. Here's forty bucks on the counter."
Susan,"Yes. If I don't find Mike before he's off that mountain, I may never see him again."
Susan,That's why I have to go. I have to make amends and heal his broken heart.
Susan,"Well, what else can I do? I love him. I have to go."
Susan,"Uh, can I get a map to the hot springs? I'm gonna hike up there."
Susan,Yep.
Susan,Why not?
Susan,"Well, it's my daughter's. Uh, the whole junior class has them."
Susan,Why would I need a tent?
Susan,"Two days? Well, can't I just drive part of the way and then hike from there?"
Susan,"Well, maybe I am a little unprepared, but it'll be fine. I work out. I have quads of steel."
Susan,"Can't? There's no ""can't"" in love. There's a man on that mountain that I intend to spend the rest of my life with, and nothing is gonna keep me from him-- not fate, not destiny and definitely not you."
Susan,Cool. How do I get one of those?
Susan,"I mean, the doctor said that Mike might never come out of the coma. And then when he did, he didn't even remember me."
Susan,"No, no. I'm invigorated. This fresh mountain air is--aah!"
Susan,"Little help. So anyway, the whole situation with Mike--it just seemed hopeless and that's when I decided to take a chance with Ian."
Susan,"Yeah. What was I supposed to do, wait forever for Mike?"
Susan,"No, seriously, I was asking. What would you have done?"
Susan,"Well, clearly, you were not paying attention, because I did go back to Mike the second he woke up, and he'd totally forgotten me!"
Susan,Bug.
Susan,"Oh, it's a face mask. It's lavender and honey. You want some?"
Susan,"Well, I wanted to look nice for Mike."
Susan,"Well. I'm going to apologize, and then I'm gonna tell him that I made a huge mistake--"
Susan,"Well, then. We'll just be happy."
Susan,"Okay, I know it's dark, but I can see you."
Susan,What is it?
Susan,You don't even know me. How dare you talk to me like that?
Susan,"Okay, north. I need north. Moss grows on the north side of trees."
Susan,"What? Ugh, damn it! Stupid mossy trees!"
Susan,"Oh. Hey--Mike. Um, listen, I know your cell phone's off, but I--I wanted you to know that I followed you up to the hot springs, and--now i'm lost. You know, in the off chance that I get devoured by a mountain lion, I--I just wanted you to know that, um--I love you. I've always loved you. And I don't want any more drama. And if you take me back, I promise there won't be. Unless I get eaten by a mountain lion, and, you know, that'll be dramatic, but it won't be my fault. Anyway, um--I hope it's not too late, but if it is, I just--I just want you to know that I am so, so--"
Susan,Sorry.
Susan,Mike. I twisted my ankle.
Susan,The chicken.
Susan,"If by okay, you mean uneventful, then yes."
Susan,"Mike, what day is today?"
Susan,"Yes. It's also the anniversary of the day we were supposed to get engaged. A year ago tonight, you were on your way to ask me to marry you when you got hit by that stupid car."
Susan,Is that all you have to say?
Susan,I thought you were gonna propose tonight.
Susan,"Because this date has special meaning for us. I sat in front of that trailer for six hours thinking you hated me, and a proposal would've brought the entire thing full circle. It would've turned a bad memory into a beautiful one."
Susan,"Yes, I did, because I am a thoughtful person. And whenever we do get married, that is something you are gonna have to work on."
Susan,"Oh, my god. I can't believe that you did this."
Susan,"Oh, Mike."
Susan,Will you marry me?
Susan,"Hey, Fran��__ois, it's Susan Mayer. Um, call me as soon as you get this. I know I told you that my wedding is off, but it's back on, and I wanna see if you're still available to do the flowers. Bye. Oh, um, just so you know, Ian's not the groom anymore. Long story. Call me."
Susan,There. I think I left messages for everyone. Are you sure it's okay for us to have the same wedding I was planning with Ian? Be honest.
Susan,"Gosh, I just keep thinking there's someone I've forgotten to tell. Caterer, band, florist--"
Susan,"Oh, my god! I had Julie call and cancel everyone."
Susan,You can't invite people to a wedding on the phone. You have to send a proper invitation. You want people to think I'm a complete flake?
Susan,"Hi, Curt. Susan Mayer. You did my wedding invitations? Uh, I'm gonna need another batch. Exactly the same, only change the name Ian Hainsworth to Mike Delfino. Long story. Call me."
Susan,Gaby!
Susan,We got engaged last night. We're getting married!
Susan,So forget what Julie told you about the wedding being off. It's back on.
Susan,"Yep! I promised people a wedding, and they are getting one."
Susan,"Oh, you could change your plans."
Susan,"Well, what could be more important to you than my wedding?"
Susan,What?
Susan,You're getting married on my wedding day?
Susan,"Gaby, did you really think I would want to spend what would've been my wedding day watching someone else get married?"
Susan,"Okay, if you think for one second--"
Susan,"Oh, right! I have to cancel my wedding--again!"
Susan,Is this a bad time?
Susan,"Okay, well, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry for getting so snippy yesterday, that when I canceled my wedding, you had every right to--"
Susan,Francois!
Susan,You stole my florist?
Susan,I wanna see those flowers.
Susan,"Oh, my god, that's my centerpiece!"
Susan,"In this town in wedding season? Yeah, I do. You might as well have used my caterer and my swing band."""
Susan,"Oh, my god. Did you steal my whole wedding?"
Susan,"Gaby, I spent months planning that wedding."
Susan,Gaby--
Susan,I don't want to be paid. I want my wedding back.
Susan,Excuse me?
Susan,I'm rushing? You met Victor three months ago. I've known Mike three years.
Susan,"I cannot believe that you just said that. Okay, you know what? I came over here to give you my response card. But here. This is my response."
Susan,"Oh? No.No, this is a big dramatic gesture."
Susan,No. They're my flowers! Enjoy your stolen wedding!
Susan,"I mean, I'm sorry, but this time, Gaby has just crossed the line, and I will not make myself sit through her wedding. Julie thinks I'm overreacting. You don't think I'm overreacting, do you?"
Susan,She said that I would make Mike wish he was back in a coma.
Susan,"No, I guess not."
Susan,I got you a blender for Christmas.
Susan,I don't. I was just on my way to apologize to you.
Susan,You don't have to.
Susan,Thank you. I was just bringing you this.
Susan,Oh! Well--
Susan,I'm so glad we're doing this. I hate it when we fight.
Susan,"I think so, too. But, you know, then I remember, that's what I thought about me and Karl."
Susan,"Well, you know, when I married him, Karl wasn't Karl. And I think that's why I got so mad at you. Because ninety-nine percent of me is sure that we're gonna be totally happy. But then what you said--it just stirred up that pesky one percent."
Susan,"Mm. Lynette is right. You know, marriage is like--it's like these bonbons. You never know what you're getting until you're in the middle of it."
Susan,It's one of those hard jelly ones. Do you think that's an omen?
Susan,Right. Yeah.
Susan,What?
Susan,"You and me? Oh! Well, I-I'm beyond flattered. I-I find you to be an incredibly attractive woman. I just--"
Susan,"Oh. Oh! Oh, I would love that!"
Susan,Together!
Susan,That's good to know.
Susan,"I mean, I've never seen Gaby so torn up with guilt."
Susan,"And she kept saying, please, let me make it up to you!"
Susan,"Hey, how about a double wedding?"
Susan,"She's so excited, so needy."
Susan,"I mean, what could I say?"
Susan,So what do you think?
Susan,No. I'm screwed. I cannot get out of this without hurting her feelings.
Susan,You do?
Susan,So this is what marriage is about? Having someone to hide behind?
Susan,Hey!
Susan,How are you doing?
Susan,"Listen.We need to talk. I spoke to Mike, and, uh, he's just not really into the whole double wedding thing."
Susan,"Yeah, he sort of wants the day just to be about us. So we're gonna wait till the fall. I'm so sorry."
Susan,"Oh, good! I mean, not that they said no, just--'cause i really wanted to do it."
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,"See ya. Oh, by the way--you know that one percent sliver of a doubt thing I told you about? Totally gone. Any question I had about Mike's been answered."
Susan,Yeah. I feel really good about this.
Susan,Will you marry me?
Susan,"Gaby, Bree went out of her way to buy you that bracelet."
Susan,"Oh, I have an idea. I just got a lipstick yesterday. You could wear that."
Susan,"Okay, it's your big day, so I'm gonna let that slide."
Susan,Yeah. I'm calling her cell. It's ringing.
Susan,"Oh, wow!"
Susan,I'm thinking a chocolate fountain would be a cool centerpiece to a dessert buffet.
Susan,"Yeah, but you have to give people a choice. Don't you think a chocolate fountain would be elegant?"
Susan,"Fine, we'll skip the chocolate. How out a champagne fountain? Oh, I know! Maybe we can make the champagne flow through the ice sculpture."
Susan,"Mike, these are all fairly standard wedding features. Now you name one thing that you think is going over-the-top."
Susan,"Well, the doves are not going to release themselves."
Susan,"Okay, I know that you think I'm being silly, but all of our friends went to Bree's wedding, and now they're going to Gaby's. Two months from now, do we really want them thinking our wasn't as nice?"
Susan,"You would think that, but no. Come on. This is something that we have both looked forward to for so long. Don't you want it to be perfect?"
Susan,What?
Susan,What are you doing?
Susan,It's three o'clock in the morning.
Susan,"Okay, well, that's crazy. You can't work round the clock. It's not healthy."
Susan,"You've been sneaking out while I've been asleep? What are you, ninja plumber?"
Susan,Is this about the wedding?
Susan,But we didn't agree on this. Maybe I can scale things back a bit.
Susan,"Okay, seriously, you don't have to kill yourself. I could max out my credit card."
Susan,"No, I wanna start out happy. But clearly, you're upset, and I don't know why."
Susan,Nice save.
Susan,And--break!
Susan,"Really? Is everything okay, sweetie? 'Cause you haven't quite seemed yourself the last couple weeks."""
Susan,"Okay, I got you some appetizers to tide you over. We have mini quiches and beef satay and something called Crystal Coast shrimp with grits, but it's mostly just grits 'cause I ate all the shrimp on my way over. Mike?"
Susan,"Reverend, that was such a beautiful ceremony. Really, just heartfelt and moving--the whole package."
Susan,"Yeah, it was really impressive. So what are you doing tonight?"
Susan,I hate to see you drive when you're this tired.
Susan,You were great.
Susan,Just hurry up and get dressed. We only have forty-five minutes.
Susan,"Well, I don't know if you've noticed, but my idea of the perfect wedding keeps changing. One day, I want white roses, and then I want lilies, and first, I want a harpist, and then a string quartet. Only one thing stays constant--and I'm looking at him. Why would I need anything else to make my wedding perfect?"
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,"Oh, you might wanna check that breast pocket of your suit."
Susan,"And just so you know, you'll be paying for those and the lights and the flowers."
Susan,You clean up pretty good yourself.
Susan,Carlos.How is she?
Susan,I can't believe this is happening.It's like Mary Alice all over again.
Susan,Happy one-month anniversary.
Susan,"Well,we've just been so happy the last four weeks,I thought we should celebrate."
Susan,"You are happy,right?"
Susan,"Aw,that's sweet.I don't believe you."
Susan,"I watch you sometimes,and you seem very, disconnected,like something's missing."
Susan,So our life together is exactly how you pictured it?You've gotten everything you wanted?
Susan,"""Pretty much"" means there is something that you want that you don't have. How can I give it to you if you don't tell me what it is?"
Susan,This marriage is doomed.
Susan,"I wish Edie were here.Without her,there's no one to give us the dish."
Susan,"Oh,my god.Katherine.Katherine!"
Susan,I cannot believe it has been 12 years.You haven't changed a bit.
Susan,How's your aunt?Katherine used to live here with Mrs.Sims.
Susan,"Oh,my god.This is not little Dylan.I'm Susan,Julie's mom.She is gonna be so excited to see you."
Susan,So you're back.How fun.I should have a brunch so that everyone can get to know you.
Susan,"Oh,you don't need to do that."
Susan,Sure.I'm just here for a checkup.
Susan,Yes.Yesterday.Susan Mayer.Your new neighbor.
Susan,"I-I didn't know you were,this kind of doctor."
Susan,"Listen,um.maybe this isn't-"
Susan,Okay.
Susan,"It's just that it's weird,you know,considering you're--where'd you go?"
Susan,Sorry.
Susan,Sorry.
Susan,"Yeah.You know,one month off,two months on.That happens,right?"
Susan,"Um,sometimes.But Mike's a big spooner.He's like sleeping with a hibachi."
Susan,"Okay,whoa.I'm gonna stop you right there.I am way too young for that.Please refer to your chart."
Susan,"Okay,before we go any further,can I check those diplomas?'Cause I would just like to make sure that they're not from some med school in the Philippines."
Susan,"I don't need any test!I am not old enough for menopause.Now I don't know what kind of nonsense they taught you at.Harvard Medical School,Class of '97?Oh,my god!I am old!Just give me the damn test."
Susan,"Oh,so you just shun them and throw them away."
Susan,"Yeah,get used to it."
Susan,No.I'm sorry.I'm just a little--you know what? Forget it.Let's eat.
Susan,"I know.And you thought you married a vibrant woman in her prime,and instead,you got a wife who's.dry and dusty."
Susan,"Yeah,the part before death. Oh!"
Susan,"Yes,it is! What if you wanna have kids?"
Susan,"No,you said you did."
Susan,What if you change it back?
Susan,"Listen,my last egg could be on its way down the chute at this very moment.If you wanna have kids,you might wanna jump on it right now."
Susan,I don't want you to be fine.I want you to be happy.
Susan,"Yep,we're doomed."
Susan,"Oh,my gosh. She's out of the clinic."
Susan,Well. we just all love ya.
Susan,"Damn it,Lynette. What did we say after Mary Alice.After Edie? Why didn't they tell us?"
Susan,Is that all you see in our eyes?
Susan,I'm in.
Susan,I'm in here.
Susan,"No problem.Um,what's up?"
Susan,"Adam,I have no idea what you're talking about."
Susan,Really? that's fantastic!
Susan,More?
Susan,I'm pregnant?
Susan,He said I'm pregnant.
Susan,"Well,now I believe you."
Susan,Hey!Is something wrong?
Susan,I know. She was like a sister to you.
Susan,"Oh, my god. Katherine."
Susan,I'm Julie's mom.
Susan,She said Dylan's not the same girl.
Susan,"I know it sounds weird, but Julie says Dylan does not remember anything about living here."
Susan,I'm not sure. But there was something odd about the way they left.
Susan,"Uh, that sounds great."
Susan,"Oh, yum."
Susan,I know. I will lend you my salad bowl. You really don't wanna miss Bree's pie. It's perfect.
Susan,"Hey, Katherine. What's going on?"
Susan,"Oh, whoa. No, hang on. Let me just run and get Julie so she can say good-bye to Dylan."
Susan,Katherine? Are you okay? You seem a little jumpy.
Susan,"Katherine, hi. Oh, uh, I brought you that salad bowl."
Susan,"No problem. Hey, you know, I was meaning to ask you, how did that job in Chicago work out?"
Susan,"You know, the one that you left so suddenly for."
Susan,What? I'm eating for two.
Susan,"Okay, when I'm in labor and I am pushing and screaming to bring your child into the world, do you really want me to remember that you denied me syrup?"
Susan,Is it about Matt's party?
Susan,"Well, uh, well, the Johnson's live right down the road. Yeah, I guess that's fine."
Susan,"Uh, we--I mean, you both make a-a good case. Um--but I think I'm gonna have to agree with, uh--and you know I love you both--"
Susan,Mike. I'm going with Mike.
Susan,"Well, it sounds like this party could be on the wild side, and it is starting very late."
Susan,"I'm sorry, honey. You wanted a decision. This is my decision."
Susan,Missy Taylor?
Susan,"Hey, so how's the chemotherapy going?"
Susan,"Oh, my god. Bree, that is, like, the best pie you've ever made."
Susan,So back to chemo--how's that been?
Susan,Why?
Susan,Count me in.
Susan,What are friends for?
Susan,Psst! Come here.
Susan,"Okay, I'll come there. Are you still mad at me about the party?"
Susan,"Okay, look, I've been thinking about things, and--just forget what I said earlier."
Susan,"Shh! Jeez! Ooh, Mike's in the other room."
Susan,"No, and neither are you."
Susan,"I know. I just-- think it's sweet that he worries about you, and I want him to feel like he's part of the decision making process."
Susan,Do you wanna go or not?
Susan,"Can you believe it? Ugh! Let it go. You know, Mike and I decided--no party, and that's final."
Susan,Wait for it. Wait for it. Ta-da.
Susan,"So it's not my imagination. They're bigger, right?"
Susan,Mike!
Susan,"Well, I'd better warn you. I may have to work the shoulders. Ba-boom, ba-boom, mmm."
Susan,Mm-hmm?
Susan,"Uh, yeah, well, you know, sometimes you gotta hang tough."
Susan,Mm-hmm?
Susan,What?
Susan,We need whipped cream.
Susan,"Well, I don't think that you can have sexy date night without whipped cream."
Susan,"No, no, you've, uh, worked all day. You stay here. I'll go to the store."
Susan,"Oh, that must mean you're Matt. I'm Susan Mayer, and I'm--"
Susan,#NAME?
Susan,"Yeah, it's fine. Would somebody just tell me where I can find--"
Susan,"Oh, my god! I'm not a stripper."
Susan,I'm pregnant.
Susan,If that's your lame attempt to keep me from calling your parents--it worked. Well played. Excuse me.
Susan,I am taking you home. This party is out of control.
Susan,"Well, of course you don't think it is, because you're knocking back a big cup of-- orange soda."
Susan,"Well, believe it. We're going. You, too, Dylan. Come on."
Susan,"Yeah, well, Boomer likes it."
Susan,"Look, I get that you're upset."
Susan,"Okay, I admit that there's a certain lack of consistency there."
Susan,Do you think this is easy for me? Trying to keep peace between a new husband and a teenage daughter? You're always putting me in the middle.
Susan,"Please. Every time you and Mike disagree on something, you give me the look--that pitiful face that says if I don't back you up, I love the other one more."
Susan,"Well, you're right. I'm an adult, and I need to be honest about these things, and I will be--starting tomorrow."
Susan,Hey. Look who I picked up coming out of the movies-- a P.G. Movie. Is this the perfect teenager or what?
Susan,"No, no, we can salvage this. Just work with me."
Susan,"You know, this perfect teenager thing is really starting to chap my ass."
Susan,Please tell me this isn't gonna be one of those things where you leave me and I go screaming down the street.
Susan,"I'm sorry. You gotta understand, for so long, it's just been Julie and me, and I've made all the decisions alone. You felt so strongly."
Susan,Thanks.
Susan,Right. So can we go back to date night?
Susan,Oh.
Susan,Yeah. Got it.
Susan,"Okay, once the light starts blinking, we've got three seconds,. so, everybody, say, ""cheese"" and hold it. One, two, three."
Susan,I'm eating for two.
Susan,"Hi, Gaby. It's me. I'm throwing a party Saturday night. Guess what kind?"
Susan,"No, that was a year ago."
Susan,Sure is. Can you come?
Susan,Aw! You have to come. You're the best charades player I know.
Susan,So you were paid a very nice compliment today.
Susan,"Yes. I am hosting a charades party, and all of my friends went out their way to insist I invite you."
Susan,Hey. What's this?
Susan,"Honey, you know, I'm still in my first trimester. Um, don't you think it's a little early to be making cribs?"
Susan,Great.
Susan,"Mm. Um, Bree's home. I'll be right back."
Susan,"I need a favor. Um, I remember you mentioning that you liked your obstetrician. Can I get his number?"
Susan,"Yeah, I don't know. It's getting a little weird. You know, Adam is my neighbor."
Susan,"Well, that's because I don't blush when Orson says, ""open wide""."
Susan,"Oh, well, we could schedule our appointments together and carpool. You know--pregnant gals on the road."
Susan,"Oh, I can talk him into it. What's his name?"
Susan,You don't remember?
Susan,"Bree, just get me the number."
Susan,I'm so excited. Pregnant gals sharing a doctor!
Susan,"Oh, bless you."
Susan,Right.
Susan,"A friend of mine recommended this place. It's not exactly what I expected. Must be one heck of a doctor, though, huh?"
Susan,"Gaby! Sorry I'm late. Oh, my god! You made it. That is such a beautiful dress. We're gonna have so much fun. You--Come with me."
Susan,"And the whole time, I just kept thinking, this is Bree's doctor. Bree recommended him. He must be the best. So I didn't worry when it was between a needle exchange. And the area's only transvestite bookstore. And I ignored that my shoes stuck to the floor. And there was a cigarette machine in the waiting room. But when I saw the ant traps on his speculum tray, I thought that you and I should have a talk."
Susan,That is not the point! Why would you send me to somebody who is obviously not your doctor?
Susan,Why not?
Susan,You know what else is private? The parts of me that I'm pretty sure he snapped with his camera phone. I have a party to throw. I will deal with you later.
Susan,"Okay, everybody, let the games begin. Um, okay. I will be team captain one. Who wants to be captain number two?"
Susan,"Great. Okay, you pick first."
Susan,I pick Lynette. Where's Lynette?
Susan,Carlos.
Susan,"Honey, I love you, but I wanna win."
Susan,"No, no! Wait, wait, wait. Gaby, you know how it works. Okay, first, I have to go over all the signals. Okay, so, um, this is movie, um, TV--"
Susan,"A whole concept, person, um, let's see. Shakespeare, book, and then if you do the signal for book. And you touch your heart, then that's poem."
Susan,Dibs on Lynette! She's on my team!
Susan,"Okay, go."
Susan,"Okay, 22 seconds. Lynette, you're up."
Susan,Edie. Woman. Blonde. Bleach!
Susan,"Okay. Well, I think it's time for a break."
Susan,"Okay, back to charades."
Susan,What do you think you're doing? You can't leave yet.
Susan,"No, we'll talk now. You still owe me an explanation for that scuzzy gyno you sent me to."
Susan,"Bree? Can we call a truce, please? So you know I'm not bluffing, um, I brought cake."
Susan,"It's okay. I just wanna know what's going on. Ever since you've been pregnant, there's been this wall between us. It's like something's changed, and I don't know why. Did I do something to offend you?"
Susan,"Like what? I mean, come on. Just tell me. We share everything."
Susan,"Oh, no. Is everything okay?"
Susan,"Oh, my god. And there I was, just bugging you about your doctor. I am so sorry. You should've just told me."
Susan,"Oh, are you kidding? It's the first baby I've had in 17 years. You know, I could not possibly be more freaked out. This morning, I caught Mike building a crib."
Susan,"Yeah! I-I wanted to scream. You know, are you nuts? Do you just wanna jinx it?"
Susan,"It's just gonna get worse. Do you know, when our babies go to college, we'll be like--"
Susan,If we are lucky
Susan,"Look at us. Pregnant gals, eating cake and bi*chin'. It's kinda nice, huh?"
Susan,"So anyway, that's why it was so great."
Susan,"I got it, I got it. Oh, one more. Here you go."
Susan,"Hey, neighbor!"
Susan,"Oh, we haven't gotten a chance to meet. I'm Susan. I live next door. Oh! jeez."
Susan,"Uh, I-I just wanted to say hi. You know, I saw the movers taking in some of your furniture, and I just have to say you and your wife have gorgeous taste."
Susan,"Um, I'm Susan. I live next door."
Susan,"Oh, you're partners. What kind of business? You know, whatever it is, just don't let the neighborhood association hear that you work out of your house. They're so not cool."
Susan,"Oh. Oh! oh, that's super! Yeah, I've seen a lot of cable, so I get it. You're just great."
Susan,"So there's, uh-- there's three of you. Well, that must be-- cozy."
Susan,"Raphael is your dog, of course. You know, 'cause you folks can't have kids. I mean, uh, I mean, of course you can have kids, um, you--you know, because times have changed, and now you're allowed. What a-- nice dog. I should go."
Susan,"Come on, Bree. You have to let us do this."
Susan,"Well, I don't see the problem with it--Hint, hint."
Susan,"Oh, look, I made a terrible first impression, so I thought I'd make them some of my home-baked goodness."
Susan,"Well, yeah. I don't bake. Catch up."
Susan,"Mike, they live 15 feet from us. If we have a fire, I wanna be sure that they like us enough to call 9-1-1."
Susan,"Well, maybe."
Susan,"That's fine, and once they like me, they can keep to themselves all they damn well please."
Susan,"Hi. I wanted to bring you a ""welcome to the neighborhood"" present. You should try one while they're still warm from the oven."
Susan,Nuts?
Susan,"Gee, let me think. Nope, no nuts."
Susan,I'm not seeing any nuts.
Susan,"Okay, here's the thing. I'm a really crappy baker. To give you something that I made myself would be like an insult, so ��_��_��_"
Susan,"Hey, I would've made them myself if I knew how. Honestly, I'm a good neighbor."
Susan,Do you like wine?
Susan,"Oh, come on, Uncle Frank.What's the point of having a gay uncle if you're not gonna help me make friends with these guys? Oh. Uh, mom said that the whole family knew. Um, okay. Gotta go. Love you."
Susan,What's going on?
Susan,"Bup, bup, bup! Wait a second."
Susan,"Leave him with me. I need to score some points with those guys, and being a dog-rescuing hero could be just the ticket."
Susan,Uh-huh. Maybe a little longer.
Susan,"Well, long enough for them to worry. You know, the more they worry, the more I'm a hero. Get it?"
Susan,"I'm not, I'm not. Now get some mud. I wanna dirty him up so he looks like he's been through hell. Okay, in you go."
Susan,Andrew told us that you only said no--'cause you didn't want to impose.
Susan,Lee? Is something wrong?
Susan,"Oh. Well, would you like me to help you look for him?"
Susan,Oh. It's just a baby shower--that I'm throwing-- for my best friend.
Susan,"Oh, please. What are neighbors for? Raphael?! Here, puppy!"
Susan,"Nothing, huh?"
Susan,"Oh, he will. Come on. You gotta keep believing."
Susan,Don't. We'll just keep looking. I have a feeling we're gonna find that cute little guy.
Susan,"You know what? Don't worry about it. I'm gonna go inside and get us some water, and then we're gonna just keep looking."
Susan,What?
Susan,How's Bob's suit?
Susan,Oh. What if we take it to my cleaners?
Susan,"$2,000?"
Susan,That's crazy.
Susan,Oh. I just wanted them to like me.
Susan,There must be some way I can apologize to them.
Susan,"I know. Uh, maybe if I��_��_��_"
Susan,"Mike, wait. We should talk about this."
Susan,"Yeah, I've seen a lot of cable, so I get it."
Susan,I should go.
Susan,I think it's a sculpture.
Susan,"Okay, before we become an ugly mob, why doesn't one of us go talk to the guys?But not me. They hate me."
Susan,"I don't mind it. Not to brag, but I went to art school."
Susan,And they taught us that art is subjective.
Susan,Come on. It's 6:00 a.m. What is that?
Susan,"Oh, my god. Wow! It's a fountain, too."
Susan,"Yeah, they can get like that. So do you think that you can just turn it off for a second?"
Susan,"I was just wondering, um, do you think you could move it to your backyard?"
Susan,"Yes. Quiet art is subjective. But you see, Mike is working really long hours lately, and he can't s sleep with all that noise."
Susan,Like what?
Susan,I have a lovely voice.
Susan,"Ida, again, the issue is not Bob and Lee being gay. It's the fountain."
Susan,"Hear, hear."
Susan,"I would love to, but--"
Susan,"This is awkward. Uh, I told Katherine I'd vote for her."
Susan,"Uh, it's not like I'm pro- Katherine. I'm just anti-fountain. Oh, don't give me that look. I made her a promise."
Susan,"Okay. If I vote for you, do you promise to get rid of that fountain?"
Susan,"Well, I'm voting as a light sleeper. It's right outside our bedroom window. Seriously, Lynette, it's like living next to splash mountain."
Susan,"Well, we need our sleep."
Susan,Why don't you get-- tree house plugs?
Susan,"Yeah, I'm sorry. You know, tired people aren't witty."
Susan,"Did I? Well, that's obviously wrong."
Susan,Katherine.
Susan,I'm sorry.
Susan,"Hey, Lynette."
Susan,"Okay, fine. You're still angry, but I'm gonna make it up to you. When they come after that tree house, they're going to have one Susan Mayer chained to it."
Susan,Lynette!
Susan,"Exactly, And friends don't put friends in this kind of position. I love you, but you can't ask me to put your kids ahead of my husband."
Susan,"Okay, if anybody needs me, I'll be at the hardware store buying chains."
Susan,"Oh, my god. That's great!"
Susan,Thanks for everything. Thank you.
Susan,I was surprised that my doctor suggested genetic counseling. I didn't have to do that with my last baby.
Susan,Nice save. Now can we just skip to the part where you tell me what's wrong with my baby?
Susan,"Okay. My aunt Ella has arthritis. I have two cousins with webbed feet, And there's a whole lot of third nipples on my dad's side."
Susan,"What do you mean, ""it's fine now""? He's dead."
Susan,'Cause that's what you told me when we first started dating.
Susan,"It wasn't an impression. You said those words--""my father's dead."""
Susan,"How can it be complicated? He's either dead or alive. Does it sound complicated to you, Michelle?"
Susan,"Yeah. But apparently, his dad can rise from the dead. So let's hope the baby gets that gene."
Susan,Did you really think I was gonna let you crawl in bed next to me without an explanation for your bizarre behavior?
Susan,I don't care what the issues are. You don't deny your own dad's existence.
Susan,"Oh, my god. He's in jail for murder?"
Susan,"Do you see him? I mean, do you have a relationship with him?"
Susan,"Well, I've got to meet him."
Susan,"Well, he's your father. I should know him, and besides, that genetic counselor said we should gather data about your family's history. Maybe you dad knows something you don't. I mean, I should meet him for the sake of our baby."
Susan,Thank you.
Susan,"Uh, no. Thank you, Nick."
Susan,"Um, yes, the, uh, genetic counselor, um, wanted to know a couple of things. Um, I-is there any cancer in your family?"
Susan,"Great. Uh, diabetes?"
Susan,Wonderful. Who did you kill?
Susan,Uh-huh. Okay.
Susan,So you killed him?
Susan,So you killed him?
Susan,"Uh, and how did you--"
Susan,I just don't see how he could not feel bad about it.
Susan,"You know, I expected to meet a guy that was racked with remorse, and instead, I'm looking across the table at this--"
Susan,"Yeah, an evil person."
Susan,"Well, I don't see one."
Susan,"You killed a crooked cop who was coming after you. That's self-defense, and even so, you regret it, right?"
Susan,"Well, that's my point. When good people snap, they feel bad about it. Your dad doesn't."
Susan,"I don't know. It just bothers me. I mean-- My god, Mike. He's your dad."
Susan,"At the motel. I slipped out without waking him. I've been up all night thinking, and I have something to say to you. I don't believe you. I don't believe that you could kill a man and not regret it."
Susan,"Because I am carrying a baby that has your genes. If my doctor told me that there was something wrong with this baby--something physical, I could handle that. I would probably even love it more. But if my baby was born without a conscience, without a soul, I don't know what I would do."
Susan,"If you can't feel the tiniest bit of remorse over taking a human life--No, I don't think you do."
Susan,I should go.
Susan,What did you do?
Susan,"Well, you're wrong. He's happy. He's got a good job and a wife who loves him and a baby on the way."
Susan,"Well, he's just a little piece of heaven."
Susan,Did you hear something?
Susan,"Oh, yeah!"
Susan,"Mike, how long are you gonna be? We've gotta get this food over to Bree's before it gets cold."
Susan,"No, they just had a baby. We're gonna ""ooh,"" we're gonna ""ahh,"" and then we're gonna eat."
Susan,"There's no way out of it, Mike. Just do what you need and downstairs. This is what we do in the suburbs."
Susan,And how does Danielle like her baby brother?
Susan,"Oh, honey. You'd be surprised how fast the best schools fill up. And only the best for our kid, right?"
Susan,"Gee, I don't think I've ever heard such strong opinions on the subject. I mean, not that it's something I talk about a lot--or ever."
Susan,Ice cream. Sorry.
Susan,Wow. You never ask for my help. Must be something easy.
Susan,Maybe Dylan should ask her mom.
Susan,"Okay, don't tell anybody I told you this. Her mom said something at my party about her dad being abusive towards Katherine--and maybe Dylan, too."
Susan,So I'm thinking that it would be better if you could get her to research somebody else in her family.
Susan,"Oh, sure. I'll--I'll bring up a tray."
Susan,"Bree thinks you're doing drugs. She found this on her kitchen floor, and it's not aspirin."
Susan,Really?
Susan,"Oh, thank god! You have no idea where my mind went."
Susan,I knew it. I'm so happy.
Susan,Oh!
Susan,"And he needed something for the pain, so he happened to find the last two pills in the medicine cabinet, and he took 'em. It's no big deal."
Susan,"Oh, but this isn't the same thing. Mike wouldn't lie to me about this."
Susan,He said there were no more pills. I was looking him in the eye.
Susan,"I'm thinking that you're a drug addict and a liar, so say something that's not that."
Susan,"Is it so horrible living with me? I mean, do I make you so miserable that you can't even face me without numbing the pain?"
Susan,"Well, if you did, you wouldn't be doing this! I mean, my god, Mike, we have a baby on the way!"
Susan,"Sure, go ahead. Oh, should I look you in the eyes? Does it make it easier for you to lie?"
Susan,Me feel guilty?
Susan,"Mike, we don't need any of that stuff."
Susan,"God, the only advantage he needs is to have a healthy dad who's not doing this."
Susan,I wanna believe you. It's just--
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,Thank you.
Susan,Hey.
Susan,Can we talk? This will just take a second. Did you kiss that boy?
Susan,"Oh, well, you're gonna thank me. Do you know that he has his tongue pierced?"
Susan,I checked out his web page.
Susan,"I did, too, and do you know what else he has pierced? And if you do, you're grounded."
Susan,"If the cover has holes in it, the book is no good."
Susan,"Oh, fine. Break my heart."
Susan,Trust me. Your finger is not where he'd put it.
Susan,"No, he's at work."
Susan,"Well, I don't know when he's gonna be home, but you could come back later tonight."
Susan,Orgo?
Susan,Pre-med? Really?
Susan,"Gosh, you're studying to be a doctor. That must not leave you a lot of free time for hobbies or--a girlfriend."
Susan,"Well, no rush. You know, just yesterday, I was telling my daughter Julie--oh, you know, that is so rude. I-I'm talking about daughter, and you don't even know what she looks like. That's her."
Susan,"Oh, Barrett, I wasn't fishing for compliments. If I was--I would've shown you this one."
Susan,"Oh, sure. I have to check on the laundry."
Susan,Look what I found on the dryer. Julie won second place in the state science fair.
Susan,"Yeah, good-looking and smart. Only problem is, where is she gonna find someone else like that?"
Susan,"Oh, that's okay. You know, why don't you come back tomorrow to see me, and if Julie happens to be here, maybe you can give her some advice on picking out colleges and stuff."
Susan,"Oh, please, call me ""mom"". Uh, because--that's what all the kids call me."
Susan,"Oh, Mike, you're home. I was dreaming we were ponies."
Susan,"Hey, that kid, um, Barrett came by today."
Susan,"Yeah, he said that you owed him money for some--plumbing job that he helped you on."
Susan,Oh. He's coming back tomorrow. Don't you think he would be perfect for Julie?
Susan,My matchmaking skills. Julie and Barrett are really hitting it off.
Susan,"Yeah, your friend. I told you last night he was coming by again."
Susan,"Thank you. Hey, you know, would you like me to pack some up for you guys to take?"
Susan,What?
Susan,Get out of my house. Get him out of my house!
Susan,He bought those pills a long time ago and never got around to paying the guy.
Susan,"Julie, it's not like it was heroin or crack. It was just pain pills for his shoulder, but we had a talk, and he has totally stopped taking them."
Susan,Yeah. Why?
Susan,That's a relief.
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,Okay.
Susan,I got you the fondue set.
Susan,Victor knows?
Susan,No.
Susan,"Yeah, and-and we don't need to say good-bye anyway, 'Cause we're gonna see you real soon."
Susan,"Wow. Tape, batteries, a radio. How'd you know I need this stuff?"
Susan,"Hey, actually, um, since you're here, I was thinking that maybe it would be a good idea to tell Orson about Mike's, you know--drug problem."
Susan,You did? When?
Susan,"I'm sorry, so--Orson already knows about Mike?"
Susan,"No. No, you didn't do anything wrong. Thanks for the supplies."
Susan,"Orson, we need to talk."
Susan,"Yeah, I can see that. Hi. I'm his neighbor. Cute shoes. Why the hell would you give Mike drugs?"
Susan,"No need. I'll be quick. 'Cause I'm sure you have a very good reason for giving Mike pills when you know that he has a drug problem. So--what is your very good reason? Okay, this may take a while. You might want to spit."
Susan,"Oh, of course, and you know all about shoulder pain--being a dentist."
Susan,"By giving pills to an addict? Does that sound helpful to you, Mrs. Kowalsky?"
Susan,"Thank you. Finally, some sanity."
Susan,"Fine. But you know, if I find out that you have given Mike so much as a breath mint, trust me, there is not enough novocaine in this office to numb the pain I will inflict on you."
Susan,"What was I supposed to do, Mike? Leave 'em in your truck? I'm not gonna sit back and watch you spin out of control."
Susan,What?
Susan,"What's the problem? Let's see. You lied to me. Uh, your drug dealer almost dated my daughter. You lied to me some more, and then I find out that you hit up my best friend's husband for more pills."
Susan,And you're kind of yelling at me-also a problem.
Susan,"You might think you have things under control, but they're only gonna get worse--and with a baby on the way."
Susan,Forget it.
Susan,Let go of me! Aah! Oh!
Susan,"Uh, no."
Susan,"Uh, I think I just twisted my ankle, but i would like to get checked out anyway."
Susan,It's okay.
Susan,Are you okay?
Susan,Are you sure that's all it is?
Susan,These people are bleeding. I can absolutely wait.
Susan,"Mike, stop!"
Susan,The doctor said the baby's fine.
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,Just a mild sprain. How you doing?
Susan,"It's gonna be okay. I talked to the doctor, and, um, they have a rehab facility they work with."
Susan,"You keep saying that, and it just keeps getting worse."
Susan,"Oh, my god. Are you kidding me?"
Susan,No.
Susan,"No. There's no tomorrow. It's now. You will quit this now. You will go to rehab, or so help me, I will leave you. I will take this baby, and I will leave you."
Susan,"You will go to rehab, or so help me, I will leave you."
Susan,"Uh, she went to the hospital with Carlos. He was pretty banged up, but they say he's gonna be okay."
Susan,"Okay, Lynette, listen to me. They are all going to be fine. I know it."
Susan,"Yes, yes, I do. I do. So I want you to go over to those paramedics, and I want you to let them look at these cuts. Because you don't want to be all bloody when they pull your kids out of there, do you?"
Susan,What?
Susan,I'm just trying to comfort her.
Susan,What do you suggest we do?
Susan,And I will help her.
Susan,"Come on, Tom."
Susan,"Please, this is what best friends do--right before their friendship ends."
Susan,"How do you say no to someone in need? That wasn't rhetorical. Seriously, you got anything?"
Susan,"Oh, yeah. Every cup needs a coaster. Every coaster needs a doily. Every doily needs daily laundering. This woman is gonna drive me out of my freakin'��_��_��_ Hey, roomies. You need help?"
Susan,Imposing. Who's imposing? You can stay as long as you want. I'm sorry. The words came out of my mouth before I knew what I was saying.
Susan,Sounds good to me!
Susan,"Well, I drove all the way out there, and I waited for hours and then they wouldn't let me see him. Uh, no. They just said that I should--I should call you. Listen, I know it's a 30-day rehab. I'm not trying to break him out. I'm just trying to see him. You know what? Could you just call me when you know? Thank you."
Susan,Don't talk. I'm smelling. What is that?
Susan,And our oven is making its debut.
Susan,"Oh, my god! I want to eat that."
Susan,This has just replaced your birth as the best day of my life.
Susan,I hope you don't mind that I'm going to kiss you.
Susan,"Not at all. In--in fact, if you wanna do a dry run for Sunday brunch, I'm there for you."
Susan,"Oh, none taken."
Susan,"No. That Walter guy needs to stay miserable, because if he's not, he'll fix her roof, and then she'll leave us."
Susan,"That is not enough time. She just started stenciling the kitchen, and I didn't want to tell you this, but there is talk of an herb garden. I've gotta stop her."
Susan,"I don't know, but I've had a taste of ironed pillowcases, and I am not going back."
Susan,"Hey, everybody. I'm sorry to interrupt, but the smell of that apple pie just made my mouth water."
Susan,Thanks.
Susan,"Oh, I'm just gonna visit for a while. So, Andrew, we miss you around here, but I bet you love having your own place."
Susan,"Oh, well, you'll reel somebody in. You always do. You should have seen his last boyfriend--Justin. He was so hot. You really had a thing for the young, ripped muscle boys, huh?"
Susan,"Oh! This is a fix-up? Well, I just--it never would have occurred to me, you know, because of the vast age difference. But, hell. Why not? Life is short. Certainly shorter for Walter."
Susan,"Oh, no, don't get me wrong. I mean, I think it's great. You should grab love wherever you can find it. Who cares if your friends think that you're paying for it?"
Susan,"Well, I guess I'll just bring this pie up to Julie."
Susan,"Okay, I know that it sounds selfish, but I did what I did because I want you to stay."
Susan,"Well, yeah, sure, someday, but right now I just love having you take care of me. All the cooking and the cleaning and the alphabetizing--it's helping me feel like I'm not just about to fall apart."
Susan,"No. I'm pregnant, and my husband's in rehab, and the only reason I seem sane is because you're here, making my house feel like a home."
Susan,"Can I have milk, too?"
Susan,You can stay as long as you want.
Susan,And jam.
Susan,The jam was Bree's idea.
Susan,"I wanted to bring flowers, and I was shot down. That's all I'm saying."
Susan,I told them you weren't into jam.
Susan,Sorry.
Susan,Are you always this sarcastic with your clients?
Susan,"I so appreciate you helping us out. Mike would be doing our taxes, but he's off--"
Susan,"Yeah, I was sorry to hear about your job. You know, ever since N.A.F.T.A., Corporate outsourcing has been the bane of the American worker. Is that right? I heard somebody say that on N.P.R., and I just keep repeating it to people."
Susan,"Oh, Tim."
Susan,"Okay, so back to these receipts."
Susan,Done catching up. all about accounting now.
Susan,"No, I know you're not."
Susan,These receipts are self-explanatory. I'd even know why I'm here.
Susan,"Katherine, Dylan, hi. What's up?"
Susan,Is this about the other day?
Susan,"Oh, please. after what you've been through, no one is judging. Come on in. I'll put on some coffee. Oh, um, this is my cousin Tim. Tim, this is the neighbors."
Susan,"Oh, of course you do. That's right! This is my cousin Timmy. He stayed with us that summer that he went to band camp."
Susan,"Julie, Dylan's here! Study time! I'm-- sorry. That was probably a little louder than it needed to be."
Susan,"No, that's okay. It can wait."
Susan,Mm. Hmm. Mm. Tim! where's that milk?
Susan,I'm having a baby. I can't give birth with brittle bones. Go!
Susan,"Mm, well, maybe you won't mind doing a little scrubbing when you come home next week."
Susan,"Well, it doesn't have to be toilets. I mean, it could be sinks, bathtubs."
Susan,"Oh, I forgot. Uh, Tim has some questions about the taxes. Do you mind talking to him?"
Susan,"Hey, uh, Tim, I've got Mike here. Do you want to talk to him?"
Susan,What was that? Is someone there?
Susan,Really? ��_��_��_Cause it sounded like a girl.
Susan,I've gotta go.
Susan,"I know, but this visit was really more for Julie."
Susan,"Yeah, you're going to college soon, and I want him to tell you about the dangers of drugs. Scare her straight, Mike."
Susan,Ugh! Get off that poor girl right now!
Susan,What the hell is going on here?
Susan,"No, Katherine, I know what you've been going through emotionally, so you don't have to apologize. And by the way, your boob is out."
Susan,"You, on the other hand��_��_��_"
Susan,"I don't understand you. Is this something you do? You worm your way into a neighborhood with the promise of free tax preparation, and then you jump on the nearest middle-aged divorce?"
Susan,"Oh, nice try, Timmy. Like I'm really going to believe that. Shame on you. just-- shame! What do you mean, ""old feelings""?"
Susan,"What do you have to reminisce about? He was here for a week when he was 16. What could you two have even--Oh, my god, you slept together."
Susan,"Shame on you! His mother trusted me to take care of him, and you swoop in like some swooping, sex-craved--Oh, for god sakes, Tim! pull up the blanket!"
Susan,"I don't want to hear this. I'm done with both of you. If anybody needs me, I'll be at the mall--buying sheets."
Susan,Hey.
Susan,"Okay, so I have to ask. This thing that happened with you and Katherine 12 years ago--Was it an ongoing affair?"
Susan,So you didn't go back?
Susan,So-- this man-- who do you think it was?
Susan,Not really.
Susan,No.
Susan,"Bree, that is, like, the best pie you've ever made."
Susan,Imposing? Who's imposing? You can stay as long as you want.
Susan,Especially when you get your big moment in the spotlight. Bree gets to present an award to somebody who's done something extraordinary for the community.
Susan,It would?
Susan,"Orson, you scared me. Why are you sitting down here in the dark? And aren't you a little cold?"
Susan,"Then you came down here and you couldn't remember what it was. That happens to me all the time. Well, the baby is insisting that I eat the last piece of"
Susan,"Pajamas--that's something you could do. Okay, you're right. You're a guest in my house��_��_��_a completely naked guest in my house. I should leave."
Susan,Oh. Good morning. Love what you're wearing.
Susan,All right. We don't need to talk about it. Just promise me it won't happen again.
Susan,"Orson, you were naked in this kitchen last night."
Susan,You most certainly were.
Susan,"It wasn't a claim. He was sitting right here without a stitch of clothing on, and I couldn't have cake."
Susan,"No, no, no, no. No, I did not have a sex dream."
Susan,"I know when I'm dreaming, and this really happened. Why else would I be sponging butt prints off my stool?"
Susan,"Oh, my god. You thought I was crazy, but it wasn't a dream. You're naked! And that means you're crazy."
Susan,"Oh, really? You just happened to stumble naked into my front yard?"
Susan,"""Mike""? Wait. Are you sleepwalking? Orson. Hello?"
Susan,"Orson, you're staying at my house! There you go."
Susan,"You know, it's none of my business, but seeing as I have seen you naked twice in the last week, I think I can ask, is something bothering you?"
Susan,"Clearly. You know, when you were out on the lawn, you said something about Mike."
Susan,"Well, it was just sort of muttering. Were you having a dream about him?"
Susan,"Well, maybe it's because you just saw him. He must be on your mind."
Susan,You can't. Your house isn't finished yet.
Susan,"Well, if you insist--"
Susan,"Okay, but in the meantime, um, I do have a teenage daughter, so if you could--"
Susan,Yes. Thanks.
Susan,"Well, if you forgot something, you can just come back for it, or-- you could just not leave."
Susan,"Well, before you go, I just want to say that, um--having you here these last few weeks-"
Susan,I know. I just--I can't stop now. I broke the seal.
Susan,I can't help it. My hormones are in overdrive. Didn't you get that way when you were pregnant?
Susan,Really? Not even when you heard an acoustic guitar?
Susan,"Oh, I just can't control myself like that."
Susan,Thanks. I'm gonna try that. So you don't think I act like a lady?
Susan,"In honor of you coming home, we are making your favorite meal - steak and mashed potatoes."
Susan,Since when?
Susan,"You could say ""au gratin"" when you were 3?"
Susan,It's not your favorite?
Susan,Excuse me. I have to put something in a box and stick it in the closet.
Susan,"Maternity lingerie - ah, right. Why don't they just call it what it really is? A pup tent to hide your stretch marks."
Susan,I understand.
Susan,You just don't want to be crushed under the weight of a repulsive cow.
Susan,"No, I get it. Really, I knew this day was coming. I just didn't know it would be a day when I was so horny."
Susan,Oh. What's going on?
Susan,"Well, you can tell me anything. That's what we talked about in all those sessions with the doctor."
Susan,You are never to come near my family ever again! Do you understand?
Susan,"Do you hear me, Orson?!"
Susan,So you don't know that your husband tried to kill mike?
Susan,"Trying to protect your mother? I know. Who cares? You drove the car, you ran him over, and you left him for dead!"
Susan,"And the worst part--all this time, you pretended to be our friend."
Susan,I can't come out my front door every day and see that man. We have to move.
Susan,Take a step back from what? He tried to murder you.
Susan,"How can you do that? He put you in a coma. I sat there day after day, wondering if you were gonna live. As far as I'm concerned, Orson can go to hell."
Susan,"Well, that's not enough. He should pay for what he did. He should go to prison."
Susan,Mike says I need to forgive Orson--
Susan,"And he's right. I have to find a way to make peace with all of this. But you need to understand, it's gonna be one of the hardest things I've ever done. And like most things in my life, I probably won't do it with much elegance or grace. So if I don't come over to your house for coffee--if I don't smile when the two of you walk by, just please know that I still love you. And for forgiving Orson--just be patient. I'll get there."
Susan,So you don't know that your husband tried to kill Mike?
Susan,"No, I'm not finished with it. It's a Lamaze class. I guarantee you I will not be the only woman in there holding a Chimichanga. Wow, it's all couples. I wish Mike didn't have that rehab thing tonight."
Susan,"Oh, no, that's okay. I'll be fine."
Susan,Quit eyeing it. I ain't sharing.
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,My god.
Susan,"He got his skank pregnant, and you didn't tell me?"
Susan,"Okay, I get it."
Susan,"Hello, Karl."
Susan,What does that mean?
Susan,"Okay, clearly, this is not going to work. So why don't you take your child bride and find another class?"
Susan,The only work I've had done was getting 185 pounds of ugly fat sucked out of my house.
Susan,"Oh, no, no, no, th-those are not the legs of a law professor."
Susan,"There's nothing wrong with that. It shows our respect for Lamaze, and, you know, the whole birthing process."
Susan,"Karl? Is he here? Oh, what a freakish--"
Susan,"Cause I knew you'd make us switch to another class. Last time I was here, Karl kept throwing his perfect life in my face, and I just wanted to come back here and--"
Susan,"""Hence."" That's classy. Say a lot of ""hence"" when we see him."
Susan,I'm not asking you to lie. I'm just saying spin. Why won't you spin?
Susan,"Hey, guys. Mike, you remember Karl? And this is Karl's wife Marisa."
Susan,"Well, after this, we have a big party to go to."
Susan,Just bananas.
Susan,I know.
Susan,Did you have to tell Karl about rehab?
Susan,"Yeah, but that doesn't mean you have to go blurting all our deepest, darkest secrets."
Susan,"Oh, enough with the ""hence."" I'm just saying that some things are private, and I think that you can be honest without being inappropriate."
Susan,And Karl made his happy monkey face. Did you notice that?
Susan,He's not feeling well. I see Marisa isn't here either.
Susan,"Okay, Karl, you win. You happy?"
Susan,"Just drop the act. You are so loving this. You ended up with the Miss America with a law degree, and I ended up with the pillhead plumber. Bravo. Damn it! Why won't this unroll?"
Susan,"Oh, really? You guys live one day at a time? Is your first thought when she's late that maybe she's out using again or maybe she's dead? It just seems like everything is so fragile right now, which is not the way you want it to be when you're about to have a baby."
Susan,"Uh, yeah. That guy was the worst."
Susan,I know. I just wish I could fast-forward through my life and see that everything ends up okay.
Susan,Thank you. Which cousin?
Susan,It's nice to meet you.
Susan,"Oh, okay."
Susan,"Oh, well, good. Thank you."
Susan,Oh! Oh!
Susan,Wow. It's all recipes.
Susan,"Um, well--I guess Mike didn't tell you that I'm, uh, really not a cook."
Susan,"The one she won't be helping me with--please tell me it's ""whore."""
Susan,"A fount of wisdom, your meemaw. Well--I really appreciate this. Thanks, Adele."
Susan,Don't do that--mama.
Susan,I don't have one.
Susan,Sorry.
Susan,Don't even know what they are.
Susan,"Although he also enjoys coming home to sesame chicken from Red Panda, and they deliver."
Susan,"He told you that? Well, we're getting past it."
Susan,I have a job.
Susan,Children's books pay.
Susan,"You know, I think, actually, I might have those dough hooks somewhere."
Susan,"No, no. It's fine, Adele. Mama."
Susan,"Bree, are you okay?"
Susan,"Oh, my god."
Susan,I can't believe she made a play for Orson.
Susan,What are you gonna do?
Susan,"It's not like all the other times, Edie. We're done."
Susan,"We're not inviting you to poker. We're not talking to you. We're not even gonna wave when you jog by. From now on, you are invisible."
Susan,I'm doing what now?
Susan,"Well, that's gonna change real soon."
Susan,Nice? She's driving me crazy. You have got to stop complaining about me to her.
Susan,"Well, you could see how I, as the nude, snoring whore, would think so."
Susan,"Well, the next time she tries to help, she's gonna get an old-fashioned in her face, so you better step up and start defending me."
Susan,"Oh, my god! My water broke."
Susan,My water just broke. I'm in labor. We have to go.
Susan,"I don't know what to tell you, mama. Look at me. Aah!"
Susan,"No, no, no, you should take a cab home and start packing. This one feels like a crier."
Susan,Aah! Aah! Come on. Aah! Aah! Aah!
Susan,Ah. Ah.
Susan,A few weeks apart. Wanna go to the movies?
Susan,"I'm not in labor, okay?"
Susan,That was club soda. Amniotic fluid doesn't have ice cubes and a lemon wedge.
Susan,"I'm sorry. I panicked. Your mother just invited herself to stay with us for three weeks, and you said nothing. I had to come up with a plan."
Susan,I didn't say it was a good plan. Do you see the effect she has on me? I just thank god I wasn't drinking coffee. I could've hurt myself.
Susan,Thank you. Do you wanna go back in there right now and tell her?
Susan,"Well, it happens."
Susan,That--turns out I spilled some club soda.
Susan,"He sure does, but I want mine first."
Susan,Um--Sorry. Go on.
Susan,Aah!
Susan,"No, no, no, I love where this is going."
Susan,"No, I'm not trying to-- Aah!"
Susan,Maybe. Who cares! Let her have it.
Susan,Apology accepted. Let's go. Aah!
Susan,"Oh, I know you do. I don't, and neither does the baby. Philip? Oh, Phil? See? Nothing. Not even a burp. Here's a thought. How about ""Nathaniel""?"
Susan,I am not naming my son after a quarterback.
Susan,"It sounds like ""Mucus."""
Susan,Like the deodorant?
Susan,"Oh, give me that. Well, we need new inspiration. Ooh. Riley."
Susan,"He's a guy who--""killed six, then self."" Well, I give up. He's not gonna get a name. When we want him to come, we'll just whistle and say, ""Here, boy."""
Susan,Conner.
Susan,"Me, too. Oh, you finally have a name. Dr. Conner Delfino."
Susan,"Oh, I'm so sorry. I know how much you loved him."
Susan,"Oh. Well, yeah, um, I mean, ""Conner"" we just picked it after the senior. This would mean something."
Susan,"I think it's a beautiful way to honor your grandfather. I mean, ""James"" wouldn't be my first choice, but it's a good, solid name."
Susan,"Oh, right. Maynard. Oh, that's awful--that he died."
Susan,"Oh, and rare, really rare."
Susan,"Yeah. I said that, didn't I? Oh, shoot. We can't do it. Isn't your Grandpa James significantly older than Grandpa Maynard? Shouldn't we honor him first?"
Susan,You sure? It's worth a phone call.
Susan,Oh. Forgive me. Don't look at me like that. His grandfather just died.
Susan,Maynard.
Susan,"Okay, drop the act, ladies. I hate it, too. Mike insisted that we name him after his dead grandfather."
Susan,"I know. It's terrible, but I can't change it now. Mike was so emotional about it."
Susan,"Well, I'm not sure that the world war II argument is gonna fly."
Susan,You're right. My son's future is at stake. I have to do something.
Susan,"Hello, Maynard. I love you, Maynard. My sweet little-- May May. Mamie. Nerd."
Susan,Hello. I need to change the name on my baby's birth certificate.
Susan,"Delfino, Maynard."
Susan,"Oh. Working. Busy, busy, busy. Uh, but he told me to tell you that he's totally cool with it."
Susan,"Oh. Uh--okay. I'm just gonna level with you. My husband picked the name, and I think it's horrible, and I know over time, he's gonna agree."
Susan,"You gotta help me out here. I'm just trying to protect my child. I don't want him to go through life saddled with the name ""Maynard."""
Susan,"Well, of course, you don't. You're Vanessa. You went through life with a beautiful name. That's why you have such a crackerjack personality."
Susan,Griselda--That must have been a tough name to take out on the playground.
Susan,We should talk.
Susan,"Oh, honey. Can you get all my toiletries out of the bathroom?"
Susan,What are those?
Susan,Get them out of here now.
Susan,Because my husband is terrified of balloons. He was once molested by a clown.
Susan,Is that what it said?
Susan,Shh!
Susan,"Well--I hate the name ""Maynard."""
Susan,Get out.
Susan,"I'm sorry. I--I just want our kid to have a great name. I don't think ""Maynard"" is great."
Susan,Wow. I didn't know about that.
Susan,Mm. Maynard. Let's hope he's worthy.
Susan,"Well, I have to agree. She's changed. She's not that fun anymore."
Susan,"Random chitchat, nothing specific."
Susan,"Hey, got any plans tomorrow at 5:00 a.m.? 'Cause now you do. Bree needs about two truckloads of flowers picked up from--What?"
Susan,"Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I'm so proud of you! Okay, I am going to need a bumper sticker right away so I can start annoying all the other parents!"
Susan,Tuesday? What are you talking about?
Susan,"Next week? W-well, that is a big--No."
Susan,"Yes--To be chosen, and you have been chosen. So congratulations, and you're staying home."
Susan,"But it's a huge honor. Yes, we've established that. It's huge. It's an honor. We get it."
Susan,"Well, the first thing off the top of my head--uh--We can't afford it."
Susan,"Mike, that is so sweet. Mike makes another good point. Who is this professor? I don't know him. I am certainly not going to give my daughter to him for a summer. I'm sorry, Julie. This is not happening."
Susan,"Well, yes, but don't forget--It is a huge honor."
Susan,Hey.
Susan,"Uh, um, no, I-I haven't seen her."
Susan,"Hey, Katherine, are you all right?"
Susan,"Well, I'm sure she's just upset, and she'll come home after she cools off."
Susan,"Well-- we all lie to our kids sometimes, right?"
Susan,I want to be able to reach you this summer when you're doing that internship.
Susan,"Here's the thing. You and I have always had kind of an unconventional relationship, and the reason that worked was because we always tell each other the truth--until yesterday. Julie, I lied about not having enough money to send you."
Susan,Because I just freaked out about you leaving.
Susan,"Yes, in the fall. And I needed those extra three months to get ready. I--I still have not figured out how I'm gonna get by without you."
Susan,Seriously--I just lean on you in ways you don't even know.
Susan,"Well--I spend more time with me than you do, and I'm a mess."
Susan,Really?
Susan,Thanks. Now I want you to have that phone on you at all times--because I'm still not sure how to work the dishwasher.
Susan,"My god! Bree,are you all right?"
Susan,"Come here, come here."
Susan,"Okay, just listen to me."
Susan,"I knew Wayne was the reason she moved away, and the second she moved back, he started stalking her again."
Susan,Honey? I'm home. Did you miss me?
Susan,Mike.
Susan,Amazing.
Susan,So were you. Oh. And--Time to go.
Susan,"I don't know. Come on, zippy, zippy."
Susan,"Well, good, then you shouldn't have any problem finding a place to sleep."
Susan,"You know, you're a guy, and we just had hot sex, and I didn't force you to cuddle. So run! Go! Brag to your friends."
Susan,Edie? Is that really you?
Susan,Really? Whose?
Susan,I'm back. You want something cold?
Susan,You know--This is why it's taking four months to get my house painted.
Susan,I think I'll have it done right now.
Susan,"Mm. Uh, Lynette, it's not really a good time."
Susan,Yeah. He--he's hard to keep track of.
Susan,"Oh, you poor thing! You need a hug."
Susan,"Hey, anytime that you need to talk, you just ring my bell--and wait."
Susan,"Okay, new rule. From now on, sex only happens in the bedroom, door closed, between the hours of 7:00 and 10:00 P.M."
Susan,"No, of course not. It's just-- complicated."
Susan,I'm sorry. I can't give that to you.
Susan,What are you doing here?
Susan,Not here. Go home. I'll call you.
Susan,I don't know. Later. Just go.
Susan,Is it? I can't tell. Ooh! Excuse me.
Susan,"You, come with me. Why would you humiliate me in front of my friends? Are you a lunatic?"
Susan,"No, of course not. My friends would love you."
Susan,"The problem is, if you meet my friends, then we're in a relationship, and I can't be in a relationship right now."
Susan,"Well, Maybe I don't deserve to be happy. A few years ago--There was this car accident--A bad one."
Susan,"You know what, Jackson? You're not gonna say anything I haven't already heard a million times. I-I only told you because I--I just want you to understand why I can't let you in my life."
Susan,"Yeah, I guess I could handle that."
Susan,Okay.
Susan,"Yeah, he's upstairs waiting for you."
Susan,I told you the brakes were squeaking. I asked you to get them checked.
Susan,I meant a mechanic--Not you.
Susan,"And we killed them, Mike!"
Susan,"They were a mother and a child. She was a mother, just like me--with a child just like ours. And if it weren't for us, they would still be alive."
Susan,"It's like you don't care at all, like you feel nothing for those people."
Susan,Hey. Did you pack your dinosaur book so you can read it with your daddy?
Susan,"Oh, good. Mmm. Okay, you have fun, sweetie."
Susan,Fine.
Susan,"Well, I've sort of start seeing someone. So I might do something with him."
Susan,Fine.
Susan,It's not really a good time.
Susan,"Edie, is that really you?"
Susan,"Mike! Uh, what's going on?"
Susan,Oh. Thanks. So I guess you met Jackson.
Susan,"Oh, clearly this is not how I would've wanted the two of you to meet. He's--he's really a nice guy."
Susan,"Oh, I don't know that that's necessary."
Susan,"Oh, well, first off, um, M.J. Was at a sleep over last night. And, in fact, Jackson and he haven't even met, so, uh, there's really no need for you to be hanging--or checking."
Susan,"Hey, hold on. You don't get to just decide these things by yourself."
Susan,"Well, when you meet him for the second time, you can tell him that. He's picking you up here tomorrow night."
Susan,I'll explain over breakfast. Did you get the paper?
Susan,"Oh, hey!"
Susan,"Ah, no."
Susan,"Well, I do. We need a shirt that says, ""I'm a responsible citizen,"" not ""My favorite clothing store also sells bongs."""
Susan,"Absolutely. Put this on. Now--Let's talk about acceptable topics of conversation. You like sports, right?"
Susan,"No, you're not. You like football-- American football. Specifically the colts."
Susan,"And here are some other things you can talk about--Cars, barbecue, fishing."
Susan,"Jackson, please take this seriously."
Susan,"He could take me to court, and the judge can make me choose between you and my son. And I'm sorry. You will lose."
Susan,Thank you. Now go shave. You look like a hobo.
Susan,"You guys were insulting each other. That's good, right?"
Susan,Really?
Susan,Potato skins at O'brien's? You've made his inner circle! This is fantastic! Thank you. Mmm. Mmm.
Susan,Nice.
Susan,Yeah. Mmm. You've never done that before. Wait. You've never done that before. Why are you doing that now?
Susan,"Yeah. But how did you know I would like it? Oh, my god."
Susan,"Mike told you about the ear thing, didn't he?"
Susan,So you just happened to stumble across my secret turn-on the same night that you and Mike became B.F.F.S?
Susan,"This is-- I mean, I'm just--I have been violated."
Susan,Don't touch me! Or my ears! My ears are dead to you.
Susan,"He has a name for it? Okay. That's it. You and Mike are not hanging out anymore. And this little Wednesday ""potato skins and Susan sex tips night""? I forbid it. Did Mike mention he likes having his toes sucked? Oops! That just slipped out."
Susan,Oh. Is his name Mike Delfino? Did you room together at liars' college?
Susan,"Yeah, you'll drop by later--With potato skins on your breath, you miserable two-timer!"
Susan,"Nothing. Just, the answering machine lied to mommy."
Susan,Where is he?
Susan,Like you don't know-- Jackson.
Susan,Really? Whose is this?
Susan,I am-- so sorry. Miss? Um-- Could you just--please take good care of my friend?
Susan,He said that?
Susan,I am such a jackass.
Susan,"Well, I was pretty ticked off that you told Jackson about the ear thing."
Susan,Apology accepted.
Susan,I don't--
Susan,I'm just not comfortable with you and Jackson getting that close.
Susan,It's just--I don't want him to see me through your eyes.
Susan,"Well, those last few months we were together, I--The things I said to you, the way I acted--I mean, I'm not proud of the person I became."
Susan,"Could you please take care of this guy? He's my friend, too."
Susan,"Out, uh, doing some thinking. And I've decided that I may have gone a little overboard about you and Mike. In fact, I think it's cool if you wanna hang out with my ex."
Susan,What are you doing here?
Susan,"Can you leave, please?"
Susan,Get out.
Susan,"Ugh. Hey. Hon. How was the park? Wait. Hold on. Mommy just found her first gray hair. I need you to grab it, yank it and never speak of it again. Oh. Look at your face. It's scratched. What happened?"
Susan,And your shirt is ripped. That's the second time this week. Is someone picking on you? Who is it?
Susan,"Oh, sweetie. I know you're upset, but you'll feel better if you talk about it. And there's nothing you can't tell me. I'm your mommy."
Susan,Okay. We'll give him a call.
Susan,"Well, what did he say?"
Susan,He's only 5. I don't want him fighting.
Susan,Ugh.
Susan,"You know what, boys? Not in the house. Oh, my god!"
Susan,Hey! You leave him Alone. Oh! Honey! Is that who's been picking on you? Juanita Solis?
Susan,"Well, she is going to get a big surprise, because your daddy is about to turn you into a killing machine."
Susan,What?
Susan,That's not just any girl. You saw her. She could take down a small deer.
Susan,"That is sexi. If feminism means anything, it's that it's okay for a big, mean girl to get her butt kicked. You, teach him one of those Brazilian kung fu cha-cha things."
Susan,Ah! Couple of wusses. I'll handle it myself.
Susan,"Gaby, we have a problem. I just saw Juanita push M.J. down."
Susan,Really. It's not the first time. Juanita's been bullying him.
Susan,Thank you.
Susan,Hear what?
Susan,Well--A girl.
Susan,"Gaby, Juanita's fat for your age."
Susan,You know what? Maybe you could teach your daughter how to use her words and not her fists.
Susan,"Oh! Wait. Your forgot your whistle. Okay, sweetie. This is just to be on the safe side. If Juanita comes around, you just blow it. I'll be right there."
Susan,Good boy.
Susan,"Juanita Solis, don't you move! You are in big trouble!"
Susan,Never mind. What did you do to M.J.?
Susan,So your solution was to push him down? Do you think that's nice? How would you feel if someone did that to you?
Susan,"Oh, really? You don't think it would hurt?"
Susan,"I'm sorry. Juanita, I just wanted you to see how it felt. Are you okay?"
Susan,"Okay, first off, it wasn't as bad as it looked."
Susan,I barely tapped her. She was milking it.
Susan,I was trying to teach her not to be a bully--Something she should have learned from her mother.
Susan,This conversation is over. Tell Bob and Lee that I'll pay for the dent in their lawn. You did not!
Susan,"You know what? We've both been incredibly childish here, and it is time one of us took the high road, so I am now going to walk away. Please take note of this conflict resolution and try to pass the lesson on to your daughter."
Susan,I came to say I'm sorry.
Susan,I brought booze.
Susan,"Like, I have this rule--No toy guns. Except everything that M.J. Picks up--Whether it's a hairbrush, a hanger, everything--he pretends it's a gun."
Susan,"He's a boy. That's my point! I know nothing about raising boys. And I think M.J. Has figured this out, so he goes straight to Mike whenever there's a problem."
Susan,"Yeah, sure, on alternate weekends. That's fine--until-- M.J. needs his daddy, and his daddy's not there."
Susan,"Well, we split up, so it's at least half my fault any way you slice it."
Susan,Preparing them for what?
Susan,"Well, I don't see any kid of yours being a victim. You're the strongest person I know."
Susan,"Well, I thought I had you beaten today, and next think I knew, I was eating grass."
Susan,Maybe you need to get mad more often.
Susan,This is nice. We should rumble all the time.
Susan,To Gabrielle Solis--Another good mom.
Susan,"Well, I sort of started seeing someone."
Susan,Did I not say 7:00? You missed their little show. M.J. Was tooth decay.
Susan,"Well, did you tell me to take off the lens cap? Next Time, be more specific."
Susan,Look what he did with my hair. I kind of like the bangs.
Susan,"Which is a good thing, 'cause there's a shark attacking the house."
Susan,"Because--Mike and I are divorced, so that's why--it was supposed to be a picture of the family, so you should've put your daddy in it."
Susan,"To Susan, the sweetest, most--"
Susan,"You're gonna be in magazines, too?"
Susan,Wow! Isn't it fantastic?
Susan,"So you're still gonna wanna hang out with us, even when you're totally fabulous, and we're still nobodies?"
Susan,Mike! What's going on?
Susan,"Yes, I see. And here, mommy thought we'd agreed to wait till your birthday. Crazy mommy."
Susan,"Oh, my god. This is about M.J.'s drawing, isn't it?"
Susan,He does not love Jackson more than you. He knows who his father is.
Susan,So you're totally fine with that drawing?
Susan,Hello?
Susan,Great. He's so excited to learn. Are you sure he's ready to go without training wheels?
Susan,Yeah. He's been asking when you're coming. I can't wait to tell him. I know he'll be just--Ah--
Susan,Spider. Big one. Gotta go!
Susan,"I know! You did great! Jackson, can I see you a sec?"
Susan,Yeah. You know what I learned? Mike is on his way over here to teach his son how to ride the bike he bought--something he was looking forward to until you ruined it.
Susan,I had to tell you not to steal a father's precious moment.
Susan,You could've walked away.
Susan,Damn it.
Susan,"Come on, M.J. Your daddy's waiting."
Susan,"Oh, honey. You know how you like to push the button when we go on the elevator, and if somebody else pushes it first, it makes you sad?"
Susan,"Just listen. Daddy really wanted to be the one to teach you to ride your bike, and if you can already do it, it's gonna make him sad. So just let daddy push the button. Understand?"
Susan,Yeah. I think it's just beginner's luck. Uh-huh.
Susan,"No. He was absolutely waiting for you, you know, I think I'm gonna go check his helmet."
Susan,What are you doing? We talked about this. You're supposed to be new at it.
Susan,"Oh! Of what? You're 3 inches off the ground. You're completely padded. So just do what I say--Wobble, wobble. ""Daddy, look at me!"" crash."
Susan,Boy--He was just telling me how glad he is to have his dad here.
Susan,"Oh, that's just silly."
Susan,"Whoops-a-daisy! Oh, it's a good thing your dad's here to teach you how to do it right."
Susan,"Oh, he's fine."
Susan,"Oh, will you stop? The doctor said it was just a sprain."
Susan,"You know, why look for blame? Kids fall. If you have to find fault, blame the pavement, not yourself--or me."
Susan,"Remember, it's the pavement you're mad at."
Susan,Jason taught him to ride the bike.
Susan,"Hey, doc. Uh, don't you hand out lollipops to brave little boys?"
Susan,"I'm sorry. M.J. was excited about the bike, so Jackson took off the training wheels and taught him. He didn't know."
Susan,"Okay, you know what? This is not Jackson's fault. You can't give a 5-year-old a bike and expect him to wait to ride it until you have time. You know, this is what it means to be divorced. It means that sometimes you won't be there."
Susan,"Well, it's hard for me, too. I miss things when he's with you. And I--am trying to come to terms with my guilt, because--I have to."
Susan,I've never seen Bree so happy. She's glowing.
Susan,"Yeah, just until you can blink both eyes at the same time."
Susan,Hi.
Susan,"Har har. Uh, actually, he's at Juanita's watching a DVD. Do you want me to call him?"
Susan,You're moving again? How far are you gonna be away now? The Hudson house?
Susan,"Yeah. It's great. Uh, we'll be like--one big, happy, divorced family."
Susan,"It's a little weird. I--I but, you know, M.J. will be thrilled, and--Yeah, I'm fine with it."
Susan,"No, it wouldn't."
Susan,"Hi, guys. Welcome to the party."
Susan,What took you so long? People are gonna be here any minute. I need you to pour the cheap vodka into the expensive bottles.
Susan,"Well, just please change your shirt."
Susan,Fine. You can have a little space in the closet. I think I've got some clothes from the '80s I'm ready to part with.
Susan,Moving in? Here?
Susan,"So obviously, this is the bedroom."
Susan,"I don't know. Um--I'm sort of going through a difficult transition in my life right now. I need a change. Uh, I was thinking--taupe."
Susan,"Uh, thanks."
Susan,Get out.
Susan,"I was not born yesterday, pal. You're coming on to me."
Susan,"Oh, please. Telling me I smell good? I'm not even wearing deodorant."
Susan,"Semantics. And then the not so subtle sit-on-the-bed maneuver? You know, why not just ask for a massage?"
Susan,You said you liked it.
Susan,"No. No, don't go. That was very sweet of you to consider my feelings. You know what? You're hired."
Susan,You know what? We need a minute.
Susan,Are we doing the right thing here?
Susan,"Once we sign these papers, there's no going back."
Susan,I know. I'm thinking--that maybe that was a mistake.
Susan,"We wouldn't be here if it weren't for that accident. You know that. Before that, we were good. We could get back there."
Susan,"Oh, come on! We were Mike and Susan, remember? You only get one of those in a lifetime. We could make things right again."
Susan,Uh-- it--it looks good.
Susan,Thanks. Do you like scotch?
Susan,H-honest? Okay.
Susan,"So just to be clear, you're saying you don't want a relationship?"
Susan,"No, uh-- It's fantastic."
Susan,"I don't want a relationship either. All I want from you is exactly what we just did. Except next time, it's Susan."
Susan,Unless you're not interested.
Susan,I gave romance a shot and--I'm ready for something a little more casual.
Susan,"Uh, yeah. You want to move in."
Susan,Um--no.
Susan,What's wrong with the way things are? Why change everything now?
Susan,"Hi, guys. Welcome to the party."
Susan,"Well, you really went all out."
Susan,Where's Karen?
Susan,Do I you think she'll be surprised?
Susan,It means that someone forgot that we had an agreement to keep things casual.
Susan,"No, it wouldn't."
Susan,What?
Susan,Poor Karen. I hope she's okay.
Susan,"We should probably talk now, huh?"
Susan,"Jackson, what we have here has been working pretty well."
Susan,Can't we just keep going the way we are?
Susan,We had an agreement to keep things casual.
Susan,"No, it wouldn't."
Susan,"So out of nowhere, Jackson says, ""Let's move in together."" I-I mean, of course I was stunned. And then when I said no, he just broke up with me. I mean, does he really expect me to be in love after just five months? That's crazy."
Susan,"It's Susan. And he was the first one to say he didn't want to get serious, which is why I was happy. We were just having fun."
Susan,"Not so much. Frank, how can I call him? He's the one that ended it with me."
Susan,How much am I paying you?
Susan,That's not enough.
Susan,Jackson? It's me. Hello? That'll work.
Susan,Are we ok?
Susan,Good. So who the hell are you?
Susan,Susan. Jackson's girlfriend.
Susan,"Well, when guys go slut hunting, they tend not to play the girlfriend card."
Susan,"You met the guy in night, then you're in a shower. I'm just doing the math."
Susan,"So we break up, and 15 minutes later you're with someone else? You got over me fast."
Susan,Stay out of this.
Susan,I wanted to talk about our future.
Susan,"Well, I was starting to change my mind, and then I show up and find 5 feet of lip gloss in the shower. I brought hot wings. You're not getting any."
Susan,"Sorry, bad time. I have the mailman upstairs in my tub."
Susan,I don't?
Susan,"Yeah, I have been married twice, and both times that's imploded, so really, I feel like--love is not my friend. You know, I-I wish that I could say it was just rotten luck, but--I just am thinking that--I can't do this."
Susan,"Wow--We really messed this up, didn't we?"
Susan,We just have so much baggage. I wish we could start over. Can we start over?
Susan,Hello?
Susan,May I ask who's calling?
Susan,"Uh, yeah. I think I remember you."
Susan,Okay. When?
Susan,Ugh!
Susan,Sounds great. Pick me up at 7:00.
Susan,Can we start over?
Susan,Okay.
Susan,Yeah. I gotta have one more. Ah! Thank you for doing this.
Susan,Mm.
Susan,And knowing we're not gonna have sex takes all the pressure off.
Susan,"Yes. We're starting completely over, so this time, we're gonna do things right."
Susan,"Well, it means--no sex until at least date four."
Susan,I want us to spend this time really getting to know each other.
Susan,What's my least favorite word?
Susan,"You're just guessing. It's ""panties."""
Susan,"Although some days it's ""larva"" or ""chunks."""
Susan,Mm. Now you tell me something I don't know about you.
Susan,I sort of guessed that when you painted my house.
Susan,Seriously?
Susan,Wow. So now you're painting--my bathroom?
Susan,Blocked?
Susan,"Well, I'm sorry things aren't going well. But I'm glad you told me. See? We're getting to know each other. And we wouldn't have if we'd spent the whole night in bed."
Susan,"And so there I was in ninth grade, and my boobs had not made an appearance. I was desperate."
Susan,"And so that's when I got caught stuffing at the pep rally. And six months later--Kaboom. I was voted prom queen. Nice work, girls. Stop that right now."
Susan,The sex music. Turn it off.
Susan,"We are not having sex until date number four, and this is date number two."
Susan,Jackson��_��_��_
Susan,"Okay, do you know how sad it makes me to know that you only braised it to boink me? You're supposed to be asking me questions. The point of all this was to get to know each other better."
Susan,"You know, that was hard for me to share, and the fact that you just make light of it--No, I'm am calling the second date officially over. And you know what? I was going to let you feel me up over my blouse. But now? Nada."
Susan,Thank you--for a wonderful third date. And I'm glad that you're back on board with our plan.
Susan,"Mmm. Oh, pop quiz! Why did Kim Beale stop talking to me in eighth grade?"
Susan,Right! What time is it?
Susan,No. It's sex time!
Susan,What?!
Susan,"Jackson, look at me. I'm tipsy. I'm horny. I'm easier than a 5-year-old's homework."
Susan,The forehead?
Susan,Jackson?
Susan,"Hi. I am declaring this our official fourth date, okay? The rules have been followed, and you may begin disrobing--now."
Susan,"Okay, I just ran into your house half-naked. The only thing you should be doing is me. What is on your face? Is that paint? Are you painting again?"
Susan,I thought you were blocked.
Susan,"So you've broken through your creative logjam? Congratulations! Ooh, why not celebrate by ripping off my clothes with your teeth?"
Susan,How close are you? 'cause I can wait.
Susan,That's me.
Susan,"That look on my face--I've seen before--in the mirror, when I'm feeling--How do you know about that look?"
Susan,"I can't believe I ever thought you didn't know me. Well, I guess I should let you finish this. I'm sort of missing hands."
Susan,Really?
Susan,Oh. Come on. I think you know the answer to that.
Susan,"Oh! Look at my little girl. Isn't she adorable? Oh, I missed her so much."
Susan,"Oh, not yet. I wanna give her new boyfriend the once-over. Wow. He's as cute as she said-- nice smile, and look at that hair. Don't you just wanna run your fingers through it?"
Susan,"You know, I'm very good at first impressions. I'm gonna like this guy. Why is the cab driver handing Julie's boyfriend money? Why is Julie's boyfriend getting back in the cab? And why is the middle-aged cab driver kissing Julie?"
Susan,I know what's going on. Let me enjoy my denial.
Susan,"You know, when your 24-year-old daughter calls you and tells you she's bringing home a boy from college, you sort of expect it to be, well, a boy."
Susan,And a damn good one.
Susan,Your what?
Susan,Before that.
Susan,Before that.
Susan,That's the one. So you've been married three times?
Susan,I don't believe so. Although I may have blacked out after she told me you were 40. So how does a man your age get married and divorced three times?
Susan,Did someone throw rice at you?
Susan,It counts.
Susan,"Yeah. Only twice. Two. Small number. Much smaller than three. And my first cheated on me, so that doesn't even count."
Susan,Shut up.
Susan,"Well, that's true."
Susan,"Why? Oh, my god."
Susan,That has got to stop. I'm gonna do something.
Susan,"Uh-huh, she's a grown woman with stars in her eyes who's in love with a 3-times loser."
Susan,Aren't I?
Susan,Aren't I?
Susan,"You're right. I'll stay out of it. Oh, now where is the little girls' room?"
Susan,"Hey, why did that guy hand you a CD?"
Susan,No. Why?
Susan,Tonight?! Isn't that lovely?
Susan,"Hey, you two. What's going on?"
Susan,"Oh, I just love this song. And Jackson doesn't like to dance, so--isn't this fun?"
Susan,"Oh, reminds me of being young and single. Oh, I wish I'd never given up that."
Susan,Right! Right. You mind easing away so I can dance with my daughter?
Susan,I'm--just movin' to the music.
Susan,"Uh, no. No. No, no. No! No, no, no! Oh, all right! But no matter what he asks you, promise me you'll say ""no."""
Susan,"Lloyd, I'm sorry. I can't help I I don't want my daughter to be someone's fourth wife."
Susan,"Right, better feelings than you had about wives one, two and three?"
Susan,"""Ever""? W-what do you mean ""ever""?"
Susan,What is this about you never getting married?
Susan,"Hey, I believe in marriage."
Susan,"Oh, Julie, you're way too young to be this cynical."
Susan,"Well, putting a wall around your heart doesn't protect you. It just keeps people out. I learned that the hard way. Now with Jackson--I remember that I like feeling hopeful. I like believing in ""happily ever after."" I really wish that you felt that way, too."
Susan,"Hey, Jackson. Where are you going? The guys are about to start."
Susan,Jackson-- he's in the bathroom.
Susan,Jackson. Jackson.
Susan,Jackson--he's still in there. He's in the bathroom.
Susan,Jackson. Thank god. Where's mike?
Susan,Yeah! He went in there to find you.
Susan,I didn't see him.
Susan,Someone's coming!
Susan,Hi!
Susan,"Uh, he's fine, just getting some stitches. Oh. How's--Wait, who are you here to see?"
Susan,"Oh. Crap! I didn't get anyone gifts. But I did give blood, so I'll just remind everybody that I did that."
Susan,How you feeling? I just gave blood.
Susan,"Oh, fine. He just needs some stitches. Ooh, those cookies look delicious. Where'd you get them?"
Susan,"Oh, I shouldn't. They're yours."
Susan,"Well, I did just give blood. Oh!"
Susan,"Mm, I hate macadamia nuts. You think they're white chocolate chips until it's too late. Stupid Hawaii. Who made 'em?"
Susan,Yeah. But what friend? Wait. Is this a woman friend?
Susan,When I'm done. Don't change the subject. Are you seeing someone?
Susan,"I care because you mean a lot to me, and it makes me feel good knowing that two people have found love and happiness. So what's her name? Who am I happy for?"
Susan,Why not?
Susan,So--I know her?
Susan,You're dating a friend of mine?
Susan,"I'm not, but now you have to tell me who she is. Fine. Have it your way. Oh, if he ever needs a transfusion, you are not allowed to give him my blood."
Susan,I don't understand. Carlos might get his sight back. You should be thrilled.
Susan,"Gaby, please. Most women would kill to look like you."
Susan,You are still beautiful. So you've gained a little weight. Who hasn't? Don't go by me. I have a weird metabolism.
Susan,Gaby thinks that Carlos isn't gonna find her attractive after he gets his sight back.
Susan,Edie!
Susan,Fine. You're a pig.
Susan,"Of course, even though I still think you're beautiful just the way you are."
Susan,"Hey, do you wanna take a walk? I need a little girl free time."
Susan,Well--It's about Mike.
Susan,Yeah. Can you imagine how upset I was when I discovered he's dating a friend of mine?
Susan,It's gotta be Lisa Wallace.
Susan,"You know, she has wanted to get her hooks into Mike for years. Every time she would have us over for a barbecue, she always wore something booby."
Susan,"Well, it doesn't matter. She's my friend. She should've come to me and discussed it first."
Susan,"All things we can discuss when I knock her teeth out with a pool cue. You know, it's sad when you can't trust a friend. Or maybe the lesson here is that she wasn't really a friend to begin with then."
Susan,It's fine. It's--fine.
Susan,"Yes, I am. You're perfectly right."
Susan,"Well, now you're not."
Susan,Bree?
Susan,So Bree knew?
Susan,"Okay. Well, have a nice day."
Susan,You knew about Katherine and Mike?
Susan,Why didn't you tell me?
Susan,"Well, she didn't."
Susan,"Uh, not good enough. You had a million chances to say something and you didn't. That is just the same as lying to my face. You know, I always thought that the one thing I could depend on you for was honesty. What happened to that?"
Susan,What am I supposed to do?
Susan,"Hello? It's me. I just wanted to tell you--I've been thinking about it, and, um, I'm okay with you dating Mike."
Susan,No--and I think it's great.
Susan,"Oh. Well, you haven't. Just treat him well, okay? He's a really good guy."
Susan,"Uh--no, thanks. I'm really busy. I have a lot of things to do today. Another time though, okay? Bye."
Susan,He's dating a friend of mine.
Susan,"M.J. ,hurry up. Your dad's here. Hey, Katherine. What are you doing here?"
Susan,"Of course. Why wouldn't it be okay? I think it's--great. Really, really great."
Susan,"Sweetie, good news. Katherine's gonna go to the zoo with you."
Susan,"Well, she and your daddy are friends, and the more, the merrier."
Susan,"Oh, don't forget his coat."
Susan,I'm sure you will.
Susan,You're home kind of early. Is everything okay?
Susan,What did happen?
Susan,Seriously? That's terrible. Is she okay?
Susan,I'm sorry. The--the image in my mind is probably way funnier than what actually happened. Why did M.J. do that?
Susan,That's the worst thing I've ever heard.
Susan,"No, I'm talking about that line you fed her. ""Sports illustrated""? What's the issue about, the senior Olympics?"
Susan,"I mean, I could see her on the cover of ""Menopause monthly."""
Susan,The whole thing's like a miracle.
Susan,Yeah. I got it.
Susan,"Uh, yeah. It's--round."
Susan,"Oh, looky there. Lou Gehrig."
Susan,Who did you sell the ball to?
Susan,Or maybe you used your corkscrew as much in four months as most people do in a lifetime. Ever think of that?
Susan,Hi.
Susan,"Hey, Katherine. What a cute top."
Susan,"By the way, uh, I don't think you're gonna have any problem. I had a little talk with M.J."
Susan,What is that supposed to mean?
Susan,What? I don't do that.
Susan,What? I have never said a negative word about them dating ever.
Susan,"What do you mean, the way I act?"
Susan,"Okay. It-it's a little uncomfortable, is whole situation. I mean, if M.J.'s picking up on it, how am I supposed to fix that?"
Susan,"Hey, everybody! Are we ready to have the best time ever?"
Susan,You're welcome.
Susan,You're welcome.
Susan,"I know. You know, that Colts jersey you bought him doesn't fit anymore."
Susan,So how is Katherine's foot?
Susan,"Sweetie, if you're worried that I don't like your daddy spending time with Katherine, don't be. I think it's great."
Susan,I can totally explain this. I swear.
Susan,"It was--I don't know, uh, about a month after you moved out. It was bedtime. I was trying to read to him, but he only wanted you. And he was crying so hard, and he kept asking me if you were ever coming back, and so I finally--said maybe you would. I just didn't want him to be so sad."
Susan,I didn't even think he'd remembered it.
Susan,Because we have never said it.
Susan,We've never looked each other in the eye and said that there is no chance we are ever getting back together.
Susan,Did we?
Susan,I don't know. I--You don't ever think about it?
Susan,No. I'm good.
Susan,"I'm sorry. If you're interested, I have dirt on Bree."
Susan,You're no better than I am.
Susan,Thank you. Can I go clubbing with you tonight?
Susan,"Oh, please! I'm bored. Mike has M.J., Jackson's out of town, and you're gonna need somebody to bitch about Bob to."
Susan,"Yes, that's fine. Gays love me."
Susan,"You, Bob, Andrew."
Susan,Come on.
Susan,"This is so fun! I haven't been out in ages. Tonight, I am gonna--boogie-oogie-oogie--"
Susan,Oh!
Susan,"Oh, I'll have what you're having."
Susan,"Hey, Jackson. What? Really?"
Susan,I thought you had a housekeeper.
Susan,"I just--Jackson called earlier, and, um--you know, he went to Riverton to visit his old art professor, and she offered him a job."
Susan,And he wants me to move there with him.
Susan,"Well--I wanna be with him, so--I think I have to."
Susan,Yeah. Sure. Why not?
Susan,What does that mean?
Susan,"Lee, that is not what I'm doing. Is Jackson perfect? No. But I don't think there is such a thing, and I have a history of sabotaging relationships. No, I'm doing this. I'm moving."
Susan,Oh! Knock yourself out.
Susan,Oh! Jazz!
Susan,I don't know. I was drunk.
Susan,"Just a friend. Oh, Gaby, do you think I did this subconsciously just to sabotage my relationship with Jackson?"
Susan,"Will you stop guessing? Oh, god! Why won't I just let myself be happy?"
Susan,My mechanic? Are you crazy?
Susan,"Bob! Um--uh, what are you doing here?"
Susan,"Yes. Uh, we had a very nice, uneventful evening. Why? What did he say? 'Cause he was pretty drunk, so he was--probably making stuff up."
Susan,Never mind her. She was just leaving.
Susan,"Uh, Bob--Uh, Lee did stay here last night. He slept on the couch--in the guest room. So you have nothing to worry about."
Susan,Lee wouldn't do that. He loves you.
Susan,"Lee, um--well, there's just no graceful way to ask this, so--I'm just gonna say it straight out. When you spent the night, did we get it on?"
Susan,Oh! So--nothing happened between us?
Susan,"Oh, thank god. You know, when I woke up next to you yesterday, I just didn't know what to think."
Susan,"'Cause you were mad at Bob, and I told you about how I sometimes sabotage my relationships."
Susan,Yeah. Now I can move in with Jackson with a clear conscience.bGood. Good.
Susan,Because--he loves me.
Susan,I'm getting there.
Susan,Mike and I will never get back together. I know that now. And I really need to move on with my life.
Susan,Jackson has made it pretty clear that he doesn't do good with long-distance relationships. I could lose him.
Susan,I'm not good alone. I need a man in my life.
Susan,But you are fun to dance with.
Susan,So he was married before. You don't kick a man out for that.
Susan,"Well, maybe I can help you. Think you can rent my house out?"
Susan,"Jackson got a teaching job at the college in Riverton, and--I'm going with him."
Susan,"I know it's sudden, but I feel really good about this. And it's only two hours away, so it'll still be like we're practically next door."
Susan,Edie!
Susan,Edie? Edie! Do you not hear me?
Susan,Looks like the mailman switched our mail again. Do you have mine?
Susan,What is wrong with you?
Susan,I'm sorry. I thought we gave your latest breakup the three seconds of shock it deserved.
Susan,Gladly.
Susan,Nothing. It's locked. Do you have a key?
Susan,No. Help! Get me out of here!
Susan,"Please, help! Please! I'm getting a really unpleasant picture of what you're like in the Ol' Sackarooni."
Susan,Gotta get out. I'm supposed to be meeting the moving company. What?
Susan,So now me wanting to be with the man I love is stupid?
Susan,What are you getting at?
Susan,Of course I have.
Susan,I don't know. I'm not sure. What are you doing?
Susan,Edie--
Susan,Todd Shaffer. I was 14.
Susan,He dumped me during math class.
Susan,This is a stupid exercise. I refuse to--
Susan,Lunch. It was lunch.
Susan,Ron. Dr. Ron. Are we done?
Susan,This is not proof of anything.
Susan,My grades sucked?
Susan,"Hey, I was single for several months after Karl and after Mike."
Susan,"Have you ever looked in your mirror, Edie? You're famous for the number of men you've conquered."
Susan,"It's not a compliment, you tramp! Okay, I am not gonna take relationship tips from a woman who has hooked up with--what is it? Over a thousand men?"
Susan,That is not much of a distinction.
Susan,You know-- maybe I do feel incomplete without a man. But I-- wouldn't trade places with you for anything. You wanna know why?
Susan,It's the way you are with men-- they're like tissues. You use one and then toss it away and then you're on to the next one. At least I'm looking for something real.
Susan,Really?
Susan,"Oh, my god."
Susan,It's just-- now I get it.
Susan,"All these years, I have judged you, and--it is not your fault. Oh, come here. You are the way you are because of your father."
Susan,"Edie, what the hell?"
Susan,And I was just trying to be nice and give you a free pass for being such a big slut! Edie!
Susan,"Aw, come on, Edie. I said I was sorry."
Susan,July?
Susan,"Oh, thank god! We've been locked in here all night."
Susan,I wasn't planning to.
Susan,I won't.
Susan,"Good-bye, Edie."
Susan,Thanks.
Susan,"Jackson, hi. Do you have a sec?"
Susan,"Uh, no, nothing's wrong. Just--we need to talk about this move."
Susan,"Hey, Gaby, did you remember to get change? 'Cause when I cash in my chips, I don't want to hear you say, ""All I've got is $50s."""
Susan,I wonder how many people are gonna show up. Mrs. McCluskey was saying he didn't have much family.
Susan,I'm in. How much are we talking?
Susan,So--is she in?
Susan,Do what?
Susan,"Look, I know it's quiet here, but I think you'll find there's a real charm to Fairview."
Susan,We're getting a wreath for Eli's funeral. Are you in?
Susan,"You know, if we're gonna have a get-together after the funeral, we should start thinking about food."
Susan,I thought that was clear.
Susan,All right.
Susan,"Hey, Bree, I know what you can make for the wake--that flaky-breaded-shrimp thing."
Susan,"Yard sale! Good. You're here. How are you, Eli?"
Susan,"Great. Yeah, I haven't worn these jeans in a while, and I found 20 bucks in the pocket. Don't you just love when that happens? Also, Karl left me for his secretary, so I need you to change these locks."
Susan,"Oh, thanks, but don't be. Just hurry. Karl said he was coming by to get some of his stuff, and I want this place to be a fortress by then."
Susan,"Oh, well, on one hand, I got dumped for a pair of headlights named Brandy. On the other, I reported Karl's credit cards stolen, and cut the pockets out of all of his pants. So a little from column ""A,"" a little from column ""B."" Sorry."
Susan,What do you mean?
Susan,Brandy's not a redhead. She's blonde.
Susan,What--do--you--know?
Susan,I didn't.
Susan,Just leave!
Susan,"I-I-if Karl's coming--change the locks, then leave."
Susan,"Change the locks, don't talk to me, then leave."
Susan,Thanks.
Susan,Locks.
Susan,"Actually, um--Jackson and I split up."
Susan,"Oh, yeah. He's a great guy. I just, uh, want to be alone right now."
Susan,"As long as you're here, I think there's a loose shingle on my roof. Do you think maybe you could fix it for me?"
Susan,What?
Susan,You can't retire. I break too many things.
Susan,"Hey, I am happy for you. It's just, uh--this is gonna sound crazy."
Susan,"Um, I think you have been the most consistent male relationship in my life. You're so stable and reliable, and I just--always thought you'd be around. Which is funny, because I don't really know anything about you."
Susan,Great. I will go to the store right now and get some wine so we can toast your retirement.
Susan,Okay. What kind do you like-- red or white?
Susan,I'm not surprised. He was a good man.
Susan,"Well, let's just make sure we remember him."
Susan,"Thank you for agreeing to see us, Mr. Hobson. Running a school like Oakridge mustn't leave you with much--free time."
Susan,So I heard through the grapevine that there might be an opening for another student?
Susan,"Yeah. He bit his teacher, huh? They had that problem with their older boy, Toby. It's a family of biters."
Susan,"Well, you wouldn't have to worry about that with M.J.. He's so well-behaved."
Susan,"I've been too pushy. Oh, please don't take it out on M.J.. He is such a bright kid. Say something in Spanish."
Susan,Be bored in Spanish.
Susan,Seriously?
Susan,Fantastic!
Susan,"Yeah. That's quite a tad. But we're starting in the middle of the year, so we'd only pay half, right?"
Susan,Fantastic.
Susan,"I know, I know. We may have to give up a few luxuries."
Susan,"Okay, you know the problems they're having at his school. And now with all the budget cutbacks--I mean, this place is fabulous."
Susan,"Well, we've gotta do something. My editor just quit, and my books are not exactly flying off the shelves. Could you pick up some extra shifts?"
Susan,What about that big job you just did for the last three months? What did you do with that money?
Susan,"Yeah, well, if we were still married, you'd--probably would've waited until I finished my sentence."
Susan,What's going on?
Susan,"Uh, what am I looking at exactly?"
Susan,"Oh, those. Oh, they're stunning."
Susan,What? Mike bought those? He bought her pearls?
Susan,Hi. You at home?
Susan,I'm going crazy 'cause I think I left my front door unlocked. Could you run and check? I'll stay on the line.
Susan,"Exactly. And so even though I was already halfway to the airport, I turned around and I came home, and, yep, I had left the garbage disposal on. So ever since then, I always check."
Susan,"Oh, you know what? I'm actually still worried about the side door. Do you think you could check that, too?"
Susan,Pearls or towel--you decide.
Susan,I have been naked on this street. It would be nice to take the heat off that story.
Susan,Mike said he can't afford to pay for M.J.'s private school. Now I know why. He wants to see his girlfriend wearing pearls when she flashes him.
Susan,"No. So I was going to take these and sell them to try to pay for it, and, yes, now that I'm saying it out loud, I hear how stupid that sounds."
Susan,"Well, he did."
Susan,"Damn right, ""oh"".What happened to ""I'm broke and can't afford to send M.J. To private school""?"
Susan,"But you can't go around blowing your kid's money on jewelry for your girlfriend. What did these cost you? $4,000, $5,000?"
Susan,What?
Susan,Well--at least you won't feel bad if you ever lose them.
Susan,"Okay, okay. Point made. Move along."
Susan,I didn't know they were fake.
Susan,"Okay, maybe I jumped to conclusions, but this school is important for M.J.. I feel really bad that we're falling short."
Susan,"No. But I read in your brochure that faculty members get a 50% discount, so for your art department, how would you like to hire an award-winning children's book illustrator who is great with kids and has a face you can't say no to?"
Susan,Can't say no.
Susan,"Yes. Right. No, wrong."
Susan,"Look, I know I said that M.J. was a star student, but the truth is, he's one of those kids that needs extra attention. The classes at his school are way too big, and I see him getting lost in the shuffle. And if he gets lost now--My ex-husband is doing everything that he can, and I need to know that I am, too. I will serve lunches. I will be a janitor. Anything. But I am not walking out on my son's future."
Susan,I'll take it.
Susan,Congratulations on getting me out of your office.
Susan,Congratulations on getting me out of your office.
Susan,"M.J., Why aren't you dressed? We're gonna be late for our first day of school."
Susan,He's sick. I'm late. Thanks for helping.
Susan,"So do I, and it's my first day at a new job. I win."
Susan,"You're a plumber. Ms. Nelson is not expecting you on time. In fact, if you show up before dinner, she'll turn cartwheels. I'm a teacher. It's different."
Susan,Well--listen to me. The whole reason I went back to work is so we could both afford to give M.J. the things we felt he needed. Now I'm doing my part. It's time you do yours.
Susan,"I gotta go. You get lots of rest and drink plenty of fluids, okay?"
Susan,"Oh, I know, honey. But mommy has a job now. Come on. We talked about this. You understand, right? Don't be sad. I am gonna pick you both up at 6:00."
Susan,"Okay, sure. Uh, where's M.J.?"
Susan,"Oh, hey, baby. How's my boy? I missed you so much. Are you feeling better?"
Susan,That's cute. Where's Mike?
Susan,"Well, uh, thank you very much for helping us out. Come on, M.J.. It's time to go."
Susan,"We already thanked her, buddy. Let's not make her uncomfortable."
Susan,Yeah. Come on in.
Susan,"Really? I thought we were using Katherine for all sorts of things--sending messages, raising our kid."
Susan,"Well, it's not better for me, especially when I'm not even told about it."
Susan,No.
Susan,"Hey, thanks. Let me remind you that the reason I agreed to custody is so our son could spend time with his father."
Susan,"No, she's a peach, but she's not the one that dragged me to court to hammer out some custody agreement. Now if you'd like, we can go back, and the judge can explain to you the difference between you and your girlfriend."
Susan,"No, sweetie. We are just trying to figure out what is best for you. Aren't we?"
Susan,"Yes, and imagine my surprise, 'cause the last time I talked to Mike, he promised me he was picking up M.J. from school."
Susan,I don't need the details. I had a long day. I just want to pick up my kid.
Susan,"No, thank you. Let's go."
Susan,But we can make Brownies at home.
Susan,Good save. Let's go.
Susan,"Well, I don't need you to do me any favors. What I need is for everyone to just stick the plan. Monday, Wednesday, Friday--Mike watches his son. He doesn't pawn him off on his girlfriend."
Susan,"Okay, lunch and movie. You are one lucky boy. I'm gonna take a quick shower. Try not to get any crumbs on the couch. What's wrong? It's peanut butter, no crusts��_��_��_ Your favorite."
Susan,I don't know how to make Paninis.
Susan,"No, we do not have any provolone."
Susan,"Absolutely not. In this house, we do not eat pretentious cheeses. We eat honest American peanut butter. Now watch your movie, and I'll be back in a minute."
Susan,"Hey, sweetie. How was your sandwich? M.J.?"
Susan,What is he doing here?
Susan,"M.J., go wait outside on the porch. I need to talk to Katherine. You can take the sandwich."
Susan,You think I don't feed my kid?
Susan,"Yeah, 'cause you make it like Disneyland over here, with your Paninis and your blackjack. You're trying to do everything you can to make him think that you're the other mommy."
Susan,You're trying to get your hooks deeper into Mike by showing him how much his son loves you.
Susan,"No, not evil. Devious. Well, you know, I hate to tell you, but your big plan is not gonna work, 'cause from now on, M.J. is either at my house or Mike's. He is no longer allowed to be here."
Susan,"Well, that's the way it's gonna be, whether you like it or not."
Susan,What?
Susan,What?
Susan,"Hey, guys. What are we talking about?"
Susan,"Oh, yeah. I'm so excited. You got my RSVP, right?"
Susan,Absolutely. Anything else you need?
Susan,Why would we do that?
Susan,"Well, yes, I was upset at first. But, you know, Mike was gonna be with someone eventually, and I consider myself lucky that it was someone, who, after all is said and done, has always been my true friend."
Susan,Hey.
Susan,"Washed, cleaned, ready to go."
Susan,"Hey, did you manage to keep that antler chandelier out of here?"
Susan,"That ""football guy"" is Peyton Manning. You would do well to learn that name. Oh. Wow."
Susan,Thank you.
Susan,I painted it. It was a gift for him.
Susan,"Yeah. It was a little beach we went to for our honeymoon. Uh, I mean, you know how much Mike loves the ocean."
Susan,"Anyway, um, can't wait for the party. It's gonna be fun."
Susan,Katherine and I told you guys we were taking the high road. Why won't you believe us?
Susan,"Okay, you know what? Let me show you something I think might change your mind. So Katherine has a picture that I painted for mike hanging over her mantelpiece."
Susan,"Yes, and we talked all about it. She loves it."
Susan,What? Where the hell is it?
Susan,It is possible.
Susan,"All right, you guys think what you want. I'm gonna choose to believe her."
Susan,"Uh, look at what I found-- my beach painting."
Susan,"Yeah, that's what she told me, too, only, uh, it didn't."
Susan,I don't know. She seemed to love the painting--until I told her that I painted it.
Susan,"Uh, nothing."
Susan,I didn't. I didn't.
Susan,"Hey, Katherine."
Susan,Hold on. I'm sorry. But neither of us exactly gets a gold star for model behavior.
Susan,"Why not? I mean, you loved that painting until you found out that I did it, and then you acted totally petty."
Susan,No.
Susan,"Uh, you do. I am here to take my painting back."
Susan,"Well, now I'm ungiving it. Try to keep up."
Susan,"It is, actually, because that is when I decided that I don't want this piece of art that I slaved over hanging in the house you are sharing with your new girlfriend. Capisce?"
Susan,"Yep. I'm complicated like that. Aren't you glad you divorced me? If you two want a painting so bad, paint your own."
Susan,Mayfair. Stay out of this. This is between me and my ex. Got it?
Susan,"No, we've already covered you."
Susan,"I'm missing my small candy dish. I had it last night when you guys were over for dinner, because I remember Orson admiring it."
Susan,"Well, we don't know that for sure. I could have misplaced it."
Susan,"Now as you listen to the music, see what pops into your head. What shapes does it make you see? What colors are you thinking of?"
Susan,"Well, I wanted to do something more free. It's an imagination-building exercise."
Susan,"Jessie, you said that I could plan the lesson today, and I think this is valuable. I'm just trying to be creative."
Susan,"An evaluation? Well, that is when someone judges your work and gives you a grade on it. But don't worry. I'm not doing that today."
Susan,Who?
Susan,"Oh, right. That's not till later this year."
Susan,The lady with the purple swear?
Susan,"All right, everyone. Grab some clay. We're making vases."
Susan,I'm so glad you could make it. I know I sprung this on you at the last minute.
Susan,"Oh, well, keep looking, 'cause I don't cook, and Shanghai Panda delivers."
Susan,"Oh, well, you know, I just think that school is such a formal environment, and I thought it would be nice if we could let loose and drink a little wine, get to know each other. Oh, my gosh."
Susan,Look at you. You're like that schoolmarm in the movies who lets down her hair and va-va-va-voom.
Susan,"Oh, please. I didn't even get a chance to change. My ex was late picking up M.J., which is insane, 'cause he lives right across the street."
Susan,He decided to shack up with my best friend. And people wonder why I'm through with men.
Susan,"Getting to know each other better. Oh, napkins."
Susan,No. I-I will not let you. You are too smart and funny and adorable.
Susan,"Well, I mean it. Anyone would be lucky to have you. You are a catch. Jeez. How did it get so late? Is there a school policy on showing up to work drunk?"
Susan,"Oh, me, too. You know, I think we should probably keep this between us. We don't want people talking at work."
Susan,It's a date.
Susan,A regular kiss on the mouth--that lasted a little longer than I thought it would.
Susan,"Okay, I'm probably just blowing this out of proportion. I mean, she never even said anything about being gay."
Susan,"Oh, that would be way too awkward. She's my boss."
Susan,I don't know.
Susan,I don't remember.
Susan,The second one?
Susan,"I don't have cumin, but I probably have cinnamon."
Susan,Thanks. I was thinking about the other night--
Susan,"You know, I-I think you may have gotten the wrong impression. I'm not--into women."
Susan,"I thought it was gonna rain. Okay, um--I'm not gay."
Susan,"Oh, well, that kiss was all you."
Susan,"Well, that's because--"
Susan,What?
Susan,"Actually, I'm more worried about the lesbian that's outside of me trying to get in. Um, can we just teach the class and talk about this later?"
Susan,"Okay, class, let's see how our animals of Africa drawings are going. Oh, Emma, this is beautiful. Emma drew a gazelle. Isn't she pretty? Zachary, is that a rhinoceros? He looks so big and strong. I love rhinos."
Susan,Excuse me?
Susan,"Though I would definitely appreciate the--beauty of the gazelle, uh, if I was going to take a trip to Africa--"
Susan,No. And--as on the softball team.
Susan,"That is not true, and I think we are dangerously close to no longer speaking in metaphor."
Susan,Because I wanted you to give me a good evaluation.
Susan,"Jessie, I-I am so sorry."
Susan,"Still, uh--I never meant to lead you on."
Susan,"Look, I need this job. But even if I didn't, I would still like you as a person."
Susan,"You know, I don't get why people say that. I-I love pity. Pity means someone is trying to understand what you're going through, that they sympathize, and I do."
Susan,"Well, here's how. Um, I--I've spent my whole life putting myself out there, and, um, I'm still--today, alone."
Susan,"Well, okay, it's not, because I'm alone but I'm not lonely 'cause I have friends. Love doesn't happen for everyone. You know what? I don't even know if it's gonna happen for me anymore. But my friends are there for me no matter what, and that helps. So at the very least, you know, let me be there for you--as a friend."
Susan,My boots.
Susan,"Hey, Karl."
Susan,Karl. What are you doing here?
Susan,"Wow, and I was worried that we'd be out of each other's lives forever. Mm, lucky, lucky."
Susan,I am an art teacher.
Susan,"And now I'm ignoring you and moving on to Evan. Hello, Evan."
Susan,"Evan, why don't you head into the classroom? I need to talk to your daddy, and I may need to use some grown-up words."
Susan,"Listen, it's bad enough that I've got one ex-husband running around the halls. I don't need the faculty and the parents knowing that I have two. So not a word about us having been married. No more wisecracks. No Susie Q's. I am Miss Susan, art teacher."
Susan,"Karl, I'm serious. Don't mess with me. I have a yardstick, and I'm not afraid to use it."
Susan,"What a lovely rainbow, June. Here's a gold star for you. Oh, Drew, wow! You know, elephants don't have wings, but I like the way you're thinking. Hey, Evan, what did you draw? That's a lot of red."
Susan,Okay. So--that man must be a doctor making the bloody man all better?
Susan,"Evan, that's-- kind of a scary picture."
Susan,"No, honey, it's inappropriate, especially when the assignment was to make a picture that makes you happy."
Susan,"It's a head, and he's stabbing someone with a sword."
Susan,It's not my fault. I showed this to the school psychologist. She gave it to the principal. My hands were tied.
Susan,I told the class to draw something that made them happy. All the other kids drew kittens and rainbows. Your son drew small intestines on the end of a stick.
Susan,That is not true!
Susan,"Okay, will someone call Guinness? Because you just set the world record for the biggest load of crap in one sentence."
Susan,"This is nothing, Mr. Hobson. We were just having a difference of opinion."
Susan,"Shut up, Karl."
Susan,Would this seem any less shocking if I told you we were once married for 12 years?
Susan,"Amy, that is very sweet. I love the colors you used. Oh, Danielle, that is just beautiful. Evan, that is very pretty. You did the assignment just like I asked. Good job!"
Susan,"Okay, just so you know, should be bringing this to the psychologist. But I didn't, because this kind of ""self-expression"" usually gets a kid expelled."
Susan,"Yeah, ""aw, hell."" You got a problem here, Karl. Your son's got some serious anger issues, and you need to figure out what's going on."
Susan,"Marisa? Well, why would he draw a picture of her like this?"
Susan,Karl--
Susan,So she just left?
Susan,Why?
Susan,Yeah.
Susan,"I used to hope that one day, you would know what this feel like, and now that you do--I'm so sorry."
Susan,"Don't worry, Edie. You're gonna get through this. you're gonna be just fine."
Susan,Here's a thought. why don't we talk about Edie?
Susan,"I don't know, but she is the reason we're on this trip. Uh, maybe we could share memories or tell stories."
Susan,"Okay, I was thinking of stories that put Edie in a positive light."
Susan,"The woman is dead, people. Let's honor her memory."
Susan,"Yeah. That's what everybody thinks. But the first time we met, it seemed like we'd end up being the best of friends."
Susan,"No, it's okay. It landed on the detergent box."
Susan,"Uh, you think I'm homeless. Oh, no, no, no. No, I live here. I-I can prove it. I know exactly what's in this garbage bag. Um, empty carton of eggs, coffee grinds, shampoo bottle--"
Susan,You're right. I'm homeless. Susan Mayer. Oh. It's all cleared up.
Susan,"Oh, yeah. I saw the moving van. Welcome."
Susan,"So is it just you, or do you have a family?"
Susan,How about coffee? I just put on a pot.
Susan,Funny and likes to gossip. We're gonna get along just fine.
Susan,Wait. Stop. Could we just rest for a second?
Susan,"Okay, I lied. I hate running."
Susan,"Because we were starting to become friends and you like to run, and I like to--sit and--one of us had to give."
Susan,"Oh, hi, Helen. Ed. I would have introduced you, but once Helen starts talking, she doesn't shut up."
Susan,"Oh, you met Ed?"
Susan,Yeah?
Susan,Doing what?
Susan,Ed is married.
Susan,"No, you're being immoral. You're committing adultery."
Susan,I can't forget something like this. Helen is my very good friend.
Susan,"She is annoying, and I hide when she knocks on my door, she does not deserve for you to be wrecking her marriage."
Susan,Home.
Susan,I don't think so.
Susan,"Well, it depends on what I'm running away from!"
Susan,A cup? Are you sure that'll be enough?
Susan,Really?
Susan,"Oh, I get it. So you feel I judged you, and for revenge, You're trying to make me insecure about my marriage."
Susan,"You know, Karl would never cheat, And the woman he was with-- Brandi, his secretary, and he took her out for her birthday."
Susan,"Okay, well, since you're on this moral roll, Why don't we walk over to Helen's? And I will introduce you. We can have some tea, and then you two could swap stories about Ed's favorite positions."
Susan,How?
Susan,Wow. You're just a giver.
Susan,You should leave now.
Susan,"Three weeks later, I found Brandi's bra in Karl's glove compartment, and, well, you know the rest."
Susan,I can't help thinking about all the times Edie and I sniped at each other. We could have been good friends.
Susan,"Lynette, don't look at Edie."
Susan,"Oh, not now. We have a flat."
Susan,We don't have time for this. Anybody know how to change a tire?
Susan,"Bree, how did you know where she lived?"
Susan,Good. We got some ground to make up. I was hoping we would be able to get there before dark.
Susan,You really think she spent a lot of time thinking about her death?
Susan,"What do you mean, you two were the hottest chic?"
Susan,"And your mom's new husband's never met you, so he thought it would be best if we told you."
Susan,"Look, Travers, we're all moms here. We've all made mistakes with our kids, and what we count on is when they grow up, they'll forgive us."
Susan,"God, she is so good at that."
Susan,We thought you might wanna scatter them somewhere.
Susan,"Oh, I think my leg's asleep."
Susan,We'd find a lot of traumatized cows.
Susan,Like what?
Susan,Just one word. This is hard.
Susan,I need four words.
Susan,"Okay. I want to do Edie justice, and for that to happen, I need four words, okay?"
Susan,One of a kind.
Susan,"Yeah, I left that casserole three days ago, and it's still there. I'm surprised the squirrels haven't gotten to it."
Susan,We need to be annoying and persistent. We're good at that.
Susan,"I'm in the classroom all day, and I have meetings after."
Susan,Hot shirtless gardeners with great abs and learner's permits?
Susan,"Remember to tell him ""annoying and persistent."" And I can make another casserole."
Susan,In the kitchen.
Susan,"I was cooking, all right?"
Susan,Sometimes it's the stove's fault.
Susan,How'd that go?
Susan,At you? Why?
Susan,That's weird.
Susan,I know what you meant. I'll stop by tomorrow and see him.
Susan,"You know, this whole thing with Edie--I mean, seeing her lying in the street that night--Oh, it just brought up all those awful memories from our accident."
Susan,Yeah. Look what it did to us.
Susan,"You, too."
Susan,"Hey. I'm on my way to work, but I just wanted to bring you these. Uh, chicken salad sandwiches, which I did not make. I bought. I learned my lesson from the casserole."
Susan,"Uh, wait. Could you maybe have one right now so that I know that you actually ate something?"
Susan,"Dave, I know that you're going through hell, But Edie was my friend, so please, let me help you. Just a little."
Susan,You sure you don't want one? It's really good.
Susan,So--have you thought about what you're gonna do now?
Susan,You're kidding. So soon?
Susan,"Okay, well--at least you're making plans for the future."
Susan,"Uh, well, I should probably--put these away before I finish them off. Are you sure there's nothing I can do to help you? A load of laundry?"
Susan,How about a pot of coffee? Or I could just--straighten up in here?
Susan,Oh. Uh--okay. Sure.
Susan,Do you know what is a great cure for the blues? Cribbage. Do you have a cribbage set?
Susan,"I'll call in sick, take the day off."
Susan,"Okay. You have a realtor coming, right? You cannot let him see the house in this condition. So just let me clean up a little. You won't even know I'm here."
Susan,"All right. I will be back after work to check on you. But until then, here's the phone, in case you wanna order Chinese or--call a hotline or something."
Susan,"Hey, Katherine, can you call me back as soon as you can? I just left Dave, and he's in bad shape. I actually think that he might be--Oh, crap. I gotta go."
Susan,"Yes, officer?"
Susan,"Oh, okay. Uh, what did I do?"
Susan,Right. I know that. I just was worried about a friend so I forgot. I'm sorry.
Susan,"Uh, what? You don't want the license?"
Susan,"Oh! You think that I'm dangerous. No, I totally have an explanation for those."
Susan,You're gonna feel really silly when you hear what it is.
Susan,Okay.
Susan,"Oh, yes, sir!"
Susan,It's just your belts and ties. The police kept the rest.
Susan,I'm sorry. It's just-- the things you said--I'm worried about you.
Susan,"You are not fine. How could you be? You have suffered a horrible loss. And you are allowed to feel any way you want. But I know that you are not fine. Okay, well, I'm sorry for ransacking your house. I'll stop bugging you."
Susan,"Oh, Dave--That does not make it your fault."
Susan,"You can't think that way. I mean, what happened is bad enough. Y-- you can't blame yourself for it, too. If you do that, you will destroy everything you have left that's good. Trust me. I know."
Susan,"A few years ago, Mike and I got in a car accident. A woman and her daughter--died."
Susan,"That's what we said--but it wasn't true. After the crash, I couldn't find my license. I had switched purses that night, and I had left it at home, and so--Mike--told them that he was driving. He took the blame for me. So--I understand guilt. And I want you to understand that Edie's death was an awful tragedy. It was not your fault."
Susan,Can't we just keep going the way we are?
Susan,"Karl, what are you doing here?"
Susan,Wow.
Susan,Mike and I got in a car accident.
Susan,"That's what we said, but it wasn't true. He took the blame for me."
Susan,"Oh, not necessarily. I hear they're getting divorced, and it's gonna get ugly."
Susan,"The wife hired the sleaziest, most unethical divorce lawyer in town."
Susan,My ex-husband.
Susan,"Yeah, and a total shark. The worst thing about our divorce was that I couldn't hire him to represent me."
Susan,"Oh, not with Karl. By the time he's done finding loopholes and hiding assets, there's nothing left to split."
Susan,"Are you kicking us out, Tom?"
Susan,What was that about?
Susan,Is it working?
Susan,"How's it feeling, Mrs. McCluskey?"
Susan,"Jackson, hey. You're back."
Susan,Why didn't you call?
Susan,"Well, you did."
Susan,"Oh, uh, right. Jackson, you remember Mrs. McCluskey, don't you?"
Susan,I'm taking her to the doctor so he can perform a little procedure.
Susan,"Okay. I just had my car detailed, so I should probably go."
Susan,Um--how about dinner tomorrow night?
Susan,I'll see you tomorrow.
Susan,"I've only been working there two months, but I love it. And the kids are so cute. And I get to see M.J. during the day, which is nice. Uh, you know, uh, for a guy that just had to see me so bad, you--you seem awfully far away."
Susan,What is it?
Susan,I have to go upstairs.
Susan,I'm fine. I just didn't want you to see me crying.
Susan,"Oh, I'm sorry. Just, um, all these months, I've been telling myself that I didn't really care about you, which was easy to do because you left so suddenly. But I am so lonely. And as much as I tell myself that I like being the strong, single woman on her own, the truth is, I think about you all the time. And I wanted to call you, but I thought you'd gotten over me. And to hear that you still love me--that is just something that I really needed to hear right now. And I want you to know--Oh, god. I want you to know I love you, too. Jackson--I love you. Jackson?"
Susan,Finish what?
Susan,I heard.
Susan,Get out or I will kick your ass back to the Canadian border!
Susan,Go away! I-I don't want to talk to you.
Susan,"Thanks, but I've reached my maximum allowance for humiliation this week."
Susan,Maximum allowance exceeded.
Susan,What do you want?
Susan,"Oh, I'm not mad at you. You know, I'm just disappointed in myself. I was a little lonely and a little afraid and--I just did what I always do--let some silly romantic fantasy take over."
Susan,"I don't. This isn't about you. Not really. And besides, you moved on."
Susan,"This--I mean, this is really the only thing you can do to stay here and do your work?"
Susan,I'll help you.
Susan,"Yeah. I'll do it. But that's it. No love, no sex, just--marriage."
Susan,"You want people to think this is a real marriage, don't you?"
Susan,"Oh, my god. We're not gonna be able to make it this weekend. I'm kind of--getting married."
Susan,We're not gonna be able to make it this weekend. I'm kind of getting married.
Susan,"Oh, just leave the toilet seat up, and the immigration people will totally think we're married."
Susan,"Actually, I did think of one way you could repay me."
Susan,"Uh, no. Not like that. No, I was thinking that after our quickie courthouse ceremony, you could buy me a cake. I love wedding cake. It's the one part of marriage that never lets you down."
Susan,What?
Susan,"Okay. Yeah, I guess that could be fun. While our friends are toasting to our everlasting happiness, we can yell, ""surprise! It's all a sham! Thanks for the crock-pot!"""
Susan,Can't I at least tell the girls?
Susan,"Ah, fake marriages--they're complicated."
Susan,"No, no. It's okay. I wanna do this. Truth is--I miss you, and the house has been kinda lonely since you left."
Susan,Not that lonely.
Susan,We're getting married.
Susan,Monday.
Susan,Yeah. He was on board when he found out there was cake.
Susan,"Well, uh, we wanted you two to be the first to know, and we should probably get going. Got a few more neighbors to shock."
Susan,"Aw, how sweet. And heavy. Score."
Susan,Yeah. What?
Susan,Right! Score for you!
Susan,"Uh, can I talk to you for a sec?"
Susan,"I was too proud to admit it. I'm not too proud to take it. I need that money, Jackson."
Susan,"""Chip in""? It's is not a birthday cake for Shirley in accounting. It's mortgage and food and insurance. I'm sorry, but I can't marry you."
Susan,"It's Canada, not Iran. It's like America with free health insurance. Okay, I know this is important to you, but I depend on that check every month."
Susan,"Well, look, maybe--I could talk to Mike. I could see if we could work something out."
Susan,"Yeah, I'll try. Don't think he's not gonna want his gift back. And it's really heavy, too."
Susan,"Hey, Katherine, is Mike here?"
Susan,"Oh, shoot. Well, can you tell him to call me as soon as he gets back?"
Susan,"Uh, well--okay, you know what? Mike's probably gonna tell you anyway, so just don't tell anyone else, okay?"
Susan,It depends. Jackson and I are only getting married because he needs his green card.
Susan,"And then I realized that I would lose my alimony. So unless Mike will keep paying me, I can't get married."
Susan,Canada.
Susan,That would be great. Just tell him I need an answer quickly 'cause the wedding is Monday.
Susan,Thanks.
Susan,Good news. Looks like we're getting fake married after all.
Susan,Yeah. Mike agreed to keep paying me alimony. He just sent me a text.
Susan,And unbelievably generous. I'm gonna send him a thank-you right now.
Susan,"Clearly, you've never been married before."
Susan,"Well, I've been in some real marriages that weren't, so--maybe you're right."
Susan,Sweet! Let's get to the car wash on our way to the courthouse.
Susan,"Oh, no, no, no. You--you can't take him now."
Susan,"Please, can't this wait? We're about to get married."
Susan,We're getting married.
Susan,Can't this wait? We're about to get marry.
Susan,After the crash--
Susan,"--Mike told 'em that he was driving, but it wasn't true."
Susan,"Hey, Dave. I was gonna call you."
Susan,"Yeah, um. Did you say something to M.J. about going on that fishing trip?"
Susan,"I wish I could, but I can't. I'm worried about Jackson."
Susan,"Dave, I haven't heard Jackson since he was taken away and I just wanna be here in case he calls."
Susan,I'd just feel more comfortable if I'm close by.
Susan,I'm sorry. We'll go fishing another time.
Susan,What are you doing? I just told you I can't go.
Susan,He'll be fine.
Susan,Hello?
Susan,"Jackson, I have been so worried. Where--where are you?"
Susan,So they're sending you back? When?
Susan,"Well--I'll miss you, too. I mean, you came in my life when I was going through a really hard time, and you were amazing. I mean, you are amazing."
Susan,So--did the immigration people tell you how they found out about you?
Susan,Mike? You think Mike did this?
Susan,"Yeah, but, no, this doesn't make any sense because Mike knew that it wasn't for real."
Susan,"What's he gonna do with that, watch Bruce Lee movies without the subtitles?"
Susan,Why is that? When did being practical and realistic become synonymous with bitchiness?
Susan,"I think that Bree is right--That the more Tom sees you digging in your heels, the more he's gonna wanna do it."
Susan,"Oh, you guys, I'm sorry. I gotta run."
Susan,Hey. I need to talk to Mike.
Susan,"Oh, no need, I will wait."
Susan,"No, I need to talk to Mike. Now you could flush the toilet and try to get him out there."
Susan,Did mike turn Jackson in to immigration?
Susan,I don't know. Jealousy? Jackson thinks mike is still hung up on me.
Susan,Mm. Shower's off. I guess we'll know in a few seconds.
Susan,"Well, somebody did, because he sent me a text agreeing to keep paying me alimony."
Susan,Are you insane? Why would you do something--
Susan,What?
Susan,"Okay, Katherine, that is--it's totally unfair to Mike. I mean, he needs to know the truth."
Susan,"Um, yeah. I--Katherine already told me about your big news."
Susan,"Yes, sure. Why not?"
Susan,"Well, don't be mad at Katherine. We all know that she just can't-- keep a secret."
Susan,"Ooh. Hey. Um, can I talk to you a sec?"
Susan,"Um, no, thanks. So, look, uh.. I'm sorry if I was a little under-enthusiastic the other day about you and Katherine getting married."
Susan,"Yeah. That and, uh--I don't know. It d-did kind of come out of nowhere."
Susan,"I know. But still--I mean, it happened so fast. I just--I wanna make sure that you know what you're doing."
Susan,I know. And feel free to throw me out of your house if I'm out of line--But do you love her?
Susan,Just answer the question.
Susan,"Good. That's all I needed to hear. Well, I hope that you will be very happy together."
Susan,"Yeah, well, I don't know if that's gonna happen."
Susan,"Oh, the truth is, um--well, it's complicated."
Susan,Well--I realized that I never properly congratulated you on getting married.
Susan,Really.
Susan,Wow. You're getting married this weekend?
Susan,"It's sweet, but--yeah, it's ridiculous. And besides, um, M.J. and I have big plans this weekend."
Susan,"Hey, Dave. Glad I caught you. Is your friend's boat still available this weekend?"
Susan,"I was thinking about what you said, and you were right. It really would do me good to get out of here for a few days"
Susan,"Well, if you do, we're gonna clean it and serve it up for dinner."
Susan,"Okay. Bye, Mike. Have a nice wedding."
Susan,"Oh, sweetie. You just had one, and we don't want to have to stop ten times so you can go to the bathroom."
Susan,"Oh, the joys of being a parent."
Susan,You do?
Susan,"Oh, my god. I--I-I had no idea. I'm so sorry."
Susan,"Oh, it's your daddy. Hey, Mike."
Susan,"Uh, yeah. We are in the car, singing."
Susan,This sounds really---
Susan,Okay.
Susan,"Oh, my god."
Susan,That sucks. How could they cancel your flight?
Susan,Right. So how long do you think you'll be delayed?
Susan,"Well, I hope you get there soon."
Susan,"Gosh, it feels like we've been driving forever. Maybe we should stretch our legs."
Susan,"Aren't you hungry, though? Maybe there's a restaurant up ahead."
Susan,Okay. It's no big deal.
Susan,"Okay, sweetie. Do you mind pulling over at the next rest stop?"
Susan,Just hold on a few more minutes.
Susan,"Um, can't we find a gas station or maybe a diner?"
Susan,"Okay. Here, M.J."
Susan,Keys. Keys--
Susan,"M.J., run!"
Susan,"Come on, honey! Let's run! Let's run!"
Susan,"We're playing a game with Dave, okay? So run as fast as you can."
Susan,I'm fine.
Susan,"Okay, listen. It's really important that you win this game. So I want you to find a good hiding place, and even if you hear Dave, you don't come out no matter what, okay? Okay? Don't worry. I'm gonna hide, too. Now go. Go!"
Susan,M.J.! Don't come out!
Susan,Now keep the volume really high. You don't wanna hear all the boring grown-up talk.
Susan,What are you gonna do to us?
Susan,"Dave, please--I'm so sorry about that accident. You don't wanna hurt M.J. or me. You're a good person. I know you."
Susan,"Well, you won't get away with it. Mike already called the cops. They're on their way."
Susan,Mike!
Susan,Canterbury Road? That's where we--
Susan,What are you gonna do to us? Why did you bring us here?
Susan,"Mike should be here any minute. Dave, please. Don't hurt Mike. It wasn't his fault."
Susan,I'm not leaving M.J.
Susan,Try not to scare M.J. when you bring him here.
Susan,What?
Susan,"Oh, my god."
Susan,"Dave, please. Please. I cannot imagine the pain you went through, but you can't do this. You can't kill my little boy!"
Susan,What if your daughter could see you now? Is this how you'd want her to see you? As a monster who could murder an innocent child?
Susan,Dave! Dave!
Susan,Mike! Mike! Mike! Stop! No! M.J.! M.J.!
Susan,"Oh, god! Are you okay?"
Susan,Mike. Mike!
Susan,Shhhh.Keep playing.
Susan ,"Okay. Just stop talking. John, how old are you?"
Susan ,What do you think?
Susan ,Issues? What kind of issues do you think I have?
Susan ,New York!
Susan ,I love him. You can write that in your little book.
Susan ,What?
Susan ,"Oh, you did it again!"
Susan ,"Listen, I know being dramatic is the birthright of every teenager, but come on--"
Susan ,"Thank you, Zach. You have just made this really easy for me. You are now forbidden from seeing or talking my daughter ever again! And if you come within ten feet of her, I will call the police, and I will have you arrested! Now get out!"
Susan ,"Hey, Mike, it's me. Are you there? Pick up. Hello? Okay, I know you're home. Your lights are on. Look, I really need to talk to you about something, uh, you know what? I'm just gonna stop by."
Susan ,Is that blood?
Susan ,What are you smiling about?
Susan ,"If he's not gone in five minutes, then I'm going to go out there and tell him how old you really are."
Susan ,What have you done?
Susan ,"For god's sake, Tim, she's ticklish! How many times do you have to be told?"
Susan ,"I'm having trouble with the family across the street. I think one of them may have set a fire in my house, and I don't know why, but I feel like it might have something to do with my friend who killed herself. I called the police, but they didn't take me seriously. This family has a secret, a bad secret. I think I'm in over my head. I need you to find out everything you can about Paul Young and his family. Do you think you can help me?"
Susan ,"Well, I went over Mike's to feed the dog."
Susan ,Edie!
Susan ,"Mike, I didn't do it to hurt you. You've gotta believe me. I--"
Susan ,What the hell was that?
Susan ,"Hi. Hi, yeah, I'm here."
Susan ,Just a second?
Susan ,"Karl,just stop."
Susan ,"Come on,come on,come on."
Susan ,That's my daughter.Get dressed!
Susan ,"Well, all of the food is very expensive."
Susan ,"Shh. Not in front of Mike! Oh, look, Mike. Ian brought you flowers. I'll just go put them in some water."
Susan ,"Actually Tom could you just hang on a second. Uh, I also would like to say a few words. To Bree and Orson, ah yes, what could be better than a second love, and this time you enter it a little older, a little wiser, but also, and this is key, uh, with a bit of caution. Because, while love can be spontaneous and wonderful, it can also be selfish and sometimes the best thing you can do is just to walk away. Uh, not you two. You two crazy kids are great. Congrats, yeah."
