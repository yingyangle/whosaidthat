Speaker,Line
Sheldon,"So if a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either slit is observed it will not go through both slits. If itês unobserved it will, however, if itês observed after itês left the plane but before it hits its target, it will not have gone through both slits."
Leonard,"Agreed, whatês your point?"
Sheldon,"Thereês no point, I just think itês a good idea for a tee-shirt. "
Leonard,Excuse me?
Leonard,"One across is Aegean, eight down is Nabakov, twenty-six across is MCM, fourteen down isÑ move your fingerÑ phylum, which makes fourteen across Port-au-Prince. See, Papa Docês capital idea, thatês Port-au-Prince. Haiti. "
Leonard,"Yes. Um, is this the High IQ sperm bank?"
Sheldon,I think this is the place.
Leonard,Thank-you. Weêll be right back.
Sheldon,"Leonard, I donêt think I can do this."
Leonard,are you kidding? Youêre a semi-pro. 
Sheldon,"We are committing genetic fraud. Thereês no guarantee that our sperm is going to generate high IQ offspring, think about that. I have a sister with the same basic DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers."
Leonard,"Sheldon, this was your idea. A little extra money to get fractional T1 bandwidth in the apartment."
Sheldon,"I know, and I do yearn for faster downloads, but thereês some poor woman is going to pin her hopes on my sperm, what if she winds up with a toddler who doesnêt know if he should use an integral or a differential to solve the area under a curve."
Leonard,Iêm sure sheêll still love him.
Sheldon,I wouldnêt.
Leonard,"Well, what do you want to do?"
Sheldon,I want to leave.
Sheldon,Whatês the protocol for leaving?
Leonard,"I donêt know, Iêve never reneged on a proffer of sperm before."
Sheldon,Letês try just walking out.
Leonard,See you.
Sheldon,Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
Sheldon,You want to hear an interesting thing about stairs?
Leonard,Not really.
Sheldon,"If the height of a single step is off by as little as two millimetres, most people will trip."
Leonard,I donêt care. Two millimetres? That doesnêt seem right.
Sheldon,"No, itês true, I did a series of experiments when I was twelve, my father broke his clavicle."
Leonard,Is that why they sent you to boarding school?
Sheldon,"No, that was the result of my work with lasers."
Leonard,New neighbour?
Leonard,Significant improvement over the old neighbour.
Sheldon,"Two hundred pound transvestite with a skin condition, yes she is."
Penny,"Oh, hi!"
Leonard,"We donêt mean to interrupt, we live across the hall."
Penny,"Oh, thatês nice."
Leonard,"OhÑ uhÑ noÑ we donêt live togetherÑ umÑ we live together but in separate, heterosexual bedrooms."
Penny,"Oh, okay, well, guess Iêm your new neighbour, Penny."
Leonard,"Leonard, Sheldon."
Leonard,"Hi. Well, uh, oh, welcome to the building."
Penny,"Thankyou, maybe we can have coffee sometime."
Leonard,"Oh, great."
Leonard,"Great. Well, bye."
Leonard,Should we have invited her for lunch?
Sheldon,Weêre going to start Season Two of Battlestar Galactica.
Leonard,We already watched the Season Two DVDs.
Sheldon,Not with commentary.
Leonard,"I think we should be good neighbours, invite her over, make her feel welcome."
Sheldon,We never invited Louis-slash-Louise over.
Leonard,"Well, then that was wrong of us. We need to widen our circle."
Sheldon,I have a very wide circle. I have 212 friends on myspace. 
Leonard,"Yes, and youêve never met one of them."
Sheldon,Thatês the beauty of it.
Leonard,Iêm going to invite her over. Weêll have a nice meal and chat.
Sheldon,Chat? We donêt chat. At least not offline.
Leonard,"Well itês not difficult, you just listen to what she says and then you say something appropriate in response."
Sheldon,To what end?
Leonard,Hi. Again.
Leonard,"Anyway, um. We brought home Indian food. And, um. I know that moving can be stressful, and I find that when Iêm undergoing stress, that good food and company can have a comforting effect. Also, curry is a natural laxative, and I donêt have to tell you that, uh, a clean colon is just one less thing to worry about."
Sheldon,"Leonard, Iêm not expert here but I believe in the context of a luncheon invitation, you might want to skip the reference to bowel movements."
Penny,"Oh, youêre inviting me over to eat?"
Leonard,"Uh, yes."
Penny,"Oh, thatês so nice, Iêd love to."
Penny,"So, what do you guys do for fun around here?"
Sheldon,"Well, today we tried masturbating for money."
Leonard,"Okay, well, make yourself at home."
Penny,"Okay, thankyou."
Leonard,Youêre very welcome.
Penny,"This looks like some serious stuff, Leonard, did you do this?"
Sheldon,Actually thatês my work.
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, itês just some quantum mechanics, with a little string theory doodling around the edges. That part there, thatês just a joke, itês a spoof of the Bourne-Oppenheimer approximation."
Penny,"So youêre like, one of those, beautiful mind genius guys."
Penny,This is really impressive.
Leonard,"I have a board. If you like boards, this is my board."
Penny,Holy smokes.
Sheldon,"If by holy smokes you mean a derivative restatement of the kind of stuff you can find scribbled on the wall of any menês room at MIT, sure."
Sheldon,"Oh, come on. Who hasnêt seen this differential below _here I sit broken hearted?î"
Leonard,At least I didnêt have to invent twenty-six dimensions just to make the math come out.
Sheldon,"I didnêt invent them, theyêre there."
Leonard,In what universe?
Sheldon,"In all of them, that is the point."
Penny,"Uh, do you guys mind if I start?"
Sheldon,"Um, Penny, thatês where I sit."
Penny,"So, sit next to me. "
Sheldon,"No, I sit there."
Penny,Whatês the difference?
Sheldon,Whatês the difference?
Leonard,Here we go.
Sheldon,"In the winter that seat is close enough to the radiator to remain warm, and yet not so close as to cause perspiration. In the summer itês directly in the path of a cross breeze created by open windows there, and there. It faces the television at an angle that is neither direct, thus discouraging conversation, nor so far wide to create a parallax distortion, I could go on, but I think Iêve made my point. "
Penny,Do you want me to move?
Leonard,Just sit somewhere else.
Sheldon,Fine. 
Leonard,"Sheldon, sit!"
Leonard,Well this is nice. We donêt have a lot of company over.
Sheldon,Thatês not true. Koothrapali and Wolowitz come over all the time. 
Leonard,"Yes I now, butÑ"
Sheldon,Tuesday night we played Klingon boggle until one in the morning.
Leonard,"Yes, I remember."
Sheldon,I resent you saying we donêt have company.
Leonard,Iêm sorry.
Sheldon,That is an antisocial implication.
Leonard,I said Iêm sorry.
Penny,"So, Klingon boggle?"
Leonard,"Yeah, itês like regular boggle but, in Klingon. Thatês probably enough about us, tell us about you."
Penny,"Um, me, okay, Iêm Sagittarius, which probably tells you way more than you need to know."
Sheldon,"Yes, it tells us that you participate in the mass cultural delusion that the Sunês apparent position relative to arbitrarily defined constellations and the time of your birth somehow effects your personality."
Penny,Participate in the what?
Leonard,"I think what Sheldonês trying to say, is that Sagittarius wouldnêt have been our first guess."
Penny,"Oh, yeah, a lot of people think Iêm a water sign. Okay, letês see, what else, oh, Iêm a vegetarian, oh, except for fish, and the occasional steak, I love steak. "
Sheldon,Thatês interesting. Leonard canêt process corn.
Leonard,"Wu-uh, do you have some sort of a job?"
Penny,"Oh, yeah, Iêm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory."
Leonard,"Oh, okay. I love cheesecake."
Sheldon,Youêre lactose intolerant. 
Leonard,"I donêt eat it, I just think itês a good idea."
Penny,"Oh, anyways, Iêm also writing a screenplay. Itês about this sensitive girl who comes to L.A. from Lincoln Nebraska to be an actress, and winds up a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory."
Leonard,So itês based on your life?
Penny,"No, Iêm from Omaha. "
Leonard,"Well, if that was a movie I would go see it."
Penny,"I know, right? Okay, letês see, what else? Um, thatês about it. Thatês the story of Penny."
Leonard,Well it sounds wonderful.
Penny,It was. Until I fell in love with a jerk. 
Sheldon,Whatês happening.
Leonard,I donêt know.
Penny,"Oh God, you know, four years I lived with him, four years, thatês like as long as High School. "
Sheldon,It took you four years to get through High School?
Penny,"I just, I canêt believe I trusted him."
Leonard,Should I say something? I feel like I should say something.
Sheldon,"You? No, youêll only make it worse."
Penny,"You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?"
Sheldon,Yes. 
Leonard,"No, itês not crazy itês, uh, uh, itês a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too. Well, I didnêt make it worse."
Penny,"Oh, Iêm so sorry, Iêm such a mess, and on top of everything else Iêm all gross from moving and my stupid shower doesnêt even work."
Leonard,Our shower works.
Penny,Really? Would it be totally weird if I used it?
Sheldon,Yes. 
Leonard,Itês right down the hall.
Penny,Thanks. You guys are really sweet.
Sheldon,Well this is an interesting development. 
Leonard,How so?
Sheldon,It has been some time since weêve had a woman take her clothes off in our apartment.
Leonard,"Thatês not true, remember at Thanksgiving my grandmother with Alzheimerês had that episode."
Sheldon,Point taken. It has been some time since weêve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didnêt want to rip our eyes out. 
Leonard,The worst part was watching her carve that turkey.
Sheldon,"So, what exactly are you trying to accomplish here?"
Leonard,Excuse me?
Sheldon,That woman in thereês not going to have sex with you.
Leonard,Well Iêm not trying to have sex with her.
Sheldon,"Oh, good. Then you wonêt be disappointed."
Leonard,"What makes you think she wouldnêt have sex with me, Iêm a male and sheês a female?"
Sheldon,"Yes, but not of the same species."
Leonard,"Iêm not going to engage in hypotheticals here, Iêm just trying to be a good neighbour."
Sheldon,"Oh, of course."
Leonard,Thatês not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that I wouldnêt participate. However briefly.
Sheldon,Do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered when she discovers your Luke Skywalker no-more-tears shampoo?
Leonard,Itês Darth Vader shampoo.  Luke Skywalkerês the conditioner.
Howard,Wait till you see this.
Raj,Itês fantastic. Unbelievable.
Leonard,See what?
Howard,Itês a Stephen Hawking lecture from MIT in 1974.
Leonard,This is not a good time.
Howard,Itês before he became a creepy computer voice:.
Leonard,"Thatês great, you guys have to go."
Leonard,Itês just not a good time.
Sheldon,Leonard has a lady over.
Howard,"Yeah, right, your grandmother back in town?"
Leonard,"And sheês not a lady, sheês just a new neighbour."
Howard,"Hang on, there really is a lady here?"
Howard,And you want us out because youêre anticipating coitus?
Leonard,Iêm not anticipating coitus.
Howard,So sheês available for coitus?
Leonard,Can we please stop saying coitus?
Sheldon,Technically that would be coitus interruptus.
Penny,"Hey, is there a trick to getting it to switch from tub to shower. Oh. Hi, sorry. Hello!"
Howard,"Enchante Madamoiselle. Howard Wolowitz, Cal-Tech department of Applied Physics. You may be familiar with some of my work, itês currently orbiting Jupiterês largest moon taking high-resolution digital photographs."
Penny,Penny. I work at the Cheesecake Factory.
Leonard,"Come on, Iêll show you the trick with the shower."
Howard,Bon douche.
Penny,Iêm sorry?
Howard,Itês French for good shower. Itês a sentiment I can express in six languages.
Leonard,"Save it for your blog, Howard."
Leonard,"Uh, there it goes, it sticks, Iêm sorry."
Penny,Okay. Thanks. 
Leonard,"Youêre welcome, oh, youêre going to step right, okay, IêllÑ."
Penny,"Hey, Leonard?"
Leonard,The hair products are Sheldonês.
Penny,"Um, okay. Can I ask you a favour."
Leonard,"A favour? Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you."
Penny,Itês okay if you say no.
Leonard,"Oh, Iêll probably say yes."
Penny,Itês just not the kind of thing you ask a guy youêve just met.
Sheldon,I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.
Leonard,Must we?
Sheldon,"Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned womanês ex-boyfriend. Query, on what plane of existence is there even a semi-rational link between these events?"
Leonard,"She asked me to do her a favour, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Ah, yes, well that may be the proximal cause of our journey, but we both know it only exists in contradistinction to the higher level distal cause."
Leonard,Which is?
Sheldon,You think with your penis.
Leonard,Thatês a biological impossibility and you didnêt have to come.
Sheldon,"Oh, right, yes, I could have stayed behind and watched Wolowitz try to hit on Penny in Russian, Arabic and Farsi. Why canêt she get her own TV."
Leonard,"Come on, you know how it is with break-ups."
Sheldon,No I donêt. And neither do you.
Leonard,"Wuh, I, I broke up with Joyce Kim."
Sheldon,"You did not break up with Joyce Kim, she defected to North Korea."
Leonard,To mend her broken heart. This situation is much less complicated. Thereês some kind of dispute between Penny and her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the TV. She just wanted to avoid having a scene with him.
Sheldon,So we get to have a scene with him?
Leonard,"No, Sheldon, thereês not going to be a scene. Thereês two of us and one of him."
Sheldon,"Leonard, the two of us canêt even carry a TV. "
Penny,"So, you guys work with Leonard and Sheldon at the University?"
Penny,"Uh, Iêm sorry, do you speak English?"
Howard,"Oh, he speaks English, he just canêt speak to women."
Penny,"Really, why?"
Howard,Heês kind of a nerd. Juice box?
Leonard,Iêll do the talking.
Leonard,"Hi, Iêm Leonard, this is Sheldon."
Leonard,"What did I justÑ. Uh, weêre here to pick up Pennyês TV."
Sheldon,"Okay, thanks for your time."
Leonard,Weêre not going to give up just like that.
Sheldon,"Leonard, the TV is in the building, weêve been denied access to the building, ergo we are done."
Leonard,"Excuse me, if I were to give up at the first little hitch I never would have been able to identify the fingerprints of string theory in the aftermath of the big bang."
Sheldon,My apologies. Whatês your plan.
Sheldon,Itês just a privilege to watch your mind at work.
Leonard,"Come on, we have a combined IQ of 360, we should be able to figure out how to get into a stupid building."
Sheldon,What do you think their combined IQ is?
Leonard,Just grab the door.
Leonard,This is it.  Iêll do the talking.
Sheldon,"Good thinking, Iêll just be the muscle."
Leonard,"Iêm Leonard, this is Sheldon."
Sheldon,From the intercom.
Leonard,Oh. Weêre scientists.
Sheldon,Tell him about our IQ.
Sheldon,My mom bought me those pants.
Leonard,Iêm sorry.
Sheldon,Youêre going to have to call her.
Leonard,"Sheldon, Iêm so sorry I dragged you through this."
Sheldon,"Itês okay. It wasnêt my first pantsing, and it wonêt be my last."
Leonard,"And you were right about my motives, I was hoping to establish a relationship with Penny that might have some day led to sex."
Sheldon,Well you got me out of my pants.
Leonard,"Anyway, Iêve learned my lesson. Sheês out of my league, Iêm done with her, Iêve got my work, one day Iêll win the Nobel Prize and then Iêll die alone."
Sheldon,"Donêt think like that, youêre not going to die alone."
Leonard,"Thank you Sheldon, youêre a good friend."
Sheldon,And youêre certainly not going to win a Nobel Prize.
Howard,"This is one of my favourite places to kick back after a quest, they have a great house ale."
Penny,"Wow, cool tiger."
Howard,"Yeah, Iêve had him since level ten. His name is Buttons. Anyway, if you had your own game character we could hang out, maybe go on a quest."
Penny,"Uh, sounds interesting."
Howard,So youêll think about it?
Penny,"Oh, I donêt think Iêll be able to stop thinking about it."
Leonard,Weêre home.
Penny,"Oh, my God, what happened?"
Leonard,"Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory."
Penny,"Iêm so sorry, I really thought if you guys went instead of me he wouldnêt be such an ass."
Leonard,"No, it was a valid hypothesis."
Sheldon,That was a valid hypothesis? What is happening to you?
Penny,"Really, thank you so much for going and trying youêre, uh, youêre so terrific. Why donêt you put some clothes on, Iêll get my purse and dinner is on me, okay?"
Leonard,Really? Great.
Sheldon,"Thank you. Youêre not done with her, are you?"
Leonard,Our babies will be smart and beautiful.
Sheldon,Not to mention imaginary.
Leonard,Is Thai food okay with you Penny?
Sheldon,"We canêt have Thai food, we had Indian for lunch."
Sheldon,Theyêre both curry based cuisines.
Sheldon,They would be gastronomically redundant. I can see weêre going to have to spell out everything for this girl.
Penny,Any ideas Raj? 
Howard,Turn left on Lake Street and head up to Colorado. I know a wonderful little sushi bar that has karaoke.
Penny,That sounds like fun.
Howard,"Baby, baby donêt get hooked on me. Uh, baby, baby donêt get hooked on me."
Sheldon,"I donêt know what your odds are in the world as a whole, but as far as the population of this car goes, youêre a veritable Mack Daddy."
Leonard,"There you go, Pad Thai, no peanuts."
Howard,But does it have peanut oil?
Leonard,"Uh, Iêm not sure, everyone keep an eye on Howard in case he starts to swell up."
Sheldon,"Since itês not bee season, you can have my epinephrine."
Raj,Are there any chopsticks?
Sheldon,"You donêt need chopsticks, this is Thai food."
Leonard,Here we go.
Sheldon,"Thailand has had the fork since the latter half of the nineteenth century. Interestingly they donêt actually put the fork in their mouth, they use it to put the food on a spoon which then goes into their mouth."
Leonard,"Ask him for a napkin, I dare you.  Iêll get it."
Howard,Do I look puffy? I feel puffy.
Penny,Hey Leonard.
Leonard,"Oh, hi Penny."
Penny,Am I interrupting.
Sheldon,"Youêre not swelling, Howard."
Howard,"No, no, look at my fingers, theyêre like Vienna sausages."
Penny,Sounds like you have company.
Leonard,"Theyêre not going anywhere.  So, youêre coming home from work. Thatês great. How was work."
Penny,"Well, you know, itês the Cheesecake Factory. People order cheesecake, and I bring it to them."
Leonard,"So, you sort of act as a carbohydrate delivery system."
Penny,"Yeah, call it whatever you want, I get minimum wage. Yeah, anyways, I was wondering if you could help me out with something, I wasÑ."
Penny,"Oh. Okay, great, Iêm having some furniture delivered tomorrow, and I may not be here, soÑ.  Oh! HelÑhello!"
Penny,Iêm sorry?
Howard,Havenêt you ever been told how beautiful you are in flawless Russian?
Penny,"No, I havenêt."
Howard,Get used to it.
Penny,"Yeah, I probably wonêt, butÑ Hey Sheldon."
Penny,"Hey Raj!  Still not talking to me, huh?"
Sheldon,"Donêt take it personally, itês his pathology, he canêt talk to women."
Howard,"He canêt talk to attractive women, or in your case a cheesecake_scented Goddess!"
Leonard,"So, thereês gonna be some furniture delivered?"
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, if it gets here and Iêm not here tomorrow could you just sign for it and have them put it in my apartment."
Leonard,"Yeah, no problem."
Penny,"Great, hereês my spare key. Thank you."
Leonard,"Penny, wait."
Leonard,"Um, if you donêt have any other plans, do you want to join us for Thai food and a Superman movie marathon?"
Penny,"A marathon? Wow, how many Superman movies are there?"
Sheldon,"Youêre kidding, right?"
Penny,"Yeah, I do like the one where Lois Lane falls from the helicopter and Superman swooshes down and catches her, which one was that? "
Sheldon,You realise that scene was rife with scientific inaccuracy.
Penny,"Yes, I know, men canêt fly."
Sheldon,"Oh no, letês assume that they can. Lois Lane is falling, accelerating at an initial rate of 32 feet per second per second. Superman swoops down to save her by reaching out two arms of steel. Miss Lane, who is now travelling at approximately 120 miles per hour, hits them, and is immediately sliced into three equal pieces. "
Leonard,"Unless, Superman matches her speed and decelerates. "
Sheldon,"In what space, sir, in what space? Sheês two feet above the ground. Frankly, if he really loved her, heêd let her hit the pavement. It would be a more merciful death."
Leonard,"Excuse me, your entire argument is predicated on the assumption that Supermanês flight is a feat of strength."
Sheldon,"Are you listening to yourself, it is well established that Supermanês flight is a feat of strength, it is an extension of his ability to leap tall buildings, an ability he derives from Earthês yellow Sun."
Howard,"Yeah, and you donêt have a problem with that, how does he fly at night."
Sheldon,"Uh, a combination of the moonês solar reflection and the energy storage capacity of Kryptonian skin cells."
Penny,Iêm just going to go wash up.
Leonard,"I have 26 hundred comic books in there, I challenge you to find a single reference to Kryptonian skin cells."
Sheldon,Challenge accepted.  Weêre locked out.
Raj,"Also, the pretty girl left."
Leonard,"Okay, her apartmentês on the fourth floor but the elevatorês broken so youêre going to have to  oh, youêre just going to be done, okay, cool, thanks. I guess weêll just bring it up ourselves."
Sheldon,I hardly think so. 
Leonard,Why not?
Sheldon,"Well, we donêt have a dolly, or lifting belts, or any measurable upper body strength."
Leonard,"We donêt need strength, weêre physicists. We are the intellectual descendents of Archimedes. Give me a fulcrum and a lever and I can move the Earth, itês just a matterÑ  I donêt have thisÑ I donêt have this I donêt have this."
Sheldon,Archimedes would be so proud.
Leonard,Do you have any ideas?
Sheldon,"Yes, but they all involve a green lantern and a power ring."
Leonard,"Easy, easy  Okay! Now weêve got an inclined plane. The force required to lift is reduced by the sine of the angle of the stairs, call it thirty degrees, so about half. "
Sheldon,Exactly half.
Leonard,"Exactly half. Letês push. Okay, see, itês moving, this is easy, all in the math. "
Sheldon,Whatês your formula for the corner.
Leonard,"Oh, okay, uh, okay, yeah, no problem, just come up here and help me pull and turn."
Sheldon,"Ah, gravity, thou art a heartless bitch."
Sheldon,You do understand that our efforts here will in no way increase the odds of you having sexual congress with this woman?
Leonard,Men do things for women without expecting sex.
Sheldon,"Yeah, those are men who just had sex."
Leonard,"Iêm doing this to be a good neighbour. In any case, thereês no way it could lower the odds."
Leonard,"Almost there, almost there, almost there. "
Sheldon,"No weêre not, no weêre not, no weêre not."
Sheldon,"Watch your fingers. Watch your fingers. Oh God, my fingers!"
Leonard,You okay?
Sheldon,"No, it hurtÑ  Great Caesarês Ghost, look at this place?"
Leonard,So Pennyês a little messy.
Sheldon,"A little messy? The Mandelbrot set of complex numbers is a little messy, this is chaos. Excuse me, explain to me an organisational system where a tray of flatware on a couch is valid. Iêm just inferring that this is a couch, because the evidence suggests the coffee tableês having a tiny garage sale. "
Leonard,"Did it ever occur to you that not everyone has the compulsive need to sort, organise and label the entire world around them?"
Leonard,"Well they donêt. Hard as it may be for you to believe, most people donêt sort their breakfast cereal numerically by fibre content."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, but I think weêve both found that helpful at times."
Leonard,"Come on, we should go."
Sheldon,Hang on.
Leonard,What are you doing?
Sheldon,Straightening up.
Leonard,"Sheldon, this is not your home."
Sheldon,"This is not anyoneês home, this is a swirling vortex of entropy."
Leonard,"When the transvestite lived here, you didnêt care how he kept the place."
Sheldon,"Because it was immaculate, I mean, you open that manês closet, it was left to right, evening gowns, cocktail dresses, then his police uniforms."
Leonard,What were you doing in his closet?
Sheldon,I helped run some cable for a webcam.
Penny,Hey guys.
Leonard,"Oh, hey Penny, this just arrived, we just brought this up, just now."
Penny,Great. Was it hard getting it up the stairs?
Leonard,"Well, weêll get out of your hair."
Penny,"Oh, great, thank you again ."
Sheldon,"Penny, I just want you to know that, you donêt have to live like this. Iêm here for you."
Penny,Whatês he talking about?
Leonard,Itês a joke.
Penny,I donêt get it.
Leonard,"Yeah, he didnêt tell it right."
Leonard,Sheldon? Hello? 
Sheldon,Sssshhhh! Pennyês sleeping.
Leonard,"Are you insane, you canêt just break into a womanês apartment in the middle of the night and clean."
Sheldon,"I had no choice. I couldnêt sleep knowing that just outside my bedroom was our living room, and just outside our living room was that hallway, and immediately adjacent to that hallway wasÑ this."
Leonard,"Do you realise that if Penny wakes up, there is no reasonable explanation as to why weêre here?"
Sheldon,I just gave you a reasonable explanation.
Leonard,"No, no. You gave me an explanation, itês reasonableness will be determined by a jury of your peers."
Sheldon,Donêt be ridiculous. I have no peers.
Leonard,"Sheldon, we have to get out of here."
Sheldon,You might want to speak in a lower register.
Sheldon,"Evolution has made women sensitive to high pitched noises while they sleep, so that theyêll be roused by a crying baby. If you want to avoid waking her, speak in a lower register."
Leonard,Thatês ridiculous. 
Sheldon,"No,  thatês ridiculous."
Leonard,"Fine. I accept your premise, now please letês go."
Sheldon,I am not leaving until Iêm done.
Leonard,O-o-o-oh! .
Sheldon,"If you have time to lean, you have time to clean."
Leonard,"Oh, what the hell."
Leonard,Morning. 
Sheldon,"I have to say, I slept splendidly. Granted, not long, but just deeply and well."
Leonard,Iêm not surprised. A well known folk cure for insomnia is to break into your neighbourês apartment and clean.
Leonard,You think?
Sheldon,"Granted, my methods may have been somewhat unorthodox, but I think the end result will be a measurable enhancement of Pennyês quality of life."
Leonard,"You know what, youêve convinced me, maybe tonight we should sneak in and shampoo her carpet."
Sheldon,You donêt think that crosses a line?
Leonard,"Yes! For Godês sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth."
Sheldon,You have a sarcasm sign?
Leonard,"No, I do not have a sarcasm sign."
Sheldon,"Do you want some cereal. Iêm feeling so good today Iêm going to choose from the low fibre end of the shelf. Hello, Honey Puffs."
Penny,Son of a Bitch!
Leonard,Pennyês up.
Penny,"You sick, geeky bastards!"
Leonard,How did she know it was us?
Sheldon,I may have left a suggested organisational schematic for her bedroom closet.
Leonard,"God, this is going to be bad."
Sheldon,"Goodbye, Honey Puffs, hello Big Bran."
Penny,You came into my apartment last night when I was sleeping?
Leonard,"Yes, but, only to clean."
Sheldon,"Really more to organise, youêre not actually dirty, per se."
Penny,Give me back my key.
Leonard,"Iêm very, very sorry."
Penny,Do you understand how creepy this is.
Leonard,"Oh, yes, we discussed it at length last night."
Penny,"In my apartment, while I was sleeping."
Sheldon,"And snoring. And thatês probably just a sinus infection, but it could be sleep apnoea, you might want to see an otolaryngologist. Itês a throat doctor."
Penny,And what kind of doctor removes shoes from asses?
Sheldon,"Depending on the depth, thatês either a proctologist or a general surgeon.  Oh!"
Leonard,"Okay, look, no Penny, I think what youêre feeling is perfectly valid, and maybe a little bit later today when youêre feeling a little bit less, for lack of a better word, violated, maybe we could talk about this some more."
Penny,Stay away from me.
Leonard,"Sure, thatês another way to go."
Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, just to clarify because there will be a discussion when you leave, is your objection solely to our presence in the apartment while you were sleeping, or do you also object to the imposition of a new organisational paradigm.  Well that was a little non-responsive."
Leonard,You are going to march yourself over there right now and apologise.  Whatês funny?
Sheldon,That wasnêt sarcasm?
Sheldon,"Wooh, boy, you are all over the place this morning.  I have a masters and two PhDês, I should not have to do this."
Sheldon,"I am truly sorry for what happened last night, I take full responsibility. And I hope that it wonêt colour your opinion of Leonard, who is not only a wonderful guy, but also, I hear, a gentle and thorough lover.  I did what I could."
Penny,"Hey Raj.  Hey, listen, I donêt know if you heard about what happened last night with Leonard and Sheldon, but Iêm really upset about it, I mean they just, they let themselves into my place, and then they cleaned it, I mean can you even believe that? How weird is that?"
Raj,"Ooh, sheês standing very close to me. Oh my, she does smell good. What is that, vanilla?"
Penny,"You know, where I come from, someone comes into your house at night, you shoot, okay? And you donêt shoot to wound. I mean, alright, my sister shot her husband, but it was an accident, they were drunk. What was I saying?"
Raj,"Sheês so chatty. Maybe my parents are right. Maybe Iêd be better off with an Indian girl. Weêd have the same cultural background, and my wife would sing to my children the same lullabies my mother sang to me. "
Penny,"Itês obvious that they meant well, but Iêm just, Iêm having a really rough time, like I said, I broke up with my boyfriend, and itês just freaking me out."
Penny,"I mean, just because most of the men Iêve known in my life happen to be jerks, doesnêt mean I should just assume Leonard and Sheldon are. Right?"
Penny,Thatês exactly what I thought. Thank you for listening. Youêre a doll. 
Howard,"Grab a napkin, homie. You just got served. "
Leonard,Itês fine. You win.
Howard,Whatês his problem?
Sheldon,His imaginary girlfriend broke up with him.
Howard,Been there.
Raj,"Hello. Sorry Iêm late. But I was in the hallway, chatting up Penny."
Howard,"Really? You? Rajesh Koothrapali, spoke to Penny?"
Raj,"Actually, I was less the chatter than the chattee."
Leonard,What did she say? Is she still mad at me?
Raj,"Well, she was upset at first, but, probably because her sister shot somebody. Then there was something about you andÑ then she hugged me."
Howard,She hugged you? How did she hug you?  Is that her perfume I smell?
Raj,"intoxicating, isnêt it?"
Penny,Whatês going on?
Leonard,"Um, hereês the thing.  Penny. Just as Oppenheimer came to regret his contributions to the first atomic bomb, so too I regret my participation in what was, at the very least, an error in judgement. The hallmark of the great human experiment is the willingness to recognise oneês mistakes. Some mistakes, such as Madame Curieês discovery of Radium turned out to have great scientific potential even though she would later die a slow, painful death from radiation poisoning. Another example, from the field of ebola researchÑ."
Leonard,Six two inch dowels.
Leonard,"One package, Phillips head screws."
Penny,"Guys, seriously, I grew up on a farm, okay, I rebuilt a tractor engine when I was like twelve, I think I can put together a cheap Swedish media centre. "
Leonard,"No, please, we insist, itês the least we can do considering. "
Sheldon,Considering what? How great this place looks?
Howard,"Oh boy, I was afraid of this."
Howard,These instructions are a pictographic representation of the least imaginative way to assemble these components. This right here is why Sweden has no space program.
Penny,"Well, uh, it looked pretty good in the store."
Leonard,"It is an inefficient design, for example Penny has a flat screen TV, which means all the space behind it is wasted."
Sheldon,We could put her stereo back there.
Leonard,And control it how?
Sheldon,"Run an infra-red repeater, photocell here, emitter here, easy peasy. "
Howard,"Good point, how you gonna cool it?"
Penny,"Hey guys, I got this. "
Sheldon,"Hang on Penny. How about fans, here and here?"
Leonard,"Also inefficient, and might be loud."
Howard,"How about liquid coolant? Maybe a little aquarium pump here, run some quarter inch PVCÑ"
Penny,"Guys, this is actually really simple."
Howard,"Hold on, honey, men at work. The PVC comes down here, maybe a little corrugated sheet metal as a radiator here."
Leonard,"Oh, really, show me where we put a drip tray, a sluice and an overflow reservoir?"
Sheldon,And if water is involved weêre going to have to ground the crap out of the thing. 
Penny,"Guys, itês hot in here, I think Iêll just take off all my clothes. "
Leonard,"Oh, Iêve got it. How about if we replace panels A, B and F and crossbar H with aircraft grade aluminium. "
Sheldon,"Right, then the entire thingês one big heat sink."
Howard,"Perfect, Leonard, why donêt you and Sheldon go down to the junk yard and pick up about six square metres of scrap aluminium, Raj and I will run down to my lab and get the oxy-acetaline torch."
Leonard,Meet back here in an hour?
Leonard,Got it. .
Penny,"Okay, this place does look pretty good."
Howard,"Alright, just a few more feet, andÑ. here we are gentlemen, the Gates of Elzebub."
Sheldon,Good lord!
Leonard,"Donêt panic, this is what the last 97 hours have been about."
Howard,"Stay frosty, thereês a horde of armed goblins on the other side of that gate guarding the Sword of Azeroth."
Leonard,"Warriors, unsheathe your weapons, magic wielders raise your wands."
Sheldon,Lock and load. 
Howard,"Raj, blow up the gates."
Raj,"Blowing the gates. Control, shift, B! Oh, my God, so many goblins!"
Howard,"Donêt just stand there, slash and move, slash and move."
Leonard,Stay in formation.
Howard,"Leonard, youêve got one on your tail."
Leonard,"Thatês alright, my tailês prehensile, Iêll swat him off."
Raj,Iêve got him Leonard. Tonight I spice my meat with goblin blood!
Leonard,"Raj, no, itês a trap, theyêre flanking us!"
Raj,"Oooh, heês got me."
Howard,"Sheldon, heês got Raj, use your sleath spell. Sheldon! Sheldon!"
Sheldon,Iêve got the Sword of Azeroth!
Leonard,"Forget the sword, Sheldon, help Raj."
Sheldon,"There is no more Sheldon, I am the Swordmaster!"
Howard,Leonard look out!
Leonard,"Dammit man, weêre dying here. "
Sheldon,"Goodbye, peasants. "
Leonard,The bastard teleported. 
Raj,Heês selling the Sword of Azeroth on ebay.
Leonard,"You betrayed us for money, who are you?"
Sheldon,"Iêm a rogue knight elf, donêt you people read character descriptions? Wait, wait, wait, somebody just clicked _buy it now.î"
Howard,I am the Swordmaster!
Sheldon,"Wooh, Iêm all sweaty, anybody want to log on to second life and go swimming, I just built a virtual pool."
Leonard,"No, I canêt look at you or your avatar right now."
Howard,Sounds like your neighbourês home.
Leonard,Excuse me.
Sheldon,Donêt forget the mail you took accidentally on purpose so youêd have an excuse to talk to her.
Leonard,"Oh, right, right right right right."
Howard,"Stealing snail mail, very old school, I like it. "
Penny,"Um, no, hi Leonard, this is Doug, Doug, this is my neighbour Leonard."
Leonard,Not much. Bro. 
Penny,"Is, is everything okay."
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, uh, I just, I got your mail again, here."
Penny,"Thank you, Iêve got to talk to that mailman."
Leonard,"Oh no, thatês probably not such a good idea. Civil servants have a documented propensity to, you know, snap. "
Penny,"Okay, well, thank you, again."
Leonard,"No problem. Bye. Oh, and, bye, bro! ."
Sheldon,Penny for your thoughts. 
Raj,Whatês the matter.
Leonard,"No, Iêm fine. Pennyês fine, the guy sheês kissing is really fine andÑ"
Howard,"Kissing, what kind of kissing? Cheeks? Lips? Chaste? French? "
Leonard,What is wrong with you?
Howard,Iêm a romantic.
Sheldon,Please donêt tell me that your hopeless infatuation is devolving into pointless jealousy.
Leonard,"No, Iêm not jealous, Iêm just a little concerned for her. I didnêt like the look of the guy that she was with."
Howard,Because he looked better than you?
Leonard,Yeah. He was kinda dreamy.
Sheldon,"Well, at least now you can retrieve the black box from the twisted smouldering wreckage that was once your fantasy of dating her, and analyse the data so that you donêt crash into geek mountain again."
Howard,"I disagree, love is not a sprint, itês a marathon. A relentless pursuit that only ends when she falls into your arms. Or hits you with the pepper spray. "
Leonard,"Well, Iêm done with Penny. Iêm going to be more realistic and go after someone my own speed."
Raj,Like who?
Leonard,I donêt know. Olivia Geiger?
Sheldon,The dietician at the cafeteria with the limp and the lazy eye?
Sheldon,"Well, I donêt think you have a shot there. I have noticed that Lesley Winkle recently started shaving her legs. Now, given that winter is coming one can only assume that she is signalling sexual availability. "
Howard,"I donêt know, you guys work in the same lab."
Howard,"There are pitfalls, trust me, I know. When it comes to sexual harassment law IêmÑ a bit of a self-taught expert. "
Leonard,"Look, Howard, if I were to ask Lesley Winkle out it would just be for dinner, Iêm not going to walk into the lab, ask her to strip naked and dance for me."
Howard,"Oh, then youêre probably okay."
Leonard,Hello Lesley.
Leonard,Lesley I would like to propose an experiment.
Leonard,"Right. Lesley, I would like to propose an experiment."
Leonard,"Pfff, Iêve done it, about two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone. Anyway, I was thinking more of a bio-social exploration with a neuro-chemical overlay. "
Leonard,"I was going to characterise it as the modification of our colleague/friendship paradigm, with the addition of a date-like component. But we donêt need to quibble over terminology. "
Leonard,"There is a generally accepted pattern in this area, I would pick you up, take you to a restaurant, then we would see a movie, probably a romantic comedy featuring the talents of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock. "
Leonard,"Heartrate, pheromones, etc, yes. "
Leonard,"You mean, kiss you now?"
Leonard,Can you define the parameters of the kiss?
Leonard,Thank you. . Shall I count down from three?
Leonard,"You proposed the experiment, I think you should present your findings first."
Leonard,"Ah. Well, thank you for your time."
Leonard,None at all?
Howard,"Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didnêt, would you want me to tell you?"
Sheldon,"That depends. When I learn that Iêm a robot, will I be able to handle it?"
Howard,"Maybe, although the history of science-fiction is not on your side. "
Sheldon,"Uh, let me ask you this. When I learn that Iêm a robot, would I be bound by Asimovês three laws of robotics?"
Raj,You might be bound by them right now.
Howard,"Thatês true. Have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction allowed a human being to come to harm?"
Sheldon,Of course not. 
Howard,"Have you ever harmed yourself, or allowed yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would have been endangered?"
Sheldon,"Well, no."
Howard,I smell robot. 
Leonard,"Hey, whatês going on."
Sheldon,The internetês been down for half an hour. 
Raj,"Also, Sheldon may be a robot. "
Howard,"So, how did it go with Lesley? "
Leonard,"Oh, we tried kissing, but the earth didnêt move. I mean any more than the 383 miles that it was going to move anyway. "
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêve seen that look before. This is just going to be two weeks of moping and tedious emo songs, and calling me to come down to pet stores to look at cats. I donêt know if I can take it. "
Raj,You could power down.
Howard,"Well, as usual, Wolowitz has the solution. I happen to know a place where there are plenty of eligible women, and Leonard could have his pick."
Howard,"I think Mrs Tishmanês got her eye on you. Iêve been there, youêre in for a treat. "
Sheldon,"Oh, good lord."
Leonard,"You donêt know me, you donêt wear my chainsÑ God, thatês a good song. "
Sheldon,"If youêre compiling a mix CD for a double suicide.  Oh, I hope that scratching post is for you."
Leonard,"I know what youêre thinking, Iêve taken your asthma into account. Thereês a feline geneticist in San Diego who has developed the cutest little hypo-allergenic calicos. "
Sheldon,"Leonard, listen to meÑ"
Leonard,"Iêve been thinking about names, Iêm kind of torn between Einstein, Newton and Sergeant Fuzzyboots. "
Sheldon,"Leonard, do you really think you can satisfy your need for a relationship with a genetically altered cat?"
Leonard,"Maybe, if itês a cute little cuddly cat."
Sheldon,"Oh, come on, Leonard! This is obviously about Penny. "
Leonard,"It doesnêt matter. The womanês not interested in me, the woman rejected me. "
Sheldon,"Okay, look, I think that you have as much of a chance of having a sexual relationship with Penny as the Hubble Telescope does of discovering at the centre of every black hole is a little man with a flashlight searching for a circuit breaker. Nevertheless, I do feel obligated to point out to you that she did no reject you. You did not ask her out. "
Leonard,"Youêre right. I didnêt ask her out, I should ask her out."
Sheldon,"No, now that was not my point. My point was, donêt buy a cat. "
Leonard,"No, but youêre right. I should march over there and ask her out. "
Sheldon,"Oh, goody, weêre getting a cat. "
Penny,"Ah, hey Leonard."
Leonard,"Good afternoon Penny, so hi, hey. UhÑ I was wondering if you had plans for dinner."
Penny,"Uh, do you mean dinner tonight?"
Leonard,"There is an inherent ambiguity in the word dinner. Technically it refers to the largest meal of the day whenever it is consumed, so, to clarify here, by dinner I mean supper."
Leonard,"Or dinner. I was thinking six thirty, if you can go, or a different time."
Penny,"Uh, six thirtyês great."
Leonard,Really? Great!
Penny,"Yeah, I like hanging out with you guys."
Leonard,Us guys?
Penny,"You know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, who allês coming?"
Leonard,"TheyÑ. might all be there. Or a subset of them might be there, uh, algebraically speaking there are too many unknowns, for example Sheldon had Quizznos for lunch, sometimes he finds that filling, other times he doesnêt, itês no fault of Quizznos, they have a varied menu."
Penny,"Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun."
Leonard,Great. Did we say a time?
Penny,Six thirty.
Leonard,And thatês still good for you.
Penny,Itês fine.
Leonard,Cos itês not carved in stone.
Penny,"No, six thirtyês great."
Leonard,Iêll get my chisel.
Leonard,"ToÑ carve theÑ okay, Iêll see you six thirty."
Leonard,How do I look?
Sheldon,Could you be more specific?
Leonard,Can you tell Iêm perspiring a little?
Sheldon,The dark crescent-shaped patterns under your arms conceal it nicely. What time is your date?
Leonard,Six thirty. 
Sheldon,"Perfect, that gives you two hours and fifteen minutes for that dense molecular cloud of Aramis to dissipate. "
Leonard,Is it too much?
Sheldon,Not if youêre a rugby team. 
Leonard,"By the way, if it should ever come up, you didnêt join us because you stuffed yourself with a chicken carbonara sub at Quizznos. "
Sheldon,Why would I join you?
Leonard,"No reason. Oh, you know what, maybe this isnêt such a good idea. "
Sheldon,"Oh, no, no, no, well now, thereês always the possibility that alcohol and poor judgement on her part might lead to a nice romantic evening."
Leonard,"Youêre right, alcohol, poor judgement, it could go well."
Sheldon,"Of course, thereês the other possibility that this date kicks off a rather unpleasant six months of the two of you passing awkwardly in the hall until one of you breaks down and moves to another zip code."
Leonard,You could have stopped at _it could go well.î
Sheldon,"If I could of, I would of. "
Leonard,"I mean, Iêm a perfectly nice guy. Thereês no reason we couldnêt go to the restaurant and have a lovely dinner. Maybe take a walk afterwards, talk about things we have in common, _you love pottery? I love pottery!î You know, thereês a pause, we both know whatês happening, I lean in, we kiss, itês a little tentative at first but then I realise, sheês kissing me back, and sheês biting my lower lip, you know, she wants me, this thing is going the distance, weêre going to have sex! Oh God! Oh, my God!"
Sheldon,Is the sex starting now?
Leonard,Iêm having a panic attack.
Sheldon,"Oh, okay, well then, calm down."
Leonard,"If I could calm down I wouldnêt be having a panic attack, thatês why they call it a panic attack."
Sheldon,"Alright, alright, well, just, sit down, yes, sit down, now close your eyes."
Sheldon,Just do it.
Sheldon,Now try to increase your alpha-wave activity.
Sheldon,"Itês a bio-feedback technique, itês relaxation through brain-wave manipulation, I read a paper about it in the Journal of American Neuroscience, it was a little sparsely sourced but I think the basic science is valid, I probably have it here somewhere."
Leonard,"Oh, who am I kidding, I canêt go through with this, you need to call her and cancel."
Sheldon,What should I tell her.
Leonard,I donêt know. Tell her Iêm sick.
Leonard,"Not the kind of illness that will make her want to come over and take care of me, but nothing so critical that sheêll feel uncomfortable going out with me in the future if I want to try this again."
Sheldon,Got it. So Iêm assuming nothing venereal. Iêll just tell her that you had a routine colonoscopy and havenêt quite bounced back.
Leonard,Give me the phone. 
Sheldon,But I thought you wanted to cancel?
Leonard,I canêt because if I donêt show up sheêll still be expecting you.
Sheldon,Why would she be expecting me? 
Leonard,"Stop asking me all these questions, I need to take another shower."
Penny,So are the rest of the guys meeting us here?
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, no. Turns out that Raj and Howard had to work, and Sheldon had a colonoscopy and he hasnêt quite bounced back yet. "
Penny,"Ooh, my uncle just had a colonoscopy."
Leonard,"Youêre kidding, well, then, thatês something we have in common. "
Leonard,We both have people in our lives whoÑ want to nip intestinal polyps in the bud. 
Penny,"So, whatês new in the world of physics?"
Penny,"Really, nothing?"
Leonard,"Well, with the exception of string theory, not much has happened since the 1930ês, and you canêt prove string theory, at best you can say _hey, look, my idea has an internal logical consistency.î"
Penny,Ah. Well Iêm sure things will pick up. 
Leonard,Whatês new at the Cheesecake Factory?
Penny,"Oh, uh, not much. We do have a chocolate key lime thatês moving pretty well. "
Leonard,"Good. Good. And what about your, uh, hallway friend."
Penny,"Doug? Oh, yeah, I dunno, I mean, heês nice and funny, butÑ"
Leonard,"No,  You were saying, butÑ"
Penny,Iêd like a drink.
Leonard,Just say the but thing about Doug and then Iêll get her back. 
Penny,"Okay, well, you know, itês just me. Iêm still getting over this break-up with Kurt, and this thing with Doug would be just rebound sex."
Leonard,"Ugh, donêt get me started on rebound sex."
Penny,"Itês just, itês my pattern. I break up, then I find some cute guy, and then itês just thirty six meaningless ofÑ well, you know. "
Leonard,"Iêm not sure that I do. Um, is that one thirty-six hour experience, or is it thirty six hours spread out over say, oneÑ glorious summer."
Penny,"No, itês usually over a weekend, and trust me, you do not feel good after it."
Leonard,"Well, chafing, right?"
Leonard,"Of course, yeah, emotional chafing. Hey, do you want to see something cool?  I can make this olive go into this glass without touching it. "
Leonard,Physics. .
Penny,"Wow, centrifugal force!"
Leonard,"Actually, itês centripetal force, which is an inward force generated by the glass acting on the olive. "
Penny,Are you okay?
Leonard,"Yeah, Iêm okay. Did you spill ketchup?"
Leonard,Iêm not okay.
Penny,Are you sure you donêt want to go to the emergency room?
Leonard,"No, no, Iêm okay, itês stopped bleeding."
Penny,"I know, but you did throw up. Isnêt that a sign of a concussion?"
Leonard,"Yes, but I get car sick too, soÑ"
Leonard,"Sorry about your car, by the way."
Penny,"Oh, no, itês fine, you got most of it out the window. "
Leonard,The poor guy on the bike. I had a nice time.
Penny,"Yeah, me too. Um, good night.  Leonard?"
Penny,Was this supposed to be a date?
Leonard,"This? No, of course not, this was just you and me hanging out with a bunch of guys who didnêt show up, because of work and a colonoscopy."
Penny,"Okay, I was just checking."
Leonard,"When I take a girl out on a date, and I do, she knows sheês been dated. Capital D. Bold face, underline, like Day-ted. I think I might have a little concussion, Iêm going to go lay down for a while, good night. "
Sheldon,"So, how was your date?"
Sheldon,Score one for liquor and poor judgement.
Sheldon,Iêve been thinking about time travel again.
Leonard,"Why, did you hit a roadblock with invisibility?"
Sheldon,"Put it on the back burner. Anyway, it occurs to me, if I ever did perfect a time machine, Iêd just go into the past and give it to myself, thus eliminating the need for me to invent it in the first place."
Sheldon,"Yeah, it really takes the pressure off. "
Leonard,"Sounds like a breakthrough, should I call the science magazines and tell them to hold the front cover? "
Sheldon,"Itês time travel, Leonard, I will have already done that. "
Leonard,Then I guess congratulations are in order.
Sheldon,"No, congratulations will have been in order. You know, Iêm not going to enjoy this party."
Leonard,"I know, Iêm familiar with you."
Sheldon,"At the last department party, Dr Finkleday cornered me and talked about spelunking for 45 minutes."
Leonard,"Yes, I was there."
Sheldon,"You know whatês interesting about caves, Leonard?"
Leonard,"Well then weêll avoid Finkleday, weêll meet the new department head, congratulate him, shake his hand and go. "
Sheldon,"Howês this? Pleased to meet you, Dr Gablehouser. How fortunate for you that the University has chosen to hire you, despite the fact that youêve done no original research in 25 years, and instead have written a series of popular books that reduce the great concepts of science to a series of anecdotes, each one dumbed down to accommodate the duration of an average bowel movement. Mahalo."
Leonard,Mahaloês a nice touch. 
Sheldon,Do you know there are only eight consonants in the Hawaiian language.
Leonard,"Interesting, you should lead with that."
Raj,"Oh, God, Look at this buffet. I love America."
Leonard,You donêt have buffets in India?
Raj,"Of course, but itês all Indian food. You canêt find a bagel in Mumbai to save your life. Schmear me."
Sheldon,Well hereês an interesting turn of events.
Leonard, Howard brought a date?
Sheldon,A more plausible explanation is that his work in robotics has made an amazing leap forward.
Howard,"Hey, what up, science bitches? May I introduce my special lady friend, Summer. "
Howard,Right. Sorry.
Leonard,"Here comes our new boss, be polite."
Howard,Howard Wolowitz.
Sheldon,An actual real scientist.  How was that?
Sheldon,I canêt believe he fired me.
Leonard,"Well, you did call him a glorified high-school science teacher whose last successful experiment was lighting his own farts."
Sheldon,"In my defence, I prefaced that by saying _with all due respect.î"
Leonard,Youêre making eggs for breakfast?
Sheldon,"This isnêt breakfast, itês an experiment. "
Leonard,Huh? Cos it looks a lot like breakfast.
Sheldon,"I finally have the time to test my hypothesis, about the separation of the water molecules from the egg proteins, and its impact vis-a-vis taste."
Leonard,Sounds yummy. I look forward to your work with bacon.
Sheldon,As do I.
Leonard,"You know, Iêm sure if you just apologised to Gablehauser he would give you your job back."
Sheldon,"I donêt want my job back. Iêve spent the last three and a half years staring at greaseboards full of equations. Before that I spent four years working on my thesis. Before that I was in college, and before that, I was in the fifth grade. This is my first day off in decades, and Iêm going to savour it."
Leonard,Okay. Iêll let you get back to fixing your eggs.
Sheldon,"Iêm not just fixing my eggs, Iêm fixing everyoneês eggs."
Leonard,And we all thank you.
Sheldon,Use new eggs. .
Penny,"Hi, hey. Iêm running out to the market, do you guys need anything?"
Sheldon,"Oh, well this would be one of those circumstances that people unfamiliar with the law of large numbers would call a coincidence."
Penny,Iêm sorry?
Sheldon,I need eggs. Four dozen should suffice.
Penny,Four dozen?
Sheldon,"Yes, and evenly distributed amongst brown, white, free range, large, extra-large and jumbo."
Penny,"Okay, one more time?"
Sheldon,"Never mind, you wonêt get it right, Iêd better come with you."
Penny,"Oh, yay!"
Penny,How come you didnêt go into work today.
Sheldon,"Iêm taking a sabbatical, because I wonêt kow-tow to mediocre minds. "
Penny,"So you got canned, huh?"
Sheldon,Theoretical physicists do not get canned. But yeah. 
Penny,"Well, maybe itês all for the best, you know I always say, when one door closes, another one opens. "
Sheldon,"No it doesnêt. Not unless the two doors are connected by relays, or there are motion sensors involved. "
Penny,"No, no, I meantÑ"
Sheldon,Or the first door closing causes a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door.
Penny,Never mind. 
Sheldon,"Slow down. Slow down, please slow down."
Penny,Weêre fine.
Sheldon,"Look, youêre not leaving yourself enough space between cars."
Penny,"Oh, sure I am."
Sheldon,"No, no. Let me do the math for you, this car weighs letês say 4,000lb, now add say 140 for me, 120 for you."
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm sorry, did I insult you? Is your body mass somehow tied into your self worth?"
Penny,"Well, yeah."
Sheldon,"Interesting. Anyway, that gives us a total weight of, letês say, 4,400lb."
Penny,"Letês say 4,390. "
Sheldon,"Fine. Weêre travelling forward at, good Lord, 51 miles an hour. Now letês assume that your brakes are new and the callipers are aligned, still, by the time we come to a stop, weêll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us, an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death, mutilation andÑ oh look, they built a new put-put course."
Sheldon,"This is great. Look at me, out in the real world of ordinary people, just living their ordinary, colourless, workaday lives. "
Penny,Thank you.
Sheldon,"No, thank you. And thank you, ordinary person. Hey, you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes."
Penny,"Uh, no, no not really. Listen, didnêt you say you needed some eggs. "
Sheldon,"Uh, yes, but anyone who knows anything about the dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated foods on the way out of the supermarket."
Penny,"Oh, okay, well maybe you should start heading on out then. "
Sheldon,"No, this is fun. Oh, the thing about tomatoes, and I think youêll really enjoy this, is, theyêre shelved with the vegetables, but theyêre technically a fruit. "
Sheldon,Isnêt it?
Penny,"No, I mean what you find enjoyable. "
Sheldon,Oh boy.
Penny,What now?
Sheldon,"Well, thereês some value to taking a multivitamin, but the human body can only absorb so much, what youêre buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine. "
Penny,"Well, maybe thatês what I was going for. "
Sheldon,Well then youêll want some manganese.
Sheldon,That was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores. 
Penny,"Oh, I donêt know Sheldon, itês going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today. "
Sheldon,"Are you sure. There are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk. For example, I noticed that you purchase your tampons one monthês supply at a time."
Sheldon,"Well think about it, itês a product that doesnêt spoil, and youêre going to be needing them for at least the next thirty years."
Penny,You want me to buy thirty years worth of tampons?
Sheldon,"Well, thirty, thirty five, hey, when did your mother go into menopause?"
Penny,"Okay, Iêm not talking about this with you."
Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, this is a natural human process, and weêre talking about statistically significant savings. Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle and a 28 day cycle, are you fairly regular?  Okay, no warehouse store, but weêre still on for put-put golf, right?"
Leonard,"Hey, I just ran into Penny, she seemed upset about something."
Sheldon,I think itês her time of the month. I marked the calendar for future reference. 
Leonard,Whatês with the fish?
Sheldon,Itês an experiment. 
Leonard,What happened to your scrambled egg research?
Sheldon,"Oh, that was a dead end. Scrambled eggs are as good as theyêre ever going to be."
Leonard,SoÑ fish. 
Sheldon,"I read an article about Japanese scientists, who inserted DNA from luminous jellyfish into other animals, and I thought hey, fish nightlights."
Leonard,Fish nightlights.
Sheldon,Itês a billion dollar idea. Shhhhh!
Leonard,"Mumês the word. Sheldon, are you sure you donêt want to just apologise to Gablehauser and get your job back."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, no, no. No, Iêve too much to do."
Leonard,Like luminous fish.
Leonard,RightÑ I didnêtÑ.
Sheldon,"Thatês just the beginning. I also have an idea for a bulk mail-order feminine hygiene company. Oh, glow in the dark tampons! Leonard, weêre going to be rich. "
Leonard,Thank you for coming on such short notice.
Leonard,"I didnêt know what else to do, heês lost all focus, every day heês got a new obsession.  This is a particularly disturbing one. "
Sheldon,You called my mother?
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,"I was working with luminous fish, and I thought, hey, loom! Mom, what are you doing here?"
Sheldon,"I know, but why?"
Leonard,Because one of the great minds of the twenty-first century is raising glow-in-the-dark fish and weaving sarapes. 
Sheldon,"This is not a sarape. This is a poncho. A sarape is open at the sides, a poncho is closed, this is a poncho, and neither is a reason to call someoneês mother. "
Leonard,"Really, when was the last time you left the house."
Sheldon,I went to the market with Penny.
Leonard,That was three weeks ago.
Sheldon,"Well then buckle up, in the next four to eight days sheês going to get very crabby."
Sheldon,"Yes, well Iêm not a child, Iêm a grown man capable of living my life as I see fit. And I certainly donêt need someone telling on me to my mother. "
Leonard,Where are you going?
Sheldon,"To my room, and no-oneês allowed in. "
Leonard,Oh. 
Leonard,I see.
Leonard,Sheldon? Your mum made dinner.
Sheldon,Iêm not hungry. 
Penny,Are we so sure thatês a bad thing?
Howard,"Excuse me for being so bold, but I now see where Sheldon gets his smouldering good looks."
Leonard,"That is a lovely story, um, are we going to do anything about Sheldon?"
Leonard,Sounds like a wise man.
Penny,Has Shelly ever freaked out like this before.
Penny,What happened?
Leonard,A death ray?
Leonard,"No, weêre not, weêre not, not a couple, two singles, like those individually wrapped slices of cheese thatÑ. are friends."
Howard,Oh yeah.
Penny,"Oh my God, this is the best cobbler Iêve ever had."
Howard,"Hey, look whoês come outÑ."
Leonard,"This is ridiculous. Dammit, Sheldon, snap out of it. Youêre a physicist, you belong at the University doing research, not hiding in your room. "
Sheldon,Itês my idea of what DNA would look like in a silicon based life form. 
Sheldon,"What do you want, mom?"
Sheldon,What for?
Sheldon,"Iêm not going to apologise, I didnêt say anything that wasnêt true. "
Sheldon,Why not?
Sheldon,Wouldnêt have been any ass-kickings if that stupid death ray had worked.
Leonard,Really? Thatês impressive.
Sheldon,Dr Gablehouser.
Sheldon,"Um, as you know, several weeks ago in our first encounter we may have gotten off on the wrong foot, when I called you an idiot. And I just wanted to say that I was wrong. To point it out. "
Leonard,"Hey, how did it go?"
Sheldon,I got my job back.
Leonard,Really? What happened?
Sheldon,Iêm not quite sure. It involves a part of the human experience that has always eluded me. 
Leonard,That narrows it down. 
Sheldon,"Thanks, mom. Mom?"
Sheldon,Is Dr Gablehouser going to be my new daddy?
Sheldon,"Alright, Iêm moving my infantry division, augmented by a battalion of Orcs from Lord of the Rings, we flank the Tennessee Volunteers, and the North once again wins the Battle of Gettysburg."
Howard,"Not so fast, remember the South still has two infantry divisions, plus Superman and Godzilla."
Leonard,"No, no, no, no, Orcs are magic, Superman is vulnerable to magic, not to mention, you already lost Godzilla to the Illinois Cavalry and Hulk."
Raj,Why donêt you just have Robert E. Lee charge the line with Shiva and Ganesh.
Penny,"Hi, you guys ready to order?"
Howard,"Hang on, honey. Shiva and Ganesh? The Hindu Gods against the entire Union army?"
Leonard,And Orcs!
Penny,Iêll be back.
Raj,"Excuse me, Ganesh is the remover of obstacles, and Shiva is the destroyer. When the smoke clears, Abraham Lincoln will be speaking Hindi and drinking mint juleps. "
Penny,"Alright, my boss says you either have to order, or leave and never come back. "
Howard,What do you recommend for someone who worked up a man-sized appetite from a morning of weight training and cardio-funk?
Penny,A shower. 
Howard,Iêll take the heart smart platter.
Penny,"Alright, thank you, and Sheldon."
Sheldon,"We donêt eat here, I donêt know whatês good."
Penny,"Well, itês all good. "
Sheldon,Statistically unlikely. 
Leonard,"Just get a hamburger, you like hamburgers."
Sheldon,"I like the hamburgers where we usually have hamburgers, you canêt make the assumption that Iêll like the hamburgers here. "
Leonard,Iêm sorry. Give him a hamburger. 
Penny,"Uh, which one, the Classic Burger, the Ranch House Burger, the Barbecue Burger or the Kobe burger?"
Sheldon,Canêt we just go to Big Boy? They only have one burger. The Big Boy. 
Penny,The Barbecue Burger is like the Big Boy. 
Sheldon,"Excuse me, in a world that already includes the Big Boy, why would I settle for something like a Big Boy?"
Penny,Because you are not at Big Boy!
Sheldon,"Fine, Iêll have the Barbecue Burger. "
Leonard,Make it two. 
Sheldon,Waitresses donêt yell at you at Big Boy. 
Leonard,Hey Lesley. 
Sheldon,We donêt. This is a disturbing aberration. 
Leonard,"Lesley, this is Penny, she lives across the hall from Sheldon and me. "
Howard,And walks in quiet beauty like the night. 
Penny,"Howard, Iêve asked you not to do that. "
Leonard,Lesley and I do research together at the University. 
Penny,"Oh, wow, a girl scientist. "
Leonard,What happened to Elliot Wong?
Leonard,"Yeah, sure, why not."
Leonard,Why at my place?
Penny,"Yeah, you too. Leonard, I didnêt know you played the cello?"
Leonard,"Yeah, my parents felt that naming me Leonard and putting me in advanced placement classes wasnêt getting me beaten up enough. "
Howard,"If youêre into music, I happen to be a human beatbox. "
Penny,"Really?  Iêm actually not that into music. So hey, your friendês really cute, anything going on with you two. "
Leonard,"Lesley? No, no-oh, what are you kidding?"
Sheldon,"He asked her out once, it was an embarrassing failure. "
Leonard,Thank you Sheldon.
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm sorry, was that supposed to be a secret?"
Penny,"Oh, thatês too bad, you guys would make a cute couple. "
Raj,Oh dear.
Howard,Whatês the matter?
Raj,She didnêt take my order.
Howard,How can she take your order when youêre too neurotic to talk to her.
Raj,"Nevertheless, this will be reflected in her tip. "
Leonard,"What did Penny mean, youêd make a cute couple?"
Sheldon,"Well I assume she meant that the two of you together would constitute a couple that others might consider cute. An alternate, and somewhat less likely interpretation, is that you could manufacture one. As in, oh look, Leonard and Lesley made Mr and Mrs Goldfarb, arenêt they adorable. "
Leonard,"If Penny didnêt know that Lesley had already turned me down then that would unambiguously mean that she, Penny, thought that I should her, Lesley, out, indicating that she, Penny, had no interest in me asking her, Penny, out. But because she did know that I had asked Lesley out and that she, Lesley, had turned me down then she, Penny, could be offering consolation. Thatês too bad, you would have made a cute couple. But while thinking, good, Leonard remains available. "
Sheldon,"Youêre a lucky man, Leonard. "
Leonard,How so?
Sheldon,Youêre talking to one of the three men in the Western hemisphere capable of following that train of thought. 
Leonard,"Well, what do you think."
Sheldon,"I said I could follow it, I didnêt say I cared."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,"That was fun, Lesley, thanks for including me. "
Leonard,"Uh, sure, why not. "
Leonard,I thought you werenêt interested in me.
Leonard,You mean my cello?
Leonard,No kidding?
Leonard,"Gee, uhÑ"
Leonard,Penny? What about her?
Leonard,"Well, I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast, which could give a positive urine test for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupils, so I guess thereês no point in bringing it up. "
Leonard,"No, thereês nothing going on between Penny and me."
Leonard,"Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am. "
Leonard,"Yeah, yeah it is good. Did you want to start now?"
Leonard,Oh. Okay. A little musical foreplay. Terrific. 
Leonard,"Iêm good, Iêm good to go. "
Penny,"Oh, hey Sheldon, whatês going on?"
Sheldon,I need your opinion on a matter of semiotics.
Penny,Iêm sorry?
Sheldon,"Semiotics. The study of signs and symbols, itês a branch of philosophy related to linguistics."
Penny,"Okay, sweetie, I know you think youêre explaining yourself, but youêre really not. "
Sheldon,Just come with me.
Penny,Well what?
Sheldon,What does it mean?
Penny,"Oh, come on, you went to college."
Sheldon,"Yes, but I was eleven."
Penny,"Alright, look, a tie on the doorknob usually means someone doesnêt want to be disturbed because theyêre, you know, getting busy. "
Sheldon,So youêre saying Leonard has a girl in there.
Penny,"Well, either that or heês lost his tie rack and gotten really into Bryan Adams. "
Penny,We really shouldnêt be standing here. 
Sheldon,This is very awkward.
Penny,"Oh, come on, you know, Leonardês had girls over before, right?"
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, but thereês usually planning, courtship and advance notice. Last time I was able to book a cruise to the Arctic to see a solar eclipse. "
Penny,"Wait, you had to leave the state because your roommate was having sex?"
Sheldon,"I didnêt have to, the dates just happened to coincide. "
Penny,"So, do you know whoês in there?"
Sheldon,"Well, thereês Leonard.  And heês either with Lesley Winkle or a 1930ês gangster. "
Penny,"Hmmm. Good for him. Good for Leonard. Okay, night."
Sheldon,"No, no, wait, hold on. "
Penny,Whatês the matter?
Sheldon,"I donêt know what the protocol is here. Do I stay, do I leave? Do I wait to greet them with a refreshing beverage? "
Penny,"Gee, Sheldon, youêre asking the wrong girl. Iêm usually on the other side of the tie. "
Sheldon,"Hi, Leonard. Itês me, Sheldon. In the living room. I just, I wanted you to know I saw the tie. Message received. Youêre welcome. You carry on. Give my best to Lesley. "
Sheldon,"Big boy!  Someone touched my board. Oh God, my board. Leonard! Leonard!"
Leonard,"Hey, whatês the matter? "
Sheldon,"My equations, someoneês tampered with my equations. "
Leonard,Are you sure?
Sheldon,"Of course Iêm sure. Look at the beta-function of quantum chrono-dynamics, the signês been changed. "
Leonard,Oh yeah. But doesnêt that fix the problem youêve been having?
Sheldon,"Are you insane? Are you out of your mind? Are youÑ. hey look, that fixes the problem Iêve been having. "
Sheldon,You did this?
Leonard,"Thank you, Iêll see you at work. "
Sheldon,"Uh-duh, hold on, hold on!"
Sheldon,Who told you you could touch my board?
Sheldon,I donêt come into your house and touch your board.
Sheldon,"Oh, that is soÑ soÑ"
Sheldon,"Inconsiderate, that is the adjective, inconsiderate. "
Leonard,"You can stare at your board all day Sheldon, sheês still going to be right. "
Sheldon,"Iêm not staring, Iêm mulling."
Penny,"Oh, hey Leonard."
Leonard,"Oh, hi."
Penny,"So, howês it going?"
Leonard,Pretty good. 
Penny,"Just pretty good, Iêd think you were doing very good. "
Leonard,"Pretty, very, thereês really no objective scale for delineating variations of good, why do you ask?"
Penny,"Well, a little bird told me that you and Lesley hooked up last night. "
Sheldon,Iêm coming.
Penny,"So, is it serious, do you like her?"
Leonard,"Wuh, I donêtÑ. th-th-th-thatês really two different questions, uh, Iêm notÑ. Sheldon, we have to go! "
Sheldon,"Boy, youêre wound awfully tight for a man who just had sexual intercourse. "
Penny,"Alright, well, Iêll talk to you later, but, I am so happy for you Leonard. "
Leonard,"Thank you. What did she mean, sheês happy for me? Is she happy because Iêm seeing someone, or is she happy because she thinks that Iêm happy, because anyone who cared for someone would want them to be happy, even if the reason for their happiness made the first person unhappy. You know, because the second person, though happy, is now romantically unavailable to the first person."
Sheldon,Do you realise I may have to share a Nobel Prize with your booty call?
Leonard,"You know what, Iêm being ridiculous. But who cares what Penny thinks, Lesley is a terrific girl, sheês attractive, we like each other, sheês extremely intelligent."
Sheldon,Sheês not that intelligent.
Leonard,She fixed your equation.
Sheldon,She got lucky.
Leonard,You donêt believe in luck.
Sheldon,I donêt have to believe in it for her to be lucky. 
Leonard,"Regardless, I have a chance at a real relationship with Lesley, Iêm not going to pass that up for some hypothetical future happiness with a woman who may or may not want me to be happy with a woman who is currently making me happy. "
Sheldon,I still donêt care. 
Leonard,"Hey, Lesley."
Leonard,Brrrr. Why are you smashing a flash frozen banana.
Leonard,So anyway  Hello.
Leonard,Just extending the intimacy. Do you want to slip over to the radiation lab and share a decontamination shower?
Leonard,"Iêm not sure, but I think Iêm about to discover how the banana felt. "
Leonard,Who wouldnêt? 
Leonard,"Yeah, well, Iêm just glad to be a part of it. So what happens now?"
Leonard,Oh. Okay. Thank you.
Leonard,You want to make plans for New Years.
Howard,"Hey, look, itês Doctor Stud!"
Leonard,Doctor what?
Howard,The blogosphere is a-buzzing with news of you and Lesley Winkle making eine kleine bang-bang music. 
Leonard,WhaÑ how did it get on the internet?
Howard,I put it there. 
Leonard,"Well, how did you know about it?"
Raj,A little bird told us. Apparently you are a magnificent beast. 
Leonard,"Well, that partês true! "
Sheldon,"You know, I think I may have misjudged this restaurant. "
Leonard,No kidding.
Sheldon,"I wonêt go out on a limb, but I think we may be looking at my new Tuesday hamburger. "
Leonard,Your old Tuesday hamburger will be so broken hearted. 
Sheldon,"Way ahead of you. I was thinking of moving Big Boy to Thursdays, and just dropping Soup Plantation. "
Sheldon,"Yeah, the name always confused me anyway, Soup Plantation. You canêt grow soup. "
Penny,"So, howês everything. "
Sheldon,"Terrific, youêll be happy to know that I plan to come here every Tuesday night for the foreseeable future."
Penny,"Really, oh yay!"
Sheldon,Who do I speak to about permanently reserving this table? 
Penny,"Um, I donêt know, a psychiatrist? So hey, how are things with you and Lesley? "
Leonard,"Oh, to be honest, I donêt think itês going to work out. "
Penny,"Oh, oh thatês too bad. Well hey, donêt worry, Iêm sure there is someone out there who is just right for you. ."
Leonard,Well what did she mean by that? Was that just a generic platitude or was that a subtle bid for attention? 
Sheldon,You know why this hamburger surpasses the Big Boy? This is a single decker hamburger whereas the Big Boy is a double decker. This has a much more satisfying meat to bun to condiment ratio. 
Leonard,Are you even listening to me?
Sheldon,"Of course Iêm listening. Blah blah, hopeless Penny delusion, blah blah blah."
Leonard,"Okay then. You know, you can grow the ingredients for soup. . "
Raj,"Okay, if no-one else will say it, I will. We really suck at paintball."
Howard,That was absolutely humiliating.
Leonard,"Oh, come on, some battles you win, some battles you lose."
Howard,"Yes, but you donêt have to lose to Kyle Bernsteinês Bar-Mitzvah party. "
Leonard,"I think we have to acknowledge, those were some fairly savage pre-adolescent Jews. "
Sheldon,"You know, we were annihilated by our own incompetence and the inability of some people to follow the chain of command. "
Leonard,"Sheldon, let it go."
Sheldon,"No, I want to talk about the fact that Wolowitz shot me in the back. "
Howard,"I shot you for good reason, you were leading us into disaster. "
Sheldon,"I was giving clear, concise orders. "
Leonard,"You hid behind a tree yelling _get the kid in the yarmulkah, get the kid in the yarmulkah.î"
Penny,"Oh, hey guys."
Leonard,Hello Penny.
Howard,Morning maêam. 
Penny,"So, how was paintball, did you have fun?"
Sheldon,"Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun.  You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry."
Penny,"Okay, um, oh hey, Iêm having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by."
Leonard,A party? 
Howard,A boy-girl party?
Penny,"Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, itêll just be a bunch of my friends, weêll have some beer, do a little dancingÑ"
Leonard,"Yeah, I donêt know, PennyÑ"
Sheldon,"The thing is, weêre notÑ."
Leonard,Weêre really moreÑ.
Leonard,"But thanks, thanks for thinking of us."
Penny,"Are you sure? Come on, itês Halloween."
Sheldon,A Halloween party?
Howard,"As in, costumes? "
Penny,"Well, yeah. "
Leonard,Is there a theme?
Penny,"Um, yeah, Halloween."
Sheldon,"Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific? "
Penny,"As usual, Iêm not following."
Leonard,"Heês asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasyÑ"
Sheldon,What about comic-books?
Penny,Of course.
Sheldon,"TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse GodsÑ"
Penny,"Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye. "
Howard,"Gentlemen, to the sewing machines."
Leonard,"Oh, no. "
Sheldon,Oh no! 
Raj,Make way for the fastest man alive.  Oh no!
Sheldon,"See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting. "
Leonard,"We all have other costumes, we can change."
Raj,"Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast. "
Howard,"No, no, no, itês a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo. "
Leonard,"Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed?"
Leonard,I call Frodo!
Raj,"Hey. Sorry Iêm late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus."
Leonard,You went with Thor?
Raj,"Just because Iêm Indian I canêt be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. Thatês racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, heês not English, but heês dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon is neither sound nor light, but heês obviously the Doppler Effect. "
Howard,"Iêm not Peter Pan, Iêm Robin Hood. "
Raj,"Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and youêre dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but itês basically the same look, man. "
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, thereês something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party."
Sheldon,"I donêt care if anybody gets it, Iêm going as the Doppler Effect. "
Leonard,"No, itês notÑ"
Sheldon,"If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!"
Leonard,"Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight. "
Sheldon,"Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?"
Leonard,"For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey. "
Sheldon,"Well, thereês nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting. "
Leonard,All Iêm saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend andÑ perhaps more. I donêt want to look like a dork. 
Howard,"Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky Iêve got a dozen condoms in my quiver. "
Penny,"Oh, hey guys. "
Leonard,"Hey, sorry weêre late. "
Penny,Late? Itês 7:05.
Sheldon,And you said the party starts at seven. 
Penny,"Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven. "
Sheldon,Itês 7:05. 
Penny,"Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in. "
Howard,are all the girls in the bathroom?
Penny,"Probably, but in their own homes. "
Sheldon,So what time does the costume parade start? 
Penny,The parade?
Sheldon,"Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle."
Penny,"Oh, Sheldon, Iêm sorry but there arenêt going to be any parades or judges or prizes. "
Sheldon,This party is just going to suck. 
Penny,"No, come on, itês going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, thatês so cute."
Leonard,"Actually, Penny, heês RobÑ"
Howard,Iêm Peter Pan! And Iêve got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it. 
Penny,"No you donêt. Oh, hey, whatês Sheldon supposed to be."
Leonard,"Oh, heês the Doppler Effect."
Sheldon,Yes. Itês the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. 
Penny,"Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, Iêve got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable. "
Leonard,Okay. 
Sheldon,"See, people get it. "
Raj,"Mmmm, by Odinês beard, this is good Chex Mix. "
Howard,"No thanks, peanuts, I canêt afford to swell up in these tights. "
Sheldon,"Iêm confused. If thereês no costume parade, what are we doing here? "
Leonard,Weêre socialising. Meeting new people. 
Penny,"Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!"
Raj,"Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berryês."
Leonard,"Sheês not Catwoman, sheês just a generic cat."
Sheldon,And thatês the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.
Howard,"Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe itês time for me to turn my head and cough. "
Raj,What is your move?
Howard,"Iêm going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously sheês thinking weêre in sync, we belong together."
Leonard,Where do you get this stuff?
Howard,"You know, psychology journals, internet research, and thereês this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls. "
Raj,"Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men. "
Howard,"If thatês a working stethoscope, maybe youêd like to hear my heart skip a beat."
Howard,"No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia."
Leonard,"I  want to get to know Pennyês friends, I just, I donêt know how to talk to these people. "
Sheldon,"Well, I actually might be able to help."
Leonard,How so?
Sheldon,"Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will. "
Leonard,Go on.
Sheldon,"Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting _How wasted am I?î which is met with an approving chorus of _Dude.î"
Leonard,Then what happens?
Sheldon,Thatês as far as Iêve gotten.
Leonard,"This is ridiculous, Iêm jumping in."
Sheldon,Good luck. 
Leonard,"No, youêre coming with me."
Sheldon,"Oh, I hardly think so. "
Leonard,Come on.
Sheldon,Arenêt you afraid Iêll embarrass you?
Leonard,Yes. But I need a wing-man.
Sheldon,"Alright, but if weêre going to use flight metaphors Iêm much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing wreckage. "
Sheldon,Me? Iêll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!
Sheldon,Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!
Sheldon,Iêm the Doppler Effect. 
Leonard,Why donêt you just tell people youêre a zebra?
Sheldon,"Well, why donêt you just tell people youêre one of the seven dwarves. "
Leonard,Because Iêm Frodo.
Sheldon,"Yes, well, Iêm the Doppler Effect. "
Leonard,Oh no.
Leonard,Thatês Pennyês ex-boyfriend.
Sheldon,What do you suppose heês doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field. 
Leonard,"If he were any bigger, heêd have moons orbiting him."
Sheldon,"Oh, snap. So I guess weêll be leaving now. "
Leonard,"Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesnêt even want him here. ."
Sheldon,You have a back-up hypothesis. 
Leonard,Maybe they just want to be friends. 
Sheldon,"Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more. "
Leonard,Then he and I are on equal ground.
Sheldon,"Yes, but youêre much closer to it than he is. "
Leonard,"Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners."
Sheldon,"And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy. "
Leonard,"Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldnêt have to back down. "
Sheldon,True. Why donêt you text him that and see if he backs down?
Leonard,Iêm going to assert my dominance face to face. 
Sheldon,"Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?"
Leonard,Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.
Penny,"Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?"
Sheldon,"Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system. "
Sheldon,Yet another child left behind. 
Leonard,"No, Iêm a Hobbit."
Leonard,"Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior. "
Sheldon,"Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash. "
Leonard,I think weêre all talking to Penny here.
Sheldon,Iêm not. No offence. 
Penny,"Alright Kurt, be nice."
Leonard,"Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you canêt compete with me on an intellectual level and so youêre driven to animalistic puffery. "
Penny,"Of course not, no, heês not, youêre not, right Leonard? "
Leonard,"No, I said animalistic. Of course weêre all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree. "
Sheldon,"If he understands that, youêre in trouble. "
Sheldon,Youêre in trouble. 
Penny,"Okay, Kurt, please."
Leonard,"No, Penny, itês okay, I can handle this. Iêm not a dwarf, Iêm a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?"
Leonard,A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?
Leonard,I think Iêve made my point.
Sheldon,"Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless. "
Leonard,"Thereês not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation."
Penny,"Kurt, put him down this instant. "
Penny,"I donêt care, Iêm finishing it, put him down. "
Sheldon,Heês a Hobbit! Iêve got your back. 
Penny,"Leonard, are you okay."
Leonard,"Yeah, no, Iêm fine. Itês good, itês a good party, thanks for having us, itês just getting a little late soÑ."
Penny,"Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming. "
Sheldon,"Happy Halloween.  If itês any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place. "
Leonard,Whatês that?
Sheldon,Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?
Sheldon,Good. There there was really all I had. 
Leonard,Good night Sheldon.
Sheldon,Good night Leonard. 
Penny,Hey Leonard.
Leonard,Hi Penny.
Penny,"Hey, I just wanted to make sure youêre okay."
Leonard,Iêm fine. 
Penny,Iêm so sorry about what happened.
Leonard,Itês not your fault.
Penny,"Yes it is. Thatês why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that. "
Leonard,So why was he at your party?
Penny,"Well, I ran into him last week and, he wasÑ  just, all apologetic, about how heês changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and Iêm an idiot because I always believe guys like that andÑ I canêt go back to my party because heês there, and I know you donêt want to hear this and Iêm upset and Iêm really drunk and I just want toÑ "
Leonard,There there. 
Penny,"God, what is wrong with me."
Leonard,"Nothing, youêre perfect."
Penny,"Gah, Iêm not perfect."
Leonard,Yes you are. 
Penny,"You really think so, donêt you? "
Leonard,How much have you had to drink tonight?
Penny,JustÑ. a lot. 
Leonard,"Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesnêt have something to do with whatês going on here?"
Penny,"It might. Boy, youêre really smart."
Leonard,"Yeah, Iêm a frickinê genius. "
Penny,"Leonard, you are so great. Why canêt all guys be like you? "
Leonard,"Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldnêt survive. "
Penny,I should probably go.
Leonard,Probably. 
Leonard,"Thatês right, you saw what you saw. Thatês how we roll in The Shire. "
Sheldon,Coming. 
Howard,"Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?"
Sheldon,Heês not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him. 
Howard,"Heês not the Marvel comic story, heês the original Norse God. "
Sheldon,Thank you for the clarification. 
Howard,Iêm supposed to give him a ride home.
Sheldon,Well Iêm sure heêll be fine. He has his hammer. 
Howard,"Watch this, itês really cool. Call Leonard Hofstadter."
Howard,Call Leonard Hofstadter.
Leonard,"Here, let me try. Call McFlono McFloonyloo. Heh-heh. "
Raj,"Oh, thatês very impressive. And a little racist. "
Sheldon,"If weêre all through playing mock the flawed technology, can we get on with Halo night, we were supposed to start at eight, it is now 8:06."
Leonard,So? Weêll start now.
Sheldon,"Yes, first we have to decide if those lost six minutes will be coming out of game time, bathroom time or the pizza break."
Raj,"We can split it two, two and two."
Howard,If weêre having anchovies on the pizza we canêt take it out of bathroom time. 
Sheldon,"Oh, what fresh hell is this?"
Leonard,"Hey Penny, come on in."
Penny,Hey guys. 
Howard,"See a Penny, pick her up, and all the day youêll have good luck."
Penny,"No you wonêt. Uh, can I hide out here for a while."
Leonard,Sure. Whatês going on.
Penny,"Well, thereês this girl I know from back in Nebraska, Christie, well anyway she called me up and sheês like _Hey, howês California,î and Iêm like _Awesomeî ‚cos, you know, itês not Nebraska, and the next thing I know sheês invited herself out here to stay with me. "
Penny,"Anyway, she got here today, and sheês just been in my apartment, yakkety-yakking about every guy sheês slept with in Omaha, which is basically every guy in Omaha, and washing the sluttiest collection of underwear you have ever seen in my bathroom sink."
Howard,"Well, is she doing it one thong at a time, or does she just throw it all in, like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse."
Penny,He really needs to dial it down.
Leonard,"So, if you donêt like this Christie, why are you letting her stay? "
Penny,"Well, she was engaged to my cousin while she was sleeping with my brother, so sheês kind of family. "
Sheldon,"You know, I apologise for my earlier outburst, who needs Halo when we can be regaled with the delightfully folksy tale of the whore of Omaha?"
Leonard,"Oh, I donêt think sheês a whore."
Penny,"No, yeah sheês definitely a whore. I mean, she has absolutely no standards, this one time, she was atÑ whereês Howard?"
Howard,"Bonjour mademoiselle, I understand youêre new in town. "
Sheldon,Oh good grief.
Penny,"Ugh, I cannot believe Christie let Howard into my apartment.    "
Sheldon,"And I cannot believe people pay for horoscopes, but on a more serious note itês 8:13 and weêre still not playing Halo. "
Leonard,"Okay, fine, weêll just play one on one until he gets back. "
Sheldon,"One on one? We donêt play one on one, we play teams, not one on one. One on one!"
Leonard,Well the only way we can play teams at this point is if we cut Raj in half.
Raj,"Oh, sure, cut the foreigner in half, thereês a billion more where he came from. "
Penny,"Hey, if you guys need a fourth, Iêll play."
Leonard,Great idea.
Sheldon,"Uh, no. The wheel was a great idea. Relativity was a great idea. This is a notion, and a rather sucky one at that. "
Sheldon,"Why? Oh, Penny, Penny, Penny."
Penny,"Oh, what, what, what? "
Sheldon,"This is a complex battle simulation with a steep learning curve, there are myriad weapons, vehicles and strategies to master, not to mention an extremely intricate back-story."
Penny,"Oh cool, whose head did I just blow off? "
Sheldon,Mine. 
Penny,"Okay, I got this, lock and load boys. "
Leonard,Itês the only way we can play teams. 
Sheldon,"Yes, but whoeverês her partner will be hamstrung by her lack of experience and not to mention that fact that shÑ. "
Penny,"Ha-ha, there goes your head again."
Sheldon,"Okay, this isnêt at all good sportsmanship to shoot somebody whoês just respawned, you need to give them a chance to  now come on!"
Sheldon,"Raj, Raj, sheês got me cornered, cover me."
Penny,"Cover this, suckers. Ha-ha-ha!"
Leonard,"Penny, you are on fire."
Penny,"Yeah, so is Sheldon. "
Sheldon,"Okay, thatês it, I donêt know how, but she is cheating. No-one can be that attractive and be this skilled at a video game. "
Penny,"Wait, wait, Sheldon, come back, you forgot something. "
Penny,"This plasma grenade.  Ha! Look, itês raining you! "
Sheldon,"You laugh now, you just wait until you need tech support. "
Penny,"Gosh, heês kind of a sore loser, isnêt he?"
Leonard,"Well, to be fair, he is also a rather unpleasant winner. "
Penny,"Well, itês been fun."
Leonard,"You know, Penny, we make such a good team, maybe we could enter a couple of Halo tournaments sometime."
Penny,Or we could just have a life. 
Leonard,I guess for you thatês an option.
Penny,"Good night, Leonard."
Leonard,Good night.
Penny,"As usual, nice talking to you Raj  "
Raj,What do you suppose she meant by that?
Leonard,"Sheês an enigma, Raj. "
Sheldon,"And another thing, thereês a certain ethic to the game, Penny, a well estabÑ"
Leonard,"Sheês gone, Sheldon. "
Sheldon,Well she could have said goodbye. 
Penny,"Okay, I have a problem."
Sheldon,"Itês called carpal tunnel syndrome, and quite frankly you deserve it. "
Leonard,Whatês wrong?
Penny,"Um, well, Howard and Christie areÑ kind ofÑ hooking up in my bedroom. "
Leonard,Are you sure?
Penny,"Look, I grew up on a farm, okay, from what I heard theyêre either having sex or Howardês caught in a milking machine. Do you mind if I stay here tonight?"
Leonard,"No, take the couch, or my bed, I just got new pillows, hypo-allergenics. "
Penny,"Uh, the couch is good."
Sheldon,"Hold that thought, Leonard, a moment."
Leonard,"Let me guess, you have a problem with this."
Sheldon,Where do I begin? 
Leonard,"Itês up to you, crazy personês choice. "
Sheldon,"Well first, we donêt have house guests, frankly if I could afford the rent Iêd ask you to leave. "
Leonard,"Your friendship means a lot to me as well, what else? "
Sheldon,"Well, our earthquake supplies, we have a two day, two man kit."
Leonard,So? 
Sheldon,"So, if there is an earthquake and the three of us are trapped here, we could be out of food by tomorrow afternoon. "
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, are you suggesting that if we let Penny stay we might succumb to cannibalism?"
Sheldon,No-one ever thinks it will happen until it does. 
Leonard,"Penny, if you promise not to chew the flesh off our bones while we sleep, you can stay. "
Penny,Hu.. what?
Sheldon,"Heês engaging in reductio-ad-absurdum. Itês the logical fallacy of extending someoneês argument to ridiculous proportions and then criticising the result, and I do not appreciate it. "
Leonard,Iêll get you a blanket and a pillow. 
Sheldon,"Okay, well since Iêm obviously being ignored here, letês go over the morning schedule, I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20, plan your ablutions and bodily functions accordingly. "
Penny,How am I supposed to plan my bodily functions?
Sheldon,I suggest no liquids after 11pm. 
Leonard,Here you go.
Penny,Thanks Leonard. 
Sheldon,"Hmmph, wrong. "
Penny,Iêm listening.
Sheldon,Your head goes on the other end.
Sheldon,"Itês culturally universal, a bed, even a temporary bed, is always oriented with the headboard away from the door. It serves the ancient imperative of protecting oneself against marauders."
Penny,Iêll risk it.
Penny,Anything else I should know.
Sheldon,Yes. If you use my toothbrush Iêll jump out that window. Please donêt come to my funeral. Have a good night. 
Leonard,Sorry about that.
Penny,Thatês okay. 
Leonard,"FYI, his toothbrush is the red one in the plexiglass case under the UV light. "
Penny,Got it.
Leonard,"Well, sleep tight."
Leonard,"Funny expression, sleep tight. It refers to the early construction of beds which featured a mattress suspended on interlocking ropes which would occasionallyÑ sleep tight. "
Leonard,What are you doing? 
Sheldon,"Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cereal, added a quarter cup of 2% milk, sat on this end of this couch, turned on BBC America and watched Doctor Who. "
Leonard,Pennyês still sleeping.
Sheldon,"Every Saturday since we have lived in this apartment, I have awakened at 6:15, poured myself a bowl of cerealÑ."
Leonard,"I know, I know, look, you have a TV in your room, why donêt you just have breakfast in bed? "
Sheldon,Because I am neither an invalid nor a woman celebrating Motherês Day. 
Penny,"Uh, what time is it?"
Leonard,Almost 6:30. 
Penny,I slept all day?
Leonard,"Oh, no, itês 6:30 in the morning."
Penny,What the hell is your problem?
Sheldon,"Okay, this cereal has lost all its molecular integrity, I now have a bowl of shredded wheat paste."
Howard,"Ola, nerd-migos. "
Penny,Why do you people hate sleep? Are you wearing my robe?
Howard,"Oh, yeah, sorry, Iêll have it cleaned."
Penny,"Thatês okay, keep it. Whereês Christie."
Howard,"In the shower. Oh, by the way, where did you get that loofah mitt, yours reaches places that mine just wonêt."
Penny,Y-you used my loofah?
Howard,More precisely we used your loofah. I exfoliated her brains out! 
Penny,You can keep that too.
Howard,"Ah, well then weêll probably need to talk about your stuffed bear collection."
Howard,In here my lady.
Howard,chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka-chka .
Sheldon,Well thereês one beloved childrenês book Iêll never read again.
Sheldon,Iêm Sheldon.
Penny,"Uh, so Christie, what are your plans?"
Penny,"Yeah, no, I meant plans to find some place to live. Other than with me, not that I donêt love having you, but itêsÑ a little crowded."
Leonard,"Penny, youêre always welcome to stay with us."
Sheldon,"Oh, terrific, now weêre running a cute little B&B."
Howard,"Let me offer a little outside the box thinking here, why doesnêt Christie stay with me."
Leonard,For one thing you live with your mother.
Howard,"I do not, my mother lives with me. "
Sheldon,"Well then, itês all settled, Christie will stay with Howard, Penny can go back to her apartment, and Iêll watch the last 24 minutes of Doctor Who, although at this point itês more like Doctor Why Bother. "
Leonard,Sheldon you just canêt dictateÑ
Sheldon,"No more talking, everybody go. "
Howard,"So, what do you say, you wanna repair to Castle Wolowitz? "
Howard,"Iêm sorry, I should have mentioned this earlier, my last name is Wolowitz."
Sheldon,I imagine there arenêt many kosher corn-huskers. 
Howard,Anything you want.
Howard,When they perfect human cloning Iêm going to order twelve of those.
Leonard,"Howard, canêt you see sheês using you?"
Howard,"Who cares, last night she pulled off her blouse and I wept!"
Penny,"Look, Howard, I know her, okay, sheêll have sex with anyone as long as they keep buying her things. "
Howard,"Yay! If youêll excuse me, I have some Bar-Mizvah bonds to cash. "
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, we cannot do this without Wolowitz."
Leonard,We canêt order Chinese food without Wolowitz?
Sheldon,"Let me walk you through it, our standard is, the steamed dumpling appetizer, General Soês chicken, beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lo-main. Do you see the problem?"
Leonard,I see a problem. 
Sheldon,Our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four entrees divided among four people. 
Leonard,"So, weêll just order three entrees."
Sheldon,"Fine, what do you want to eliminate, and who gets the extra dumpling. "
Raj,We could cut it into thirds. 
Sheldon,"Then it is no longer a dumpling, once you cut it open it is at best a very small open faced sandwich. "
Sheldon,"Heês putting his needs ahead of the collective good.  Where he comes from, thatês punishable by death."
Leonard,"Can we get an order of dumplings, but with three instead of four."
Leonard,"This isnêt a substitution, itês a reduction. "
Leonard,"Fine, bring us three orders of dumplings, thatês twelve, weêll each have four. "
Raj,That works. 
Sheldon,"No, if we fill up on dumplings weêll need to eliminate another entree. "
Leonard,"If we have extra, weêll just take the leftovers home."
Sheldon,"And divide it how, Iêm telling you we cannot do this without Wolowitz. "
Leonard,"Wolowitz is with his new girlfriend, if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth."
Sheldon,"Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food, she uses a fork, and she double dips her egg rolls. "
Leonard,We donêt order egg rolls.
Sheldon,"Exactly, but weêd have to if she was here."
Raj,"Can we please make a decision, not only are there children starving in India, thereês an Indian starving right here. "
Leonard,"Hereês an idea, why donêt we just go out for Indian food."
Sheldon,Iêll know. 
Raj,How about soup?
Leonard,"Yeah, we can always divide soup."
Sheldon,What about the won-tons?
Penny,"Oh, hey guys, whatês up?"
Sheldon,Itês Halo night.
Penny,Yeah. Okay. So?
Leonard,"Well, with Wolowitz spending all of his time with your friend Christie, "
Penny,Sheês not my friend. Friends do not get their friends care bears all sweaty. 
Leonard,"Right, anyway, uh, with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere, we had something we wanted to ask you. Sheldon?"
Sheldon,"Yes. Penny, we would very much appreciate it if you would be the fourth member of our Halo team. I donêt think I need to tell you what an honour this is. "
Penny,"Oh, thatês so sweet. But Iêm going out dancing with a girlfriend. "
Sheldon,"You canêt go out, itês Halo night. "
Penny,"Well, for Penny itês dancing night. "
Sheldon,You go dancing every Wednesday.
Sheldon, Then itês not dancing night. 
Penny,"Look, why donêt I play with you guys tomorrow?"
Sheldon,"Tonight is Halo night, itês like talking to a wall. "
Penny,"Alright, now Sheldon, you and I are about to have a problem. "
Leonard,"Sheldon, remember, we role-played this."
Sheldon,"Yes, but you didnêt portray her as completely irrational."
Penny,"Alright fellas, I gotta go. Good luck. "
Leonard,Maybe we should have asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend. 
Sheldon,"Okay, assuming we could dance, which we canêt, there are three of us and two of them."
Sheldon,"Itês the Chinese restaurant all over again. I assure you that cutting a dumpling in thirds is childês play compared with three men, each attempting to dance with 67% of a woman."
Leonard,"Aaah, for Godês sake, Sheldon, you are driving me crazy. "
Sheldon,"Your angerês not with me, sir, but with basic mathematics."
Leonard,"No, Iêm pretty sure my angerês with you."
Raj,Whatês happening to us? Weêre falling apart. 
Leonard,Who are you calling?
Sheldon,The only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe.
Howard, Hi this is Howard Wolowitz.
Howard,We canêt get to the phone right now because weêre having sex.
Leonard,"Sheldon, think this through, youêre going to ask Howard to choose between sex and Halo."
Sheldon,"No, Iêm going to ask him to choose between sex and Halo 3. As far as I know, sex has not been upgraded to include high-def graphics and enhanced weapon systems. "
Leonard,"Youêre right, all sex has is nudity, orgasms and human contact. "
Sheldon,My point.
Howard,"Ladies, ladies, Iêm sure thereês a middle ground."
Howard,"You girlês talk, Iêm going to take my scooter out for a little spin. "
Howard,What are you guys doing here? 
Sheldon,Itês Halo night. 
Howard,"So, Halo night, huh? "
Raj,I thought she was the whore of Omaha?
Sheldon,Shhh! 
Howard,"Sheldon, you got him in your sights, fire, heês charging his plasma rifle. "
Sheldon,"I canêt shoot now, Iêm cloaking."
Leonard,"Now, Raj, kill Sheldon."
Raj,I canêt see him.
Sheldon,"Thatês why the call it cloaking, dead man."
Leonard,Well then start throwing grenades.
Raj,Iêm all out. 
Penny,"Hi guys, my friends and I got tired of dancing, so we came over to have sex with you. "
Leonard,"That will do, Raj, straight for the tank."
Sheldon,We said no tanks.
Raj,There are no rules in hell! 
Howard,"Son of a bitch, medpack, I need a medpack! "
Penny,Told yah! . 
Leonard,"Thereês a sniper, use your rocket launcher. "
Raj,"All Iêve got is a needler, and Iêm all out of ammo. "
Sheldon,And now youêre out of life. Why did you hit pause?
Leonard,I thought I heard something. 
Leonard,"No, never mind, alright, go. "
Sheldon,"Damn you, walletnook.com."
Sheldon,"The online description was completely misleading, they said eight slots plus removable ID, to any rational person that would mean room for nine cards, but they donêt tell you the removable ID takes up one slot, itês a nightmare. "
Leonard,"Okay, now, do you really need the honorary Justice League of America membership card?"
Sheldon,Itês been in every wallet Iêve owned since I was five. 
Sheldon,It says keep this on your person at all times.  Itês right here under Batmanês signature.
Raj,And this is Leonard and Sheldonês apartment. 
Howard,Guess whose parents just got broadband. 
Raj,"May I present, live from New Delhi, Dr and Mrs V. M. Koothrappali. "
Raj,Sorry papa.
Leonard,Hi! 
Raj,And over here is Sheldon.
Raj,He lives with Leonard. 
Raj,"No, no, not like Haroun and Tanweer."
Leonard,"Yeah, weêre not like Haroun and Tanweer!"
Raj,"Papa, please donêt start. "
Raj,"Okay, thatês my life, thatês my friends, good to see you, say goodbye."
Raj,What is it papa.
Howard,"Is it just me, or does webchatting with your clothes on seem a little pointless. "
Raj,The little fat girl that used to kick me in the samosas and call me untouchable.
Raj,Why did you do that?
Raj,"But Papa, Iêm not supposedÑ"
Raj,Spring wedding?
Raj,"If you donêt want to meddle, then why are you meddling."
Sheldon,"If I may, your parents probably donêt consider this meddling, while arranged marriages are no longer the norm, Indian parents continue to have a greater than average involvement in their childrenês lives."
Raj,Why are you telling me about my own culture? 
Sheldon,You seemed confused.
Raj,"Sorry, Mommy, Papa, but with all due respect I really canêt go throughÑ"
Raj,I donêt believe it.
Howard,"Neither do I. Doogie Howserês been off the air for like, twenty years. "
Leonard,"Actually, I read somewhere that itês one of the most popular programmes in India. "
Sheldon,It might speak to a cultural aspiration to have oneês children enter the medical profession. 
Leonard,I bet youêre right.
Howard,I bet they love Scrubs.
Sheldon,Whatês not to love?
Raj,"Excuse me, hello? My parents are trying to marry me off to a total stranger, what am I going to do?"
Sheldon,I suggest you go through with it.
Sheldon,"Romantic love as the basis for marriage has only existed since the nineteenth century. Up until then, arranged marriages were the norm, and it served society quite well."
Howard,Itês the entire premise of Fiddler on the Roof.
Leonard,"Iêm not a big fan of musicals, but I love that show. "
Howard,"Me too. Of course, it speaks to me culturally. "
Sheldon,"Understandable, but thereês a universality to that story which transcends ethnicity."
Howard,Letês not forget itês got some really catchy tunes.
Raj,"Okay, I know what Iêm going to do."
Raj,Find new friends. 
Howard,So who wants to rent Fiddler?
Sheldon,"No need, we have the special edition. "
Leonard,"Well, maybe we are like Haroun and Tanweer. "
Sheldon,"This is Dr Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I need to cancel my membership to the Planetarium. Yeah, well Iêm sorry too, but thereês just no room for you in my wallet. Yeah, I understand, but it was between you and the Museum of Natural History and, frankly, you donêt have dinosaurs. Well Iêll miss you too, bye bye. Okay, I know youêre texting about me, and Iêd really like you to stop."
Raj,"Oh dear, I am rightly and truly screwed. "
Leonard,"Hey, I thought you were finding new friends."
Raj,"Iêve got some feelers out. In the meantime, listen to this."
Raj,Can you believe how pushy she is?
Leonard,So donêt call her.
Raj,"If I donêt call her, I wonêt hear the end of it from my parents."
Leonard,So call her. 
Raj,"How can I call her, you know I canêt talk to women. "
Leonard,"Iêm done, anybody else?"
Howard,Give me the phone.
Howard,Just give it to me. 
Raj,What are you doing?
Howard,"Donêt worry, youêll thank me.  You may now thank me. "
Raj,"For what, making me sound like a Simpsons character? "
Howard,"Fine, next time make your own date."
Raj,I didnêt want to make this one.
Leonard,"Look on the bright side, she might turn out to be a nice, beautiful girl. "
Raj,"Great, then weêll get married, I wonêt be able to talk to her, and weêll spend the rest of our lives in total silence. "
Howard,Worked for my parents. 
Penny,Hi guys.
Leonard,"Oh, hey. "
Penny,I need some guinea pigs.
Sheldon,"Okay, thereês a lab animal supply company in Reseda you could try, but if your research is going to have human applications may I suggest white mice instead, their brain chemistry is far closer to ours. "
Penny,"I swear to God, Sheldon, one day Iêm going to get the hang of talking to you. "
Leonard,His momês been saying that for years. Whatês up?
Penny,"Well, I finally convinced the restaurant to give me a bar tending shift, so I need to practice making drinks."
Leonard,"Oh, great, well the key to acquiring proficiency in any task is repetition."
Sheldon,"With certain obvious exceptions. Suicide, for example. "
Penny,"So Leonard, how about it?"
Leonard,"Look, Penny, weêd love to help you, but Raj is going through some stuff right now. And besides, he doesnêt drink, soÑ  Really? Um, Raj is going through some stuff right now and heêd like to take up drinking. "
Penny,"Okay, here you go, Leonard, one tequila sunrise. "
Leonard,Thank you. This drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container. Thank you. 
Penny,"Okay, Raj, whatêll it be?  "
Leonard,Whatever you recommend.
Penny,"Uh, how about a grasshopper. I make a mean grasshopper. Okay? Good. Coming up. Sheldon, what are you going to have?"
Sheldon,Iêll have a diet coke.
Penny,"Okay, can you please order a cocktail, I need to practice mixing drinks."
Sheldon,Fine. Iêll have a virgin cuba libre. 
Penny,"Thatês, um, rum and coke without the rum."
Sheldon,"Yes, "
Penny,So coke.
Sheldon,Yes. And would you make it diet? 
Penny,Thereês a can in the fridge. 
Sheldon,A cuba libre traditionally comes in a tall glass with a lime wedge.
Penny,Then swim to Cuba.
Sheldon,Bartenders are supposed to have people skills. 
Penny,"Okay, Raj, here you go. Alright, whoês next?"
Howard,Iêd like to try a slippery nipple. 
Penny,"Okay, youêre cut off. Anybody need a refill?"
Raj,"Where did my life go, Penny? One day Iêm a carefree batchelor, and the next Iêm married and driving a minivan to peewee cricket matches in suburban New Delhi. "
Penny,AÑ are you talking to me?
Raj,"Is there another Penny here? I had such plans. I had dreams. I was going to be the Indira Gandhi of particle astro-physics. But with a penis, of course. "
Leonard,Itês amazing.
Raj,"Ever since I was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynaecologist like him. How can I be a gynaecologist, I can barely look a woman in the eye. You know what, Iêm not going to let my parents control my future any longer, itês time for a showdown. Somebody give me a computer with a webcam. "
Penny,"Okay, sweetie, I think thatês the grasshopper talking. "
Raj,And itês about to tell my parents that Iêm not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lalita Gupta. 
Penny,"Okay, calm down, no-one can make you get married. Why donêt you just meet this girl and, see what happens."
Raj,"Havenêt you been listening to me, I cannot talk to women."
Leonard,UmÑ Raj.
Howard,"No, no, letês see how long it takes him."
Penny,"Um, Raj, honey, you say you canêt talk to women butÑ youêve been talking to me."
Sheldon,And now weêll never know. 
Raj,"Youêre right. IÑ I am talking to you. Hello Penny, how are you?"
Penny,Iêm fine.
Raj,"Okay, now I just need to make sure I have a Lalita before I meet the grasshopper. Itês a sweet green miracle. "
Penny,"Okay, if youêre going to drink on this date just promise me you wonêt overdo it. "
Raj,Overdo what? Happiness? Freedom? This warm glow inside of me that promises everything is going to be all hunky donkey?
Penny,"Yeah, that. Uh, why donêt you bring her to my restaurant when Iêm tending the bar so I can keep an eye on you?"
Leonard,"Wait a minute, whatês the plan here? Letês say he meets her and he likes her and they get married, whatês he going to do, stay drunk for the rest of his life?"
Howard,Worked for my parents. 
Raj,I canêt believe Iêm sitting here next to little Lalita Gupta. 
Raj,"Little Lalita. Thatês kind of fun to say. Little Lalita, Little Lalita, Little Lalita, you should try it."
Raj,"You have lost so much weight! That must have been difficult for you because you were so, so fat! Do you remember?"
Raj,Of course you do. Who could forget being that fat? 
Raj,"So youêre a dental student? Hmm, are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate? Not as high as, say, air traffic controllers, but then there are far more dentists than air traffic controllers, so in pure numbers youêre still winning. "
Leonard,You have a drink thatêll make him less obnoxious?
Penny,Drinks do not work that way. 
Howard,"Iêd say he was doing fine, look at her, last girl my mom set me up with had a moustache and a vestigial tail. "
Sheldon,Sorry Iêm late.
Leonard,What happened?
Sheldon,"Nothing, I just really didnêt want to come. Virgin diet cuba libre please."
Sheldon,"In a tall glass, with a lime wedge."
Penny,"Oh, Iêll wedge it right in there. "
Sheldon,"So, howês Koothrappali dÑ. oh my Lord."
Sheldon,Thatês Princess Punchali. 
Leonard,Iêm pretty sure her nameês Lalita.
Sheldon,"No, no, Princess Punchali from The Monkey and the Princess. "
Howard,"Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online, but they wanted a credit card. "
Sheldon,Itês a childrenês story.
Howard,"Oh, no it isnêt. "
Sheldon,"When I was a little boy and got sick, which was most of the time, my mother would read it to me. Itês about an Indian princess who befriends a monkey, who was mocked by all the other monkeys because he was different. For some reason I related to it quite strongly. "
Penny,I know the reason. 
Leonard,"We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting at?"
Sheldon,That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Punchali in the book. How often does one see a beloved fictional character come to life?
Howard,"Every year at Comic Con. Every day at Disneyland you can hire Snow White to come to your house. Course they prefer it if you have a kid, butÑ "
Raj,"Hey guys. This is Lalita Gupta, Lalita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny. Isnêt it great, she isnêt fat any more! "
Sheldon,"Forgive me your highness, for I am but a monkey, and it is in my nature to climb. I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair."
Sheldon,You are the living embodiment of the beautiful Princess Punchali. 
Sheldon,A beloved character from an Indian folk tale. 
Sheldon,You Indian.
Sheldon,The resemblance is remarkable. I can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair. 
Sheldon,I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can. 
Raj,"But youêre a dentist, heês nuts. "
Sheldon,"It was said that the Gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars, and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her ruby lips. "
Raj,Back off Sheldon. 
Raj,If you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath.
Sheldon,Iêm not hitting on her.
Howard,And you have no wrath. 
Raj,You are my lady. Our parents said so. We are for all intents and purposes one hundred percent hooked up.
Sheldon,Exactly the kind of spirit with which Princess Punchali led the monkeys to freedom. 
Raj,"Oh, screw Princess Punchali."
Raj,But youêre not Princess Punchali.
Sheldon,"Luckily for you, she could have you beheaded."
Sheldon,I could eat. 
Raj,What just happened?
Leonard,Beats the hell out of me. 
Howard,"Iêll tell you what just happened, I just learned how to pick up Indian chicks. "
Raj,"Maybe you should keep your eye on the ball, Papa. "
Leonard,"Doctor and Mrs Koothrappali, in all fairness, it wasnêt entirely Rajês fault. "
Leonard,"No, Iêm Leonard. "
Raj,"But heês right, Papa, listen to him.  You! You are the one who ruined everything! "
Raj,"Go ahead, tell my parents why they wonêt have any grandchildren."
Sheldon,"How would I know, do you have a low sperm count?"
Raj,This has nothing to do with my sperm count.
Raj,Yes Mommy.
Raj,"Can we please stop talking about my testicles? Sheldon, tell them what you did."
Sheldon,What did I do? 
Leonard,You left with his date. Friends donêt do that to each other. 
Sheldon,"Oh. Alright, noted. Sorry."
Raj,Sorry? Thatês all you can say is sorry?
Leonard,"Take it, Raj. Itês more than Iêve ever gotten. "
Sheldon,And may I point out she wouldnêt have asked me to go with her if you hadnêt been drunk and boring. 
Sheldon,"And boring, her words. "
Raj,Iêm not an alcoholic.
Raj,"It was just this one time, Papa, I swear. "
Raj,"But Papa, pleaseÑ."
Raj,I have to go.   
Raj,Please wait until I get into the hall. 
Sheldon,"Okay, well, good night."
Leonard,Hold on. What happened with you and Lalita?
Sheldon,"We ate. She lectured me on the link between gum disease and heart attacks, nothing I didnêt already know, and I came home. "
Leonard,So youêre not going to see her again?
Sheldon,Why would I see her again? I already have a dentist. 
Leonard,I wonder whoês going to tell his parents theyêre not having grandchildren. 
Leonard,"I donêt believe it, whatês gotten into him? "
Penny,"Oh, maybe a couple of virgin cuba libres that turned out to be kind of slutty. "
Leonard,You didnêt?
Penny,"Hey, you do your experiments, I do mine. "
Leonard,"Okay, the X10s are online."
Howard,"Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal from this laptop through our local ISP, racing down fibre-optic cable at the speed of light to San Francisco, bouncing off a satellite in geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal, where the data packets will be handed off to submerged transatlantic cables terminating in Halifax, Nova-Scotia, and transferred across the continent via microwave relays back to our ISP and the X10 receiver attached to this . "
Sheldon,"Look at me, look at me, Iêve got goosebumps. "
Howard,Are we ready on the stereo? 
Raj,Go for stereo. 
Penny,Hey guys. 
Penny,Itês a little loud.
Howard,"No problem, turning it down.  et voila. "
Penny,"Okay, thanks."
Leonard,"Hang on, hang on, do you not realise what we just did."
Penny,"Yeah, you turned your stereo down with your laptop. "
Sheldon,"No, we turned our stereo down by sending a signal around the world via the internet. "
Penny,"Oh. You know you can just get one of those universal remotes at Radio Shack, theyêre really cheap."
Leonard,"No, no, no, you donêt get it, um, Howard, enable public access. "
Howard,Public access enabled. 
Penny,"Boy, thatês brilliant, but Iêll see you."
Leonard,"No, hang on, hang on.  See! "
Sheldon,"Someone in Sezchuan province, China is using his computer to turn our lights on and off. "
Penny,"Huh, well thatês handy. Um, hereês a question, why? "
Sheldon,They found the remote controlled cars.
Penny,"Well, wait, wait, whatês on top of them. "
Leonard,"Wireless webcams, wave hello. "
Howard,"The monster truck is out of Austin, Texas, and the blue Viper is being operated from suburban Tel Aviv. "
Sheldon,You may want to put on slacks. 
Penny," Ew, stop it, no, leave me alone. "
Leonard,Whoês running the red Corvette?
Howard,That would be me. 
Sheldon,"You know, in the future, when weêre disembodied brains in jars, weêre going to look back on this as eight hours well wasted. "
Raj,I donêt want to be in a jar. I want my brain in an android body. Eight feet tall and ripped. 
Howard,Iêm with you. I just have to make sure if Iêm a synthetic human Iêd still be Jewish. I promised my mother. 
Raj,I suppose you could have your android penis circumcised. But thatês something your Rabbi would have to discuss with the manufacturers. 
Sheldon,Not to mention youêd have to power down on Saturdays. 
Leonard,"Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash? "
Sheldon,"Well, thereês always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter, but Occamês Razor would suggest that someone threw it out. "
Leonard,Itês from the Institute for Experimental Physics. They want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bowes-Einstein condensates. 
Sheldon,I know. I read it before I threw it out. 
Leonard,"OkayÑ if I may drill down to the bedrock of my question, why did you throw it out."
Sheldon,"Because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgemental strangers, who wouldnêt recognise true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech. Which, if I were there, it would be. "
Howard,"I donêt know, Sheldon, those topical conferences on Bowes-Einstein condensates parties are legendary. "
Leonard,Forget the parties.
Howard,Forget the parties? What a nerd. 
Leonard,Are there any other honours Iêve gotten that I donêt know about? Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it?
Sheldon,"Leonard, please donêt take this the wrong way, but the day you win a Nobel Prize, is the day I begin my research on the drag co-efficient of tassles on flying carpets. "
Raj,Hoo-hoo-hoo. The only thing missing from that insult was _yo mamma.î 
Howard,"Iêve got one, hey Leonard, your mammaês research methodology is so flawedÑ."
Leonard,"Shut up, Howard. Sheldon, we have to do this."
Sheldon,"No we donêt. We have to take in nourishment, expel waste, and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying, everything else is optional. "
Leonard,"Okay, let me put it this way, Iêm doing it."
Sheldon,You canêt. Iêm the lead author. 
Leonard,"Oh, come on. The only reason youêre the lead author is because we went alphabetically. "
Sheldon,"I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I was throwing you a bone. Youêre welcome. "
Leonard,"Excuse me, I designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis. "
Sheldon,It doesnêt need proving. 
Leonard,So the entire scientific community is just supposed to take your word?
Sheldon,"Theyêre not supposed to, but they should. "
Leonard,"Alright, I donêt care what you say, Iêm going to the conference and Iêm presenting our findings. "
Sheldon,And I forbid it. 
Leonard,You forbid it?
Sheldon,If Iêm not taking credit for our work then nobody is. 
Leonard,"Oh, you admit that itês our work."
Sheldon,"No, once again, Iêm throwing you a bone. And once again, you are welcome. "
Howard,Oh no he ditênt!
Penny,"So, howês it going with Sheldon, are you guys still not talking to each other? "
Leonard,"Not only is he still not talking to me, but thereês this thing he does where he stares at you and tries to get your brain to explode. You know, like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners?  You know, bzzz-pchew! Never mind. How about this one. It says, _I know my physics, but Iêm still a fun guy!î"
Penny,"Oh, hey, I didnêt know they still made corduroy suits!"
Leonard,"They donêt, thatês why I saved this one. "
Penny,"Okay, well, letês just see what else you have. Okay, here, take this, and this, and this, and these."
Leonard,Is this all stuff you want me to try on?
Penny,"No, this is stuff I want you to throw out. "
Penny,"Seriously, donêt even give it to charity, you wonêt be helping anyone. Whatês this."
Leonard,"Oh, thatês the bottled city of Kandor. "
Penny,Uh-huh. 
Leonard,"You see, Kandor was the capital city of the planet Krypton, it was miniaturised by Brainiac before Krypton exploded and then rescued by Superman. "
Penny,"Oh, nice. "
Leonard,Itês a lot cooler when girls arenêt looking at it.
Penny,"Here, why donêt you put these on while I find a shirt and sport-coat to match. "
Leonard,"Great, be right back."
Penny,"Well, where you going, just put them on. "
Penny,"Oh, are you shy? "
Leonard,"No, Iêm not shy."
Penny,"Donêt worry, I wonêt look. "
Leonard,"I know you wonêt look, why would you look, thereês nothing to see, well, not nothingÑ."
Penny,"Sweetie, put the pants on."
Leonard,Putting them on.
Penny,"So, you know, isnêt there maybe some way you and Sheldon could compromise on this whole presentation thing."
Leonard,"Scientists do not compromise. Our minds are trained to synthesise facts and come to inarguable conclusions. Not to mention, Sheldon is batcrap crazy. "
Penny,What is this?
Leonard,"Oh, careful. Thatês my original series Battlestar Galactica flight suit. "
Penny,"Oh, why didnêt you wear it at Halloween?"
Leonard,"Because itês not a costume, itês a flight suit. "
Penny,"Okay, alright, moving on, oh, wow, a paisley shirt."
Leonard,"Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit. "
Penny,"If you mean it should end up in the same place then, I agree. Is this yourÑ your only tie?"
Leonard,"Ah. Technically yes, but, if youêll notice, itês reversible. So it works as two. "
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, I donêt think it even works as one. Is this all your clothes?"
Leonard,Yeah. Everything since the eighth grade. 
Penny,TheÑ the eighth grade?
Leonard,My last growth spurt. 
Penny,"Okay, well, I guess weêre back to the corduroy suit. "
Penny,"Yup.  I said no, put it down. "
Penny,Hey Sheldon! 
Sheldon,Hello Penny.  
Penny,Get anything good? 
Sheldon,"Uh, just the latest copy of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly."
Penny,"Oh, you know, that is so weird that yours came and mine didnêt.  Yup, tip your waitresses, Iêm here all week. "
Sheldon,"Penny, just to save you from further awkwardness know that Iêm perfectly comfortable with the two of us climbing the stairs in silence. "
Penny,"Oh yeah, me too. Zip it, lock it.  Put it in your pocket. So you and LeonardÑ"
Sheldon,Oh dear God! 
Penny,"Little misunderstanding, huh. "
Sheldon,A little misunderÑ. Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding.
Penny,"Anyway, I was talking to Leonard this morning and I think he feels really bad about it. "
Penny,Well how do you feel?
Sheldon,I donêt understand the question.
Penny,Well Iêm just asking if itês difficult to be fighting with your best friend. 
Sheldon,Oh. I hadnêt thought about it like that. I wonder if Iêve been experiencing physiological manifestations of some sort of unconscious emotional turmoil. 
Penny,WaitÑ what? 
Sheldon,I couldnêt poop this morning. 
Penny,"You should just talk to him, Iêm sure you guys can work this out. "
Sheldon,Itês certainly preferable to my plan.
Penny,Which was? 
Sheldon,A powerful laxative. 
Penny,"Okay, so you absolutely should talk to him, look, I know Leonard values you as a friend, and he told me himself that without your little idea thereês no way he could have come up with this whole experiment thing."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, little idea? "
Penny,"Yeah, I mean he tried to explain it to me, I didnêt really understand it butÑ"
Sheldon,"Of course you didnêt, he said little idea? "
Penny,"Uh, well no, no, not inÑ not in those words."
Sheldon,"In what words then, exactly"
Penny,"Um, gee, the exact words arenêt writtenÑ itês more the spirit in which itês "
Sheldon,What did he say?
Penny,You had a lucky hunch. 
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, Iêve been thinking, instead of arguing about this why donêtÑ."
Sheldon,Donêt you ever speak to me again. 
Leonard,. 
Penny,"Uh, heÑ . "
Leonard,"Okay, Iêm leaving for the conference. "
Sheldon,Have fun presenting my lucky hunch. 
Leonard,Sheldon I didnêt mean it like that.
Sheldon,Then why did you say it.
Leonard,"I donêt know, I wasnêt choosing myÑ"
Sheldon,Were you trying to impress Penny?
Leonard,"No, no not at all. A little bit. "
Sheldon,Howêd that work out for you?
Penny,"Leonard, ready to go?"
Sheldon,"Libido 1, truth zero. "
Leonard,"Okay, Iêm going to ask you one more time, we did the work together, lets present the paper together."
Sheldon,"And Iêm telling you for the last time itês pandering, itês undignified and bite me. "
Leonard,Letês go.
Penny,Sheldon. 
Sheldon,"Goodbye Penny.  Oooh, one of these days, Pkshhhh!"
Penny,There you go. 
Leonard,"Youêre right, this side does look better. "
Penny,"No, no, I didnêt say better, I said less stained. "
Howard,"I just checked the house, thereês probably twenty, twenty-five people in there."
Leonard,Youêre kidding. 
Penny,Is that all?
Leonard,"All? In particle physics, twenty five is Woodstock. "
Penny,"Oh, well, then good!"
Leonard,"I wasnêt expecting such a crowd, Iêm a little nervous. "
Howard,"Itês okay, just open with a joke, youêll be fine. "
Leonard,"A joke. Okay. How about this, um, okay, uh thereês this farmer, and he has these chickens, but they wonêt lay any eggs. So, he calls a physicist to help. The physicist then does some calculations, and he says, um, I have a solution, but it only works with spherical chickens in a vacuum.  Right? "
Penny,"Oh, sorry, Iêve just, Iêve heard it before. "
Howard,"Letês roll. Hey, nice suit."
Leonard,"Itês a classic, right? "
Penny,I really should have brought my own car. 
Leonard,"So, in conclusion, the data show that at temperatures approaching absolute zero, the moment of inertia changes, and the solid becomes a super-solid, which clearly appears to be a previously unknown state of matter.  Are there any questions?"
Leonard,Any other questions?
Leonard,"I didnêt skip it, itês just an anecdote. Itês not science."
Sheldon,"Oh, I see, was the apple falling on Newtonês head, was that just an anecdote?"
Leonard,You are not Isaac Newton.
Sheldon,"No, no thatês true, gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple. "
Leonard,You cannot possibly be that arrogant.
Sheldon,"You continue to underestimate me, my good man. "
Leonard,"Look, if you werenêt happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me."
Sheldon,"As I have explained repeatedly, unlike you, I donêt need validation from lesser minds. No offence. "
Leonard,"Really, so why did you come?"
Sheldon,Because I knew youêd screw this up.
Leonard,I didnêt screw it up.
Sheldon,"Oh, please. I admit, that spherical chicken joke, that was hilarious. But it was straight downhill from there. "
Leonard,"Iêve had enough of your condescension. Maybe I didnêt go to college when I was eleven like you, maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16, but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room. No offense. And I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation."
Sheldon,So you admit that youêre an egotist?
Leonard,"Yes.  My name is Dr Leonard Hofstadter, and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you. But heês worse."
Sheldon,"Okay, that is it. "
Leonard,You cannot blow up my head with your mind. 
Sheldon,Then Iêll settle for an aneurysm. 
Leonard,Stop it.
Sheldon,"You hit me. You saw him, he hit me."
Leonard,You were trying to blow up my head.
Sheldon,So it was working.
Leonard,"It wasnêt, it was not, you are a nutcase."
Sheldon,"Oh weêll see about that , heads up you people in the front row, this is a splash zone."
Leonard,"Stop, stop it, quit it. "
Penny,Is this usually how these physics things go?
Howard,More often than youêd think.
Leonard,Vulcan nerve pinch!
Sheldon,You could have offered me a ride home. 
Leonard,Youêre lucky I didnêt run you over. 
Sheldon,"I really donêt understand what youêre so unhappy about, you begged me to come, I came, thereês just no pleasing you. "
Leonard,"Youêre right, Iêm the problem, Iêm the one that needs help. "
Sheldon,"Well thatês not much of an apology, but Iêll take it. "
Leonard,Excuse me. Is there anything youêd like to apologise for?
Sheldon,Yes. Iêm sorry I tried to blow up your head. It was uncalled for. 
Howard,You wonêt believe this.
Raj,Somebody got the whole thing on a cell phone and put it on youtube. 
Sheldon,"Now, who would do that?"
Howard,"That would be me. Hey, check it out, itês a featured video. . "
Leonard,Oh jeez. Is this suit really look that bad?
Sheldon,"Forget your suit, look at my arms waving, Iêm like a flamingo on Ritalin. "
Penny,"Howard, would you like to explain to me why your facebook page has a picture of me sleeping on your shoulder captioned _Me and my Girlfriend?î"
Howard,"Uh-oh, here comes _the talk.î "
Leonard,"See, the liquid metal Terminators were created in the future by Skynet, and Skynet was developed by Miles Dyson, but that future no longer exists, due to Dysonês death in Terminator 2."
Sheldon,"Okay, then riddle me this. Assuming all the good Terminators were originally evil Terminators created by Skynet but then reprogrammed by the future John Connor, why would Skynet, an artificial computer intelligence, bother to create a petite hot 17 year-old killer robot?"
Leonard,Skynet is kinky? I donêt know. 
Sheldon,Artificial intelligences do not have teen fetishes. 
Leonard,"Alright, oh wait, they use it to inÑ"
Sheldon,", too late, I win. "
Penny,Letês go-oh-oh Ou-oooo-ut tonight. I have to go-oh-oh-oh ou-ooooo-ut tonight. 
Leonard,What the hell is that? 
Sheldon,"I donêt know, but if cats could sing, theyêd hate it too. ."
Leonard,Oh we just had toÑ mail some letters and 
Penny,Youêll never guess what just happened.
Leonard,"Oh, I give up."
Sheldon,"I donêt guess. As a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation, although as Iêm saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot. "
Penny,What was that?
Leonard,"Believe it or not, personal growth. What happened?"
Penny,"Alright, remember when I auditioned for that workshop production of Rent, but I didnêt get it and I couldnêt figure out why?"
Sheldon,I have a conclusion based on an observation.
Leonard,No you donêt. No he doesnêt.
Penny,"Well, the girl they picked to play Mimi, she dropped out and they asked me to replace her. "
Leonard,"Oh, congratulations, what a lucky break."
Penny,"Itês not a big deal, just a one night showcase, but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so, you never know. "
Sheldon,I think I know.
Leonard,No you donêt. He doesnêt.
Penny,"Itês this Friday at eight, you guys want to come?"
Leonard,"BecauseÑ. uh, Friday, we are attending a symposium on molecular positronium."
Sheldon,I think thatês a week from Tuesday at six. 
Leonard,"No, itês this Friday, at eight. "
Penny,"Oh, too bad, well, I got to get to rehearsal, see you guys. "
Leonard,See you.  
Sheldon,You just lied to Penny.
Leonard,"Yes, I did. "
Sheldon,"And you did it so casually, no rapid breathing, no increase in perspiration."
Sheldon,"So, lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath. "
Leonard,"Sheldon, are you worried about your safety."
Sheldon,"No, I imagine if you were going to kill me youêd have done it a long time ago. "
Leonard,Thatês very true. 
Sheldon, LeonardÑ
Sheldon,I need to speak to you.
Leonard,Itês two oêclock in the morning
Sheldon,Itês important.
Leonard,I highly doubt that. Go away. . Are you still out there? 
Sheldon,Yes. 
Sheldon,"Youêre right, it can wait until morning. "
Leonard,"what, what, what, what? "
Sheldon,"Never mind. I clearly woke you up in the middle of a REM cycle, youêre in no state to talk."
Leonard,"Sheldon, what is it? "
Sheldon,Iêm uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny. 
Leonard,What was I supposed to say. 
Sheldon,You could have told her the truth.
Leonard,That would have hurt her feelings. 
Sheldon,Is that a relevant factor? 
Sheldon,Then I suppose you could have agreed to go. 
Leonard,And what would I have said afterwards? 
Sheldon,"I would suggest something to the effect of, singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you, and if you disagree, Iêd recommend you have a CAT scan, to look for a tumour pressing on the cognitive processing centre of your brain."
Leonard,"I couldnêt say that, I would have to say, you were terrific and I canêt wait to hear you sing again. "
Leonard,"Itês the social protocol, itês what you do when you have a friend whoês proud of something they really suck at. "
Sheldon,I was not aware of that. 
Leonard,Well now you are.
Sheldon,"Oh, alright. Leonard."
Sheldon,"When we played chess earlier, you were terrific and I canêt wait to play you again. Goodnight. "
Sheldon,Ñ.. 
Leonard,Oooaw. This would be so much easier if I were a violent sociopath.  What?
Sheldon,"I was analysing our lie, and I believe weêre in danger of Penny seeing through the ruse."
Sheldon,"Simple. If she were to log on to www.socalphysicsgroup.org/activities/other, click on upcoming events, scroll down to seminars, download the pdf schedule, and look for the seminar on molecular positronium, well then, bippidy-boppidy-boo, our pants are metaphorically on fire. "
Sheldon,"Well, sir, my trousers will not be igniting today. "
Sheldon, Good morning.
Penny,Do you have any idea what time it is? 
Sheldon,"Of course I do. My watch is linked to the atomic clock in Boulder, Colorado. Itês accurate to one tenth of a second. But as Iêm saying this it occurs to me that once again your question may have been rhetorical."
Penny,What do you want?
Sheldon,Remember how Leonard told you we couldnêt come to your performance because we were attending a symposium on molecular positronium?
Penny,I remember symposium.
Sheldon,"Yes, well, he lied."
Penny,"Wait, what?"
Sheldon,"He lied, and Iêm feeling very uncomfortable about it."
Penny,Well imagine how Iêm feeling. 
Sheldon,Hungry? Tired? Iêm sorry this really isnêt my strong suit. 
Leonard,"You told her I lied, why would you tell her I lied?"
Sheldon,To help you. 
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, Iêm not seeing the help."
Sheldon,"She was going to see through your lie eventually, so I told her that you were lying to protect me. "
Leonard,"Oh, Iêm getting a bad feeling. "
Sheldon,"Hunger? Indigestion, Iêm sorry Iêm really not very good at this. Anyway, Penny now believes that on Friday night, weêre going to participate in my cousin Leopoldês drug intervention. "
Leonard,Your cousin Leopold?
Sheldon,"Yea, who most people call Leo, but he also answers to Lee, remember that, itês important. "
Leonard,Whatês important?
Sheldon,"Details, Leonard, the success or failure of our deceitful enterprise turns on details. "
Leonard,Do you have a cousin Leopold.
Sheldon,"No, I made him up. I think youêd call him Lee. "
Leonard,"I donêt get it, I already told her a lie, why replace it with a different lie?"
Sheldon,"Well, first of all, your lie was laughably transparent, where mine is exquisitely convoluted. While you were sleeping I was weaving an un-unravelable web. "
Sheldon,"Yes, if she googles Leopold Houston sheêll find a facebook page, an online blog depicting his descent into drug use, and a desperate yet hopeful listing on e-harmony.com."
Leonard,"Okay, why would I go to a drug intervention for your cousing."
Sheldon,"Ah, because itês in Long Beach, and I donêt drive. "
Leonard,Weêre going to Long Beach?
Sheldon,"No, of course not, thereês no cousin Leo, thereês no intervention, focus Leonard."
Leonard,"Oh, come on!"
Sheldon,"We just leave the house on Friday night, and we return in the wee hours emotionally wrung out from the work of convincing Leo to go back into rehab."
Leonard,So he goes back into rehab?
Sheldon,"Yes, but, he can relapse if Penny ever invites us to go hear her sing again."
Leonard,You still told her I lied.
Sheldon,"For a noble purpose, to spare me the social embarrassment of having a drug-addled first cousin, which Iêm assuming is embarrassing, yes?"
Leonard,I donêt know. How am I supposed to remember all of this.
Sheldon,"Thatês the best part, you donêt have to, see I told Penny that you would be embarrassed, if you knew that she found out that you had lied, so sheês agreed to operate as if the original lie was still in force. "
Leonard,"So sheês expecting me to lie about going to a symposium in Pasadena, when in actuality weêre pretending to go to a drug intervention in Long Beach? "
Sheldon,Un-unravelable. 
Leonard,"Oh hey Penny, wow, look at you, all ready for your showcase, you look great."
Penny,Thanks. I just wanted to come by and wish you guys luck with your symposium. 
Leonard,"Oh, well, thankyou."
Penny,"You know, I got to tell you, a lot of friends would let their friend go alone, but thatês not who you are, you are the kind of guy who stands by a friend whenÑ when he has a symposium to go to. "
Leonard,I donêt know what to say. 
Penny,"Itês okay, Leonard "
Leonard,"Oh, okay, alright, good. "
Howard,"Oh boy, group hug."
Howard,Okay. So whatês up? 
Sheldon,"Well, uh, Penny is on her way to perform in a one night showcase production of Rent, which we are unable to attend because we are going to a symposium on molecular positronium, given by Dr Emile Farminfarmian."
Howard,"Wait a minute, Farminfarmian is speaking and youêre Bogarding the symposium. "
Leonard,"Howard, Iêm sorryÑ weêreÑ weêre"
Howard,"No, no, youêre quark-blocking us. "
Leonard,I donêt know what to say.
Leonard,"Howard, listenÑ"
Howard,"No, itês okay, itês your Millenium Falcon, you and Chewbacca do whatever you want to do. Me and Princess Leia here will find some other way to spend the evening. "
Penny,"Howard, wait. Sheldon, I think we should tell them."
Sheldon,"Okay, sure. I donêt see a problem with that. "
Penny,"Thereês no symposium, Leonard lied to me, isnêt that right Leonard. "
Leonard,WellÑ I donêt know what to say. 
Penny,"Itês okay, I do, look, Leonard is helping Sheldon through a family crisis, he made up the whole story about the symposium with Dr Farmin..farmÑian"
Sheldon,Good for you. 
Penny,"Hah, yeah! Because he didnêt want Sheldon to be embarrassed, and there is nothing to be embarrassed okay, every family in America has a relative holed up in a garage somewhere huffing paint thinner."
Howard,"No, Iêm lost too, I think she skipped a step. "
Penny,"No, look, Sheldonês cousin Leo escaped rehab, and heês in a Motel 8 at Long Beach, the whole familyês going out for an intervention. Leonard is driving Sheldon down there to help him through this because heês such a good man."
Leonard,"Oh, another hug, thank you."
Penny,"Alright you guys, good luck."
Leonard,Thanks Penny. 
Howard,"Yeah, uh, break a leg."
Sheldon,Break a leg. 
Howard,"So, road trip to Long Beach."
Leonard,"No, weêre not going to Long Beach."
Raj,Why not? 
Leonard,Because Sheldon doesnêt have a drug addicted cousin Leopold. 
Raj,"Oh, too bad. Iêve always wanted to go to Long Beach. "
Sheldon,"Itês a very nice community. The Queen Mary is docked there, once the largest ocean liner in the world, itês now a hotel and restaurant where they host a surprisingly gripping murder mystery dinner. "
Raj,Sounds fun.
Howard,Iêm game.
Sheldon,"No, no, no, Leonard gets nauseous unless he sits in front, and even then itês iffy."
Leonard,"Wait, are we really going to Long Beach? "
Sheldon, LeonardÑ
Leonard,"Let it go, Sheldon, the murderer was the first mate whether it makes sense to you or not. "
Sheldon,"No, thatês the least of our worries. Iêve been doing some research on addiction, both the biochemical and behavioural aspects, and I think thereês a problem with the current version of our lie. "
Leonard,"What are you talking about, itês fine, she bought it, itês over. "
Sheldon,"Sadly, itês not. Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle, but beyond that I have realised that the Leo I described would not have agreed to go to rehab."
Leonard,Why not? 
Sheldon,Because Leo is a middle child. 
Leonard,"There is no Leo, how can you say that? "
Sheldon,"You didnêt read the bio, did you? Heês not just a middle child, heês the quintessential middle child, from a broken home to boot. Psychologically speaking, the attention he gets by rebelling even to the point of self-destruction is more emotionally valuable than the help he would get at rehab."
Leonard,Iêve got a solution.
Sheldon,"Great, what is it?"
Leonard,Get out.
Sheldon,Fine.  Weêll talk in the morning.
Leonard,Who are you? 
Leonard,"Oh, God! Sheldon does not have a cousin Leo."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, we just went over this. As the quintessential middle child, your addiction is rooted in your unmet need for attention."
Sheldon,"For your information, this is all based on solid research, stick with the character profile I wrote for you. "
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, Leonard, this is Toby Loobenfeld, heês a research assistant in the particle physics lab, but he also minored in theatre at MIT."
Leonard,"Yeah, I got it, Sheldon, why?"
Sheldon,"Well, you see, while Leo would not have gone into rehab, it is completely plausible that we would have talked him into leaving the motel, and coming home with us."
Sheldon,"Weêre going with middle child, and a generic predisposition to inadequate serotonin production."
Sheldon,"Subtextually, of course.  Morning Penny."
Penny,Hi. How did the intervention go.
Sheldon,"Unfortunately, we werenêt able to convince him to go to rehab. "
Penny,"Well, based on what you told me, Iêm not surprised. "
Sheldon,"But we did convince him to leave the motel. Come say hello. Leo, this is Penny, our friend and neighbour."
Penny,"Hi Leo, how are you feeling?"
Leonard,"Well, thatês Leo. Hey, um, why donêt you tell me about your showcase last night?"
Penny,"Oh, it was okay I guess, wasnêt a big turn out but they both really seemed to like it. "
Leonard,There were only two people there?
Penny,By the end. Yeah. 
Penny,IêmÑ Iêm sorry.
Sheldon,Donêt forget his genetic predisposition towards addiction.
Sheldon,There have been studies.
Sheldon,"How could there be a double blind study, who would be the control group. "
Leonard,"As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly, letês give them some privacy."
Penny,"Yeah. Hey, do you want to come over to my place, have coffee?"
Leonard,Sounds good.
Penny,"I have a video of me singing last night, do you want to see it? "
Leonard,"Gee, why wouldnêt I?"
Penny,"This is even better than you coming to the showcase, because now I get to watch you watch me."
Leonard,Yeah! Funny how things work out. 
Sheldon,Your parents made the right decision. 
Penny,"Leo, you are a very sweet, really funny guy. Youêre gonna do okay. "
Leonard,How long is he going to stay here.
Sheldon,"Heês a homeless drug addict, Leonard, where is he going to go? Boy, you have a lot to learn about lying."
Leonard,O-o-o-o-h! Again?
Sheldon,"Obviously youêre not well suited for three-dimensional chess, perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed. "
Leonard,Just reset the board.
Sheldon,It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels. 
Penny,Hi guys.
Leonard,Hey! 
Penny,Did you get my mail.
Leonard,"Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?"
Penny,"Oh, better than North Dakota!  I guess that jokeês only funny in Nebraska."
Sheldon,From the data at hand you really canêt draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here. 
Penny,"Boy, itês good to be back. "
Leonard,How was your family?
Penny,"Ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend."
Sheldon,Sick? 
Leonard,Here we go. 
Sheldon,What kind of sick?
Penny,"Oh, the flu I guess."
Sheldon,"I donêt need you to guess, I need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?"
Penny,Maybe Friday.
Sheldon,"Friday, was that morning or afternoon? "
Penny,IÑ I donêtÑ
Sheldon,"Think woman, who blew their nose and when? "
Leonard,"Sheldon, relax, she doesnêt have any symptoms, Iêm sure sheês not contagious."
Sheldon,"Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose. "
Leonard,"Penny, youêll have to excuse Sheldon, heês a bit of a germophobe. "
Penny,"Oh, itês okay, I understand."
Sheldon,"Thanks for your consideration, now please leave."
Leonard,Youêd better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol. 
Penny,"Okay, well, thank you for getting my mail."
Leonard,No problem. Welcome home. 
Leonard,What the hell are you doing?
Sheldon,Iêm making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures. 
Leonard,With lime jello?
Sheldon,"I need a growth medium, and someone polished off the apricot yoghurt. Here, swab my throat."
Leonard,I donêt think so.
Sheldon,Leonard! If Iêm going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out whatês growing in my throat. 
Leonard,"Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not. "
Sheldon,We have no idea what pathogen Typhoid Penny has introduced into our environment. And having never been to Nebraska Iêm fairly certain that I have no cornhusking antibodies. 
Leonard,"Sheldon, donêt you think youêre overreacting? "
Sheldon,"When Iêm lying comatose in a hospital relying on inferior minds to cure me, these jello cultures and my accompanying notes will give them a fighting chance. "
Leonard,Iêm going back to bed. 
Sheldon,Wait.  Put this in the bathroom.
Leonard,What for? 
Sheldon,I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys arenêt shutting down.
Leonard,I mix pancake batter in this! 
Sheldon,"No, that measuring cup has always been for urine."
Leonard,"You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didnêt have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup? "
Sheldon,Itês right here on the bottom. 
Leonard,Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology. 
Sheldon,"Oh, dear God.  Leonard! Leonard, Iêm sick!"
Sheldon,Leonard! Leonard Iêm sick!
Sheldon,"Leonard, where are you? "
Leonard,Iêm at work. 
Sheldon,At six-thirty in the morning? 
Sheldon,On Sunday? 
Leonard,They asked me to come in.
Sheldon,"Well, I didnêt hear the phone ring."
Leonard,They texted me. 
Sheldon,"Well, as I predicted, I am sick. My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate. "
Leonard,No kidding?
Sheldon,"Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green. "
Leonard,"Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids. "
Sheldon,What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?
Leonard,Drink whatever you want.
Sheldon,I want soup.
Leonard,Then make soup. 
Sheldon,We donêt have soup. 
Leonard,"Iêm at work, Sheldon.  "
Sheldon,Is that a dog?
Leonard,"Yes, "
Sheldon,In the lab?
Leonard,"Yes, theyêre training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, I have to go. "
Howard,"I know itês the phone, Ma, I hear the phone."
Howard,I donêt know.
Howard,How can I ask them when Iêm talking to you!  Hello.
Leonard,"Howard, itês Leonard, code Milky Green. "
Howard,"Dear Lord, not Milky Green! "
Leonard,"Affirmative, with fever."
Howard,Itês Leonard.
Howard,Sheldonês sick.
Howard,"For Godês sake, Ma, Iêm twenty six years old."
Howard,Chocolate milk and eggoes please! 
Leonard,"Howard, listen to me."
Howard,"Hang on, call waiting."
Leonard,"No, donêt, donêtÑ."
Sheldon,"Howard, Iêm sick. "
Howard,"Howardês sleeping, this is his mother. Why are you calling at this ungodly hour? "
Sheldon,I need soup.
Howard,Then call your own mother.  It was Sheldon.
Leonard,I tried to stop you. 
Howard,"Itês my own fault, I forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of ê06. "
Leonard,"You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours. "
Howard,"Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?"
Howard,Thatês a negatory. But thereês a Planet of the Apes marathon at the New Art today. 
Leonard,"Five movies, two hours apiece. Itês a start. "
Penny,"No, just crazy. Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
Sheldon,"Iêm sick, thank you very much. "
Penny,"How could you have gotten it from me, Iêm not sick."
Sheldon,Youêre a carrier. All these people here are doomed. Youêre doomed! 
Penny,"Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want."
Sheldon,I want soup.
Sheldon,"Penny, I have an IQ of 187, donêt you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?"
Penny,You can have soup delivered.
Sheldon,"I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for. "
Penny,"Okay, what kind of soup do you want."
Sheldon,"Well, my mother used to make me this split pea with little frankfurter slices and these home made croutons."
Penny,We have Chicken Tortilla and Potato Leek. 
Sheldon,Can I get any of those with little frankfurter slices and home made croutons?
Sheldon,Then surprise me.  Would you call that moss green or forest green? 
Howard,"Look at this, everyone went chimp. "
Raj,"Well Iêd like to point out, I voted for orang-utan, but you shouted me down. ."
Leonard,"Oh, hi Penny!"
Penny,"Hey, where are you? "
Leonard,IêmÑ uhÑ at work.
Penny,You sound funny.
Leonard,IêmÑ uhÑ in aÑ Iêm in a radiation suit. Whatês up?
Penny,"Yeah, well Iêm at work too, and youêll never guess whoês here infecting my entire station. "
Penny,"He wonêt leave, he says heês afraid heêll pass out on the bus and someone will harvest his organs."
Leonard,"Heês paranoid, and heês established a nest. "
Penny,Can you please come get him? 
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, Iêd beÑ Iêd be happy to Penny.  I feel really guilty. "
Raj,You did what you had to do. 
Howard,Take your stinking paws off my popcorn you damn dirty ape. 
Sheldon,Thanks for bringing me home. 
Penny,"Oh, itês okay, I didnêt really need to work today, itês not like I have rent or car payments or anything."
Sheldon,Good. Good.
Penny,"Okay, well, you feel better."
Sheldon,"Wait, where are you going? "
Penny,"Um, home, to write some bad cheques."
Sheldon,Youêre going to leave me? 
Penny,"Sheldon, you are a grown man, havenêt you ever been sick before? "
Sheldon,"Well, of course, but, not by myself. "
Penny,"Really, never?"
Sheldon,"Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany."
Penny,Studying abroad?
Sheldon,"No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than Iêm used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia. "
Penny,And there was no-one there to take care of you?
Sheldon,"No, my mum had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again. "
Sheldon,"It was tornado season. And it was an aluminium house. Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didnêt speak any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said _M_chtest Du eine Darmspélung?î"
Penny,What does that mean?
Sheldon,"Based on what happened next, I assume it means _would you like an enema?î"
Penny,"Okay, sweetie, Iêll take care of you, what do you need?"
Sheldon,"Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths. "
Penny,"Okay, ground rules, no sponge baths, and definitely no enemas. "
Sheldon,Agreed. 
Raj,"Here we go, ten and a half hours of apey goodness. "
Leonard,"Oh dammit, my glasses. Okay, Iêm blind here guys, can you help me find them?"
Howard,Sorry.  Found ‚em. 
Leonard,Oh great.
Howard,"Sorry, donêt you have a spare."
Leonard,"Yeah, at home. "
Raj,"Well if you leave now, you can be back before the gorillas rip the crap out of Charlton Heston. "
Howard,"Unless Sheldonês there, in which case youêll be trapped forever in his whiny hyper neurotic snot-web. "
Raj,How about Lasic? 
Leonard,You want me to get eye surgery? 
Raj,"Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?"
Leonard,Iêm thinking! 
Penny,"Okay, nice and cosy, okay, Iêll see you later."
Sheldon,Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest. 
Penny,"Oh, Sheldon, canêt you do that yourself?"
Sheldon,Vaporub makes my hands smell funny. 
Penny,But SheldonÑ.
Sheldon,"Please, please, please, please, please, please, please."
Penny,I canêt believe Iêm doing this. 
Sheldon,"No, no, counter-clockwise or my chest hair mats. "
Penny,Sorry. 
Sheldon,Can you sing _Soft Kittyî. 
Sheldon,My mom used to sing it to me when I was sick.
Penny,"Iêm sorry, honey, I donêt know it."
Sheldon,"Iêll teach you. _Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr purr purr.î Now you. "
Penny,"Soft kitty, warm kittyÑ"
Sheldon,Little ball of fur. Keep rubbing. 
Penny,Little ball of fur. 
Leonard,"What do you see, what do you see."
Raj,The living room appears to be empty. 
Leonard,"Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal. "
Howard,Iêm not going in there.
Raj,"No way, Jose. "
Leonard,"Well I canêt do it, I canêt see anything. "
Howard,"Itês all right, wireless mini-cam and Bluetooth headset. Weêll be your eyes. "
Howard,"One more thing. This is a subsonic impact sensor. If Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. At that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon, youêll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses."
Leonard,Wonêt my footsteps set it off? 
Howard,"No, youêll be on your hands and knees. Now youêll need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldonês room. "
Leonard,"Well, how do I carry it if Iêm on my hands and knees?"
Howard,Stay low. Bear left. Now keep true.
Howard,It means go straight.
Leonard,Then just say go straight. 
Howard,"You donêt stay go straight when youêre giving bearings, you say keep true. "
Leonard,Alright  I just hit my head. 
Howard,"Because you didnêt keep true.  Okay, turn right. "
Raj,TheÑ the pictureês breaking up. 
Howard,"Angle your head to the right. A little more. A little more.  Thatês it, now just keep true. Alright, youêre close enough to Sheldonês room, deploy the sensor. Now turn it on."
Leonard,It wasnêt on? 
Leonard,Then why did I have to crawl? 
Howard,"Oh, I guess you didnêt. "
Leonard,"Okay, itês on."
Howard,Good. From this point forward you will have to crawl. 
Leonard,I know. 
Howard,"Hang on, the sensorês picking up something, turn your head back.  "
Penny,You rat bastard. 
Howard,Told you the sensor would work. 
Penny,You deliberately stuck me with Sheldon. 
Leonard,"Well, I had to, you see what heês like. "
Sheldon,"Penny! Penny, Iêm hungry. "
Penny,"Uh, itês okay, sweetie, good news, Leonardês home!"
Leonard,No! 
Penny,"Here you go, good luck, bye."
Leonard,W-wait! 
Sheldon,"Leonard, Iêm hungry!"
Leonard,Wait! Penny! Take me with you!  
Sheldon,I want grilled cheese. 
Sheldon,Do you think Penny will come here and take care of us? 
Leonard,I donêt think Pennyês ever coming here again. 
Sheldon,Iêm very congested. 
Leonard,"Yeah, so?"
Sheldon,"Can you go to the kitchen, and get me the turkey baster labelled mucus."
Leonard,"If I stand, Iêll vomit. "
Sheldon,"Under the sink, yellow Tupperware bowl. "
Sheldon,Hereês the problem with teleportation.
Leonard,Lay it on me. 
Sheldon,"Assuming the device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location, and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly, you would not have actually transported the individual. You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another."
Leonard,How about that. 
Sheldon,"Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon."
Leonard,Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon? 
Sheldon,"No, he would be exactly the same. "
Leonard,That is a problem. 
Sheldon,"So, you see it too."
Leonard,"Graduate work, very impressive."
Sheldon,"Not bad, I myself started graduate school at fourteen."
Leonard,Advantage Kim. 
Sheldon,"Excuse me, that is my research, and it is by no means a dead end."
Leonard,Yes sir. 
Sheldon,"You can count on us, weêre on it. What the hell do you mean, dead end. "
Sheldon,I sense a disturbance in the force. 
Leonard,"A bad feeling I have about this, mmm-hmmm. "
Leonard,"So, Dennis, how long have you been in America."
Leonard,"No kidding, you speak English really well."
Leonard,What are you talking about? 
Sheldon,"Heês not wrong. Alright, and this is my office."
Sheldon,Nope. Goodbye. 
Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon, weêve hardly shown him anything."
Sheldon,"Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye. "
Sheldon,"Keen observation, goodbye. "
Leonard,"Huh, yeah? "
Sheldon,Get him out. 
Leonard,"Come on, Dennis, Iêll show you the rec centre, theyêve got nautilus equipment."
Leonard,Not heavy ones. 
Sheldon,You think I havenêt considered it? You really think I havenêt considered it? 
Sheldon,Get him out Leonard.
Leonard,"Come on, Dennis, Iêll show you the radiation lab."
Sheldon,"Yes, in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it. "
Sheldon,Fourteen and a half.
Leonard,"Itês like looking into an obnoxious little mirror, isnêt it? "
Howard,"Hey, Iêm damaged too. How about a hug for Howie? "
Penny,"Sure. Raj, hug Howard. "
Sheldon,Uh-uh-uh. 
Leonard,Something youêd like to share? A tale of woe perhaps.
Sheldon,"Fifteen years old. Dennis Kim is fifteen years old, and heês already correcting my work. Today I went from being Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart toÑ you know, that other guy."
Howard,Antonio Salieri?
Sheldon,"Oh, God, now even youêre smarter than me."
Howard,"You know, Sheldon, you donêt have so many friends that you can afford to start insulting them. "
Leonard,"Just eat, Sheldon, youêll feel better. "
Sheldon,"Why waste food. In Texas when a cow goes dry they donêt keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes. "
Penny,"Iêm confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk? "
Leonard,You canêt let this kid get to you. You always knew that someday someone would come along who was younger and smarter.
Sheldon,"Yes, but I assumed I would have been dead hundreds of years, and that there would be an asterisk by his name because he would be a cyborg. "
Penny,"So, youêve got a bit of competition, I really donêt see what the big deal is. "
Sheldon,"Well of course you donêt, youêve never excelled at anything. "
Penny,"I donêt understand, exactly how did he get any friends in the first place? "
Howard,We liked Leonard.
Leonard,"Well, what are you going to do, Sheldon, give up?"
Sheldon,"Yes. Thatês what a rational person does when his entire lifeês work is invalidated by a post-pubescent Asian wunderkind. He ceases his fruitless efforts, he donates his body to scientific research, and he waits to die. "
Penny,"You know, Iêm confused again, is he waiting, or do we get to shoot him between the eyes?"
Sheldon,Iêve decided youêre right. My career is not over. 
Sheldon,"But, since the arrival of Dennis Kim has rendered my research pointless, I just have to find something else to focus on."
Sheldon,"So Iêve decided, Iêm going to collaborate with you."
Sheldon,"What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but Iêve never really paid attention."
Leonard,"Okay, well, right now Iêm designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really donêt need any help. "
Sheldon,"Oh, sure you do. Now, see, whatês this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?"
Sheldon,Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?
Leonard,It would blow up.
Sheldon,Are you sure? 
Leonard,Pretty sure.
Sheldon,"Pretty sureês not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?"
Leonard,"Okay, Sheldon, I understand that youêre going through a bit of a career crisis, youêre searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully. "
Leonard,Go away.
Sheldon,"If youêre concerned about sharing credit with me, youêre name can go firstÑ Iêm going. "
Sheldon,"So, this is engineering, huh? "
Howard,Iêll talk to you later. 
Sheldon,"Engineering. Where the noble semi-skilled labourers execute the vision of those who think and dream. Hello, oompah-loompahs of science."
Howard,"Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
Sheldon,I just came by to say hello.
Howard,"Iêve been at this lab for three years, youêve never came by to say hello."
Sheldon,"Well, up until now Iêve had better things to do. So, what are we making today? "
Howard,A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package thatês going up on the next space shuttle. 
Sheldon,"Really, how does it work?"
Howard,"When this is done, it will be attached to the payload bay, and the sensor apparatus will rest on it. "
Sheldon,"Uh, huh. So itês a shelf? "
Howard,"No, you donêt understand, during acceleration it needs to stay perfectly level and provideÑ yeah, okay, itês a shelf. "
Sheldon,"Now, I notice youêre using titanium, did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes, theyêre lighter, cheaper and half twice the tensile strength."
Howard,"Sheldon, thereês a diploma in my office that says I have a masters in engineering."
Sheldon,"And you also have a note from your mother that says I love you, bubbula. But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes. "
Howard,Go away. 
Sheldon,Did Leonard tell you to say that? 
Howard,"No, I thought of it all by myself. "
Sheldon,Huh. It canêt be a coincidence. There must be some causal link Iêm missing.
Raj,Go away. 
Sheldon,Curiouser and curiouser. 
Howard,Is he here? 
Leonard,"If he were, I wouldnêt be. "
Raj,"Do you know what he did. He watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me. "
Leonard,Is that even possible?
Raj,"As it turns out, yes."
Howard,"Somethingês got to be done about him, Leonard."
Leonard,Like what? Heêll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is. 
Raj,"Well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?"
Howard,Then our problem would be solved. 
Leonard,"Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? Iêm not saying no. "
Howard,"We donêt have to go that far, there are other means available."
Raj,We canêt send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get out. 
Howard,The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.
Leonard,"That wonêt happen, heês not interested in anything but physics."
Howard,What about biology? 
Howard,"You know, biology? The one thing that can completely derail a world class mind. "
Leonard,"Howard, heês fifteen."
Howard,"Yeah, so, when I was fifteen I met Denise Polmerry and my grade point average fell from a 5.0 to a 1.8. "
Raj,She was sleeping with you?
Howard,"No, I just wasted a lot of time thinking about what it would be like if she did. "
Penny,"Oh, hey guys, whatês up?"
Howard,We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys. 
Leonard,"Howard, thatês racist, any fifteen year-old girl will do the trick. "
Raj,Itês possible she may have misunderstood us. 
Sheldon,"No, no, please, come in. Yeah, I think youêll appreciate this, very exciting."
Sheldon,"Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, Iêve decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, Iêm going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert. "
Sheldon,"You know, itês like the baseball movie, build it and they will come. "
Sheldon,The Jewish people.
Sheldon,"Weêll make it nice, put out a spread. "
Sheldon,"Of course he has, the oracle told us little Neo was the one. You can see the Matrix, canêt you."
Sheldon,"Ah, la-la-la, Hava Nagila. Theyêll come, theyêll settle and Iêll win the prizeÑ"
Sheldon,"I really donêt understand your objections, Professor Goldfarb, why wouldnêt the Senoran Desert make a perfectly good promised land?"
Sheldon,We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem. 
Sheldon,Said Pharoah to Moses. 
Leonard,Itês take your daughter to work day. 
Raj,"Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16. "
Raj,Thank you. 
Leonard,"Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women. "
Howard,All he has to do now is hook up with one of them. 
Leonard,Does anyone else see the flaw in this plan?
Raj,We need a social catalyst.
Leonard,Like what? We canêt get fifteen year-old girls drunk.  
Howard,Or can we?
Leonard,"No, we canêt. "
Howard,I donêt think you mean we canêt. I think you mean we shouldnêt. 
Sheldon,"Hey, Howard. Youêre a Jew. If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, itês definitely me. "
Leonard,"Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis. "
Raj,Okay. How about that one.
Howard,"Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, wonêt even look at anybody in the gifted programme. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and youêre in the back seat of your momês car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you."
Raj,Are you crying?
Howard,"No, I have allergies. "
Raj,"Okay, uh, how about her? "
Leonard,"Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while youêre the one holding her head out of the toilet while sheês puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesnêt even know you. "
Raj,"Okay, so not her either. How about her?"
Howard,"Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem. "
Leonard,I think thatês our girl. One of us should go talk to her. 
Raj,"I canêt talk to her, you do it. "
Leonard,"I canêt just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her. "
Howard,"Oh no, sheêll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this. "
Raj,"You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and weêd be done."
Leonard,"Well, weêre not in India. "
Raj,"Alright, why donêt we do it your way then? Weêll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end."
Leonard,"Okay, that was uncalled for."
Raj,"You started it, dude. "
Sheldon,Welcome Dennis Kim. 
Sheldon,Youngest till the cyborgs rise up! 
Leonard,The kid got a girl. 
Howard,Did anyone see how he did it?
Sheldon,"Donêt worry, Iêve got this. Ladies and Gentlemen, honoured daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank you. "
Howard,Heês back.
Leonard,"Yeah, mission accomplished. "
Raj,"Forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?"
Howard,I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy. 
Leonard,"Well, why do we go home alone every night, weêre still smart. "
Raj,Maybe weêre too smart. So smart itês offputting. 
Howard,"Yeah, letês go with that. "
Howard,"Unbelievable. Components I built are on the International Space Station, and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park. "
Leonard,"I donêt know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman _you have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.î"
Raj,"Hey, look at that.  Itês Dennis Kim."
Howard,"Wow, I almost didnêt recognise him."
Raj,"You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him. "
Leonard,"Yeah, we really ruined his life. "
Sheldon,"Screw him, he was weak. "
Howard,"Ooh, more details about the new Star Trek film. Thereês going to be a scene depicting Spockês birth. "
Raj,Iêd be more interested in a scene depicting Spockês conception. 
Sheldon,"Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating, or, if you will, Pon Farr, itês an extremely private matter."
Leonard,"Still, Iêd like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldnêt just conceive."
Howard,Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Imagine Spockês dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.
Raj,"How come on Star Trek everybodyês private parts are the same. No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, hey, get your thing out of my nose. "
Penny,"Hi, can you help me, I was writing an email and the A key got stuck. Now itês just going _aaaaaaaî."
Leonard,What did you spill on it?
Penny,Nothing. Diet coke. And yoghurt. A little nail polish. 
Leonard,Iêll take a look at it. 
Howard,"Gentlemen, switching to local nerd news. Fishman, Chen, Chowdry, McNair arenêt fielding a team in the university physics bowl this year. "
Leonard,"Youêre kidding, why not?"
Howard,"They formed a barbershop quartet, and got a gig playing Knotsbury Farm. "
Penny,"Wow, so in your world, youêre like, the cool guys. "
Howard,Recognise. 
Leonard,"This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod. "
Howard,Kryptonian villain. Long story.
Raj,Good story.  
Sheldon,Well count me out.
Howard,Why?
Sheldon,You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish? 
Leonard,"Come on, you need a four person team, weêre four people. "
Sheldon,"By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition."
Penny,I want tickets to that please. 
Leonard,"Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spockês dying words to you."
Sheldon,"No, donêt. "
Leonard,The needs of the many.
Howard,Outweigh the needs of the few. 
Sheldon,"Or the one. Dammit, Iêll do it. "
Raj,Okay. First order of physics bowl business. We need a truly kick-ass team name. Suggestions.
Howard,"How about the perpetual motion squad? Itês beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads up for the ladies. "
Leonard,The ladies?
Howard,"Perpetual motion squad, we can go all night."
Raj,I like it.
Sheldon,"I donêt. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent."
Raj,Then we can be the Bengal Tigers.
Sheldon,"Poor choice. Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant. "
Raj,Maybe so. But you canêt incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass. 
Leonard,Letês put it to a vote. All those in favourÑ.
Sheldon,"Point of order. I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant. "
Leonard,Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question? 
Sheldon,I will yield.
Leonard,"After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?"
Sheldon,He does. 
Leonard,"I move we are the Army Ants, all those in favour?"
Penny,"Good afternoon, and welcome to todayês physics bowl practice round. Iêm Penny, and Iêll be your host, because apparently I didnêt have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon, and isnêt that just a little sad? Gentlemen, are you ready?"
Sheldon,Of course. 
Howard,Fire away. 
Penny,"You know, itês none of my business, but isnêt a guy who canêt speak in front of women going to hold you back a little?"
Leonard,"Oh, uh, heêll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when theyêre one on one and smell nice."
Penny,"Oh, thanks Raj, itês vanilla oil."
Leonard,"I was actually the one who noticed, okay, letês just start. "
Penny,"Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper."
Sheldon,"And of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds."
Penny,That is correct.
Leonard,I knew that too.
Penny,"Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard."
Sheldon,"And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance."
Penny,Right. 
Howard,"Hey, I buzzed in. "
Sheldon,"But I answered, itês called teamwork. "
Howard,Donêt you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.
Sheldon,By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because Iêm a mammal.  
Leonard,Just ask another one.
Penny,Okay. What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einsteins predicted frame dragging? 
Sheldon,And of course itês Gravity Probe B.
Leonard,"Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer. "
Penny,Because itês polite.
Sheldon,What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?
Penny,"Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions. "
Sheldon,"The objective of the competition is to give correct answers, if I know them, why shouldnêt I give them? "
Howard,Some of us might have the correct answers too. 
Sheldon,"Oh please, you donêt even have a PhD. "
Howard,"Alright, thatês it."
Leonard,"Howard, sit down."
Howard,Okay. 
Leonard,maybe we should take a little break.
Sheldon,"Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury. "
Howard,I agree.
Penny,What did he say? 
Howard,He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summerês eve. 
Penny,"Yeah, and the bag it came in. "
Sheldon,"Leonard, excellent, I want to show you something."
Leonard,"Can it wait, I need to talk to you."
Sheldon,"Just look. Iêve designed the perfect uniforms for our team. The colours are based on Star Trek, the original series. The three of you will wear support red, and I will wear command gold. "
Leonard,Why do they say AA? 
Sheldon,Army Ants. 
Leonard,Isnêt that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people. 
Sheldon,Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium?
Leonard,"No, I meantÑ. never mind. Hey, check it out. I got you a Batman cookie jar!"
Sheldon,"Oh neat, whatês the occasion?"
Leonard,"Well, youêre a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and youêre off the team. "
Leonard,"Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting. "
Sheldon,No you didnêt.
Leonard,"Yes we did, I just came from it."
Sheldon,"Okay, I donêt know where you just came from, but it couldnêt have been a team meeting because Iêm on the team and I wasnêt there, ergo the team did not meet. "
Leonard,"Okay, let me try it this way, uh, I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out youêre off the team. "
Leonard,Because youêre taking all the fun out of it.
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?"
Leonard,"Okay, let me try it this way, youêre annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more. "
Sheldon,"I see. Well. At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears."
Leonard,Thanks for the heads up. 
Sheldon,Youêre welcome. One more thing.
Sheldon,"Itês on, bitch. "
Howard,So whoêd he get to be on his team.
Leonard,"He wonêt say. He just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar. "
Raj,"Heês using psychological warfare. We must reply in kind. I say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like, yes, you are a smart and strong competitor, but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you. "
Leonard,How exactly would that laugh go? 
Raj,Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
Howard,"That sounds more like, we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians. "
Leonard,"Guys, letês remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my room mate."
Leonard,"So nothing, letês destroy him. "
Raj,Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!
Howard,"Okay, weêre going to need a strong fourth for our team."
Raj,"You know whoês apparently very smart, is the girl who played TVês Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something. "
Leonard,"Raj, weêre not getting TVês Blossom to join our physics bowl team. "
Raj,How about the girl from the Wonder Years? 
Howard,"Gentlemen, I believe Iêve found the solution to all our problems. "
Leonard,We canêt ask Leslie Winkle.
Raj,Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last nightês chutney? 
Leonard,Yes. 
Howard,Sometimes youêve got to take one for the team.
Raj,"Yeah. Sack up, dude. "
Leonard,"Fine. Here I go, taking one for the team. In the sack. Hey Leslie."
Leonard,"Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that IÑ"
Howard,Hit that thang. 
Leonard,"Thereês not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be. "
Leonard,"Thatês all very comforting, but if itês okay, Iêd like to get on with my question now."
Leonard,We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.
Howard,"Dilepton, schmilepton, we need you. "
Howard,"Well, we tried. Just have to face Sheldon mano-e-mano-e-mano. A-mano. "
Leonard,Sheês in. 
Penny,"So, how do you feel? Nice and loose? Come to play? Got your game face on?  Are you ready?"
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. You know you donêt have to stay for the whole thing. "
Penny,"Oh, no, no, I want to. It sounds really interesting. "
Howard,Sheldon. 
Raj,Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.
Penny,Sheldon. Iêm just going to sit down. 
Leonard,"So, is that your team."
Sheldon,"Actually, I donêt need a team, I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four, so may I introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my Spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?"
Sheldon,Leslie Winkle? 
Sheldon,"Yes, well, Iêm polymerised tree sap and youêre non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you. "
Leonard,Hereês your tee-shirt.  
Leonard,"No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad. "
Howard,"All night long, yêall! "
Leonard,The Eta Meson.
Sheldon,Formal protest.
Sheldon,The Velcro on my wrist brace caught on my shirt.
Sheldon,"And of course, the answer is Technetium."
Raj,"Sheldon can suck on, the Casimir Effect."
Sheldon,4.1855 times ten to the seventh ergs per calorie.
Leonard,Prevostês theory of exchanges. 
Sheldon,Lamda equals one over Pi R squared N 
Howard,"760 degrees celsius, the approximate temperature of the young lady in the front row."
Sheldon,A sigma particle.
Raj,Holy crap. 
Leonard,What the hell is that.
Howard,It looks like something they found on the ship at Roswell. 
Leonard,"Come on, think, Leslie."
Leonard,"Youêre never going to let that go, are you? "
Leonard,"Sorry, I panicked. "
Howard,Then guess.
Leonard,"Um, eight.  Point four. "
Howard,He doesnêt have it. Heês got squat.
Sheldon,"Hang on, hang on a second, thatês not our answer. What are you doing?"
Sheldon,How do you know anything about physics?
Sheldon,"Well thatês a delightful little story, but our arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything, I answer the questions."
Sheldon,"Hey look, now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia, but on this physics bowl team I rule with an iron fist. . Ow!"
Sheldon,Well itês not what he said.
Sheldon,I want a different question.
Sheldon,Formal protest.
Sheldon,Informal protest.
Sheldon,I decline to provide one.
Sheldon,Thatês your opinion.
Leonard,"Hang on. Sheldon, is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team. "
Sheldon,I donêt understand the question. 
Leonard,Go ahead.
Leonard,"Sorry, somebodyês sitting there."
Leonard,My Physics Bowl Trophy! 
Sheldon,"That trophy is meaningless, I forfeited, therefore you did not win. "
Leonard,I know someone who would disagree.
Leonard,"My Physics Bowl Trophy!  _Leonard is so smart, Sheldon who?î"
Sheldon,Alright that is very immature.
Leonard,"Youêre right, Iêm sorry.  Iêm not! "
Penny,"Okay, new contest. "
Leonard,What are you doing?
Penny,"Iêm settling once and for all who is the smartest around here. Okay, are you ready?"
Leonard,Bring it on.
Penny,"Okay. Marsha, Jan and Cindy were the three daughters of what TV family?  The Brady Bunch. Okay, Sammy Hagar replaced David Lee Roth as the lead singer in what group?"
Sheldon,The Brady Bunch? 
Penny,"Van Halen. Alright, Madonna was married to this Ridgemont High alum.  Oh my God, Sean Penn!"
Leonard,How do you know these things?
Penny,"I go outside and I talk to people. Alright, here, what actor holds the record for being named people magazineês sexiest man alive?"
Sheldon,William Shatner.
Leonard,"Wait, I donêt think itês Shatner."
Sheldon,Then itês got to be Patrick Stewart. 
Sheldon,Formal protest. 
Penny,"Alright, singer who sang _Oops I Did It Again.î  Okay, Tweetie Bird, taught he taw a what?"
Penny,Yes. He taught he taw a Romulan. 
Sheldon,"Well, this sandwich is an unmitigated disaster. I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat."
Raj,What did they give you?
Sheldon,Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. Itês the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash. 
Leonard,I donêt believe it.
Sheldon,"I know, itês basic culinary science. "
Leonard,Some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no-one is bidding on it. 
Howard,A time machine from the movie The Time Machine? 
Leonard,"No, a time machine from Sophieês Choice. "
Raj,"Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it, itês rough. "
Howard,"Oh, thatês cool."
Raj,Itês only $800?
Leonard,Yeah. And thatês my bid.
Sheldon,You bid $800.
Leonard,"It was a spur of the moment thing, I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it. "
Sheldon,Thereês only 30 seconds left in the auction.
Howard,Do you have $800?
Leonard,Not to blow on a miniature time machine. 
Howard,"Donêt worry, the way these things work thereês people waiting ‚til the last second to bid, and then they swoop in and get it, itês called sniping."
Raj,Fifteen seconds.
Leonard,"Come on, snipers. "
Raj,"Ten, nine, eightÑ"
Leonard,Where are your snipers?
Leonard,Snipe. 
Leonard,Aaaa-aw! 
Raj,"Congratulations, you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine."
Howard,You lucky duck. 
Sheldon,"I wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia. "
Leonard,"Yeah, I know, I still canêt afford it. "
Howard,Why donêt we share it? Weêll each put in two hundred bucks and weêll take turns having it in our homes.
Raj,A time share time machine? Iêm in. Sheldon?
Sheldon,Need you ask? But I still donêt understand why no-one else bid. 
Sheldon,I understand why no-one else bid. 
Raj,Did the listing actually say miniature?
Leonard,I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine for $800?
Sheldon,"In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets _no longer want my time machineî and _need $800î."
Howard,"Itês actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound. "
Raj,Cocktain shrimp are $12.50.
Leonard,How are we going to get it upstairs? 
Howard,If we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator. 
Leonard,Yes but the elevatorês been broken for two years. 
Sheldon,"Iêve been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call about that? "
Howard,"Not necessary, I have a masters in engineering, I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads. When the Mars rover started pulling to the left I performed a front end alignment from 62 million miles away.  No, that babyês broken. "
Leonard,"Come on, guys, push. "
Howard,If I push any harder Iêm going to give birth to my colon. 
Raj,"I canêt feel my fingers, hurry up. "
Sheldon,"Itês the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics."
Raj,"If my fingers ever work again, Iêve got a job for the middle one. "
Penny,"Oh, hey guys."
Penny,What are you doing?
Leonard,"Oh, just, you know, movingÑ something upstairs. "
Penny,What is it?
Leonard,"ItêsÑ you know, time machine. "
Penny,"Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, soÑ."
Leonard,"Uh, just give us a few minutes."
Penny,"I donêt have a few minutes, Iêm running really late."
Sheldon,"Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, thereês a small gap, donêt look down if youêre subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell. "
Penny,"Youêre joking, right?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo. "
Penny,"Damn, okay, Iêll just take the roof. "
Leonard,"Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke, itês notÑ never mind. "
Sheldon,"For what itês worth, I thought it was humorous. "
Leonard,"Letês just do this. Guys, ready to push?"
Raj,In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up. 
Sheldon,I donêt know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.
Leonard,Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned. 
Sheldon,"The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions, the sub-terranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy. "
Howard,Talk about your chick magnets. 
Raj,"Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, Iêve got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!"
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I know we said weêd take turns, but I think youêd agree that practicality dictates it remain here. "
Howard,"You canêt just keep it here, what if I meet a girl and say, _you wanna come up and see my time machine, itês at my friends house,î how lame is that? "
Raj,Heês got a point.
Sheldon,"Alright, I think weêre going to need some ground rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine. "
Leonard,Seconded. 
Howard,I was going to put down a towel. 
Raj,I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis. 
Leonard,That sounds fair.
Sheldon,"Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month? "
Raj,Twice a month.
Sheldon,Then no. 
Raj,"Okay, every other month."
Leonard,"Sheldon, you canêt be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. Now out of the way so I can sit in my time machine.  Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10th, 1876. "
Howard,"Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson."
Sheldon,"Wait a minute, Iêd want to see that too. "
Leonard,"So, when itês your turn you can."
Sheldon,"But if we all go back to the same point in time, Bellês lab is going to get very crowded, heêll know somethingês up. "
Raj,"Also, since the time machine doesnêt move in space, youêll end up in 1876 Pasadena. "
Howard,"And even if you can make it to Boston, what are you going to do, knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell, _hey Mrs Bell, big fan of your husband, can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?î"
Raj,"Mrs Bell was deaf, sheês not even going to hear you knock. "
Sheldon,"Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device."
Raj,"Ooh, how far into the future?"
Sheldon,"If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning."
Leonard,"Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10th, 2328. Here we go into the future.  That was fun. "
Raj,My turn.
Penny,"Okay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide, I slipped and skinned my knee."
Leonard,Are you okay?
Penny,"Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family, who insisted I stay for lunch. "
Leonard,That doesnêt sound too bad.
Penny,"It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son."
Penny,"Not done. By the time I finally got to work, theyêd given my shift away. Yeah, thatês right, Iêve lost an entire dayês pay thanks to thisÑ thisÑ"
Sheldon,Time machine. 
Leonard,"The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?"
Penny,"No! I donêt want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books andÑ and now thatÑ thatÑ"
Sheldon,"Again, time machine. "
Penny,"Oh please, itês not a time machine, if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades."
Sheldon,It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp. 
Penny,"Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic.  "
Raj,My turn! 
Sheldon,"Leonard, itês two in the morning. "
Sheldon,So itês my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?
Leonard,Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.
Sheldon,"You canêt. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake. "
Leonard,Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?
Sheldon,"Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious. "
Leonard,What if I knocked you unconscious right now? 
Sheldon,It wonêt change the past. 
Leonard,But it would make the present so much nicer. 
Sheldon,Are you upset about something? 
Leonard,What was your first clue?
Sheldon,"Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritabilityÑ"
Leonard,Yes Iêm upset. 
Sheldon,Oh! I donêt usually pick up on those things. Good for me. 
Leonard,"Yeah, good for you. "
Sheldon,"Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about whatês bothering you? "
Leonard,I donêt know. Maybe.
Sheldon,"Wow, Iêm on fire tonight. "
Leonard,"Uh, hereês the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines. "
Sheldon,I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.
Leonard,Thanks for pointing it out.
Sheldon,"In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother. "
Leonard,Those are movies.
Sheldon,Well of course theyêre movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? Thatês absurd. 
Leonard,"Come on, guys, push. "
Howard,If I push any harder Iêm going to give birth to my colon. 
Penny,"Oh, hey guys."
Penny,What are you doing?
Leonard,"Oh, just, you know, moving aÑ time machine. "
Penny,"Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, soÑ."
Leonard,No problem. 
Penny,"But, what about your time machine."
Leonard,Some things are more important than toys. 
Penny,"Oh, Iêm scared. "
Leonard,"Donêt worry baby, Iêve got you."
Penny,"Oh, Leonard. "
Sheldon,Itês still my turn.
Sheldon,What are you doing?
Leonard,Iêm packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell. 
Sheldon,Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen. 
Leonard,Itês not about money.
Raj,We brought food.
Howard,"Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers."
Leonard,"Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?"
Leonard,Because I donêt want it any more. 
Leonard,JustÑ personal reasons. 
Sheldon,My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny. 
Leonard,"Look, do you want to buy me out or not?"
Raj,"Iêll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and weêll put it on my balcony. "
Howard,"Screw his balcony, Iêll give you a hundred and twenty and weêll put it in my garage. "
Leonard,I paid two hundred dollars for my share.
Raj,"Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot."
Sheldon,"Iêll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is. "
Raj,"Three hundred, and Iêll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects. "
Leonard,"No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, Iêm getting rid of all of it. "
Howard,"You canêt do that, look what youêve created here, itês like nerdvana. "
Raj,"More importantly, youêve a Darth Vader voice changer? "
Leonard,Not for long.
Raj,"Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash."
Howard,"Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection."
Raj,"Too bad, I called dibs."
Howard,Well you canêt just call dibs.
Raj,"I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia."
Sheldon,Dibs doesnêt apply in a bidding war. 
Leonard,"Itês not a bidding war, Iêm selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store. "
Raj,Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs? 
Howard,Will you forget dibs! 
Leonard,He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.
Sheldon,"Whatês the number, Iêll match it. "
Raj,"Iêll match it, plus a thousand rupees. "
Sheldon,Whatês the exchange rate.
Raj,None of your business. Take it or leave it.
Howard,"Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got? Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in Israel. "
Leonard,"Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me."
Sheldon,"Who cares, as long as you pick me. "
Raj,"Okay, Leonard, put down the box, letês talk."
Leonard,"Sorry Raj, my mind is made up."
Sheldon,I canêt let you do this. 
Leonard,"Sheldon, get out of my way."
Sheldon,None shall pass. 
Leonard,"Okay. I did not want to do this but, I have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek: The Next Generation Geordi LaForge, without his visor in the original packaging. If you do not get out of my way, I will open it. "
Howard,"Okay man, be cool, weêre all friends here. "
Penny,What the hellês going on? 
Sheldon,You hypocrite!
Sheldon,"Little Miss _grown ups donêt play with toysî. If I were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty! "
Penny,"Okay, okay look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I am really sorry about what I said, I was just a bit upset."
Leonard,"No, I needed to hear it."
Penny,"No you didnêt. Look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are. "
Howard,I guess that makes me large breasts. 
Leonard,"Still, I think itês time for me to get rid of this stuff andÑ you knowÑ move on with my life. "
Penny,Oh. Wow. Good for you. 
Leonard,"Thanks. Hey, do you want to, I donêt know, laterÑ"
Penny,Hi Mike.
Penny,"Yeah, I just have to change."
Penny,"Oh, stop it! guys. "
Leonard,My turn on the time machine. 
Sheldon,"It worked. It really worked. They said I was mad, but it worked.  "
Leonard,"Sheldon, are you okay? "
Sheldon,We have to get rid of the time machine. 
Leonard,"It is a little big for the living room, isnêt it?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, thatês the problem, itês too big. "
Leonard,"Iêm glad you agree. I hired some guys to help us move it, come on in fellas. "
Sheldon,"Oh no, Morlocks? Eat him, eat him. Aaaaargh.  Leonard!!!!!!!!"
Leonard,"On the other hand, some physicists are concerned that if the super collider actually works, it will create a black hole and swallow up the Earth ending life as we know it. "
Raj,"Psh, what a bunch of crybabies. No guts, no glory man. "
Leonard,"Hey, check it out, the school of pharmacology is looking for volunteers."
Raj,"We are testing a new medication for social anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Why would they be looking for test subjects here? "
Leonard,"I donêt know, Raj. Maybe the comic book store doesnêt have a bulletin board.  Whatês going on?"
Howard,Shhh! Hot girl in Sheldonês office. 
Leonard,Sheldonês office? Is she lost? 
Howard,Donêt think so. I followed her here from the parking lot. 
Leonard,Maybe sheês his lawyer.
Howard,Well sheês free to examine my briefs.
Howard,"I know, Iêm disgusting, I should be punished. By her, oh look, I did it again. "
Sheldon,Thank you for coming by.  Hello.
Leonard,"Oh, hey buddy. "
Howard,"Sorry Iêm late, Iêm working on a project that may take me up on the next space shuttle."
Sheldon,"How can you be late, I wasnêt expecting you at all. "
Howard,"Nobody ever expects me, sometimes you just look andÑ BAM!  Howard Wolowitz. "
Leonard,"Sheldon, are you going to introduce us? "
Sheldon,"Oh, alright, this is Missy, Missy this is Leonard and Rajesh and youêve already met Howard. "
Leonard,"You too, swell, also."
Leonard,"So, how do you two know each other."
Leonard,Excuse me?
Sheldon,"Sheês my twin sister, she thinks sheês funny but frankly Iêve never been able to see it."
Sheldon,How exactly would one measure a sense of humour? A humourmometer? 
Howard,"Well, I think youêre delightfully droll. Or as the French say, Tres Drole. "
Sheldon,Rajesh. 
Leonard,"So Missy, what brings you all the way from Texas? "
Howard,"Was it perhaps destiny, I think it was destiny. "
Howard,"Destiny, thy name is Anaheim. "
Sheldon,"The papers could have been mailed, Mom just sent you here to spy on me, didnêt she."
Sheldon,"They call me a genius because Iêm a genius. Tell Mom that I currently weigh 165 pounds, and that Iêm having regular bowel movements. Enjoy the wedding, goodbye."
Leonard,"If the weddingês not until tomorrow, why donêt you stay with us tonight? "
Sheldon,"They were not friends, they were imaginary colleagues. "
Leonard,"Look, youêre here, we have plenty of room."
Sheldon,No we donêt.
Howard,"Come on, Shelly, sheês family."
Sheldon,So what? I donêt issue invitations to your mother.
Sheldon,And donêt ever call me Shelly.
Leonard,So itês settled. Youêll stay with us.
Howard,"Iêll walk you to your car. Youêre in structure 3 level C, right? "
Sheldon,What just happened?
Leonard,"Hee-hee, just classic. "
Sheldon,I needed a place to fire ceramic semi-conductor substrates for home-made integrated circuits. 
Sheldon,Made necessary by her insistence on going into my room.
Howard,"Ha-ha, not your eyebrows? "
Sheldon,Is that what that was? I just assumed that the second grade curriculum had rendered you quizzical. 
Penny,"Hey, Leonard, you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs. "
Leonard,Those are not mine.
Penny,"Really, they have your little name label in them. "
Leonard,"Yeah, no, I do, I use thoseÑ uhÑ just to polish up myÑ spear-fishing equipment. I spear fish. When Iêm not crossbow hunting, I spear fish. Uh, Penny, this is Sheldonês twin sister, Missy. Missy, this is our neighbour Penny."
Penny,"Wow, you donêt look that much alike."
Howard,Can I get a hallelujah. 
Sheldon,"Fraternal twins come from two separate eggs, they are no more alike than any other siblings."
Howard,Hallelujah. 
Raj,"Hey, guess what. Iêve been accepted as a test subject for a new miracle drug to overcome pathological shyness. "
Penny,"Hey, good for you, Raj."
Raj,"Yes, Iêm very hopeful. Hello Missy.  They mentioned there may be side effects. "
Raj,"So, Missy. Have you ever met a man from the exotic subcontinent of India? "
Raj,"Ah yes, Dr Patel, good man."
Howard,"Do you like motorcycles, ‚cos I ride a hog. "
Raj,A hog? You have a two cylinder scooter with a basket on the front. 
Howard,You still have to wear a helmet. 
Raj,Have you ever heard of the Kama Sutra? 
Raj,"The Indian sex book. In other words if you wonder wonder who wrote the book of love, it was us."
Penny,"Hey, Sheldonês sisterês pretty cute, I wÑ."
Leonard,I wasnêt staring! 
Penny,"I didnêt say you were, I just said she was cute. "
Leonard,"Oh. Huh, um, maybe, if you like women who are tallÑ and perfect. "
Penny,"Sheldon, why are you ignoring your sister?"
Sheldon,Iêm not ignoring my sister. Iêm ignoring all of you. 
Leonard,I brought snacks.
Leonard,"Onion dip, itês onion dip. "
Leonard,We donêt entertain much. 
Raj,"Missy, do you enjoy pajamas?"
Raj,We Indians invented them. Youêre welcome.
Howard,"Yeah, well my people invented circumcision. Youêre welcome!"
Penny,"Missy, Iêm going to go get my nails done. Do you want to come?"
Penny,Youêre welcome. 
Howard,Missy.
Leonard,"Missy, see you."
Penny,Goodbye Leonard! 
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, no, uh, bye Penny."
Howard,"Okay, you two have to back off."
Raj,"Why should I back off, you back off dude."
Leonard,"Excuse me, this is my apartment and sheês my roommateês sister."
Howard,"So what, youêve already got Penny. "
Leonard,How do I have Penny? In what universe do I have Penny?
Howard,So I can have Penny?
Leonard,"Hell, no! "
Sheldon,"Excuse me, can I interject something. Iêm ordering pizza online, is everyone okay with pepperoni? "
Leonard,"Sheldon, can I talk to you in private?"
Sheldon,"I guess. Donêt worry, I was going to order you cheeseless."
Leonard,Thank you. 
Sheldon,Thatês okay. Lactose intolerance is nothing to be embarrassed about. 
Howard,"Iêm a fancy Indian man, we invented pajamas! "
Raj,"Hey, look at me, I donêt have a foreskin. "
Leonard,"Sheldon, are you aware that your sister is an incredibly attractive woman?"
Sheldon,"Hmmm? She certainly has the symmetry and low body fat that western culture deems desirable. Itês noteworth that at other points in history, heavier women were the standard for beauty because their girth suggested affluence. "
Leonard,"Thatês fascinating, but IÑ"
Sheldon,"I didnêt say it was fascinating, I said it was noteworthy."
Leonard,"Alright, noted. But my point is that Koothrappali and WolowitzÑ theyêre hitting on your sister. "
Sheldon,"Oh. Okay. You know, I donêt want to criticise your rhetorical style but, weêd be a lot further along in this conversation if youêd begun with that thought. "
Leonard,"Thatês great, but IÑ."
Sheldon,What Iêm saying is that we took quite an unnecessary detour from what I now understand to be your thesis.
Leonard,Whatever. You have to do something about it.
Leonard,Because sheês your sister. 
Sheldon,"I donêt understand. Yes, we shared a uterus for nine months, but since then weêve pretty much gone our own separate ways. "
Leonard,"Okay, uhÑ. oh, consider this. With your father gone, it is your responsibility to make sure that Missy chooses a suitable mate. "
Sheldon,I hadnêt considered that. We do share DNA.
Leonard,Uh-huh. 
Sheldon,"So there is the possibility, however remote, that resting in her loins is the potential for another individual as remarkable as myself. "
Leonard,"Exactly. And, you owe it to yourself and to posterity to protect the genetic integrity of your sisterês future offspring. "
Sheldon,"Youêre right. If someone wants to get at Missyês fallopian tubes, theyêll have to go through me. "
Raj,"I am Shiva the destroyer, I will have the woman! "
Howard,"Iêm warning you, I was judo champion at math camp. "
Sheldon,"Alright, thatês enough juvenile squabbling, stop it, stop it I say. Iêm going to settle this right now. Neither of you are good enough for my sister. "
Howard,Who are you to decide that?
Leonard,"Heês the man of his family, you have to respect his wishes."
Sheldon,"Youêre out too, by the way."
Leonard,Say what?
Sheldon,"Itês nothing personal, Iêd just prefer if my future niece or nephew didnêt become flatulent every time they eat an Eskimo pie. "
Howard,What are you so happy about?
Raj,"Iêm not happy, itês the medication, I canêt stop smiling. "
Sheldon,"Now that Leonardês made me aware of how high the genetic stakes are, we have to face the fact that none of you are suitable mates for my sister. "
Howard,Wait a minute. Leonard made you aware of that? 
Leonard,"We all make mistakes, letês move on. "
Raj,"Excuse me, but I think youêre missing a big opportunity here. "
Sheldon,How so?
Raj,Everybody knows genetic diversity produces the strongest offspring. Why not put a little mocha in the family latte. 
Sheldon,"In principle you have a point, but as a practical matter, need I remind you that it takes experimental pharmaceuticals to simply enable you to speak to the opposite sex."
Howard,"Is it ‚cause Iêm Jewish, ‚cause Iêd kill my Rabbi with a porkchop to be with your sister."
Sheldon,"This has nothing to do with religion. This has to do with the fact that youêre a tiny, tiny man who still lives with his mother. "
Leonard,"Sheldon, you are really being unreasonable. "
Sheldon,Am I? Here. Eat this cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister. 
Sheldon,Oops. 
Sheldon,Why does everyone suddenly want to talk to me alone? Usually nobody wants to be alone with me.   
Leonard,"We all make mistakes, letês move on."
Sheldon,"Truthfully, Iêve never given it any thought, but it has been pointed out to me that you carry DNA of great potential."
Sheldon,"Let me explain. You see, Iêm a superior genetic mutation, an improvement on the existing mediocre stock. "
Sheldon,"That would be you. But residing within you is the potential for another me. Perhaps even taller, smarter and less prone to freckling, a Sheldon 2.0 if you will. "
Sheldon,"Exactly. Now, I am not saying that I should be the sole decider of who you mate with. If youêre not attracted to the suitor then the likelihood of conception would be reduced."
Sheldon,Not at all. Frequent coitus dramatically increases the odds of fertiliziation. 
Sheldon,"I always thought I was more like a cuckoo bird. You know, a superior creature whose egg is placed in the nest of ordinary birds. Of course the newly hatched cuckoo eats all the food, leaving the ordinary siblings to starve to death. Luckily for you, thatês where the metaphor ended. "
Sheldon,I have an alternate proposal. 
Sheldon,"You donate eggs. We will place them in cryogenic storage. I will find an appropriate sperm donor for your eggs, have them fertilized and implanted in you, that way everybody wins. "
Sheldon,Correction. Missy can date whoever she wants. 
Howard,"Look, we have to settle this."
Leonard,I agree. Sheldonês sister is hiding at Pennyês because weêve all been hitting on her at the same time. 
Raj,"Sheês not hiding. She needed privacy to call her grandmother whoês apparently very sick. Oh, and then I believe she has to wash her hair. "
Howard,"Oh, you poor, deluded bastard. "
Raj,Donêt start with me dude.
Howard,You want to go again? Letês go. 
Leonard,Sit down.
Howard,Okay. 
Leonard,"If weêre going to fight over Missy, letês do it the right way. The honourable way."
Leonard,And heês down!
Howard,"Come on, come on, get up. "
Leonard,"Stay down, bitch. Yeah, ha ha, natural selection at work."
Sheldon,I weep for humanity. 
Leonard,Excuse me while I go tell Missy the good news. 
Penny,"Ah, hey Leonard."
Leonard,"Hi Penny, howês it going. Listen, that guy Mike that you were dating, is that still going on?"
Penny,"Uh, pretty much, why?"
Leonard,"Nothing, just catching up. By the way, may I speak to Missy please? "
Penny,Of course.
Leonard,"Well, since youêre leaving tomorrow I was wondering if youêd like to go out to dinner with me?"
Leonard,"Oh. You have other plans, orÑ?"
Leonard,Oh. Alright uhÑ enjoy the rest of your evening.
Leonard,"Um, hereês something we didnêt anticipate. "
Penny,"What do you want, Howard?"
Howard,"Iêm fine, thanks for asking. Iêve come to call on Missy. "
Howard,The amazing Howard. Do you like magic?
Howard,"Then you are in for a treat. Behold, an ordinary cane. "
Howard,Okay. 
Raj,Thank you. I apprecÑ.  apprecÑ. appreeeeÑ. oh-oh.
Penny,"Oh, honey, is your medication wearing off?  "
Sheldon,"Well, she might be interested to know that I have refocused my research from bosonic string theory to heteronic string theory. "
Sheldon,"Okay, well, it was pleasant seeing you, other than that business with my testicles. "
Sheldon,You tell people Iêm a rocket scientist?
Sheldon,Iêm a theoretical physicist.
Sheldon,Whatês the difference?
Sheldon,"My God! Why donêt you just tell them Iêm a toll taker at the Golden Gate Bridge? Rocket scientist, how humiliating. "
Penny,"Hey, guys, guys, some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something."
Leonard,"Oh, itês called trestling."
Howard,It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport. 
Penny,"Yeah, thatês terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out.  Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to youÑ"
Sheldon,"We might as well stop, itês a stalemate. Youêre beating me in tetris, but youêve got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf."
Raj,"Keebler Elf? Iêve got your Keebler Elf right here.  Okay, itês a stalemate. "
Penny,"So Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?"
Sheldon,"He canêt eat cheesecake, heês lactose intolerant. "
Penny,"Okay, he can have carrot cake."
Sheldon,What about the cream cheese frosting.
Penny,he can scrape it off. 
Leonard,"Forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is Saturday? "
Penny,"I did your horoscope, remember, I was going to do everybodyês until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants."
Sheldon,"For the record, that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer, who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments, that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum. "
Penny,"Blah blah blah, a typical Taurus. So, seriously, are we going to see you Saturday?"
Leonard,"Oh, I donêt think so."
Penny,Why not?
Leonard,I donêt celebrate my birthday.
Penny,"Shuddup, yeah you do. "
Leonard,"No, itês no big deal, itês just the way I was raised. My parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them."
Penny,"Uh, thatês so silly."
Sheldon,"Itês actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it. "
Penny,"What was it called, _I hate my son and thatês why he canêt have cake?î "
Sheldon,"It was obviously effective, Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. Perhaps if sheêd also denied him Christmas heêd be a little better at it. "
Leonard,Thank you.
Howard,"Well I love birthdays, waking up to Momês special French Toast breakfast, wearing the birthday king crown, playing laser tag with all my friends."
Penny,"Yeah, see, thatês what kids should have. "
Howard,Actually that was last year. 
Penny,So youêve really never had a birthday party? 
Leonard,"But it was okay. I mean, when I was little Iêd think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson, and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering, and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favourite."
Leonard,"Uh, it turns out my grandfather had died.  "
Penny,"Oh my God, thatês terrible. "
Leonard,"Oh, it was kind of like a birthday party. I got to see all my cousins and there was cake, soÑ7"
Penny,Thatês the saddest thing Iêve ever heard. 
Howard,"You think? Go ahead, tell her about your senior prom. "
Howard,Make sure they remember no peanuts.
Leonard,"Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you canêt eat peanuts. They see me coming they go _ah, no peanut boy!î"
Sheldon,Hello Penny. Leonard just left.
Penny,I know. I want to talk to you. 
Sheldon,"What would we talk about? Weêve no overlapping areas of interest Iêm aware of, and you know I donêt care for chit-chat. "
Penny,"Okay, can you just let me in."
Sheldon,"Well alright, but I donêt see this as a promising endeavour."
Penny,"Okay, hereês the deal, we are going to throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on Saturday."
Sheldon,"I hardly think so, Leonard made it very clear he doesnêt want a party."
Howard,Did someone say party? 
Penny,He just doesnêt know he wants one because heês never had one. 
Howard,"I suppose thatês possible, but for the record, Iêve never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one."
Penny,"Howard, hereês the difference. The possibility exists that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over. "
Howard,"Fine. If I do have a threesome, you canêt be part of it. Iêm just kidding, yes you can. Can you bring a friend? "
Sheldon,I think a birthday party is a terrible idea. I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish. 
Sheldon,"Year after year, I had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles, not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation. "
Penny,"Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw Leonard a birthday party. "
Sheldon,"Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity. "
Penny,Nevertheless we areÑ.
Sheldon,In addition I really donêt think that Leonard wants aÑ
Penny,"Okay, hereês the deal, you either help me throw Leonard a birthday party or, so help me God, I will go into your bedroom and I will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. And on one of them, you wonêt know which, Iêll draw a tiny happy face in ink. "
Sheldon,"You canêt do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book itês no longer mint."
Penny,"Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?"
Sheldon,"Well of course IÑ oh! Yeah, I have an idea, letês throw Leonard a kick ass birthday party."
Sheldon,Thatês not the secret knock. This is the secret knock. 
Howard,What difference does it make?
Sheldon,The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of oneês co-conspirators. 
Penny,Is that Raj and Howard?
Sheldon,"Possibly, but unverified."
Howard,Can you just let us in.
Sheldon,Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor. 
Penny,"So, what did you get the birthday boy?"
Howard,"Well, Raj got him an awesome limited edition Dark Knight sculpture based on Alex Rossês definitive Batman, and I got him this amazing autographed copy of the Feynman lectures on physics."
Penny,Nice. I got him a sweater. 
Howard,"Okay, well, he might like that, Iêve seen himÑ chilly. "
Penny,"Uh, Sheldon, I didnêt see your present."
Sheldon,Thatês because I didnêt bring one.
Penny,Well why not? 
Howard,Donêt ask.
Sheldon,The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.
Howard,Too late.
Sheldon,"Letês say that I go out and I spend fifty dollars on you, itês a laborious activity, because I have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. Now I can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. And I ask you, is it worth it? "
Howard,Told you not to ask. 
Penny,"Well, Sheldon, youêre his friend. Friends give each other presents."
Sheldon,"I accept your premise, I reject your conclusion."
Howard,Try telling him itês a non-optional social convention. 
Howard,Just do it. 
Penny,Itês a non-optional social convention.
Sheldon,Oh. Fair enough. 
Howard,He came with a manual. 
Sheldon,"Question, how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I donêt drive, and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station. I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers. "
Penny,"Okay, letês do this, um, I will drive Sheldon to get a present, and Howard, you need to get rid of Leonard for about two hours. "
Howard,No problem.
Penny,"And then Raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up."
Howard,What if guests show up?
Penny,Entertain them.
Howard,What if theyêre women?
Penny,Stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable. 
Leonard,Hey. 
Howard,Howês it going?
Leonard,Fine. 
Howard,"So, listen, the New Art is showing the revised definitive cut of Blade Runner."
Leonard,Seen it.
Howard,"No, youêve seen the 25th anniversary final cut. This one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage. They say it completely changes the tone of the film. "
Leonard,Oh. Pass. 
Howard,"Come on, afterwards thereês a Q & A with Harrison Fordês body double. "
Leonard,"Look, I am in the Halo battle of my life here, thereês this kid in Copenhagen, he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24/7."
Howard,Canêt you play him some other time?
Leonard,Not if you believe his doctors. 
Howard,"Oh my God, do you smell gas."
Howard,"Yeah, no. "
Penny,"Alright, you know they have DVDs over there."
Sheldon,"Yes, but they have DVD burners over here. Leonard needs a DVD burner. "
Penny,"Sheldon, a gift shouldnêt be something someone needs, it should be something fun, you know, something they wouldnêt buy for themselves."
Sheldon,"You mean, like a sweater? "
Penny,"Well, itês a fun sweater, itês got a bold geometric print. "
Sheldon,Is it the geometry that makes it fun.
Penny,"Okay, the point is, one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them. "
Sheldon,"Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner."
Sheldon,"Something he wouldnêt buy for himself. Something fun. Something likeÑ oh, an 802.11n wireless router. "
Leonard,"Here you go, Copenhagen boy, how about a taste of Hans Christian Hand Grenade.  Come on, come on, oh you clever littleÑ. Come on, come on, take that! "
Leonard,Whatês the matter?
Howard,"This granola bar, thereês peanuts in it."
Leonard,"Oh my God, why did you eat it?"
Howard,"I donêt know, it was just there."
Leonard,"Well if I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself? "
Howard,"Donêt yell at me, Iêve got to go to the emergency room. "
Howard,"No, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket. "
Leonard,"Alright, um, just, uh, let me get my keys."
Howard,"Oh God, oh God, oh God, ohÑ.  Okay Sheldon, what was it supposed to be? Fine, itês out of the washer. Iêll call you when itês in the dryer. "
Sheldon,What do you think.
Penny,"Um, that one. "
Sheldon,Because of the two additional Ethernet ports.
Sheldon,"He doesnêt need them, heês already got a 640 connect switch "
Penny,"Oh, okay then this one. "
Penny,"I donêt know, the man on the box looks so happy. "
Sheldon,"Penny! If Iêm going to buy Leonard a gift, Iêm going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did. "
Penny,"Oh, I know Iêm going to regret this but, what trauma? "
Sheldon,"On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge, so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes. "
Penny,Of course.
Sheldon,"Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought meÑ wow, this is hard. They got meÑ a motorised dirt bike. "
Penny,No? 
Sheldon,What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike? 
Penny,All of them.
Sheldon,Huh? 
Penny,"Okay, so weêre getting this one?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, I suppose. "
Penny,"Okay, letês go."
Sheldon,I know everything about this stuff.
Penny,"Here, buy this one. Look, itês the one weêre getting, see, happy guy available. "
Sheldon,"No, no, no, no, she doesnêt want that, she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender."
Sheldon,It depends on what Bus you have.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear lord."
Penny,"Sheldon, we have to go."
Sheldon,"Not now, Penny, this poor man needs me.  You hold on, Iêll be right with you. What computer do you have, and please donêt say a white one?"
Howard,Excuse me.
Howard,"No, listen, see weêre throwing my friend a surprise party and Iêm supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours."
Howard,"No, see, the only way I could get him to leave is to tell him I ate a peanut. Because Iêm allergic to peanuts. "
Howard,"Look, all I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a band-aid so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour, hour and a half. "
Howard,"No, you donêt understand."
Howard,"Okay, I get it, I know how the world works, how about if I were to introduce you  to the man who freed your people. "
Leonard,"Hey, sorry I couldnêt find a parking spot, how are you doing."
Howard,"Bad, very bad. "
Leonard,"Really, ‚cos you donêt look like youêre swelling up at all, maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home. "
Howard,We canêt go home. 
Leonard,Why not?
Howard,"Becauth  Becauth-th-th. Brissket, Brissket! Water, need water. "
Leonard,"Alright, Iêll be right back. "
Howard,"Penny, look, Iêve got a problem."
Penny,"Yeah, well so do I, look youêve got to stall Leonard a little longer."
Howard,I donêt think I can. 
Penny,"You have to, we all have to be there at the same time to yell _surprise!î "
Howard,"Okay, you have to understand something, weêre in a hospital right now. "
Penny,"Why, is Leonard okay."
Howard,"Leonardês fine. Iêm fine, thanks for asking, by the way. "
Penny,"Okay, I donêt need your attitude, just hold him there a little longer. "
Howard,"Look, Iêve done my best but he wants to go home and I donêt know how to stop him. "
Penny,"Okay, how about this. You keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party Iêll point out which of my friends are easy. "
Howard,"Donêt toy with me, woman. "
Penny,"Iêve got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, Iêve got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic whoês two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat. "
Howard,Thy will be done. 
Sheldon,"Okay, we donêt have that in stock, but I can special order it for you."
Sheldon,"Yes, well, apparently neither does anyone else. "
Penny,"Sheldon, we have to go."
Penny,"Well, for one thing, weêre late for Leonardês birthday party. And for another, I told him to call security. "
Penny,Keep walking.
Sheldon,"Yeah, 1-2-3-4 is not a secure password. "
Leonard,"Excuse me, my friend is having an allergic reaction to peanuts."
Leonard,Yes he is.
Howard,Pees hep me! 
Howard,Fank-u. 
Leonard,"Say what you will about the healthcare system in this country, but when theyêre afraid of lawsuits they sure test everything. "
Howard,I really donêt think the colonoscopy was necessary. 
Leonard,"You know, before you got all swollen up, I actually thought you were trying to keep me out of the apartment so you could throw me a surprise party. "
Howard,"Oh, right, itês your birthday, I had no idea it was your birthday, I completely forgot, wow, what a lousy way to spend a birthday, well itês all over now."
Leonard,"There is a party, isnêt there."
Leonard,Howard. 
Howard,Are you mad?
Leonard,how could I be mad? You actually risked your life because you cared about me.
Howard,"Yeah, thatês why I did it. "
Leonard,Alright. Here we go. My first birthday party. 
Raj,Dude! Everybody left an hour ago! Surprise! 
Raj,"Okay Leonard, here I am at your birthday party, I donêt know where you are dude, but itês really kick-ass. Everyone is very very drunk, and uhÑ  Oh look, thereês a girl taking her shirt off. "
Penny,"Thatês my friend Carol. Remind me, Iêve got to introduce her to Howard. "
Raj,"Oh sweet Krishna, shake it, that-a rupee maker."
Penny,Iêm so sorry you didnêt get your party.
Leonard,"Oh, itês okay."
Penny,Happy birthday anyways. 
Leonard,"Hey Penny, when, uh, whenês your birthday?"
Sheldon,Wo de zhing shi Sheldon.
Howard,"No, itês Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon. "
Sheldon,Wo de ming zi shi Sheldon. 
Howard,Whatês this? 
Sheldon,Thatês what you did. I assumed as in a number of languages that the gesture was part of the phrase.
Howard,Well itês not.
Sheldon,How am I supposed to know that? As the teacher itês your obligation to separate your personal idiosyncrasies from the subject matter. 
Howard,"You know, Iêm really glad you decided to learn Mandarin."
Howard,Once youêre fluent youêll have a billion more people to annoy instead of me. 
Leonard,Hey! 
Sheldon,Mai du lui tsa.
Howard,You just called Leonard a syphilitic donkey. 
Sheldon,"My apologies Leonard, Iêm only as good as my teacher. "
Leonard,Why are you learning Chinese?
Sheldon,I believe the Szechuan Palace has been passing off orange chicken as tangerine chicken and I intend to confront them. 
Leonard,"If I were you, Iêd be more concerned by what theyêre passing off as chicken. "
Penny,I need to use your window.
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, no, sure, go ahead. "
Leonard,Whatês going on?
Penny,"Oh, Iêll tell you whatês going on, that stupid self-centred bastard wrote about our sex life in his blog. "
Sheldon,"Okay, where were we? "
Howard,"Not now, I have a blog to find. "
Leonard,"Penny, are you okay?"
Penny,"Iêm fine, Leonard, just go away."
Leonard,"Look, I understand that breaking up with someone can be very painfulÑ."
Penny,GO AWAY!
Leonard,"Okay, feel better, bye.  She doesnêt want to talk. "
Sheldon,"Not surprising. Pennyês emotional responses originate from the primitive portion of the brain known as the Amygdala, while speech is centred in the much more recently developed Neocortex. The former can easily overpower the latter giving scientific credence to the notion of being rendered speechless.  Or maybe she just doesnêt want to talk. "
Raj,"Hey, look, I found an iPod. "
Howard,"Itês smashed beyond repair, what are you going to do with it?"
Raj,What else? Sell it on ebay as slightly used. 
Leonard,"It was Pennyês boyfriendês, they broke up."
Howard,"Apparently he posted intimate details of their physical relationship on his blog, which I cannot find anywhere. "
Leonard,"You know what, Iêm going to go back and try talking to her again."
Howard,"Good idea. Sit with her, hold her, comfort her, and if the moment feels right, see if you can cop a feel. "
Leonard,"Iêm not going to do that, Howard."
Sheldon,Iêm not aware of any social convention that requires you to intervene at all.
Leonard,What about _damsel in distress?î
Sheldon,"Twelfth century code of chivalry, not exactly current. Youêd also have to be knighted for that to apply. "
Leonard,"I donêt care. Sheês upset, Iêm going over there. "
Howard,Remember to sit on your hands a bit so theyêre warm. 
Leonard,"Iêm her friend, Iêm not going to take advantage of her vulnerability."
Howard,"so youêre saying that if in the depths of despair she throws herself at you and demands you take her, right there, right now, youêll just walk away?"
Leonard,I said Iêm her friend. Not her gay friend. 
Leonard,"Hey, listen, I know you said that you didnêt want to talkÑ"
Penny,I donêt. 
Penny,Wait. 
Leonard,"Wait, did you say wait?"
Penny,Tell me the truth. Am I just an idiot who picks giant losers? 
Penny,"Okay, so I pick good guys, but turn them into losers. "
Leonard,Of course not.
Penny,"Well, itês got to be one or the other, which is it?"
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, what were the choices again? "
Penny,"I really thought Mike was different, I thought he was sensitive and smart. I mean, not you smart, normal non-freaky smart. "
Leonard,"Yeah, no, sure."
Penny,"You know, and then he just goes and has to humiliate me by writing about me on his blog so the entire world can read it."
Leonard,Actually itês not all that easy to find. 
Penny,"Yeah, really, well my friends at work found it, my sister found it, judging by my email a number of prisoners at the Michigan State Penitentiary found it. "
Leonard,"Okay, well, what exactly did this guy write, not that I need to know the details of your sex life, I just thoughtÑ. never mind. "
Penny,"Nope, you know what, you might as well read it, everybody else has, go ahead. Oh God, I just feel so betrayed and embarrassed. I just want to crawl into a hole and die."
Leonard,"Okay, well, you know, this isnêt that bad. It just paints the picture of a very affectionate woman whoês open to expressing her affection in non traditional locales. "
Penny,Oh God!
Leonard,"Elevators, parks, movie theatres, out of curiosity, is this subway the transportation system or subway the sandwich shop? "
Penny,Sandwich shop.
Leonard,Doesnêt that violate the health code?
Penny,"No, at the sub shop we were only making out. "
Leonard,Huh. Okay. But my point is that you have absolutely no reason to be embarrassed. 
Penny,"Really, do you think I overreacted?"
Leonard,Maybe a little.
Penny,"‚Cause I do that, I do overreact. Maybe I should call Mike and apologise."
Leonard,"No, no, that, that would be underreacting. He did break the implied confidentiality of the bedroom and, in your case, the elevator, parks and fast food franchise."
Penny,Yes. Youêre right. I should just say Iêm done with him. 
Leonard,"Yes, you should, go ahead, say it. "
Penny,But I never gave the man a chance to explain. 
Leonard,"What is there to explain, itês all right here, itês a betrayal. "
Penny,"No, you were right the first time, this is a man who loves me, but in his own stupid way he was just trying to show people how he feels. "
Leonard,Iêm pretty sure I never said that. 
Penny,"No, you did better than that, you helped me see it on my own. "
Leonard,"Aw, good for me. Where are you going?"
Penny,"Iêm going over to Mikeês. Leonard, thank you so much."
Leonard,"Oh, sure. Huh, maybe I am her gay friend. "
Sheldon,"Howard, Iêm going to need another Mandarin lesson. I obviously didnêt make my point with those people. "
Howard,"For Godês sake, Sheldon, if you donêt like the tangerine chicken, donêt order the tangerine chicken."
Sheldon,"I like tangerine chicken, Iêm not getting tangerine chicken."
Leonard,Can we please change the subject.
Raj,Sure. Tell us again how you screwed up and got Penny back together with her old boyfriend.
Leonard,Just roll the dice. 
Raj,"Enslaved by warlocks, stay here till you roll 2, 4 or 6Ñ7"
Leonard,"She was mad at him. She was done with him, the relationship was broken beyond repair and I walked over there and I fixed it!"
Howard,"Boy, that story gets better every time you hear it. "
Sheldon,"Actually, I thought the first two renditions were far more compelling. Previously I felt sympathy for the Leonard character, now I just find him to be whiny and annoying. "
Leonard,Just eat your tangerine chicken. 
Sheldon,"Iêd love to, but I donêt have tangerine chicken. "
Raj,Incredible. You managed to screw up the screw-up. 
Leonard,Iêm back. 
Penny,Iêm sorry I yelled at you. Itês not your fault. 
Leonard,What happened?
Penny,"Well, I went over to Mikeês to make up with him."
Leonard,"Yeah, I know, I know that part. "
Penny,But he had already moved on.
Leonard,"Already, that was quick."
Penny,Thatês what I said to the woman who had her legs wrapped around his neck. 
Leonard,"Oh, Penny, I am so sorry."
Penny,How could he do that.
Leonard,"Oh, well, you know, you did throw an 8 gig iPodÑ yeah, no, how could he do that. "
Penny,"I swear to God, I am done with guys like that. You know, macho, with the perfect body and the hair, and the money."
Leonard,"Yeah, that must get old quick. "
Penny,"You know, just once, I would like to go out with someone who is nice, and honest, and who actually cares about me. "
Leonard,What about me?
Penny,What about you what?
Leonard,What about if you went out with me?
Penny,Are you asking me out?
Leonard,UmÑ yesÑ I amÑ asking you out. 
Leonard,I was just going off your comment about the nice guyÑ
Penny,"No, I know, I got that. Yeah, totally."
Leonard,"Ñthing and honest but, itês no big dealÑ"
Penny,Yes. 
Leonard,Yes what? 
Penny,"Yes, I will go out with you. "
Penny,"Yeah. Why not, I mean, what do I have to lose?"
Leonard,Yeah. Thatês the spirit. 
Sheldon,"Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me your citrus peels. Gei wo kan, ni jud di zi pei. Show me yourÑ"
Sheldon,Aieee ya! Xia si wo le. 
Penny,"Iêm sorry. Look, do you have a second."
Sheldon,A second what? Pair of underwear? 
Penny,I was just wondering if I could talk to you? Itês about Leonard.
Sheldon,Why me? Why not Koothrappali or Wolowitz?
Penny,"Well, Raj canêt talk to me unless heês drunk, and Wolowitz is, you know, disgusting. "
Sheldon,"Yes, I suppose he is. "
Penny,"All Iêm saying is, you know Leonard the best. "
Sheldon,"Not necessarily. Iêm often surprised by my lack of familiarity with Leonard. Just the other day I discovered, he not only has a loofah, he hides it. Why do you suppose a man would be ashamed of having a loofah? I myself prefer to have my excess epithelial cells slough off naturally, but I donêt condemn those who seek to accelerate the process.  "
Penny,"Leonard might come home, can we talk in my apartment. "
Sheldon,Weêre not done? 
Sheldon,"Ach, why not? Weêre already through the looking glass anyway. "
Penny,"Okay, so, hereês the thing. I guess youêre aware that Leonard asked me out. "
Sheldon,"Well, he didnêt actually say anything, but when he came back to the apartment he was doing a dance that brought to mind the happy hippos in Fantasia. "
Penny,"Oh, thatês nice. Anyhow, the thing I wanted to talk to you about is, you know, since Leonard and I have become friends, I was justÑ want to sit down? "
Sheldon,"Oh, I wish it were that simple. You see, I donêt spend much time here and so Iêve never really chosen a place to sit. "
Penny,"Well, choose."
Sheldon,"There are a number of options and, Iêm really not familiar enough with the cushion densities, air flow patterns and dispersion of sunlight to make an informed choice."
Penny,"Alright, why donêt you just pick one at random, and then if you donêt like it you can sit somewhere else next time. "
Sheldon,"No, no, thatês crazy. You go ahead and talk while I figure it out. "
Penny,"Okay. Um, hereês the thing. So, Iêve known for a while now that Leonard has had a little crush on meÑ"
Sheldon,"A little crush? Well I suppose so, in the same way Menelaus had a little crush on Helen of Troy. "
Penny,"Alright, yeah, I donêt really know who they areÑ"
Sheldon,Well Menelaus was the brother of AgamemnonÑ
Penny,"Yeah, I donêt care, I donêt care. The point is Leonard isnêt the kind of guy I usually go out with."
Sheldon,Leonard isnêt the kind of guy anyone usually goes out with. Would you be open to rotating the couch clockwise thirty degrees? 
Penny,"What Iêm saying is, Leonard might be different in a good way. Obviously my usual choices have not worked out so well. "
Sheldon,"The last one worked out well for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod. Oh, glare! "
Penny,"But on the other hand, if things donêt go well with Leonard, I risk losing a really good friend. I mean, I guess heês not looking for a fling, heês the kind of guy that gets into a relationship for, I donêt know, like you would say light years. "
Sheldon,"I would not say that. No-one would say that, a light year is a unit of distance, not time. "
Penny,Thank you for the clarification. 
Sheldon,"Draft. You see people hear the word year and they think duration. Foot pound has the same problem, thatês a unit of work, not of weight."
Penny,"Right, thanks."
Sheldon,Itês a common mistake.
Penny,Not the first one Iêve made today. 
Sheldon,Okay. I think this will be my seat. 
Penny,"Sheldon, do you have anything to say that has anything to do with, you know, what Iêm talking about. "
Sheldon,"Well, letês see. We might consider Schrodingerês Cat. "
Penny,Schrodinger? Is that the woman in 2A?
Sheldon,"Thatês Mrs Grossinger. And she doesnêt have a cat, she has a Mexican hairless, annoying little animal, yip yip yip yipÑ"
Penny,Sheldon! 
Sheldon,"Sorry, you diverted me. Anyway, in 1935, Erwin Schrodinger, in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time. Now, since no-one knows when or if the poison has been released, until the box is opened, the cat can be thought of as both alive and dead. "
Penny,"Iêm sorry, I donêt get the point. "
Sheldon,"Well of course you donêt get it, I havenêt made it yet. Youêd have to be psychic to get it, and thereês no such thing as psychic."
Penny,"Sheldon, whatês the point? "
Sheldon,"Just like Schrodingerês Cat, your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad. It is only by opening the box that youêll find out which it is. "
Penny,"Okay, so youêre saying I should go out with Leonard. "
Sheldon,"No, no, no, no, no, no. Let me start again. In 1935, Erwin SchrodingerÑ"
Leonard,Two seats right there. 
Leonard,"Sheldon, I think Iêve made a mistake. "
Sheldon,"I can see that. Unless youêre planning on running a marathon, choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch filled redundancy."
Leonard,"No, itês about Penny."
Sheldon,"A mistake involving Penny? Okay, youêll have to narrow it down. "
Leonard,I donêt think I can go out with her tonight. 
Sheldon,Then donêt.
Leonard,Other people would say _why not?î 
Sheldon,Other people might be interested. 
Leonard,Iêm going to talk anyway.
Sheldon,I assumed you would. 
Leonard,"Now that Iêm actually about to go out with Penny, Iêm not excited, Iêm nauseous. "
Sheldon,"Ah, then your meal choice is appropriate. Starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion. "
Sheldon,"You also made a common grammatical mistake, you said nauseous when you meant nauseated. But go on. "
Leonard,"Sheldon, this date is probably my one chance with Penny, what happens if I blow it. "
Sheldon,"Well, if we accept your premise, and also accept the highly improbable assumption that Penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely, bitter old man with no progeny. The image of any number of evil lighthouse keepers from Scooby Doo cartoons comes to mind. "
Leonard,Youêre not helping. 
Sheldon,"Alright, what response on my part would bring this conversation to a speedy conclusion?"
Leonard,Tell me whether or not to go through with the date.
Sheldon,Schrodingerês Cat.
Leonard,"Wow, thatês brilliant."
Sheldon,"You sound surprised. Mmm, hou zi shui zai li du.  "
Penny,come on in.
Leonard,Thank you. You look very nice.
Penny,Thank you. So do you. 
Leonard,I made an eight oêclock reservation.
Penny,"Okay, great, listen, um, maybe we should talk first. "
Leonard,"Oh. Okay. But before you say anything, have you ever heard of Schrodingerês Cat? "
Penny,"Actually, Iêve heard far too much about Schrodingerês Cat. "
Penny,"Alright, the catês alive, letês go to dinner. "
Sheldon,Show me your mucus! Your mucus! 
Sheldon,This is not a tangerine bicycle. 
Leonard,"So you see, what youêre eating is not technically yoghurt, because it doesnêt have enough live acidophilus cultures. Itês really just iced milk with carragenin added for thickness. "
Penny,"Oh, thatês very interesting."
Leonard,Itês also not pink and has no berries.
Penny,"Yeah, but it doesnêt really answer my question."
Leonard,What was your question again?
Penny,Do you want some.
Leonard,"Oh, right, no, Iêm lactose intolerant."
Leonard,"So, gas."
Penny,Got it. 
Leonard,"Well, good night. "
Penny,What are you doing?
Leonard,There was a draft.
Penny,I didnêt feel a draft. 
Leonard,Why donêt we just go into yourÑ.
Penny,"Oh, yeah, you know what, maybe we should just slow things down a little."
Leonard,"No, no, I didnêt mean to go into your apartment toÑ go fast. "
Penny,"No, I know, IÑ I know what you meant, itês justÑ itês only our first date."
Leonard,"Yeah, okay, sure, no problem, why donêt we just figure out where weêre going, and when we want to get there, and then rate of speed equals distance over time. Solve for R."
Penny,Or we could just wing it. 
Leonard,That might work too. 
Penny,Goodnight Leonard.
Raj,Heês coming. Screen saver. 
Howard,"Oh, hey, Leonard, how was your date?"
Leonard,"Bite me. Sheldon, how could you just sit there and let them spy on me?"
Sheldon,"They were clever, Leonard. They exploited my complete lack of interest in what you were doing. "
Howard,"You should thank us. When future generations try to determine why your relationship with Penny crashed and burned, this right here is the black box. "
Leonard,"What are you talking about, the date went fine. "
Raj,"Dude, she said she wants to slow things down."
Leonard,"Okay, so, she said she wants to slow things down. Itês like saying _Iêm really enjoying this meal, Iêm going to slow down and savour it.î "
Howard,"No, itês like _this fish tastes bad, so Iêm going to slow down and spit it out.î"
Raj,You being the fish.
Leonard,Iêm not the fish. 
Howard,"Oh really, did you make a second date."
Leonard,"Well, we sort of decided to wing it. "
Sheldon,"Oh, even I know thatês lame. "
Leonard,"Okay, alright, letês assume your hypothesis. We went to dinner, we talked, we laughed, we kissed, where could I have possibly gone wrong. "
Howard,"Think back, Leonard, the littlest things can set women off. Like, hey, the waitress is hot, I bet we could get her to come home with us. Or, how much does your mom weigh, I want to know what Iêm getting into."
Leonard,I didnêt say anything like that.
Howard,"Good, ‚cos they donêt work. "
Raj,"They also donêt care for it if you stare at them and hyperventilate. Sadly, thatês my home run swing. "
Leonard,"Look, everything went fine. I didnêt even have to refer to my impromptu conversation starters. The woman across the hall is into me. "
Howard,"Letês go to the tape. Look at her reaction to the goodnight kiss, no change in respiration, pupils un-dilated, no flushing of the chest."
Raj,"Nice close up, by the way. "
Sheldon,"Interesting, her jaws are clenched, no tongue access, clearly a bad sign amongst mating humans. "
Leonard,Thatês not a bad sign.
Sheldon,"Please, you might as well have been two iguana with no dewlap enlargement. "
Raj,"And the worst sign of all is, youêre here and not there. "
Leonard,"Iêm not there because Iêm taking things slow. Which, by the way, compared to you guys approaches warp speed. And take down that camera. "
Raj,He was a lot more fun when he had no hope. 
Howard,Give him time.
Sheldon,"Oh, hi Penny. FYI, the hot water is inadequate on machine 2 so colours only, and 4 is still releasing the fabric softener too early in the cycle so Iêd avoid using that for your delicates. "
Sheldon,"Oh, good Lord. Why donêt you just take your clothes down to the river and beat them with a rock? "
Penny,"Sheldon, may I ask you a question? "
Sheldon,"I would prefer that you not, but I wonêt go so far as to forbid it. "
Penny,"Alright, I heard yes, soÑ okay, hereês my question, has Leonard ever dated, you know, a regular girl. "
Sheldon,Well I assume youêre not referring to digestive regularity? Because Iêve come to learn that such inquiries are inappropriate. 
Penny,"No, I meant has he ever been involved with someone who wasnêt a braniac? "
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, a few years ago he did go out with a woman who had a PhD in French Literature. "
Penny,How is that not a braniac? 
Sheldon,"Well, for one thing, she was French. For another, it was literature. "
Penny,"So, do you think that if Leonard and I keep dating heêll eventually get bored with me. "
Sheldon,That depends.
Penny,On what? 
Sheldon,Do you have a working knowledge of quantum physics? 
Sheldon,Do you speak Klingon? 
Sheldon,Do you know any card tricks?
Penny,"Okay, okay, you know, I get it, Leonard has no business being involved with a waitress slash actress who felt so insecure that she lied to him about finishing community college. "
Sheldon,Why would you lie about that?
Penny,"Well, he was going on and on about this college and that grad school and I didnêt want him to think I was some stupid loser. "
Sheldon,You thought the opposite of stupid loser was community college graduate? 
Penny,"You know, there are a lot of successful people in this country who are community college graduates. "
Sheldon,"Yeah, but you were neither. "
Penny,"Right, okay look, this is between you and me, you cannot tell Leonard any of this. "
Sheldon,Youêre asking me to keep a secret?
Sheldon,"Well Iêm sorry, but you would have had to express that desire before revealing the secret, so that I could choose whether or not I wanted to accept the covenant of secret keeping. You canêt impose a secret on an ex post facto basis. "
Sheldon,"Secret keeping is a complicated endeavour. One has to be concerned not only about what one says, but about facial expression, autonomic reflexes, when I try to deceive, I myself have more nervous tics than a lyme disease research facility.  Itês a joke. It relies on the hominymic relationship between tick the blood-sucking arachnid, and tic the involuntary muscular contraction. I made it up myself. "
Penny,"Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied, I will absolutely die of embarrassment. "
Sheldon,Physiologically impossible.
Penny,"Oh Sheldon, please, look, Iêm asking you as a friend. "
Sheldon,So youêre saying that friendship contains within it an inherent obligation to maintain confidences?
Penny,"Well, yeah. "
Sheldon,"Interesting. See, one more question, and perhaps I should have led with this, when did we become friends? "
Sheldon,"I.e, I couldnêt become Green Lantern unless I was chosen by the guardians of Oa, but given enough start-up capital and an adequate research facility, I could be Batman."
Leonard,You could be Batman?
Sheldon,Sure.  Iêm Batman. See.
Penny,Hi guys.
Sheldon,Hi Penny.
Leonard,"Hey, Penny, if youêre not doing anything Friday night I thought maybe we could go and see a movie. "
Penny,"Oh, um, you know, I think I have the dinner shift on Friday."
Leonard,What about Saturday?
Penny,"You know, Iêm not sure, the manager hasnêt posted the schedule yet, how about I let you know."
Leonard,"Great. So you just let me know when you know. SoÑ  Oh God, I am the bad fish! What did I do wrong?"
Sheldon,"Why are you asking me, I have no information about your interactions with Penny other than what you provided me, nor do I have any method of learning such things.  "
Leonard,What does that mean?
Sheldon,Nothing. You seem to be implying an informational back channel between me and Penny where obviously none exists.
Leonard,No I didnêt.
Sheldon,"I just think you need to be careful how you phrase things, sir. "
Leonard,Whatês going on with you?
Sheldon,Well I might ask you the same question. Why do you insist on attempting to drag me into matters which have nothing to do with me? But exist between you and Penny. A person to whom I barely speak.  
Leonard,Whatês wrong with your face? 
Sheldon,"Thereês no reason to bring my looks into this. Good day, Leonard."
Sheldon,I said Good Day! 
Leonard,Good day? 
Penny,"Also today we have a fresh caught Alaska salmon, and thatês served with a teriyaki glaze and sticky rice. Our soup of the dayÑ"
Sheldon,You must release me from my oath. 
Penny,"Sheldon, Iêm working."
Sheldon,Why donêt you take a minute to decide  I canêt keep your secret Penny. Iêm going to fold like an energy based anobo protein in conformational space. Like a renaissance triptych. Like a cheap suit.
Penny,"Oh, look, why is it so hard for you to keep one little secret?"
Sheldon,"Iêm constitutionally incapable. Thatês why I was refused clearance for a very prestigious government research fellowship at a secret military supercollider, located beneath a fake agricultural station 12.5 miles south east of Travers City, Michigan. Which you did not hear about from me. "
Penny,"Look, just forget I told you about me not graduating from community college. Okay?"
Sheldon,Forget! You want me to forget? This mind does not forget. I havenêt forgotten a single thing since the day my mother stopped breast feeding me. It was a drizzly Tuesday.
Penny,"Okay, look, you promised me you would keep my secret so youêre just going to have to figure out a way to do it."
Sheldon,"Leonard, Iêm moving out. "
Leonard,"What do you mean, youêre moving out? Why? "
Sheldon,There doesnêt have to be a reason. 
Leonard,"Yeah, there kind of does."
Sheldon,"Not necessarily. This is a classic example of munchausenês trilemma. Either the reason is predicated on a series of sub-reasons leading to an infinite regression, or it tracks back to arbitrary axiomatic statements, or itês ultimately circular, i.e., Iêm moving out because Iêm moving out. "
Leonard,Iêm still confused.
Sheldon,"Leonard, I donêt see how I could have made it any simpler. "
Howard,"Hey, quêest qêwass up?"
Raj,We just got back from that exhibit of those plasticised human cadavers.
Howard,And some of those skinless chicks were hot. 
Sheldon,"If youêll excuse me, Iêm going to pack. "
Howard,Thatês kind of an overreaction to a little harmless necrophilia. 
Leonard,"Itês not you, Howard, he says heês moving out. "
Raj,What did you do? Did you change the contrast or brightness settings on the television?
Raj,Did you take a band aid off in front of him? 
Howard,"Did you buy generic ketchup, forget to rinse the sink, talk to him through the bathroom door? "
Raj,"Adjust the thermostat, cook with cilantro, pronounce the T in often? "
Howard,Did you make fun of trains? 
Leonard,"I didnêt do anything, heês just gone insane."
Raj,"Well, we all knew this day was coming. "
Leonard,That was fast. 
Sheldon,Itês my pre-packed disaster evacuation bag. Recommended by the department of homeland security. And Sarah Connor. 
Leonard,Where are you gonna live? 
Sheldon,Until I find a permanent place I will stay with friends. 
Howard, 
Raj,"Well you canêt stay with me, I have a teeny tiny apartment. "
Sheldon,"Excuse me, but isnêt hosting guests an aspect of Menushya Yajna, one of the five central religious duties or sacrifices of the Hindu householder? "
Raj,I hate trains. 
Sheldon,"Donêt be ridiculous, you love trains. "
Raj,"Yes I do, come on. See you later Leonard. "
Leonard,This could work. 
Sheldon,This is a very old building. 
Raj,Sixty years. Used to be a watch factory. 
Sheldon,Donêt you worry about the residual radium from the luminous dials?
Raj,Not until now. 
Sheldon,"I canêt believe I didnêt bring my gieger counter. You know, I had it on my bed and I didnêt pack it. "
Raj,"Well, if youêre not comfortable staying here, SheldonÑ"
Sheldon,"Iêm kidding, I packed it. It was a joke, I was subverting the conversational expectations. I believe they call that the, um, old switcheroo. "
Raj,Terrific. 
Sheldon,Is that woman Aishwarya Rai?
Raj,"Yes, isnêt she an amazing actress."
Sheldon,"Actually, Iêd say sheês a poor manês Madhuri Dixit. "
Raj,How dare you. Aishwarya Rai is a Goddess. By comparison Madhuri Dixit is a leprous prostitute.
Sheldon,"Sorry, I didnêt mean to offend you. Obviously youêre not that familiar with Indian cinema. "
Howard,Who is it?
Raj,Tag. Youêre it.  
Howard,Shouldnêt you have put him in a brown paper bag and set him on fire? 
Sheldon,Iêve never slept on an air mattress before. No lumbar support whatsoever. 
Howard,Maybe youêd be happier on a park bench? 
Sheldon,I donêt see any way to get a park bench in here.
Howard,Do you want to switch?
Sheldon,"No, thatês fine. Iêm perfectly comfortable sleeping on a bouncy castle. "
Howard,"Get out of bed, weêre switching."
Sheldon,"Now, only if you want to."
Howard,Just get in the bed!
Howard,Weêre just talking ma. 
Howard,"For Godês sake, ma, Iêm 27 years old. Itês not even a school night!  Comfy now?"
Sheldon,Meh. That poster of Halle Berryês a little unnerving. 
Howard,So donêt look at it.
Sheldon,Sheês like my fourth favourite catwoman.
Howard,No kidding?
Sheldon,"Yeah, Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt and then her. "
Howard,What about Lee Meriwether?
Sheldon,"Oh, I forgot about Lee Meriwether."
Howard,Well Iêm glad thatês settled. 
Sheldon,"That makes Halle Berry my fifth favourite catwoman. Thereês Julie Newmar, Michelle Pfieffer, Eartha Kitt, Lee MeriwetherÑ"
Howard,"Please, Iêm begging you, go to sleep."
Sheldon,"Iêm trying, Iêm counting catwomen. She did make a fine mutant in the X-Men movies though."
Howard,Oh for Godês sake.
Sheldon,"But sheês not my favourite of the X-Men, in order that would be Wolverine, Cyclops, oh wait, I forgot Professor X. Professor X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, Angel, the Beast, oh wait, Nightcrawler. Professor X, Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, then Storm, AngelÑ."
Leonard,Iêm coming! 
Sheldon,"Hey, there he is, thereês my old buddy-bud-bud. "
Leonard,Whatês with him?
Howard,"Koothrappali dumped him on me, and he couldnêt get to sleep, so I gave him a glass of warm milk with a handful of my momês valium in it. But he still wouldnêt shut up, so, tag, youêre it. "
Sheldon,Iêm ba-ack!
Leonard,I still donêt know why you left.
Sheldon,I canêt tell you.
Leonard,Why not.
Sheldon,I promised Penny. 
Leonard,You promised Penny what? 
Sheldon,That I wouldnêt tell you the secret. Shhhhh!
Leonard,What secret. Tell me the secret. 
Sheldon,"Mom smokes in the car. Jesus is okay with it, but we canêt tell Dad. "
Leonard,"Not that secret, the other secret."
Sheldon,Iêm Batman. Shhhhh!
Leonard,"Dammit, Sheldon! You said Penny told you a secret, what was the secret."
Sheldon,"Okay, Iêll tell you, but you canêt tell Leonard. "
Leonard,I promise. 
Sheldon,Penny lied about graduating from community college because she is afraid sheês not smart enough for Leonard. 
Leonard,So itês nothing I did? Itês her problem? 
Sheldon,I drank milk that tasted funny. 
Leonard,"Penny thinks Iêm too smart for her, thatês ridiculous. "
Sheldon,"I know, most of your work is extremely derivative. Donêt worry, thatês not a secret. Everybody knows. "
Leonard,"Yeah, hi, listen, I know whatês been bothering you about us, and I have the answer. "
Penny,What are you talking about.
Leonard,"First I want to say that itês not Sheldonês fault, he tried very hard to keep your secret, if Howard hadnêt drugged him he would have taken it to his grave. "
Penny,He told you?
Leonard,"Yes, but itês okay. Now that we know what the problem is, thereês a simple solution.  "
Penny,Pasadena city college? 
Leonard,"A place for fun, a place for knowledge. See, this man hereês playing hacky sack, and this girlês going to be a paralegal. "
Penny,"Wow, I get it, because Dr Leonard Hofstadter canêt date a girl without a fancy college degree. "
Leonard,"Well, itês really not that fancy, itês just a city college. "
Penny,"Right, but I have to have some sort of degree to date you? "
Leonard,That doesnêt matter to me at all.
Penny,"So, itês fine with you if Iêm not smart. "
Leonard,Absolutely.  Oh bite me! 
Sheldon,Worst Renaissance Fair ever.
Leonard,"Please let it go, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"It was rife with historical inaccuracies. For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead, now her costume was obviously Germanic, but in 1487 the Bavarian purity laws or Rhineheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead. At best they would have had some sort of spiced wine."
Leonard,Youêre nitpicking.
Sheldon,Oh-ho! Really? Well hereês another nit for you. The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.
Howard,Renaissance fairs arenêt about historical accuracy. Theyêre about taking chubby girls who work at Kinkoês and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says howdy.
Sheldon,Bosoms would not have said howdy in the fifteenth century. If anything they would have said _huzzah!î
Howard,"I donêt care what the bosoms say, Sheldon, I just want to be part of the conversation."
Penny,Hi guys. Looks like youêve been to the Renaissance fair. Iêm hoping.
Sheldon,Renaissance fair? More of a medieval slash age of enlightenment slash any excuse to wear a codpiece fair.
Penny,"Okay, fine, whatever, um, you guys, this is my friend Eric."
Leonard,"So, yeah, good to see you."
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, itês good to see you too. We should really go."
Penny,guys.
Howard,"Thanks, my mom made it. Penny with a new guy, tres awkward."
Leonard,"It wasnêt awkward. It wasnêt fun. Besides, whatês the big deal, we dated, we stopped dating, and now weêre both moving on."
Raj,"By moving on, do you mean, sheês going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making fifteenth century soap with Wolowitz?"
Sheldon,"That was not fifteenth century soap, my God those people need to learn you canêt just put _ye oldeî in front of anything and expect to get away with it."
Leonard,"Can we please just go in, my chain mail is stuck in my underwear."
Sheldon,Youêre wearing modern underwear?
Leonard,"Relatively modern. Why, what are you wearing?"
Sheldon,I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.
Leonard,You went out and bought linen?
Sheldon,"Donêt be silly, I borrowed one of your pillow cases."
Leonard,"You know what, Iêm happy that Pennyês moving on. It gives me the freedom to move on myself."
Howard,Are you saying that youêve been holding back?
Leonard,Of course. Out of respect.
Howard,"So, how do you explain the ten years before Penny?"
Raj,Who were you respecting then?
Leonard,"Iêve dated plenty of women. There was Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle."
Sheldon,"Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary, the word plenty has been redefined to mean two."
Leonard,"Uh, what about that girl last year at Comic-con?"
Raj,Doesnêt count.
Leonard,Why not?
Raj,"What happens in costume at Comic-con, stays at Comic-con."
Howard,Youêre only saying that because of what happened to you.
Leonard,What happened to you?
Raj,N-n-n-nothing happened to me.
Howard,"It wasnêt your fault, Raj, he was dressed as a green Orion slave girl."
Raj,"H-h-h-how did we get on me, we were mocking Leonard for not moving on. Dude, you have totally not moved on."
Leonard,"Yes I have, itês just a matter of actually making a date with someone."
Howard,Like who?
Leonard,"Well, thereês Joyce Kim, but she defected back to North Korea so itês a little geographically undesireable."
Raj,What about Leslie Winkle.
Sheldon,Oh no.
Sheldon,"Her research methodology is sloppy, sheês unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse sheês often mean to me."
Raj,I think sheês smoking hot.
Howard,Iêd hit that.
Sheldon,Youêd hit particulate soil on a colloidal suspension. Mud.
Leonard,"Look, I like Leslie, but sheês not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release."
Howard,"Yeah, so, be a tool. Go get yourself a little rebound stress release."
Raj,Technically it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.
Howard,You mean like you and Richard the slave girl?
Raj,"I bought him dinner and we kissed once, that was it.  And he told me his name was Kimberley!"
Sheldon,You know how I know weêre not in The Matrix?
Sheldon,"If we were, the food would be better."
Leonard,"Hey, Leslie."
Sheldon,"Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person."
Leonard,"Uh, sure."
Sheldon,"Well, if youêll excuse me, Iêm going to go do work that promises significant results, as opposed to what you do, which does not. Yeah, you heard me."
Leonard,Where did you hear that?
Leonard,Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory. Yep.
Leonard,Are you suggesting another bout of stress release.
Leonard,"Really, what changed?"
Leonard,"Yeah, I can see how that wouldÑ a bunch of people?"
Leonard,"Oh, Iêm flattered. So, how do you suggest we proceed?"
Leonard,Sounds fun.
Leonard,"Thank you, thatês very thoughtful."
Sheldon,Great news. My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.
Sheldon,"You know what this means, donêt you? Break out the Red Bull, itês time to rock Mario old school."
Leonard,I kind of have other plans tonight.
Sheldon,"But itês Friday. Fridayês always vintage game night. Look, mom included the memory card, we can pick up where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anaemia."
Leonard,"Well, the thing is, someoneês coming over."
Sheldon,"Well then, no problem, I have three controllers, the more the merrier."
Leonard,"Sheldon, itês a date, I have a date coming over."
Sheldon,"Oh, well you canêt blame me for not jumping to that conclusion."
Leonard,"Why, whatês so unusual about me having a date?"
Sheldon,"Well, statistically speakingÑ"
Leonard,"Alright, alright. Well, uh, nevertheless, I have one now and I would appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce."
Sheldon,"Leonard, I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which canêt be accurately measured by normal tests, how much scarcer could I be?"
Leonard,"You know what I mean, could you just give us a little privacy?"
Sheldon,You want me to leave the apartment?
Sheldon,You mean just go someplace else and beÑ someplace else?
Sheldon,"Well, why should I leave, this is my apartment too."
Leonard,"I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy I would be more than happy to get out of your way."
Sheldon,Well alright then.
Penny,Sheldon? What are you doing?
Sheldon,Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.
Penny,"Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?"
Sheldon,"Iêm a modern day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date."
Penny,"Oh. Oh, well, good for him. Yeah but, why are you sitting here, why donêt you just go to a movie or something?"
Penny,"Yeah, why not?"
Sheldon,"What if I choke on my popcorn, who will administer the Heimlich manoeuvre."
Penny,Well then donêt order popcorn.
Sheldon,No popcorn at the moÑ listen to yourself.
Penny,Well why donêt you go to a coffee shop.
Sheldon,I donêt drink coffee.
Penny,They have other things.
Sheldon,What do they have?
Penny,"I donêt know, you know, cookies, pastriesÑ"
Sheldon,Pastries such as bearclaws?
Penny,"Yeah, sure."
Sheldon,I donêt like bearclaws.
Sheldon,"Leslie Winkle. Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?"
Penny,"Well, they have a lot in common. I mean theyêre both scientists."
Sheldon,Oh please. The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resume sending chimps into space.
Penny,"Okay, well I have a date too, so see ya."
Sheldon,"Everybody has a date. Even you, Mario, going after Princess Peach. And what am I doing, Iêm just enabling you."
Leonard,"Yeah, itês from Changs."
Leonard,"No, Changs."
Leonard,It changed.
Leonard,A little.
Leonard,I sure hope so.
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry to interrupt, batteries dying continue."
Leonard,"Okay, now my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you will ever meet. SoÑ Sweet lady. It always tickles when she hugs me.  What now?"
Sheldon,I have to make pee-pee.
Leonard,"Listen, Iêm sorry about all of Sheldonês interruptions, he can be a bit of an eccentric."
Leonard,"Well, I think tonight was a very good start."
Leonard,"No problem, Iêm very skilled at postponing intercourse. So I guess Iêll call you and weêll arrange another evening."
Penny,"No, it wasnêt my cat, it was an experiment designed by this guy named Schrodinger."
Penny,"No, he was some kind of scientist, let me start again. Oh, hey Leonard."
Leonard,"Okay, well, goodnight. "
Penny,"Okay, well, goodnight.  "
Leonard,Right 
Penny,"Okay, goodnight."
Penny,"Had a great time, ciao "
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance Fair."
Howard,"Come on, Sheldon, thereês so few places I can wear my jester costume."
Sheldon,I donêt care. There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.
Raj,"Oh, okay, how about this. You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s."
Sheldon,You mean like Spock?
Leonard,"Hey, why donêt we all move over there so Leslie can join us."
Howard,"Hmm, letês do it. "
Sheldon,"If youêre having trouble deciding where to sit may I suggest one potato two potato, or as I call it the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology."
Leonard,Donêt make this hard for me.
Sheldon,"Itês not hard. Itês simple. You can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate, or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with."
Leonard,"Youêre right, it is simple. "
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
Penny,"Third floor tonight. Mixing it up?  Oh. You know, I still donêt understand why you just donêt go to dinner or something."
Sheldon,"Alright, letês say I go to dinner alone. And during the meal I have to use the rest room. How do I know someoneês not touching my food?"
Penny,Goodnight Sheldon.
Sheldon,"Penny, hold on. Are you sure things canêt work out with you and Leonard?"
Penny,Excuse me?
Sheldon,Iêm just wondering if you really gave it the old college try? Or in your case the old community college try?
Penny,"Okay, where is this coming from?"
Sheldon,Leonard is upstairs right now with my arch enemy.
Penny,Your arch enemy?
Sheldon,"Yes, the Doctor Doom to my Mr Fantastic. The Doctor Octopus to my Spiderman. The Doctor Sivana to my Captain Marvel."
Penny,"Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it."
Sheldon,"Do you know, itês amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees. Graduate school should probably do a better job of screening those people out."
Penny,"Sheldon, come back, youêre losing me."
Sheldon,"Leslie Winkle, Penny. She belittles my research."
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, Iêm sorry."
Sheldon,She called me dumbass.
Penny,I know. I heard.
Sheldon,"Given this situation, I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill considered relationship with Leonard."
Penny,"Oh, gee, well, thankyou for that. But, um, I think for now Leonard and I are just going to stay friends."
Sheldon,"No, that response is unacceptable to me."
Penny,"Sheldon, you are a smart guy, you must knowÑ"
Sheldon,Smart? Iêd have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as smart.
Penny,Are you going to let me talk?
Sheldon,Iêm sorry.
Penny,"You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is going to stop it."
Sheldon,You continue to underestimate my abilities madam.
Penny,"Okay, let me put it this way, if youêre really Leonardês friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with."
Sheldon,"Wait a minute, why am I doing all the giving here? If Leonardês really my friend, why doesnêt he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?"
Penny,Because love trumps hate.
Sheldon,Oh now youêre just making stuff up.
Penny,Okay. Goodnight Sheldon.
Sheldon,"Oh Mario. If only I could control everyone the way I control you. Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop."
Sheldon,When the two of you reach a natural stopping point Iêd like to have a word.
Leonard,"If the word is pee-pee, just do it."
Sheldon,"Leonard, you are my friend. And friends support their friends, apparently. So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie."
Leonard,Thank you.
Sheldon,"I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant sub-par scientist, who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory. You kids have fun."
Sheldon,"Iêm listening, amuse me."
Sheldon,Balderdash. Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.
Leonard,"Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories."
Leonard,"Sheldon, donêt make that noise, itês disrespectful."
Sheldon,"I hope so, it was a snort of derision."
Leonard,"Sorry Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy."
Leonard,"Truth, what truth? Weêre talking about untested hypotheses, uh, itês no big deal."
Leonard,I guess we let them wait until theyêre old enough and let them choose their own theory.
Leonard,"Wait, where are you going?"
Sheldon,Look on the bright side.
Leonard,Whatês the bright side?
Sheldon,Only nine more months to comic-con.
Leonard,Oh yeah.
Sheldon,"Captain, Iêm getting an unusual reading."
Leonard,"Yeah, thatês great, you guys want corn dogs?"
Sheldon,Thatês a temporal anomaly. Corn dogs didnêt come into existence until the first half of the twentieth century.
Sheldon,"Fellow warriors, this is Sheldor the Conqueror. We are about to enter Axelês fortress. Now this is a long run, so letês do another bladder check. Alright Barry, weêll wait for you again, but you really should see a doctor.  Penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?"
Penny,"Yes, I canêt get my stupid door open."
Sheldon,"You appear to have put your car key in the door lock, are you aware of that?"
Sheldon,Alright then.  
Penny,"Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit."
Sheldon,Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?
Penny,I canêt get the damned key out.
Sheldon,"Well thatês not surprising. That Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders, whereas the key for your Volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system."
Penny,"Thankyou, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Youêre welcome. Point of inquiry, why did you put your car key in the door lock?"
Penny,"Why? Iêll tell you why. Because today I had an audition, it took me two hours to get there, I waited an hour for my turn, and before I could even start they told me I looked too Midwest for the part. Too Midwest? What the hell does that even mean?"
Sheldon,"Well, the American Midwest was mostly settled by Scandinavian and Germanic peoples who, well they have a characteristic facial bone structureÑ."
Penny,"I know what it means, Sheldon! God, you know, I have been in L.A. for almost two years now, and I havenêt got a single acting job, I have accomplished nothing, havenêt gotten a raise at work, havenêt even had sex in six months, and just now when I was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and I ate it."
Sheldon,"Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures, theyêre almost pure protein."
Penny,"Oh, sonofabitch!"
Sheldon,"I believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. But returning to your key conundrum, perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you."
Penny,"I did, and he said heêll get here when he gets here."
Sheldon,And youêre frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?
Penny,No! I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly. 
Sheldon,There there.  Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?
Penny,"No Sheldon, Iêd rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three year-old."
Sheldon,Alright then.  
Penny,For Godês sake! 
Sheldon,Just when I think Iêve gotten the hang of sarcasm.
Sheldon,Make yourself comfortable.  Sheldor is back online.
Sheldon,The Conqueror.
Penny,What are you doing?
Sheldon,"AFK. Iêm playing Age of Conan, an online multiplayer game set in the universe of Robert E. Howardês Conan the Barbarian."
Sheldon,"Sheldor, back online."
Penny,Whatês AFK?
Sheldon,AFK. Away from keyboard.
Sheldon,What does that stand for?
Penny,"Oh, I see?"
Sheldon,"Yes, but what does it stand for?"
Sheldon,Now just click on the enchanted boots to put them on.
Penny,"Oh, I donêt know. Can I see them in another colour?"
Sheldon,"Just click on them. Congratulations, you are now a level three warrior."
Leonard,Whatês going on?
Penny,"Leonard, guess what, Iêm a level three warrior."
Leonard,"Great, you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?"
Penny,"Yeah yeah yeah, shhh!"
Leonard,I only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and itês starting to attract wildlife.
Penny,"Uh-huh, yeah, do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?"
Sheldon,"It doesnêt matter, right now youêre looking for treasure."
Penny,"Okay.  Wait, wait, where are you going?"
Sheldon,"Youêre okay, if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots."
Leonard,Want to catch me up?
Sheldon,"Well letês see, uh, she attempted to open her apartment with her car key, because her face is overly Midwestern, um, she hasnêt had sex in six months, and she ate a fly."
Leonard,"Uh-huh. Seriously, six months?"
Penny,"Oh my God, a treasure chest, Iêm rich!"
Sheldon,Level three and she thinks sheês rich! What a noob.
Raj,"Okay, weêre all set."
Howard,Let her rip.
Leonard,"Hey, check it out, itês just corn starch and water."
Sheldon,"They make up a non-Newtonian fluid which is liquid, but solid under the percussive action of the speaker."
Howard,Thatês what makes it get all funky.
Penny,"Yeah, okay. Listen, I need to talk to Sheldon."
Howard,"No, thatês what she said, Sheldon."
Penny,"Okay, look, I bought the game, and Iêve been exploring the Island of Tordage but I canêt figure out how to get past the guard captain."
Sheldon,Do you have the enchanted sword?
Penny,"No, no, Iêve a bronze dagger."
Sheldon,"You canêt slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger, my Lord itês like the car key in your apartment door all over again."
Penny,"Alright, alright, how do I get the sword?"
Sheldon,"Well, have you been to the Temple of Mithra?"
Penny,Is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in front of it?
Sheldon,"No, no, no, itêsÑ oh for Godês sakes, gimme. "
Penny,"Thank you, I really appreciate this."
Sheldon,"Youêre going to have to learn to do these things for yourself, Penny."
Penny,"Donêt patronise me, just get the sword."
Howard,What the frak?
Leonard,Beats me. They were playing all last night too.
Raj,Itês like some kind of weird comic book crossover.
Howard,Like if Hulk were dating Peppermint Patty.
Raj,I always thought Peppermint Patty was a lesbian?
Leonard,"No, thatês Marcie. Peppermint Pattyês just athletic."
Sheldon,"There you go, one enchanted sword."
Penny,"Right, gimme, gimme, gimme, I want to kill the guard captain. ."
Sheldon,That girl needs to get a life.
Sheldon,"Danger, danger."
Penny,"No danger, look, itês just me, Penny, look, I got to level 25 and reached Purple Lotus Swamp, right?"
Sheldon,Youêre in my bedroom.
Penny,Yeah. Leonard gave me an emergency key.
Sheldon,People canêt be in my bedroom.
Penny,"Okay, well can we go talk in the living room?"
Sheldon,Iêm not wearing pyjama bottoms.
Penny,Why not?
Sheldon,I spilled grape juice.
Penny,"Well, wear different pyjamas."
Sheldon,"I canêt wear different pyjamas, these are my Monday pyjamas. Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom."
Penny,"Okay, just tell me, is it too soon to join a quest to the Black Castle?"
Sheldon,You were invited on a quest to the Black Castle?
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, by some guys in Budapest, Iêm just not sure itês the right move for my character."
Sheldon,"Of course itês not, youêre only a level 25, the Hungarians are just using you for dragon fodder."
Penny,"Really? Boy, youêd think you could trust a horde of Hungarian barbarians."
Sheldon,"Please Penny, enough, I have to sleep."
Leonard,"Sheldon, you want to catch me up again?"
Sheldon,"I realise that Dr Gablehauser but it is your job, as head of the department, to mediate all inter-departmental disputes. University policy manual chapter four, subsection two, mediation of inter-departmental disputes."
Sheldon,No she doesnêt.
Sheldon,"Hereês the problem. I was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in Buckman 204, and Dr Winkle just wantonly ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall."
Sheldon,"If it is a crime to ensure that the universities resources are not being squandered chasing sub-atomic wild geese then I plead guilty.  Oh, Penny!"
Sheldon,"God, no."
Sheldon,"Oh yeah, well, you wouldnêt even be nominated. Dr Gablehauser, I have a series of important multi-bit calculations and simulations to run. All sheês doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mockÑ"
Sheldon,"Hello. Penny, this is not a good time. No, I told you, youêre not prepared for the Sanctum of Burning Souls. You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest, and one should be a level 35 healer. Penny, I canêt log on and help you. Weêll talk when I get home.  Iêm not getting the computing time, am I?"
Sheldon,"Leonard, you have to do something about Penny. She is interfering with my sleep, sheês interfering with my work, and if I had another significant aspect of my life, Iêm sure sheêd be interfering with that too."
Leonard,"Why should I do something, youêre the one who introduced her to online gaming."
Sheldon,"Well, yes, but youêre the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If youêd simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening."
Leonard,Why donêt you just tell her to leave you alone.
Sheldon,"I did. I told her, I texted her, I sent out a very emphatic twitter. I even changed my facebook status to Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny would leave him alone. I donêt know what else to do."
Leonard,"Well, what am I supposed to do?"
Sheldon,"I donêt know, but if you donêt figure something out, I warn you I shall become very difficult to live with."
Leonard,"You mean, up until now weêve been experiencing the happy funtime Sheldon?"
Leonard,Iêll go talk to her.
Penny,"No, Fritz, I need you on my flank. No, I donêt know German. Flankenzie, flankenzie!"
Leonard,Hey Penny.
Leonard,"Yeah, I see that. Shouldnêt you be at work?"
Penny,I donêt work on Mondays.
Leonard,"Itês Thursday. Listen, Penny."
Penny,"Uh, Queen Penelope AFK. What?"
Leonard,"Okay, um, hereês the thing, um, sometimes people, good people, you know, they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own, you know, kind of, addicted."
Penny,"Yeah, get to the point, Iêm about to level up here."
Leonard,"Well, i-i-i-itês just if a person doesnêt have a sense of achievement in their real life itês easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment."
Penny,"Yeah, jabber jabber jabber, okay boys, Queen Penelopeês back online."
Leonard,"Penny, youêve got cheetos in your hair."
Raj,Hey guys.
Raj,"Hey, whatês with him?"
Leonard,Pennyês been keeping him up at night.
Howard,Me too. But probably in a different way.
Leonard,"Sheês gotten really hooked on Age of Conan, sheês playing non-stop."
Raj,"Ah, yes, online gaming addiction. Thereês nothing worse than having that multi-player monkey on your back."
Leonard,"Sheldon, wake up."
Sheldon,"Danger, danger."
Sheldon,"Oh yeah, well your attempt at juvenilizing me by excluding me from the set of adult malesÑ. oh, Iêm too tired to do this."
Sheldon,She comes into my room. No-oneês supposed to be in my room.
Howard,I do that too. But probably in a different way.
Leonard,"Thatês not what sheês doing, Leslie, sheês just trying to shore up her self esteem, it has nothing to do with sex."
Howard,"Mmmm, testify. "
Leonard,"Leslie, you are way off base here."
Sheldon,"Hang on, Leonard, while I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness."
Sheldon,"Some what? Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse."
Howard,Iêll take the bullet.
Leonard,"Excuse me, this whole idea is insane."
Sheldon,"Yeah, yeah, enough debate, Iêm going to take action.  Excuse me, are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?"
Sheldon,Would you like to be?
Sheldon,Zip it pip it. Can I have your phone number?
Sheldon,"There, problem solved."
Penny,"Okay, Iêm at the gate to the Treasury of the Ancients, Iêm going in."
Sheldon,Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies.
Penny,Got it.
Sheldon,"I must say, youêre playing very well for a woman of 23?"
Sheldon,Right. 22. 
Penny,"Oh, here come the mummies, which spell do I use? The hateful strike, or the frenzy stance?"
Sheldon,What happened to the rest of your group?
Penny,"I dumped them, theyêre a bunch of wussies."
Sheldon,Frenzy stance.
Penny,"Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!"
Sheldon,"So listen, would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands, or staying at home curled up with a good book?"
Sheldon,These are market research questions. Iêm filling out the online registration for your game.
Penny,"Oh, okay, wild adventure. Oh, frenzy stance isnêt working, die you undead mummy, die!"
Sheldon,Drink a healing potion.
Penny,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Youêre welcome. Anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?"
Penny,Thatês on the registration?
Sheldon,"Oh yes, itês quite extensive. But if we complete it, we get a free expansion pack, 75 additional quests."
Penny,"Ooh, awesome, okay, I totally like to initiate Iêm a big old five."
Sheldon,Good to know. Big old five.
Sheldon,"Leonard, this is Tom."
Leonard,Hi Tom. Sheldon? Didnêt I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?
Sheldon,"Yes, you were very clear, as was everyone else at the table. Tom, however, has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for Penny."
Leonard,Chosen by science?
Sheldon,"Well, what passes for science on dating sites. They claim to use heuristic algorithms, but it may well be hokum."
Leonard,You got Penny to sign up for online dating?
Sheldon,"No, of course not. No, I used trickery and deceit."
Leonard,This is bad.
Sheldon,"Tom is a paramedic with the fire department, but heês going to med school at night, uh, he likes the outdoors, and, uh, strong women who initiate sex."
Leonard,"Really, really bad."
Sheldon,Iêm surprised you struck out with Penny. Apparently sheês a big old five.
Penny,"Sheldon, what do you want."
Sheldon,"Oh, good, you got my note. Penny, Iêd like you to meet Tom, uh, Penny, this is Tom, Tom, may I present Penny."
Penny,"Yeah, Hi, listen, as long as Iêm here, Iêm on a quest with a bunch of noobs, they donêt know what theyêre doing, weêve got one assassin, three spellcasters and no tank."
Sheldon,Can we talk about this later.
Penny,"No, no, no, no, I need you now."
Sheldon,"But wouldnêt you prefer to socialise with Tom, who is a sexually passive outdoorsman."
Penny,"Whatever, Iêll figure it out myself."
Leonard,They never do.
Penny,"Oh my God, I need help.  "
Leonard,"Letês see, Raj was the Kung Palo Chicken."
Penny,Iêm the dumplings.
Howard,"Yes, you are."
Penny,"Creepy, Howard."
Howard,Creepy good or creepy bad?
Leonard,Who was the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce?
Howard,"That would be me. Come to Poppa, you un-kosher delight.  Iêm not necessarily talking to the food."
Penny,Sit over there.
Sheldon,Sit over there. Baby wipe?
Penny,What do you haveÑ.
Sheldon,Iêll tell you why.
Sheldon,I had to sanitize my hands because the university replaced the paper towels in the rest rooms with hot air blowers.
Penny,I thought the blowers were more sanitary?
Sheldon,Hot air blowers are incubators and spewers of bacteria and pestilence. Frankly it would be more hygienic if they just had a plague infested gibbon sneeze my hands dry.
Penny,"Gosh, Raj, do you think youêll ever be able to talk in front of me without being drunk?  Okay, well, Iêll just, um, go eat by myself."
Leonard,"Penny, you donêt have to do that."
Penny,"No, itês okay, between  "
Raj,Sheês so considerate.
Howard,So whatês your news?
Raj,Remember that little planetary object I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?
Leonard,"Oh yeah, two zero zero eight NQ sub seventeen."
Raj,"Or as I called it, Planet Bollywood. Anyway, because of my discovery, People magazine is naming me one of their thirty under-30 to watch."
Sheldon,"Excuse me. Thirty what, under thirty what, to watch what?"
Raj,Thirty visionaries under thirty years of age to watch as they challenge the preconceptions of their fields.
Sheldon,If I had a million guesses I never would have gotten that.
Raj,"Itês pretty cool, theyêve got me in with a guy whoês doing something about hunger in Indonesia, and a psychotherapist whoês using dolphins to rehabilitate prisoners, and Ellen Page, star of the charming independent film Juno."
Howard,"Oh, Iêd so do her."
Leonard,Youêd do the dolphins.
Howard,Do I get an honourable mention for designing the telescope camera mounting bracket you used.
Raj,"Sorry, itês not part of my heartwarming and personal narrative, in which a humble boy from New Delhi overcame poverty and prejudice and journeyed to America to reach for the stars."
Howard,"Poverty? Your fatherês a gynaecologist, he drives a Bentley."
Raj,Itês a lease.
Sheldon,Iêm confused. Was there some sort of peer review committee to determine which scientists would be included?
Raj,Peer review? Itês People magazine. People picked me.
Sheldon,What people?
Raj,The people from People.
Sheldon,"Yeah, but exactly who are these people? What are their credentials, how are they qualified, what makes accidentally noticing a hunk of rock thatês been traipsing around the solar system for billions of years more noteworthy than any other scientific accomplishment made by someone under thirty?"
Raj,"Boy, I bet Ellen Pages friends arenêt giving her this kind of crap."
Leonard,Are you proud of yourself?
Sheldon,"In general, yes."
Sheldon,"Oh, thereês my missing neutrino. You were hiding from me as an unbalanced charge, werenêt you, you little subatomic Dickens?"
Leonard,Hi Sheldon.
Sheldon,"Here, look, look, I found my missing neutrino."
Howard,"Oh, good, we can take it off the milk cartons."
Leonard,"Well, weêre going to go apologise to Raj and invite him out to dinner."
Sheldon,"Apologise, for what?"
Leonard,"Well, he came over last night with some pretty good news, and we werenêt very supportive."
Sheldon,I sense youêre trying to tell me something.
Howard,You were a colossal ass-hat.
Sheldon,"Oh! No, I beg to differ. Of the three of us, I was by far the most supportive."
Leonard,"Really, do tell."
Sheldon,"How will Raj ever reach true greatness if his friends lower the bar for him? When I was eleven, my sister bought our father a _worldês greatest dadî coffee mug, and frankly the man coasted until the day he died."
Leonard,"Okay, letês try it this way, what if the People magazine thing is the best Raj is ever going to achieve?"
Sheldon,I had not considered that.
Leonard,Come on.
Sheldon,I often forget other people have limitations. Itês so sad.
Howard,He can feel sadness?
Leonard,"Not really, itês what you and I would call condescension."
Leonard,"And when we go in there, letês show Raj that weêre happy for him."
Sheldon,But Iêm not.
Howard,"Well then fake it. Look at me, I could be grinding on the fact that without my stabilizing telescope mount he never would have found that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz, but Iêm bigger than that."
Sheldon,"Fine, what do you want me to do?"
Leonard,Smile. 
Howard,"Oh crap, thatês terrifying."
Leonard,"Weêre here to see Koothrappali, not kill Batman."
Howard,Try less teeth. 
Leonard,"Close enough, come on.  Hi Raj."
Raj,"Hey guys, whatês up?"
Howard,We just wanted to invite you out to dinner tonight.
Leonard,Celebrate your thirty under thirty thing. Right Sheldon?  
Raj,"Itês very nice of you, I would like that."
Raj,Dr Gablehouser.
Leonard,Dr Gablehauser.
Sheldon,Dr Gablehauser.
Howard,Dr Gablehauser.
Raj,"Actually, 2008 NQ sub 17 is a planetary body."
Sheldon,"Well, you didnêt discover him, you merely noticed he was here, much like he did with 2008 NQ sub 17."
Sheldon,"Oh, sorry. "
Raj,"Really, you donêt have to go to any trouble."
Raj,"Iêd rather have Fishbineês, itês bigger."
Howard,"Wait a minute, I called dibs on Fishbineês office the day he started showing up at work in his bathrobe."
Sheldon,"He gets a new office, I canêt even get paper towels in the menês room?"
Sheldon,"Damn, this is hard.  "
Howard,Told you.
Howard,I have a masterês degree.
Raj,I didnêt even know there was a Presidentês dining room.
Raj,"Okay, big buddy. See you tonight guys. "
Leonard,You can stop smiling now.
Raj,"So anyway, after a fantastic lunch I was whisked off to the People magazine photo shootÑ have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot?"
Raj,"Itês fantastic, apparently the camera loves me and I it. They shot me in front of a starry background where I posed like this.  Theyêre going to digitally add a supernova, they say itês the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent."
Sheldon,"Right, a ball of hot flaming gas that collapses in on itself.  "
Raj,"Excuse me. Oh, itês my assistant Trevor. Go for Koothrappali. Uh-huh."
Howard,They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen I have to go to the bank with wire cutters.
Sheldon,Have we at this point met our social obligations?
Leonard,Not yet.
Raj,"Okay, just put it on my calendar but start thinking of a reason why I canêt go, alrighty? Koothrappali out. God bless that boy, I donêt know what Iêd do without him."
Leonard,You just got him this afternoon.
Raj,"Yes, but Iêm finding that having a lackey suits me."
Leonard,A lackey?
Raj,"Oh, Iêm sorry, is that politically incorrect? In India we just call them untouchables."
Raj,"Speaking of untouchables, Iêve got great news for you guys. People magazine is having a reception this Saturday, and I managed to get you invited."
Howard,"Oh, gee, thanks."
Raj,"Oh, youêre welcome. Of course, I couldnêt get you into the VIP section, because, you know, thatês for VIPs, and you guys are just, you know, Ps."
Sheldon,"Thereês a tribe in Papua New Guinea where, when a hunter flaunts his success to the rest of the village they kill him, and drive away evil spirits with a drum made of his skin. Superstitious nonsense of course, but one can see their point. "
Penny,"Here you go, Raj, you might want to drink this one slowly."
Raj,"Okay, so, Saturday night, can I count on my posse?"
Howard,"Gee, Iêd love to Raj, but I canêt make it."
Raj,"Oh, okay, Leonard?"
Leonard,"Well, uh, no IÑ theÑ no."
Sheldon,"I can make it, but I wonêt."
Penny,What are you guys talking about?
Raj,"Well, thereês a reception for my magazine article on Saturday."
Penny,"And you guys arenêt going? I canêt believe you, Raj is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment and youêre not even going to be there to support him?"
Sheldon,A tremendous accomplishment would be if the planetary body he discovered were plummeting toward Earth and he exploded it with his mind.
Howard,That would be cool. Iêd go to that reception.
Penny,"Come on, this is huge, Raj is going to be in People magazine. And he didnêt even have to knock up one of the Spears sisters."
Raj,Would you like to go with me?
Penny,"Of course I would, I would be honoured."
Raj,Really? Cool.
Penny,Shame on you guys. 
Raj,Look at that. I got a date with Penny. I canêt believe it took you a whole year.
Leonard,Now. 
Raj,"Hey, buddy. Iêm going to be in people magazine."
Penny,"Oh, Raj, look at you!"
Raj,"I know, I am resplendent like the noonday sun, am I not?"
Penny,"Um, yeah, starting with the champagne a little early arenêt you?"
Raj,"It was in the limo. They sent a limo. I have a limo. I just love saying limo. Here, sip on this while youêre getting ready."
Penny,"Oh, Iêm ready."
Raj,Thatês what youêre wearing.
Penny,"Um, yeah, why whatês wrong with it?"
Raj,"Nothing, I was just hoping for something a little more, you know, redonkulous."
Penny,"Yeah, well, this is all the donkulous youêre gonna get."
Raj,"Okey dokey, letês roll. Alright, itês time to raise the roof. Oo-ooh, oo-ooh."
Penny,Hey Leonard.
Leonard,You look very nice.
Penny,"Uh, come on, good night Leonard."
Leonard,Good night.
Raj,"Hey, Leonard, did you see my limo downstairs."
Raj,Itês bigger than the house my grandfather grew up in.
Raj,It has more food too.
Penny,"Alright, come on, come on."
Raj,Iêm coming up so you better get this party started.
Howard,"Hey, good news, you donêt have to sulk about Penny any more, look, there are hundreds of Croatian women just waiting for you to contact them."
Howard,"Iêll lend you my user name, itês wealthybigpenis."
Leonard,Youêre joking.
Howard,"Well, you gotta make it easy for them, theyêre just learning English."
Howard,So youêre just going to sit around here and mope while Penny is out with Doctor Apu from the Kwik-e-Mart?
Leonard,"Itês not a date, and thatês racist."
Howard,"It canêt be racist, heês a beloved character on the Simpsons."
Leonard,Letês just eat so I can get to bed. With any luck tonight will be the night my sleep apnoea kills me.
Sheldon,Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded?
Sheldon,Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
Sheldon,"Brown rice, not white?"
Sheldon,Did you stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard.
Sheldon,Did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market?
Sheldon,Thank you.
Leonard,Youêre welcome.
Sheldon,What took you so long?
Leonard,Just sit down and eat.
Sheldon,Fine. 
Leonard,"Alright, itês shredded, what do you want me to do?"
Sheldon,I want you to check before you accept the order.
Sheldon,Were you distracted by the possibility that Koothrappali might have intercourse with Penny tonight?
Leonard,Heês not going to have intercourse with Penny.
Sheldon,"Then thereês no excuse for this chicken. You know, this situation with Koothrapali brings to mind a story from my childhood."
Howard,"Oh goody, more tales from the panhandle."
Sheldon,"Thatês Northwest Texas, Iêm from East Texas, the Gulf region, home to many Vietnamese shrimpers."
Leonard,Do the shrimpers feature in your story?
Sheldon,"Anyway, when I was eight, a Montgomery-Ward delivery van ran over our cat, Lucky."
Sheldon,"Yes, Lucky."
Leonard,"Heês irony impaired, just move on."
Howard,"Okay, dead cat named Lucky, continue."
Sheldon,"While others mourned Lucky, I realised his untimely demise provided me with the opportunity to replace him with something more suited to my pet needs. A faithful companion that I could snuggle with at night, and yet would be capable of killing upon telepathic command."
Howard,"So, not a puppy?"
Sheldon,"Please, no, nothing so pedestrian. I wanted a griffin."
Leonard,A griffin?
Sheldon,"Yes, half eagle, half lion."
Leonard,And mythological.
Sheldon,"Irrelevant. See, I was studying recombinant DNA technology and I was confident I could create one, but my parents were unwilling to secure the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen. Course my sister got swimming lessons when she wanted them."
Howard,"Sheldon, not that we donêt all enjoy a good lion semen story, whatês your point."
Sheldon,"My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to a new life of shallow, undeserved fame, perhaps this is an opportunity to create a better cohort."
Leonard,You want to breed a new friend?
Sheldon,"Thatês one option, but who has the time? But consider this, the Japanese, theyêre doing some wonderful work with artificial intelligence, now, you combine that with some animatronics from the imagineers over at Disney, next thing you know, weêre playing Halo with a multi-lingual Abraham Lincoln."
Howard,"Sheldon, donêt take this the wrong way, but, youêre insane."
Leonard,"That may well be, but the fact is, it wouldnêt kill us to meet some new people."
Sheldon,"Uh, for the record, it could kill us to meet new people. They could be murderers, or the carriers of unusual pathogens, and Iêm not insane, my mother had me tested."
Leonard,"If we do get a new friend, he should be a guy you can trust. A guy who has your back."
Howard,"And he should have a lot of money, and live in a cool place down by the beach where we could throw parties."
Sheldon,He should share our love of technology.
Howard,And he should know a lot of women.
Leonard,"Yeah, letês see, money, women, technology, okay weêre agreed, our new friend is going to be Iron Man."
Raj,Welcome to the Raj Mahal.
Penny,"Yes, itês very nice, goodnight Raj."
Raj,"No, wait, the eveningês not over."
Penny,Yes it is.
Raj,"No, itês time to put on some R. Kelly and suck face."
Penny,"Oh, wow, is the evening over."
Raj,"Wait, wait, thatês my mummy and daddy calling from India. I want you to meet my parents."
Penny,"Wait, meet them."
Raj,"Hello mummy and daddy, good to see you. Iêm not drunk."
Raj,"Just making conversation. Mummy, daddy, I want you to meet my new squeeze, Penny."
Penny,I am not your squeeze. There is no squeezing.
Raj,"Here you go, cute huh?"
Penny,"No, no, thereês no sowing, no squeezing, and no sucking face."
Raj,What right do you have to pick who I can have children with?
Raj,"Now you listen to me, I am no longer a child, and I will not be spoken to like one. Now if youêd excuse me, I have to go throw up."
Penny,"I donêt know, maybe itês the local cuisine. Okay, well, itês nice to meet you, just gonna set you on down over here, and Iêm going to leave so, Namaste.  And FYI, youêd be lucky to have me as a daughter-in-law."
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, itês okay. "
Sheldon,"Good morning, Leonard."
Sheldon,"Yeah, weêre going to have to stop by Pottery Barn on the way to work, I bought these Star Wars sheets but they turned out to be much too stimulating to be compatible with a good nightês sleep. I donêt like the way Darth Vader stares at me."
Leonard,Iêm not going to work.
Sheldon,"Oh, just because your careerês been stagnant for a few years, thatês no reason to give up."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I was up all night using the new free-electron laser for my X-ray diffraction experiment."
Sheldon,Did the laser accidentally burn out your retinas?
Sheldon,Then you can drive. Letês go.
Leonard,"Didnêt I tell you Iêd be working nights, and that youêd have to make other arrangements."
Sheldon,You did.
Sheldon,I didnêt. Letês go.
Leonard,"Goodnight, Sheldon."
Sheldon,But how am I going to get to work?
Leonard,Take the bus.
Sheldon,I canêt take the bus any more. They donêt have seatbelts. And they wonêt let you lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords.
Leonard,You tried to lash yourself to the seat with bungee cords?
Sheldon,"I didnêt try, I succeeded. For some reason it alarmed the other passengers and I was asked to de-bus."
Leonard,"Oh, youêre a big boy, youêll figure it out."
Sheldon,"Donêt talk to me like Iêm a child. Now, take me to return my star wars sheets!"
Sheldon, PennyÑ
Penny,"Sheldon, what is it?"
Sheldon,Leonardês asleep.
Penny,Thanks for the update 
Sheldon,"No, wait. You have to drive me to work."
Penny,"Yeah, uh, I really donêt think I do."
Sheldon,"But I donêt drive, and I canêt take the bus."
Penny,"Yeah, honey, youêll be fine as long as you donêt do that bungee cord thing, okay?"
Sheldon,Penny. Didnêt you recently state that you and I are friends?
Penny,"Yes, Sheldon, we are friends."
Sheldon,Then I hereby invoke what Iêm given to understand is an integral part of the implied covenant of friendship. The favour.
Penny,"Oh, dear God."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, I didnêt realize I was interrupting your morning prayers. When youêre done, weêll go."
Sheldon,Thank you for driving me to work.
Penny,"You know this is my day off, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Oh, good. Iêm not keeping you from anything. Your check engine light is on."
Sheldon,"Typically thatês an indicator. To, you know, check your engine."
Penny,"Itês fine, itês been on for, like, a month."
Sheldon,"Well, actually, that would be all the more reason to, you know, check your engine."
Penny,"Sheldon, itês fine."
Sheldon,"If it were fine, the light wouldnêt be on. Thatês why the manufacturer installed that light, to let you know itês not fine."
Penny,"Uh, maybe the lightês broken."
Sheldon,Is there a _check the check engine light lightî?  O-o-o-oh!
Sheldon,"Studies have shown that performing tasks such as eating, talking on a cell phone or drinking coffee while driving reduces oneês reaction time by the same factor as an ounce of alcohol."
Penny,Do you have any alcohol?
Sheldon,Of course not.
Penny,Too bad.
Sheldon,Youêre going up Euclid Avenue?
Sheldon,Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.
Penny,"Well, good for Leonard."
Sheldon,"Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies, but it has speed bumps, which appreciably increase point-to-point drive time, making it the less efficient choice. But you have the conn. Of course, if youêre not going to slow down for the speed bumps, I withdraw my previous objection. Hereês a fun question. Do you know what the most common street name is?"
Sheldon,"The answerês tricky. Itês Second Street. You see, youêd think it would be First Street, but in most towns, First Street eventually gets renamed to something else, you know, like Main Street, Broad Street, Michigan Avenue. Leonard and I often use our commute time to exercise our minds  with brain-teasers like that. We also play games. Would you like to play one?"
Sheldon,"Oh, come on, itês fun. Ooh! Another bump. Okay. Iêll say an element, and uh, you say an element whose name starts with the last letter of the one I said, okay? Iêll start. Helium. Now, you could say Mercury. That would give me a Y. Ooh.  Very clever, thatês a tough one. So I go Ytterbium, which gets you back to M. So you go Molybdenum, and I say Magnesium, you say Manganese, and  I say Europium, and, and youêre left with Mendelevium, and  there are no more Mês because I believe that Meitnerium should still be called Ekairidium, so congratulations, you win. Do you wanna go again?"
Penny,How about we just have a little quiet time now?
Sheldon,"All right. Hmm, huh, Iêm sorry, Iêm finding your reckless nonchalance regarding the check-engine light to be very troubling."
Penny,Get out.
Sheldon,"Well, I have to tell you that while I do have a theoretical understanding of the workings of an internal combustion engine, Iêm not sure Iêm capable of performing diagnostics."
Penny,"I said, get out."
Sheldon,Okay. Iêll give it a shot. 
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, there you are, Iêm ready to go home."
Leonard,I just got here.
Sheldon,"Good, perfect timing."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I told you, I only have access to the free-electron laser at night. I canêt drive you for the next few weeks."
Sheldon,"No, you said you couldnêt drive me to work, this is from work."
Leonard,"Howard, help me out here."
Howard,"No, just for the fun of it, Iêm gonna take his side."
Sheldon,"Now, how do you propose I get home?"
Leonard,How did you get here in the first place?
Sheldon,Penny. But I sense thatês no longer an option.
Leonard,"Look, I need to get to the laser lab, youêre just going to have to find someone else to take you home."
Howard,"Oh damn, I picked the wrong side."
Sheldon,"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Oh God, not Euclid Avenue! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
Raj,Why did Howard leave you in the middle of the road anyway?
Sheldon,We had a difference of opinion.
Raj,Over what?
Sheldon,"Whether or not he was trying to kill me. For the record, I maintain he was. Where are you going?"
Raj,Iêm taking you home.
Sheldon,"Oh, but Iêm not going home. Itês Wednesday, Wednesday is new comic book day, we have to go to the comic book store. And then we have to stop at Soup Plantation, itês creamy tomato soup day, and Radio Shack, thereês a sale on triple-a batteries. Plus, we have to go to Pottery Barn and return my Star Wars sheets."
Raj,I have a better idea.
Sheldon,You want to go to pottery barn first?
Sheldon,"Can you drive me to Pottery Barn?  Maybe if I turn off the night-light, I can keep the sheets."
Sheldon,Good morning.
Leonard,"Sheldon, sit down."
Sheldon,"Sheês in my spot. Donêt look at me like that, everybody knows that my spot."
Penny,"Sheldon, you know  that we care about you."
Howard,And itês because we care about you that weêve decided we have to speak up.
Penny,"Youêre hurting the people around you, sweetie."
Leonard,"So we made you an appointment, and we want you to keep it."
Sheldon,Department of motor vehicles new driver handbook? But I donêt have a problem.
Leonard,"Sheldon, you need to learn how to drive."
Howard,This madness has to stop.
Leonard,"Pennyês taking you to the DMV, Iêm going to bed."
Sheldon,Why Penny?
Leonard,"Because rock breaks scissors, goodnight."
Penny,"All right, come on Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Hold on, I have one condition."
Sheldon,We have to stop at Pottery Barn.
Sheldon,And Radio Shack.
Sheldon,And the comic book store.
Penny,All right! 
Howard,"Ooh, I want to go to the comic book store. "
Raj,I like comic books.
Sheldon,"I just donêt see why I need a driverês license, Albert Einstein never had a driverês license."
Howard,"Yeah, but Albert Einstein didnêt make me wet myself at 40 miles an hour."
Penny,"Yeah, and I never wanted to kick Albert Einstein in the nuts. You know, I gotta ask, why didnêt you just get a license at 16 like everybody else?"
Sheldon,I was otherwise engaged.
Penny,Doing what?
Sheldon,Examining perturbative amplitudes in n=4 supersymmetric theories leading to a re-examination of the ultraviolet properties of multi-loop n=8 supergravity using modern twistor theory.
Penny,"Well, how êbout when you were 17?"
Sheldon,Iêm actually more of a theorist.
Howard,"The application in your hand, give it to her."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, but I have some concerns about these questions."
Sheldon,"Just, look, see, this first question makes no sense, how many car lengths should you leave in front of you when driving? Thereês no possible way to answer that, a car length is not a standardized unit of measure."
Penny,"Sheldon, itês C, just put down C."
Sheldon,"I donêt need your help, Penny."
Sheldon,"No, no, wait, no, hang on, look at this next question."
Howard,"Sheldon, why are you arguing with the DMV?"
Sheldon,"How else are they going to learn? Look, question 2, when are roadways most slippery? Now, okay, there are three answers, none of which are correct. The correct answer is, when covered by a film of liquid sufficient to reduce the coefficient of static friction between the tire and the road to essentially zero, but not so deep as to introduce a new source of friction."
Sheldon,But Iêm not done. I have many additional concerns about these questions.
Penny,"Come on, letês go."
Sheldon,Aced it.
Howard,"Okay, thatês it, letês boot it up."
Howard,This is a state-of-the-art simulator. I adapted it from something a friend of mine designed for the army.
Sheldon,"Is that why I appear to be in downtown Fallujah, behind the wheel of an up-armored Humvee?"
Howard,I havenêt configured it yet. Letês seeÑ Bradley tankÑ transport truckÑ  BatmobileÑ
Howard,"Here we go, red 2006 Ford Taurus on the streets of Pasadena."
Sheldon,"Statistically, red cars are stopped by police far more often than any other colour. I donêt want any hassles with the fuzz."
Howard,"Fine, what colour do you want?"
Sheldon,"You know the pale blue of Luke Skywalkerês lightsaber, before it was digitally remastered?"
Howard,Black it is.
Leonard,"Okay, now, what you want to do first is turn on the ignition and shift into drive."
Sheldon,I havenêt fastened my seat belt yet.
Leonard,"Okay, fasten your seat belt."
Sheldon,"Click. Now, are there air bags?"
Leonard,You donêt need air bags.
Sheldon,What if a simulated van rear-ends me?
Penny,Iêll hit you in the face with a pillow.
Leonard,"Okay, now shift into drive, pull out slowly into traffic."
Leonard,Watch out.
Howard,Oh God!
Leonard,"Watch, watch out, watch out for pedestrians!"
Penny,"Oh God, wait, slow, hit the brakes, hit the brakes!"
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,SorryÑ excuse meÑ my badÑ student driverÑ
Leonard,How did you manage to get on the second floor of the Glendale galleria?
Sheldon,"I donêt know. I was on the Pasadena freeway, I missed my exit, flew off the overpass, and one thing led to another."
Leonard,Maybe you want to give it a rest and try again tomorrow.
Sheldon,I quit. 
Leonard,"Aw, the pet store?"
Sheldon,"Remind me to compliment Wolowitz on the software, itês amazingly detailed."
Leonard,"So wait,youêre just gonna give up?"
Sheldon,"No, Iêm not giving up, I never give up."
Leonard,So what is it youêre doing?
Sheldon,Iêm transcending the situation. Iêm clearly too evolved for driving.
Leonard,What does that mean?
Sheldon,"Leonard, have you ever wondered why my little toes and lateral incisors are significantly smaller than the average for someone of my size?"
Leonard,"I wonder a lot of things about you, Sheldon, but notÑ not that."
Sheldon,"Well, those are indicators that Iêm farther along the evolutionary scale than the average human."
Leonard,No kidding.
Sheldon,"Well, no, no, Iêm not going to go so far as to say that I represent a distinct new stage in humankind, you know, a Homo Novus, if you will, no, thatês for anthropologists to decide. But I am convinced that the reason I cannot master the plebeian task of driving is because Iêm not meant to."
Leonard,"Yes, you are, youêre meant to learn how to drive. Please learn how to drive!"
Sheldon,"No, no. Leonard, Iêm meant for greater things, like unraveling the mysteries of the universe, not determining when itês safe to pass a stopped school bus on a country road."
Leonard,Itês never safe.
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, I know that now."
Leonard,"Fine. Assuming that everything you say is true, how does the biologically superior Homo Novus get to work tomorrow morning?"
Sheldon,Homo Novus doesnêt know.
Leonard,"Well, hang in there, maybe youêll evolve into something with wings."
Sheldon,"Good morning, gentlemen."
Raj,Good morning. Is there some new kind of casual Friday I donêt know about?
Leonard,"No, he lives here now."
Howard,Really? Why?
Leonard,"Well, since he wonêt take the bus and heês too evolved to drive, he decided it would be easier to just sleep in his office and shower in the radiation lab until Iêm finished with my experiment."
Raj,But you finished your experiment a week ago.
Sheldon,You saw nothing! 
Leonard,"So, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. Once again, Iêm sorry that the demonstration didnêt quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach Snapple into a helium neon laser. Short answer isÑ donêt. And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Dr. Cooper?"
Sheldon,Forget it.
Leonard,"Excuse me. Sheldon, we both agreed to do this."
Sheldon,Itês a waste of time. I might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics to a bunch of labradoodles.
Leonard,"If you donêt do this, I wonêt take you to the comic book store."
Sheldon,"Hello. Nice work with the laser, by the way. Looking out at your fresh young faces, I remember when I too was deciding my academic future as a lowly graduate student. Of course, I was 14, and Iêd already achieved more than most of you could ever hope to, despite my 9 oêclock bedtime. Now, there may be one or two of you in this room who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics, although, itês more likely that youêll spend your scientific careers teaching fifth graders how to make paper mache volcanoes with baking soda lava."
Leonard,"Oh, good God."
Sheldon,"In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if youêll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out. Come, Leonard."
Leonard,"Laser demonstrationês looking pretty good now, huh?"
Raj,"I love this time of the year. The leaves are turning, thereês a bracing chill in the air."
Howard,"Plus thereês a whole new crop of female grad students about to put on just enough winter weight to make them needy and vulnerable. Thatês right, honey, have another calzone, Daddy can wait."
Raj,Isnêt there a university policy against dating graduate students?
Leonard,"No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out."
Raj,"Damn, thereês always a catch."
Leonard,"Hey, Leslie."
Sheldon,The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. But why should I cater to second-rate minds?
Sheldon,"Oh, yeah? WellÑ youêre a mean person."
Sheldon,That is the prevailing opinion.
Howard,"Howard Wolowitz, department of engineering, co-designer of the International Space Stationês Liquid Waste Disposal System."
Sheldon,"Amazing, an intelligent labradoodle."
Sheldon,The fact is Iêm quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.
Sheldon,Itês what I do.
Howard,"You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz Liquid Waste Disposal System is turning a few heads as well."
Sheldon,I donêt drink coffee.
Howard,I do. I love me a cup of joe.
Sheldon,I do eat dinner.
Sheldon,I never eat in strange restaurants. One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.
Leonard,Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.
Sheldon,"Three tines is not a fork, three tines is a trident. Forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas."
Sheldon,"That would be acceptable. On Mondays, I eat Thai food. Mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace."
Sheldon,What a nice girl.
Howard,"Sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?"
Sheldon,Yes. Apparently Iêm getting a free dinner.
Penny,"Oh, yeah, no, this thingês majorly out of order.  See? Sorry."
Penny,Where you going?
Penny,"Oh, are you here to see Leonard?"
Penny,Dr. Sheldon Cooper?
Penny,"Sheldon Cooper? Tall, thin, looks a little like a giant praying mantis?"
Penny,Sheldon Cooper?
Leonard,"Hey, Ramona. Come on in."
Leonard,"Uh, the kitchenês fine.  Hey, what are you doing?"
Penny,I need to see this.
Leonard,"Uh-huh. The viewing areaês right over there. Sheldon, your girlÑ dateÑ personÑ Ramonaês here."
Sheldon,"Oh, hello."
Sheldon,Did you enjoy the humorous footnote where I illustrate mirror-symmetry by likening it to the Flash playing tennis with himself?
Sheldon,My hypotheses tend to have that effect.
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. No, we were just going."
Howard,"To watch, right?"
Leonard,"No, come on, now, weêre going out."
Penny,"Oh, come on, weêll be quiet."
Leonard,"Letês go. Okay, you two, just, have a niceÑ whatever this is."
Penny,"Okay, you guys, look, I know this is none of my business, but I just, I have to ask, whatês Sheldonês deal?"
Leonard,What do you mean _dealî?
Penny,"You know, like whatês his deal? Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?"
Leonard,"Honestly, weêve been operating under the assumption that he has no deal."
Penny,"Come on, everybody has a deal."
Howard,"Not Sheldon. Over the years, weêve formulated many theories about how he might reproduce. Iêm an advocate of mytosis."
Penny,Iêm sorry?
Howard,I believe one day Sheldon will eat an enormous amount of Thai food and split into two Sheldons.
Leonard,"On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday heêll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton."
Penny,"Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares."
Leonard,"Hey, do you want to hang out with us?"
Penny,What are you guys gonna do?
Howard,My momês making a brisket tonight.
Leonard,The one with the little onions? Mmm.
Penny,"Yeah, Iêm busy, so, goodnight."
Howard,Her loss. Letês go.
Raj,Brisket party! B-to-the-R-to-the-I-S-KÑ To-the-E-to-the-TÑ OohÑ
Leonard,"Hey, arenêt you having breakfast?"
Leonard,Are you experimenting with nutritional suppositories again?
Sheldon,Not in these pants.
Leonard,"So, howêd it go with Ramona last night?"
Sheldon,"Oh, great. Sheês smart, insightful and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me."
Sheldon,Thank you. Did anyone touch it?
Sheldon,Ramona pointed out that Iêve been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines.
Sheldon,"You donêt tackle the big issues, Ramona. You fence with them. En garde. Riposte."
Leonard,"Ah, hey Leslie."
Sheldon,"Oh, good one."
Leonard,Wait for me.
Sheldon,"Well, to paraphrase Mozart, all the subatomic particles are there, I just have to put them in the right order."
Sheldon,Arenêt I?
Penny,"Hey, guys, this package came for yÑ"
Sheldon,"Yes, Iêm close to a breakthrough. Ooh, it tickles"
Penny,Sorry.   Holy crap on a cracker.
Leonard,"Hey, Penny."
Penny,"Hi. You know, you probably donêt want to go in there."
Leonard,Why? What are they doing?
Penny,"You know, the only way I could explain it would be in a therapistês office with dolls."
Leonard,"Yeah, I can see that. Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappaliês. You coming?"
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, itês Halo night. Let me just dry my tootsies."
Sheldon,"Yes, I am. Itês Wednesday. Wednesdayês Halo night.</i>"
Sheldon,He did.
Sheldon,"Me. Sorry, Leonard."
Leonard,Seriously? Youêre not coming?
Sheldon,You heard her. How can I argue with me?
Leonard,"Okay, well, once again, you guys have a goodÑ whatever this is."
Sheldon,I prefer to think of it as Iêm pulling them forward.
Sheldon,He does on Wednesdays.
Sheldon,He does want that. Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?
Sheldon,I suppose. Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight.  And then never ever watch it.
Penny,"Sheldon, honey, Iêve told you, itês a small apartment, you only have to knock one time."
Sheldon,"Please, please, I donêt have a lot of time. Look, Ramona finally dozed off, and I need you to help me get rid of her."
Penny,Get rid of her how?
Sheldon,"I donêt know, but apparently Iêm in some kind of relationship, and you seem to be an expert at ending them."
Penny,Excuse me?
Sheldon,I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.
Penny,"Okay, first of all, it is not man after man."
Sheldon,Hide me.
Penny,Hide you?
Sheldon,I formally request sanctuary.
Sheldon,"UmÑ she distracted me. I told you, Penny, I donêt have time for your nonsense, I have important things to do."
Penny,"Oh, man."
Penny,"Really? Well, then will you explain it to me?"
Penny,"Uh, yeah, no, thatês not it."
Penny,"Oh, gee, okay."
Penny,"Yeah, heês a gift all right."
Penny,"Um, sure, sisters.  Holy crap on a cracker."
Leonard,Sheldon?  What are you doing?!
Sheldon,Itês Morse code.
Sheldon,So we can communicate through the wall.
Leonard,We are communicating through the wall.
Sheldon,"Yes, but the communication is not encrypted."
Leonard,I donêt know Morse code.
Sheldon,Itês very simple. This is A  this is CÑ
Leonard,"Sheldon, Iêm not going to learn Morse code at three oêclock in the morning!"
Sheldon,All right.
Leonard,"Donêt come in here, donêt come in here, donêt come in here, donêt  Aw! Whatês going on?"
Sheldon,Shh! Ramonaês sleeping on the couch.
Leonard,I know. When is she going home?
Sheldon,"Never, thatês the problem. I need your help."
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Sheldon,Iêm invoking the Skynet clause of our friendship agreement.
Leonard,That only applies if you need me to help you destroy an artificial intelligence you created thatês taking over the Earth.
Sheldon,Come on! Donêt nitpick!
Leonard,Good night.
Sheldon,"Shh. All right, Iêm invoking our bodysnatchers clause."
Leonard,The bodysnatchers clause requires me to help you destroy someone we know whoês been replaced with an alien pod.
Sheldon,"Yes. Sheês in the living room. Go, Iêll wait here."
Sheldon,Now! Do it!
Sheldon,Godzilla clause?
Leonard,Not unless she destroys Tokyo.
Sheldon,Iêve got it! I finally reconciled the black hole information paradox with my theory of string-network condensates!
Sheldon,And I could not have done it without you.
Sheldon,"It was a lot more than that. You helped me work out the masses of all the fermions, and you pumiced my hammer toe. How can I ever repay you?"
Sheldon,Whoês Nowitzki?
Sheldon,"Oh, you want me to share credit?"
Sheldon,Get out!
Penny,"Oh, hey, hi."
Sheldon,"Maybe when I publish it, Iêll include an inhaler."
Sheldon,"Letês see, todayês Thursday. Thursday nights, I eat pizza from Giacomoês. Sausage, mushrooms, light olives."
Sheldon,What a nice girl.
Leonard,"Sheldon, do you see what just happened here?"
Sheldon,"Yes, Iêm getting a free pizza. Iêm on a roll."
Sheldon,"More Pad Thai, please."
Howard,"Sheldon, youêve already had four servings."
Raj,"You might want to slow down a bit, buddy."
Sheldon,Just one more bite.
Leonard,"Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?"
Sheldon,Iêm just soÑ full.
Leonard,Thatês it. No more Thai food.
Sheldon,"Time. Alright Klingons, pencils down."
Leonard,"Okay, I have pokh."
Howard,I have Chorrr.
Howard,And Kreplach.
Raj,Hold on a second. Kreplach?
Raj,"That isnêt Klingon, itês Yiddish for meat-filled dumpling."
Howard,"Well, as it turns out, itês also a Klingon word."
Leonard,Really? Define it.
Howard,"Kreplach, A hearty KlingonÑ dumpling."
Raj,Judgeês ruling?
Penny,"Hey, guys, I need to use your TV."
Sheldon,Whatês wrong with your TV?
Penny,"I donêt know, it just died, Iêm getting a bunch of static."
Howard,Did you pay your cable bill?
Penny,"You sound just like the cable company. All right, so, shh, Tyra Banks is about to kick someone off  Americaês Next Top Model."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, Penny, but weêreÑ"
Leonard,"No, no, donêt tell her."
Sheldon,Ñplaying Klingon Boggle.
Howard,"What do you mean, aw? Like she didnêt know we were nerds?"
Sheldon,"All right, if you must watch, then mute it with closed captions, please."
Sheldon,"All right, Boggle warriors, kaplaê!"
Howard,Look at those women.
Leonard,Theyêre gorgeous.
Sheldon,"Oh! Worf, nice! Too bad thatês a proper noun."
Howard,"Oh, look, theês the future Mrs. Wolowitz. No, wait, thatês the future Mrs. Wolowitz. With her head in the lap of, what a coincidence. Itês the future Mrs. Wolowitz."
Leonard,"Yeah, and they can all move in with you and your mother, the current Mrs. Wolowitz."
Sheldon,Is qochbeê spelled with a ?
Howard,Why is that Mrs. Wolowitz crying?
Penny,"Oh. Thatês Anais, none of the other girls in the house like her."
Howard,House? What house?
Penny,They all live in a house together.
Howard,"A house, where?"
Penny,I donêt know. Somewhere in L.A.
Howard,"Wait a minute, youêre telling me that Iêm within driving distance of a house filled with aspiring supermodels?"
Penny,"Yeah, I guess."
Howard,And they live together and shower together and have naked pillow fights?
Leonard,"Hey, wh-where are you going?"
Penny,To pay my cable bill.
Sheldon,"All right, pencils down! I have lokh, makh, and cherrrkh. Anybody got those?"
Leonard,Did I miss anything? Did they kick Giselle off?
Raj,"Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment."
Howard,"Sadly, Mrs. Giselle Wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine. Lucky for her I like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed."
Leonard,"Sheldon, the foodês here."
Raj,"Thereês the house, freeze frame, freeze frame."
Leonard,What are you doing?
Raj,Marking the star positions and physical landmarks so we can find the house of the supermodels.
Howard,"Isnêt it obvious? Every week, they kick out a beautiful girl, making her feel unwanted and without self-esteem, a.k.a. the future Mrs. Howard Wolowitz."
Sheldon,Is my hamburger medium well?
Sheldon,"Dill slices, not sweet?"
Sheldon,Individual relish packets?
Sheldon,Onion rings?
Sheldon,Extra breading?
Leonard,I asked.
Sheldon,What did they say?
Sheldon,Did you protest?
Sheldon,"Well, then what took you so long?"
Leonard,Just eat.
Penny,"Hey, guys, whatêd I miss? Whatêd I miss?"
Howard,Giselleês hanging by a thread.
Penny,"Oh, good, I hate her."
Howard,Then youêre not invited to our wedding.
Leonard,Here you go.
Penny,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Oh, do we have to suffer through this transparently manipulative pseudo-reality again?"
Sheldon,You and I have a standing TV schedule which is the result of extensive debate and compromise. Any alterations except for breaking news have to be pre-approved at the weekly roommate meeting.
Leonard,Put it on the agenda.
Sheldon,But you have to make a motion to put it on agenda.
Leonard,"Oh, Iêll make a motion, but youêre not going to like it."
Sheldon,Fine. Mock Parliamentary procedure. At least put it on mute.
Penny,"Oh, Giselleês not getting kicked off. Itês totally going to be Summer.  What?"
Leonard,Sheldonês onion ring. Just put it back!
Penny,Itês one onion ring.
Howard,Just put it back before he comes!
Leonard,"No, no, no,  no, I donêt think thatês where it was."
Howard,"Okay, here he comes, deny, deny, people, wall of silence."
Sheldon,Who touched myÑ
Sheldon,Why would you do that?
Penny,I donêt know. I was hungry? Whatês the big deal?
Sheldon,The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.
Penny,"All right. Look, I didnêt know, Iêm sorry."
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm sorry, but that is your second strike."
Sheldon,You have two strikes. Three strikes and youêre out. Itês a sports metaphor.
Penny,A sports metaphor?
Sheldon,"Yes, baseball."
Penny,"All right, yeah, Iêll play along. What was my first strike?"
Sheldon,March 18th. You violated my rule about forwarding email humour.
Penny,I did?
Sheldon,The photo of the cat who wants to _has cheezburgerî?
Penny,"Oh, come on, everybody loves LOLcats. Theyêre cute and they canêt spell êcause theyêre cats."
Sheldon,"I trusted you with my email address, and you betrayed that trust by sending me Internet banality, strike one. Touching my food, strike two."
Leonard,Donêt worry. They only stay on your record for a year.
Howard,"You can get them removed early, but you have to take his class."
Penny,"Come on, I touched one onion ring."
Sheldon,"And then you put it back, compromising the integrity of all the other onion rings."
Penny,"Oh, honey, the buses donêt go where you live, do they?"
Sheldon,"Look, Penny, I wish I could be more lenient with you, but since youêve become a permanent member of our social group I have to hold you to the same standards as everybody else."
Leonard,Congratulations. Youêre officially one of us.
Howard,"One of us, one of us."
Penny,"Well, what a thrill."
Sheldon,Youêre sitting in my spot.
Penny,"Oh, jeez, youêve got to be kidding me."
Sheldon,"Leonard, sheês in my spot."
Leonard,"Yeah, yeah. Uh, see, hereês the thing, after you leave, I still have to live with him."
Penny,I donêt care. Iêm taking a stand. Metaphorically.
Sheldon,"All right, thatês it. Strike three."
Penny,"Ooh, strike three."
Penny,Iêm banished? What the hell kind of crap is that?
Leonard,"Listen, donêt worry. Iêll talk to him."
Penny,"Yeah, you do that."
Leonard,"Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class? You can do it online!"
Howard,So based on our triangulation weêve narrowed down the location of the top model house to three square miles in the Hollywood Hills.
Raj,"Or possibly Durham, North Carolina."
Howard,"When we find it, you want to go with us?"
Leonard,To do what?
Raj,"Party with the pretty girls, dude!"
Leonard,"Are you insane? Youêre not going to party with them, youêre not even going to get anywhere near that place."
Howard,Thatês what they said to Neil Armstrong about the moon.
Sheldon,"No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong, the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon."
Howard,"Well, my fellow Americans, before this year is out we will put a Wolowitz on one of Americaês top models."
Raj,And a large number of people will believe it never happened.
Penny,"Okay, let me guess. A quesadilla with soy cheese for the lactose-intolerant Leonard."
Leonard,Thank you.
Penny,"Shrimp Caesar salad with no almonds for the highly allergic kosher-only-on-the-high-holidays Howard, and for our suddenly back on the Hindu wagon Raj, meatloverês pizza, no meat. Coming right up."
Sheldon,"Wait. Excuse me. You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side."
Penny,"Oh, I didnêt tell you? Youêre banished from the Cheesecake Factory."
Penny,"Well, you have three strikes. One, coming in. Two, sitting down. And three, I donêt like your attitude."
Sheldon,"You canêt do that. Not only is it a violation of California state law, it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy."
Penny,"Yeah, no, thereês a new policy. No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon."
Howard,I bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena.
Leonard,"Penny, can I talk to you for a minute? Hi."
Leonard,"Look, hereês the thing, um, I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line."
Penny,"Really? Well, thatês great."
Leonard,"Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?"
Penny,Iêm not going to apologize to that nutcase.
Leonard,"Oh, come on, itês easy, heêll even tell you what to say."
Penny,"Leonard, donêt you get it? If you guys keep going along with his insanity, youêre just encouraging him."
Leonard,Weêre not encouraging. Itês more like knuckling under.
Penny,"Look, I like hanging out with you guys, but Iêm not going to apologize for something I didnêt do."
Leonard,"Well, actually, technically, you did do it."
Penny,"Thatês strike one, Leonard."
Penny,"There you go, quesadilla, salad, thereês your pizza, and thanks to Sheldonês heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Penny,"Go ahead, eat it. I dare you"
Howard,"Thatês it. Thereês the house, I found Americaês top models!"
Raj,Are you sure?
Howard,"Look, on the roof, Anais and Giselle are sunbathing. European-style."
Leonard,You can recognize people on Google Earth?
Howard,"Of course not, I got a buddy of mine at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over."
Leonard,NORAD? Youêre using military aircraft?
Howard,"It was already targeted to poke around a nuclear reactor in Siberia, I took it an hour out of its way, tops."
Penny,"Okay, where is he?"
Leonard,Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?
Penny,Here. Try and go online.
Leonard,Problem with the WiFi?
Penny,"No, just try."
Sheldon,"Greetings, hamburger toucher. You are probably wondering why you cannot IM with your little friends about how much you heart various things. Well, this recorded message is alerting you that I am putting an end to your parasitic piggybacking upon our WiFi. If you want to remedy the situation you can contact the phone company, set up your own WiFi and pay for it, or you may apologize to me."
Leonard,"I reiterate, knuckle under."
Penny,"No, no, no, no, no. It is on. I am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt."
Leonard,"Oh, Penny, you donêt want to get into it with Sheldon. The guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain."
Penny,"I donêt care, I was in junior rodeo, I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds."
Howard,"No need to neuter the nerd, I can get you back online."
Leonard,"There, see? Problem solved."
Sheldon,"Hello, puny insects. As a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will, everyone is awarded one additional strike."
Leonard,"Thanks a lot, Howard."
Howard,What are you complaining about? Iêm the one who has to take the class again.
Sheldon,Oh! Hello.
Penny,"Time to do your laundry, huh?"
Sheldon,Itês Saturday night. Saturday is laundry night.
Penny,"I know. Every Saturday at 8:15, easy to anticipate."
Sheldon,What are you implying?
Penny,"Iêm implying that youêre a creature of habit, and if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry on Saturday at 8:15, you might find it unpleasant.  Knuckle under, my ass."
Penny,"Oh, no, are all the machines taken? What are you gonna do?"
Sheldon,"No problem, Iêll just do my laundry another night."
Penny,"Another night? Well, I guess you can try, but deep inside your heart youêll know that laundry night is always Saturday night."
Sheldon,"Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken."
Penny,"Yeah, well, your ken can kiss my Barbie."
Penny,Where are my clothes?
Sheldon,Your clothes?
Penny,"Yes, I left them in the washers and when I went down to get them, they were gone."
Sheldon,Really? Despite the sign that says _Do not leave laundry unattendedî?
Penny,"Sheldon, where are my clothes?"
Sheldon,"You know, I do recall seeing some female undergarments. Where was that? Oh, yes, earlier this evening I happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye. Do those look familiar?"
Penny,How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?
Sheldon,"When you understand the laws of physics, Penny, anything is possible. And may I add, mwah-ha-ha!"
Penny,Get them down.
Sheldon,"Well, then may I suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata."
Penny,"Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay? Iêve done some stupid things, youêve done some stupid things, how about we just call it even and move on with our lives?"
Sheldon,Iêve done no stupid things.
Penny,"Look, youêve got to meet me halfway here."
Sheldon,"I am meeting you halfway, Iêm willing to concede that youêve done some stupid things."
Leonard,"Hey, you guys are talking again. Good. What happened?"
Penny,"Leonard, remember when I said it was on? Well, now itês junior rodeo on."
Leonard,"Oh, not junior rodeo. What did you do?"
Sheldon,"I had no choice, Leonard, she ruined laundry night."
Penny,"Telephone wires canêt electrocute you, can they?"
Leonard,"Look, this has to stop."
Penny,"Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning."
Leonard,"All right, I really didnêt want to do this, butÑ here."
Penny,Whatês this?
Leonard,Sheldonês Kryptonite.
Penny,"Oh, my God."
Leonard,He can never know that I gave that to you.
Penny,"Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but, but this?"
Leonard,Itêll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.
Raj,"Oh, pause it. Thatês it. Confirmed. We now have the address of the top model house."
Howard,"God bless you, Google Street View registered trademark."
Leonard,"Okay, for the record what youêre doing is really creepy."
Howard,"You know what? If itês creepy to use the Internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly, then fine, Iêm creepy."
Leonard,"Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Iêll get him. Sheldon, itês for you."
Sheldon,Who is it?
Leonard,Your mother.
Sheldon,"Oh, good. Hi, Mom. How are you? But, Mom, she keeps sitting in my spot. And, and she touched my food. Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it. No, thatês not fair. Why should I have to apologize? Yeah, I really donêt think this is the kind of thing Jesus concerns himself with. No, youêre right, I donêt really know what Jesus thinks about. All right, good-bye. Did you tell on me?"
Leonard,Are you kidding me? I already have two strikes.
Sheldon," I am very, very sorry for what I have done. Hereês your laundry, I rescind your strikes and you are no longer banished."
Penny,"Can I sit wherever I want? No, no, never mind, never mind, thatês, thatês not important. Sheldon, this was big of you. Thank you. I really appreciate it."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Penny,"Good night, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Well played.
Penny,Thank you.
Sheldon,Just remember: with great power comes great responsibility.
Howard,"Yes, we here to fix the cable."
Howard,Thatês what I meant.
Howard,Sheês taller than all the women in my family combined.
Raj,What do we do now?
Howard,Follow Mrs. Wolowitz.
Sheldon,"Oh look, Saturn 3 is on."
Raj,I donêt want to watch Saturn 3. Deep Space Nine is better.
Sheldon,How is Deep Space Nine better than Saturn 3?
Raj,Simple subtraction will tell you itês six better.
Leonard,Compromise. Watch Babylon 5.
Sheldon,In what sense is that a compromise?
Leonard,"Well, five is partway between threeÑ Never mind."
Raj,"Iêll tell you what, how about we go rock-paper-scissors?"
Sheldon,"Ooh, I donêt think so. No, anecdotal evidence suggests that in the game of rock-paper-scissors, players familiar with each other will tie 75 to 80% of the time due to the limited number of outcomes. I suggest rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock."
Sheldon,"Itês very simple. Look, scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
Raj,"Okay, I think I got it. "
Howard,"Hello, boys."
Leonard,"Ahoy, matey."
Howard,"Noticed the eye patch, did you? Itês all part of a technique Iêve been studying for picking up women. You employ a visual display designed to make yourself distinctive and memorable."
Sheldon,"Oh yes, like the male peacock with brilliant plumage or the rutting baboon with engorged hindquarters."
Leonard,"Or in this case, the bar mitzvah boy with pinkeye."
Howard,"Mock me if you will, but it works. You show up at a club in something distinctive, scope out your target and toss out some negs."
Raj,What are negs?
Howard,"A neg is a negative compliment that throws a pretty woman off her game, like _Normally, Iêm not turned on by big teeth, but on you, they work.î Iêve got a whole list of êem. Who wants to be my wingman?"
Leonard,"Youêre not gonna need wingman, youêre gonna need a paramedic."
Penny,"Howard, your scooterês blocking my car. Aw, did you get pinkeye again?"
Howard,"Step one, she notices the eye patch. May I say, Penny, not a lot of women could look as hot as you do with such greasy hair? "
Penny,"Yeah, just move your stupid scooter before I pick it up and throw it in the dumpster."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, but Iêm not going to watch the Clone Wars TV series until Iêve seen the Clone Wars movie. I prefer to let George Lucas disappoint me in the order he intended."
Leonard,"Well, I want to watch it now."
Sheldon,Then I believe weêve arrived at another quintessential rock-paper-scissors- lizard-Spock moment.
Leonard,Watch whatever you want.
Raj,I saw what you did there.
Sheldon,What did I do?
Leonard,"Hello. Hey, Howard. Whatês wrong? Okay. Okay, weêll be right there."
Sheldon,What happened?
Leonard,Howardês at the Mars Rover lab. He says heês in trouble. Defcon 5.
Sheldon,"Defcon 5? Well, thereês no need to rush."
Sheldon,Defcon 5 means no danger. Defcon 1 is a crisis.
Leonard,How can 5 not be worse than 1?
Raj,"Yeah, Star Trek V, worse than I."
Sheldon,"Okay, first of all, thatês a comparison of quality, not intensity. Secondly, Star Trek I is orders-of-magnitude worse than Star Trek V."
Raj,Are you joking? Star Trek V is the standard against which all badness is measured.
Sheldon,"No, no, no. Star Trek V has specific failures in writing and direction, while Star Trek I fails across the board, art direction, costuming, music, sound editing."
Leonard,Can we just forget I said Defcon and go?
Raj,Star Trek V!
Sheldon,"All right, will you at least stipulate that Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is inarguably the best?"
Raj,I have three words for you. Wrath of Khan.
Howard,"Oh, thank God, youêre here."
Leonard,Whatês the emergency?
Howard,I got the Mars Rover stuck in a ditch.
Howard,On a dusty highway just outside Bakersfield. Where do you think? On Mars!
Howard,"Yeah, baby, Iêll be right in."
Sheldon,You brought a girl to the Mars Rover control room?
Howard,"Yeah, I picked her up in the bar. Sheês a doctor. One free barium enema and my mother wonêt care sheês not Jewish."
Leonard,"Wait a minute, so the eye patch and the insults worked?"
Howard,"No, there were three other guys with eye patches, iIt was a fiasco. What did work was, _Howêd you like to visit a secret government facility?î"
Sheldon,So what exactly do you want us to do?
Howard,"I need you and Raj to help me get the Rover out of the ditch, and I need you to get Stephanie out before somebody notices sheês here. She doesnêt exactly have clearance."
Sheldon,Really? They donêt let strange women from honky-tonks come in and play with $200million government projects on distant planets?
Howard,"Yes, I was bad. Maybe sheêll spank me. Can we please move on?"
Howard,"Yeah. Iêm sorry, but somethingês come up. Kind of a Mars Rover, Mars Rover, can Howard come over, situation. So my friend Leonard is gonna take you home."
Howard,Iêll call ya.
Leonard,No oneês a scientist like Howard.
Howard,My mother is so gonna love her.
Sheldon,"Oh, how nice. Maybe they can carpool when they visit you in federal prison."
Leonard,"Just said Howardês a terrific guy. Heês got a great sense of humour, he loves his mother, a lot, some people say too much."
Leonard,"Yeah, I am loyal. You know, if you look at the big picture. Just, out of curiosity, did he ever have a shot with you?"
Leonard,Then why did you?
Leonard,"Got it. So, can I see you again?"
Leonard,Ooh. Cool.
Raj,"Actually, I was just checking my e-mail. But, uh, no, the Rover is not responding."
Sheldon,I believe the appropriate metaphor here involves a river of excrement and a Native American water vessel without any means of propulsion.
Howard,"Hang on, thereês got to be other options."
Raj,"You could try calling Triple-A, but based on NASAês latest timetable, they wonêt get there for 35 years."
Sheldon,Plus I understand you have to be standing next to the vehicle with your card when they arrive.
Raj,"Oh, snap."
Sheldon,Snap what?
Howard,"OK, I guess we have to turn to Plan B."
Raj,Whatês Plan B?
Howard,"Erase all the hard drives, scrap the surveillance tapes, wipe our fingerprints off every surface and run."
Sheldon,Why wasnêt that Plan A?
Howard,Thank God for Plan B.
Penny,"Howard, didnêt you say you worked on the Mars Rover?"
Howard,"No, youêre mistaken."
Penny,"Yeah, when we first met, you said that if I went out with you, I could drive a car on Mars."
Howard,I donêt know what youêre talking about.
Leonard,Psst! Psst!
Sheldon,Will you all excuse me? Leonard is subtly signalling that heêd like to talk to me in private.
Penny,"Yeah, I remember specifically. You started by asking if I was from Mars because my ass was out of this world."
Howard,"Well, that does sound like me, but no."
Sheldon,Is there some problem?
Leonard,"Yeah. Listen, I have to kinda sneak out for a while."
Sheldon,"All right, goodbye."
Leonard,"No, wait! If anyone asks you where I went, you donêt know."
Sheldon,Where are you going?
Leonard,I canêt tell you that.
Sheldon,Who would ask me?
Leonard,"I canêt tell you that, either."
Sheldon,So you brought me in here to inform me that you canêt tell me where youêre going and you canêt tell me who might ask?
Leonard,"Yeah, I really didnêt think this through."
Sheldon,"Leonard, a moment."
Sheldon,"If someone, and of course, we donêt know who this would be, does ask where youêve gone, what should I say?"
Leonard,I donêt know. Just tell them I went to the office.
Sheldon,Are you going to the office?
Sheldon,Then how can I say it convincingly?
Leonard,"Just say, Leonard went to the office."
Sheldon,All right. Leonard went to  the office.
Leonard,"What is? No, not like that! Just, Leonard went to the office."
Sheldon,This would have worked out a lot better if youêd just told me you were going the office.
Leonard,Iêm going to the office.
Sheldon,See? Why donêt I believe you?
Leonard,Iêm going out for a while.
Sheldon,Doesnêt anyone want to know where heês going?
Penny,"Okay, where is he going?"
Sheldon,Leonard is going to  the office.
Leonard,So how was work today?
Leonard,Iêm hoping thatês three different guys.
Leonard,"Oh, you know, Iêm a physicist, so, I thought about stuff."
Leonard,"Well, I wrote some of it down."
Leonard,"Uh, yeah."
Leonard,"If I knew you were waiting, I wouldêve swallowed that lasagna whole."
Howard,"Hey, Steph, itês me again, Howard. Listen, if youêre free Friday, maybe we could have a little something to eat at my place. My mom cooks a hell of a brisket. Let me know. Itês Howard."
Leonard,Iêve had her brisket. Melts in your mouth.
Leonard,"Thatês a good idea. Thereês a bed in there, and Iêm very, very, very pro-bed."
Howard,"Hey, itês me again. Just want to let you know the head count for dinner Friday has gone up. My Aunt Betty and Uncle Elliot are coming in from Palm Springs. Oh, and if anybody should ask, youêre half-Jewish on your motherês side. Okay, call me. Itês Howard."
Leonard,Donêt you think we should tell him youêre not interested?
Leonard,"Dear God, no!"
Howard,"Hey, itês me again. Howard. Listen, my cousins from Fort Lauderdale are flying in to meet you so that means weêre gonna have to move the dinner to a restaurant."
Howard,"Weêre not going to the Olive Garden, Mom!"
Howard,Iêll call you back when we firm up the details. Itês Howard.
Penny,"Oh, hey."
Penny,New shirts?
Leonard,"Yeah, a couple."
Leonard, Thank you.
Penny,"So, whoês the girl?"
Leonard,Iêm sorry?
Penny,"Well, last time you bought a new shirt was when we were dating."
Leonard,"So, uh, what we did was in fact dating?"
Penny,"Well, yeah, we did have a date."
Leonard,"Exactly. Thank you. Do me a favour, tell Koothrappali that next time you see him."
Penny,"So, who is she?"
Leonard,"Oh, sheês a doctor."
Penny,"Oh, nice. A doctor doctor, or a you kind of doctor?"
Leonard,"Doctor doctor. Surgical resident. Smart, pretty. Let me ask you something. If your friend thinks heês dating someone, but heês not because, in fact, youêre dating her, does that make you a bad person?"
Penny,"Well, that depends."
Leonard,On what?
Penny,Is that friend Wolowitz?
Penny,Screw him. Youêre fine.
Leonard,Are you sure?
Penny,"Well, have you slept with her yet? You dog! Good for you."
Leonard,Does that change things?
Leonard,So whyêd you ask?
Penny,Iêm nosy. See ya.
Howard,Itês Leonard!
Howard,"No one cares, Ma! So, whatês up?"
Leonard,"Listen, I need to talk to you about something."
Raj,"Okay, who gets the extra dumpling?"
Sheldon,"Okay, one of us is going to have to stop putting up Spock."
Howard,How do we decide that?
Leonard,"Oh, hey, guys."
Leonard,"Hi, Howard. Howard?"
Sheldon,"Howard is employing a schoolyard paradigm in which you are, for all intents and purposes, deceased. He intends to act on this by not speaking to you, feigning an inability to hear you when you speak and otherwise refusing to acknowledge your existence."
Leonard,Thatês just ridiculous. Why are you cooperating with him?
Sheldon,"I donêt make the rules, Leonard."
Leonard,"Howard, come on, I didnêt plan on this. These things just happen. Usually not to me, but they do happen."
Howard,Did someone just feel a cold breeze?
Sheldon,I believe this is an extension of the death metaphor. The cold breeze is the so-called ectoplasmic issue of a disembodied soul passing by.
Raj,"You know, screw it, Iêm just gonna eat the dumpling."
Leonard,"Oh, hi, Steph, come on in."
Leonard,"Yeah, but I donêt see a better one on the horizon, soÑ"
Howard,"Oh, if it isnêt Mrs. Dead to Me."
Sheldon,"Look Iêm sorry, you violated the terms of your metaphor by acknowledging her existence. Iêm out."
Leonard,He just wonêt listen to me.
Leonard,Hmm. Lisaês gonna be disappointed.
Howard,"Leonard, Stephanie, youêre alive, itês a miracle!"
Howard,"So, anyway, Lisa, I just wanted to tell you again how much I enjoyed the other night, and again, Iêm sorry for how it ended. But again, if you could let me know about Friday. My mother needs a head count so she can know how big a brisket to get."
Leonard,"Howard, Howard, look at this."
Howard,"Anyway, call me. Itês Howard."
Howard,Son of a bitch.
Sheldon,"Penny, hello."
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
Sheldon,What is shaking?
Penny,Iêm sorry?
Sheldon,"Itês colloquial, a conversation opener. So, do you find the weather satisfying? Are you currently sharing in the triumph of some local sports team?"
Penny,Whatês wrong with you? youêre freaking me out.
Sheldon,Iêm striking up a casual conversation with you. Sêuêup?
Penny,Please donêt do that.
Sheldon,"All right, But Iêm given to understand that when you have something awkward to discuss with someone, itês more palatable to preface it with banal chit chat."
Penny,"So, this wasnêt the awkward part?"
Penny,"Oh, all right. Sêuêup?"
Sheldon,"Oh, good, I used that right. Anyway, youêre aware that Leonard has entered into a new romantic relationship which includes a sexual component?"
Penny,"Okay, feeling the awkward now."
Sheldon,Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett and she is a highly distinguished surgical resident at Freemont Memorial.
Penny,"Yeah, Leonard told me."
Sheldon,Good. What he may have left out is how important this relationship is to me.
Penny,To you?
Sheldon,"Yes, see, of the handful of women Leonardês been involved with, sheês the only one I have ever found tolerable."
Penny,"Well, what about me?"
Sheldon,The statement stands for itself.
Penny,"Well, arenêt you sweet?"
Sheldon,"Anyway, should you have any interaction with her, it would be most helpful that she not see you as a sexual rival."
Penny,"Yeah, I think sheês pretty safe."
Sheldon,"You say that now, but consider the following scenario, youêre sitting in your apartment, itês late, youêre alone, your hypothalamus is swimming in a soup of estrogen and progesterone and suddenly even Leonard seems like a viable sexual candidate, or a, uh, hookup as itês referred to by todayês urban youth."
Sheldon,"Yes. Now, should that happen, I would ask you to find some way to suppress your libido."
Penny,I could think about you.
Sheldon,"Fine, whatever works."
Penny,"Always nice talking to you, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Uh, peace out!"
Sheldon,"Well, this is very pleasant."
Leonard,Iêm glad youêre enjoying yourself.
Sheldon,And you said thereêd never be enough pasta for the three of us.
Leonard,I stand corrected.
Sheldon,"You know, Italian housewives have a rule of thumb. A handful of dry pasta about an inch in diameter is sufficient for each person as it doubles in volume when cooked."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Leonard,She doesnêt mean it. Sheês just being nice.
Sheldon,"Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems to be dropping the conversational ball, I guess Iêll just have to pick it up. Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?"
Sheldon,Good. Whatês your favourite fruit?
Sheldon,"Hmm, technically not a fruit, but all right. Where did you do your medical internship?"
Sheldon,Really? Thatês where I was born!
Sheldon,"I spent so much of my childhood at that hospital. When I was 12, I got to ride there in a helicopter."
Sheldon,Radiation burns. A little mishap while I was building my own cat scanner.
Sheldon,"No, I didnêt try, I succeeded. In fact, I was briefly able to see the inside of my sisterês guinea pig, Snowball, before he caught fire. It led to an interesting expression in our house, not a snowballês chance in a cat scanner."
Leonard,"Uh, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,"Excuse me. When I come back, just for fun, the subject will be alternative history. Specifically, how would the civil war have gone differently if Lincoln had been a robot sent from the future?  Look at that, thereês even pasta left over."
Leonard,Do you understand that this was supposed to be a date?
Sheldon,"I do. Do you? Because frankly, youêve been in a foul mood since I sat down."
Leonard,"Okay, hereês my question, why did you sit down?"
Sheldon,"To help. Look, if you fail at this relationship, and history suggests you will, then we risk losing the medical officer that our landing party has always needed."
Leonard,What landing party?
Sheldon,"Youêre Kirk, Iêm Spock, Wolowitz is Scotty, Koothrappali is the guy who always gets killed, and now weêve got McCoy."
Leonard,"Oh, my god, what did you do?"
Sheldon,"I have a bone to pick with you, sir."
Sheldon,"Hi, Stephanie. Iêm sorry Iêm late, but your companion left the most indecipherable invitation."
Leonard,What invitation?
Sheldon,"Weêre going to the movies. What movie? What theatre? What time? If you were trying to make it impossible to locate you, you couldnêt have done a better job."
Leonard,"Oh, clearly I could have."
Sheldon,"It took me nearly 20 minutes to go through the browser history on your computer to see what movie times you looked up. Wait here, Iêll find us seats."
Leonard,Not the right seats. 
Leonard,Heês finding the acoustic sweet spot.
Leonard,Sometimes he brings a toy xylophone. I am really sorry about this.
Sheldon,"My apologies, youêve been sitting in it all along. Leonard, you want to slide over one?"
Leonard,"No, just sit here."
Sheldon,"Oh, yeah, this is it."
Leonard,Sheldon? Sheldon? Sheldon?
Sheldon,Tell me what you see here.
Leonard,The blunt instrument that will be the focus of my murder trial?
Sheldon,"This is Stephanieês facebook page. Now, where it should say in a relationship, what does it say?"
Leonard,Stephanie Barnett is single.
Sheldon,"Yeah, furthermore, earlier this evening, she threw a digital sheep at some guy named Mike. Whoês Mike? Why does he get a digital sheep and not you?"
Leonard,Itês just her facebook page and weêve only been going out a couple of weeks.
Sheldon,"You donêt see it, do you? Weêre losing her."
Leonard,"Okay, Iêm going to make this very simple for you. You are not in this relationship, I am. Ergo, you have no say in anything that happens between me and Stephanie."
Sheldon,"Iêm afraid I canêt allow that. Pursuant to Starfleet General Order 104 Section A, you are deemed unfit and I hereby relieve you of your command."
Leonard,"General Order 104, Section A does not apply in this situation."
Sheldon,Give me one good reason why not.
Leonard,Because this is not Star Trek
Sheldon,This is banana bread.
Penny,This is a door knob.
Sheldon,Itês my understanding that an unsolicited gift of food can be a precursor to an impromptu invitation to come in and chat.
Penny,"Sheldon, would you like to come in?"
Sheldon,I suppose I could spare a few minutes. Were you robbed?
Sheldon,How can you be sure?
Penny,"Sheldon, what do you want?"
Sheldon,"Iêm certain this will come as no surprise to you, but Leonard is failing in yet another relationship."
Penny,Heês having problems with Stephanie?
Sheldon,"Sheês sending virtual livestock to random men on the internet. If I have any hope of keeping them together, I need data. Specifically, I need to know exactly what Leonard did that caused you to pop an emotional cap in his buttocks."
Sheldon,"Again, urban slang. In which, I believe Iêm gaining remarkable fluency. So, what is the down and the low? And donêt worry, this is all entirely confidential, so, you feel free to include any and all shortcomings in the bedroom."
Penny,We never got to the bedroom.
Penny,"Oh, okay, all right, you know what? Iêll tell you what happened. We were young, we were very much in love, but we could only communicate through a time-traveling mailbox at my lake house."
Sheldon,"Itês not enough that you made me watch that movie, but now you mock me with it?"
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I have a question about dating and relationships."
Raj,You told me you were going to have the talk with him.
Howard,Iêve been waiting for someone to have the talk with me.
Sheldon,"More to the point, itês about finding a way to keep Leonard and Stephanie together."
Howard,"Oh, I donêt think you can."
Sheldon,"Well, why not?"
Howard,Look at Leonardês record. 27 days with Joyce Kim.
Raj,During which she defected to North Korea.
Howard,Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.
Raj,For which she awarded him the nickname _speed of light Leonard.î
Howard,And a three hour dinner with Penny.
Raj,Which would have been two and a half if they ordered the souffle when they sat down.
Howard,"Based on the geometric progression, his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes."
Sheldon,"Yes, Iêm aware of the math, Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth, the issue remains, how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection?"
Raj,"Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie, your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet."
Howard,"Iêll tell you what you shouldnêt do. Donêt spritz him with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it, that doesnêt work at all, no matter how much you put on."
Sheldon,"So, thatês all youêve got? Apocalyptic genocide and go easy on the cologne?"
Sheldon,Penny. Zucchini bread.
Penny,"Oh, thank you."
Sheldon,May I come in?
Sheldon,I see. Apparently my earlier inquiry regarding you and Leonard crossed some sort of line. I apologize.
Penny,"Well, thank you."
Sheldon,"So, have you and I returned to a social equilibrium?"
Sheldon,Great. New topic. Where are you in your menstrual cycle?
Sheldon,"Iêve been doing some research online, and apparently female primates, you know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you, they find their mate more desirable when heês being courted by another female. Now, this effect is intensified when the rival female is secreting the pheromones associated with ovulation. Which brings me back to my question, where are you in . Clearly, Iêm 14 days too early."
Leonard,"All Iêm saying is if they can cure yellow fever and malaria, why canêt they do something about lactose intolerance?"
Sheldon,"Oh, hi Stephanie."
Leonard,Want some more wine?
Leonard,What are you doing?
Sheldon,I have a craving for white asparagus that apparently is destined to go unsatisfied.
Leonard,Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you?
Sheldon,Iêm helping you with Stephanie.
Leonard,By making constipated moose sounds?
Sheldon,"When I fail to open this jar and you succeed it will establish you as the alpha male. You see, when a female witnesses an exhibition of physical domination she produces the hormone oxytocin. If the two of you then engage in intercourse this will create the biochemical reaction in the brain which lay people naively interpret as falling in love."
Leonard,Huh? Would it work if I just punched you in the face?
Sheldon,"Yes, actually it would, but letês see how the lid goes. Iêm not strong enough, Leonard, youêll have to do it."
Leonard,"Oh, for godês sakes."
Sheldon,"Go ahead, itês pre-loosened."
Leonard,"No, no, no, I got it."
Sheldon,"No, yeah, yeah, heês got it, and thatês not surprising. This is something I long ago came to peace with in my role as the beta male. Open it. "
Leonard,"No, Iêm not. Iêm bleeding."
Sheldon,Like a gladiator!
Leonard,Stitches? With a needle?
Leonard,"Oh, okay, yeah, hang on a sec. "
Sheldon,"FYI, I was defrosting a steak in there."
Sheldon,"What a beautiful job Stephanie did. I might have gone with a mattress suture instead of a blanket stitch, but you canêt argue with her results. Itês a shame it wonêt scar, the war wound is a time-honoured badge of masculinity."
Leonard,I canêt remember a time when you werenêt talking.
Sheldon,"Just for the record, my efforts to establish you as the alpha male were not aided by you bursting into tears."
Leonard,"I did not burst into tears, my eyes just got a little watery."
Leonard,She stuck a needle into my hand!
Leonard,I didnêt cry.
Leonard,"Oh, are you still going to spend the night?"
Sheldon,"Sheês right, as long as youêre vomiting, coitus is contra-indicated."
Leonard,"Thank you, Dr. Cooper."
Sheldon,"Youêre welcome, Dr. Hofstadter."
Sheldon,"Well, you seem like a perfectly pleasant person. I just canêt understand why women have such a hard time loving you."
Leonard,"Hey, can you open this for me?"
Raj,Can I see your stitches?
Leonard,Sure. .
Raj,Answering the question once and for all why Wolowitz bailed out of medical school.
Penny,"Leonard, congratulations."
Leonard,What for?
Penny,Your facebook status update. Leonard Hofstadter is in a relationship.
Leonard,"no. no, thatês not right."
Howard,"Oh, man, did you switch your status before she did? Speaking as an expert, way to look needy."
Penny,"Seriously? You went first, after only two weeks? Thatês bold."
Leonard,"Itês not bold, itês a mistake. I didnêt change my status."
Penny,"Well, then who did?"
Sheldon,"I had no choice, he cried in front of her."
Leonard,You hacked my facebook account?
Sheldon,"Oh, itês hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything, Kal-el."
Leonard,Are you insane? Now sheês going to think Iêm desperate. Youêve destroyed this relationship! And you want to know what the worst part is? You donêt even understand what you did wrong because you canêt conceive of something that you are not an expert in!
Sheldon,In which I am not an expert.
Leonard,Donêt even! I donêt want to hear another word out of you.
Howard,Stephanie Barnett is in a relationship with Leonard Hofstadter.î
Leonard,"Really? Oh, look at that, I have a girlfriend."
Sheldon,"If I am permitted to speak again, Dr. Sheldon Cooper for the win."
Sheldon,"Well, youêre the doctor, but I am constantly hearing this annoying sound."
Leonard,"Me, too."
Sheldon,Is it a high-frequency whistle?
Leonard,"No, itês more of a relentless, narcissistic drone."
Sheldon,Then it must be a tumour.
Leonard,Maybe itês a lingering bacterial infection from all those childhood toilet swirlies.
Sheldon,Is that possible? I used to get those all the time. Even in church.
Leonard,"Okay, Iêll be right in."
Sheldon,"Itês not enough that she mocks me, but that isnêt even the correct procedure for a cootie shot."
Leonard,Do you understand that Stephanieês not here to treat your imaginary ailments?
Sheldon,How is it imaginary that I keep hearing an octave above Middle C? Is that imaginary? I donêt think so.
Leonard,Good night.
Sheldon,"Leonard, thereês one more thing. Under Article One, Section Three of our Roommate Agreement, Iêm calling an emergency meeting."
Leonard,"No, youêre not."
Sheldon,"Leonard moves the meeting not occur. Is there a second? None heard, the motion fails. Iêd like to begin the meeting by congratulating you on the progress in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie."
Leonard,Thank you.
Sheldon,"That being said, we have to discuss the implementation of the agreed upon _cohabitationî rider which has been activated now that the two of you are living together."
Leonard,Weêre not living together.
Sheldon,"I beg to disagree. _A girlfriend shall be deemed quote living with un-quote Leonard when she has stayed over for A, ten consecutive nights or B, more than nine nights in three week period or C: all the weekends of a given month plus three weeknights."
Leonard,Thatês absurd.
Sheldon,"You initialed it. See? L.H., L.H., L.H."
Leonard,"Wait, I only initialed it because I never thought it would happen! I initialed another clause naming you my sidekick in case I get superpowers."
Sheldon,"Hmm, yes, you did. Now, to review the following provisions are hereby activated. In the refrigerator, as opposed to us having two separate shelves and one communal shelf, the three of us now get individual shelves and the door becomes communal. Next, apartment vacuuming shall be increased from two to three times a week to accommodate the increased accumulation of dead skin cells. Third,the bathroom schedule. Now, Iêm given to understand women have different needs, so, weêll have to discuss that."
Leonard,Iêm going to bed.
Sheldon,"At least take this with you. Look, and have Stephanie initial here, here, here, here and here. This states that she does not now nor does she intend to play a percussive or brass instrument. Sure it sounds like a tumor pressing on the auditory nerve."
Leonard,"No, absolutely not."
Sheldon,Itês not a big deal. We have latex gloves.
Leonard,"I donêt care what the symptoms are, my girlfriend is not going to give you a prostate exam."
Sheldon,"Good morning, Dr. Stephanie. I trust Leonard satisfied you sexually last night."
Leonard,"Oh come on! Sheldon, we donêt ask questions like that."
Sheldon,I heard you ask it over and over. How is it inappropriate for me to ask it once?
Sheldon,See? Sheês not offended. And now you finally have an answer.
Penny,Out of coffee. Need coffee.
Penny,"Hi! Stephanie, right?"
Penny,"Iêm Penny, I live across the hall. Iêve heard a lot about you."
Leonard,"Sheês heard about you because weêre, you know, involved and you havenêt heard about her becauseÑ I never slept with her, I swear!"
Sheldon,"In Leonardês defence, it wasnêt for lack of trying."
Leonard,"Thank you, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Youêre welcome, Leonard."
Leonard,"Look, Iêm just saying, um, Penny is one of our many neighbours, you know, and in our building, neighbours come and go, itês very casual, no dress code. In fact, some mornings Iêll just mosey down to the third floor in my pyjamas and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian."
Sheldon,Really? I have never once been invited to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
Leonard,"She doesnêt like you. Um, well, uh, you have a gall bladder to remove and I have to get in the shower and Penny has clothes to put on, soÑ"
Penny,"Nice to finally meet you, too."
Leonard,"Okay, bye-bye."
Sheldon,What could I possibly have done to offend Mrs. Vartabedian?
Penny,"So, thatês Stephanie, huh?"
Leonard,Why do I feel like Iêm the one that just got the prostate exam?
Penny,"You know, she seems very nice."
Sheldon,"Oh, she is. Sheês terrific, and sheês proving to be a valuable roommate."
Penny,Roommate? You guys are living together?
Sheldon,Like hippies.
Leonard,Weêre not living together.
Sheldon,Do I have to pull out the paperwork again?
Leonard,Weêre not living together.
Penny,Are you sure?
Leonard,How could I not be sure?
Penny,"Well, letês find out."
Leonard,Donêt you think if a woman was living with me Iêd be the first one to know about it?
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, youêd be the last one to know about it.  Hmm, cute dresses. I bet this looks great on you!"
Leonard,Weêre not living together.
Penny,"Okay, hmm, scented candles, fuzzy slippers, ooh, floral bed sheets?"
Leonard,Weêre not living together.
Penny,"Okay, moving on. Now, who are these guys at Disney World?"
Leonard,"Uh, the big dog is Goofy, and the older couple with the mouse ears , I have no idea. Weêre not living together!"
Penny,"Youêre going to go down swinging, huh? All right, well, we got your body lotion, your InStyle Magazine, your jewellery box."
Leonard,Weêre notÑ Whereês my Bat Signal?
Penny,You have a Bat Signal?
Leonard,"I did. It was right here. She mustêveÑ Oh, my God, weêre living together."
Penny,Really? What was your first clue?
Howard,New pants?
Leonard,"Yeah, Stephanie got them for me."
Howard,Nice. Cotton?
Leonard,"Actually, I think itês more of wool, fire ant blend."
Howard,"So, the girlfriendês buying clothes for you, huh? Sounds serious."
Leonard,"It is actually. In fact, I gave it a lot of thought and I decided it was time for us to live together."
Howard,"Uh, Leonard, huge mistake. Thereês a whole buffet of women out there and youêre just standing in the corner eating the same devilled egg over and over again."
Leonard,At least I have an egg. What do you have?
Howard,A veritable smorgasbord of potential sexual partners. See the blonde over there? I can hit on her and you canêt.
Leonard,"So, go hit on her."
Howard,Sheês not my type.
Raj,"Too bad, êcause she was checking you out before."
Howard,She was?
Raj,Of course not. Look at her.
Leonard,"I donêt care what you guys think, Stephanie and I are very happy living together. I will give either of you 20 dollars, right now to trade pants with me."
Sheldon,Hang on. 130 over 80. A little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk.
Sheldon,"My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday. She thought if I failed at theoretical physics that I should have a trade to fall back on. And by the way, the blood pressure cuff is called a sphygmomanometer."
Sheldon,Didnêt they teach you that in medical school?
Sheldon,I understand. All I need is for you to authorize these tests.
Sheldon,"Oh, and an exploratory laparoscopy. Last time I had hiccups, it felt like my diaphragm was just going through the motions."
Sheldon,Can I at least have the upper GI? I already drank the barium!
Penny,Oh hey.
Leonard,"Oh, good. Do you have any fabric softener?"
Penny,"Yeah, sure. What are you washing? A crocodile?"
Leonard,"No, the pants that Stephanie got me."
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, you canêt machine wash these. Theyêll be ruined."
Leonard,Are you sure?
Leonard,"Oh, no. I wish youêd told me that sooner."
Penny,Are you guys having problems?
Leonard,"No, everythingês fine."
Leonard,"Yeah. Itês wonderful. Okay, maybe this whole living together happened kind of suddenly, but itês fine, itês great."
Penny,"Okay, Leonard, honey, you know, if youêre uncomfortable with the way things are going, youêre allowed to say something."
Leonard,Are you sure? That doesnêt sound right.
Penny,"Believe me, your feelings are just as important as hers."
Leonard,No that doesnêt sound right either.
Penny,Just tell her you need the relationship to move at a pace that you both are comfortable with.
Leonard,"Yeah, I could say something like that to her. Iêll go do that. Thank you."
Leonard,You have a really good grasp on this. Maybe you could talk to her?
Penny,"Youêre kidding, right?"
Leonard,"No, but thatês okay. Iêll go talk to her. Want to come with?"
Penny,Go! Wow.
Sheldon,I knew it! What do I do?
Sheldon,For howÑ
Leonard,Sheldon.  Whatês going on?
Leonard,"Careful, if you donêt get it all, itêll only come back worse."
Leonard,"Listen, we need to talk."
Leonard,I donêt know what that means.
Leonard,"Okay, um, well, look, itês just that things between you and me have been going pretty quick."
Leonard,Itês just a little scary.
Leonard,"Sure, when is scary not good? But, okay, um, I have feelings, right?"
Leonard,"Okay, and itês perfectly okay to express those feelings, right?"
Leonard,"Okay, well, I juÑ I think itês important to remember that we move at a pace that is our speed andÑ oh, shoot, I had it!"
Leonard,Whatês that? Really? Right now?
Leonard,"I just ate, arenêt you supposed to wait an hour?"
Leonard,"Oh, okay. I just hope I donêt get cramps."
Penny,"Hey. Oh, I put your clothes in the dryer."
Leonard,Thank you.
Penny,Your pants are ruined.
Penny,"So, how did the talk with Stephanie go?"
Leonard,"Well, um, on one level, really, really well."
Penny,"So, you told her you wanted to slow things down?"
Leonard,"Not specifically, but, uh, I did tell her that I had feelings."
Penny,"Good, good. And then what?"
Leonard,"And then the, the subject got changed somehow."
Penny,"You had sex, didnêt you?"
Leonard,"Um, little bit.  What?"
Penny,"Nothing. Okay, well, it sounds like things are going to work out."
Leonard,"Yeah, yeah itês all good. Everythingês going to work out. One way or another."
Penny,"Come on, Leonard, you are entitled to try and make things go the way you want them to."
Penny,"Yes, you donêt always have to go along with what the woman wants."
Leonard,"Nothing, just rethinking my whole life. Okay, hereês the thing, Iêm afraid that if I ask her to move out, sheêll just dump me."
Penny,"Well, itês a chance you have to take. I mean, look, if itês meant to be, itêll be."
Leonard,"Very comforting. Okay, so what do I say to her?"
Penny,"I donêt know. I mean, what have women said to you when they wanted to slow a relationship down?"
Leonard,"I really like you, but I want to see how things go with Mark?"
Penny,"Yeah, thatêll slow it down."
Leonard,"Oh, right, yeah, um, so, Stephanie, hereês the thing. I really like you."
Leonard,What speech?
Leonard,"No! No, no! I wasnêt going to say any of that. I was just going to say, I really like you."
Howard,Hey. Nice sweater.
Leonard,"Yeah, Stephanie got it for me. Itês kind of fun."
Raj,"Itês got a big bird on it, dude."
Leonard,"Yeah, yeah, thatês the fun part. Weêre also getting new curtains for my bedroom, and a dust ruffle, and a duvet, and I donêt even know what a duvet is but Iêm pretty sure if I did I wouldnêt want one, but every time I talk to her about moving out she cries and we have sex."
Raj,"Youêre lucky. With me, itês usually the other way around."
Howard,"You know, if you canêt talk to her, why donêt you just text her?"
Leonard,Isnêt that kind of cowardly?
Howard,"Oh, yeah. Itês beyond contemptible."
Raj,"Itês true, but on the other hand you are wearing a bird sweater."
Leonard,Sold. _I think it would be better for our relationship if you moved back to your place.î There. Itês done.
Howard,Good for you.
Leonard,"Yeah, good for me. Iêll never have sex again.  I was wrong. See ya."
Penny,"Okay, let me check."
Sheldon,"Your argument is lacking in all scientific merit. It is well established Superman cleans his uniform by flying into Earthês yellow sun, which incinerates any contaminate matter and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian fabric unharmed and daisy fresh."
Howard,What if he gets something Kryptonian on it?
Sheldon,Like what?
Howard,I donêt know. Kryptonian mustard.
Sheldon,I think we can safely assume that all Kryptonian condiments were destroyed when the planet Krypton exploded.
Raj,"Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite, the only way to destroy a rogue Kryptonian hotdog threatening Earth."
Leonard,"Raj, please, letês stay serious here. Supermanês body is Kryptonian, therefore his sweat is Kryptonian."
Howard,"Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?"
Sheldon,Superman doesnêt sweat on Earth.
Howard,"Okay, heês invited for dinner in the Bottle City of Kandor. He miniaturizes himself, enters the city where he loses his superpowers. Now, before dinner, his host says, _whoês up for a little Kryptonian tetherball?î Superman says _sure,î works up a sweat, comes back to Earth, his uniform now stained with indestructible Kryptonian perspiration."
Sheldon,Superman would have taken his uniform to a Kandorian dry cleaner before he left the Bottle.
Raj,"_Kandorian dry clÑî I give up, you canêt have a rational argument with this man."
Howard,"Hey, isnêt that the guy who won the MacArthur genius grant last year? No, not all at once."
Raj,Then how?
Howard,"Leonard. Now, Raj. Now, Sheldon."
Raj,I didnêt get a good look. Can I go again?
Leonard,Itês David Underhill. So what?
Sheldon,So what? His observation of high-energy positrons has provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of galactic dark matter.
Leonard,"I have two words for you. The first is big, the otherês whoop."
Sheldon,It is a big whoop. It made almost all the work youêve done since youêve been here completely useless.
Leonard,Did not.
Howard,"Did, too."
Leonard,"DidÑ okay, maybe  some of it, but, look, the guy was just in the right place, at the right time with the right paradigm-shifting reinterpretation of the universe. He got lucky."
Raj,In more ways than one. Heês a very handsome man.
Howard,"Doesnêt do anything for me. If I was gonna go that way, Iêm more of a Zac Ephron kinda guy."
Raj,"Oh, yeah, like you have a shot with Zac Ephron."
Leonard,"Uh, yeah."
Leonard,"Uh, y-yeah."
Leonard,You want to work with me?
Leonard,"Wow, y-yeah, sure. Yeah, no problem. Uh, Hereês my home number, hereês my cell, hereês my office, hereês my parentsê number up in New Jersey, they always know how to reach me. SoÑ"
Leonard,"Congratulations on the MacArthur Grant, by the way. Big fan."
Leonard,Okay. Bye-bye! What are you looking at?Youêve never seen a hypocrite before?
Raj,"Trailing badly, Wolowitz needs a strike if he has any hopes of catching up with Sheldon Cooper, who is dominating in the ninth frame with a career-best 68."
Leonard,"Hey, guys!"
Howard,That doesnêt count. Do over! Do over!
Sheldon,There are no do-overs in Wii bowling.
Howard,There are always do-overs when my people play sports.
Sheldon,Where were you thatês more important than Wii bowling night?
Leonard,"Actually, I wasÑ"
Sheldon,Itês a rhetorical question. There is nothing more important than Wii bowling night.
Leonard,"Come on, itês just a video game. And we suck at it."
Sheldon,Nice motivational speech from the team captain.
Howard,Where were you?
Leonard,I was working with Dave Underhill.
Howard,"Ooh, _Dave.î Sounds like Leonardês got a new BFF."
Leonard,"Actually, heês pretty cool. I mean, not only is he a brilliant scientist, but it turns out heês a Black Diamond skier, he collects vintage motorcycles, he plays in a rock band."
Howard,So? Weêre in a rock band.
Leonard,"No, we play Rock Band on our X-Box."
Sheldon,Nice motivational speech from our lead guitarist.
Leonard,"Heês funny, too. He does this hysterical impersonation of Stephen Hawking having phone sex. What are you wearing? Thatês not, he does it better. Anyway, he said he was gonna take me to the gym tomorrow, so Iêm gonna go practice my situps."
Raj,"Whoa. Humongous man crush, dude."
Howard,Yep. Itês officially a bro-mance.
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon, are you and Leonard putting up a Christmas tree?"
Sheldon,"No, because we donêt celebrate the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia."
Howard,"Gather round, kids, itês time for Sheldonês beloved Christmas special."
Sheldon,"In the pre-Christian era, as the winter solstice approached and the plants died, pagans brought evergreen boughs into their homes as an act of sympathetic magic, intended to guard the life essences of the plants until spring. This custom was later appropriated by Northern Europeans and eventually it becomes the so-called Christmas tree."
Howard,"And that, Charlie Brown, is what boredom is all about."
Penny,"Okay, well, thank you for that, but I got you and Leonard a few silly neighbour gifts, so Iêll just put them under my tree."
Sheldon,Wait! You bought me a present?
Sheldon,Why would you do such a thing?
Penny,I donêt know. ‚Cause itês Christmas?
Sheldon,"Oh, Penny. I know you think youêre being generous, but the foundation of gift-giving is reciprocity. You havenêt given me a gift, youêve given me an obligation."
Howard,"Donêt feel bad, Penny, itês a classic rookie mistake. My first Hanukkah with Sheldon, he yelled at me for eight nights."
Penny,"Now, honey, itês okay.You donêt have to get me anything in return."
Sheldon,Of course I do. The essence of the custom is that I now have to go out and purchase for you a gift of commensurate value and representing the same perceived level of friendship as that represented by the gift youêve given me. Itês no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year.
Penny,"Okay, you know what? Forget it. Iêm not giving you a present."
Sheldon,"No, itês too late. I see it. That elf sticker says to Sheldon. The die has been cast, the moving finger has writ, Hannibal has crossed the Alps."
Howard,I know. Itês funny when itês not happening to us.
Penny,"Sheldon, I am very, very sorry."
Sheldon,"No, I brought this on myself by being such an endearing and important part of your life. Iêm going to need a ride to the mall."
Howard,Itês happening to us.
Leonard,Ow! Ow!
Leonard,"Yeah, I guess."
Leonard,Thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle.
Leonard,"I had no idea it was so heavy. The thing just fell right over on me, didnêt it?"
Penny,"Oh, hey, Leonard. Ooh, are you okay?"
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. Itês just a little motorcycle accident."
Penny,"My God, how fast were you going?"
Leonard,I donêt know. Itês all such a blur.
Penny,Hi. Penny. So itês your motorcycle?
Penny,"Oh, is it okay?"
Leonard,"Yeah, lucky for the bike it landed on my leg."
Penny,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. So, um, Dave, how do you know Leonard?"
Penny,"Ha-ha. No, youêre not."
Penny,"Uh, well, itês just that the physicists I know are indoorsy and pale."
Leonard,Iêm not indoorsy. I just wear the appropriate sun block because I donêt take melanoma lightly.
Penny,"So, are you and Leonard working on an experiment together?"
Leonard,"Yeah, weêre examining the radiation levels of photomultiplier tubes for a new dark matter detector."
Penny,"Uh, sweetie, sweetie, Dave was talking. You know, I love science."
Leonard,Since when?
Penny,"Since always. Call me a geek, but I am just nuts for the whole subatomic particle thing."
Penny,"Ha. Well, thatês what I am, queen of the nerds."
Penny,"You know, I have always wanted to see a big science lab."
Leonard,Since when?
Penny,Since always.
Leonard,"Uh, yeah. I guess."
Penny,"Um,yeah, yeah, that sounds great, let me just get my jacket."
Leonard,"Yeah, if you like that type."
Leonard,"No, just neighbours."
Leonard,"Actually, science is my lady."
Penny,Okay. Letês go.
Leonard,"See ya. ‚Bye, Penny. Have fun. "
Sheldon,Yes?  Did you forget your key?
Sheldon,I donêt see anything in here a woman would want.
Howard,"Youêre kidding. Youêve got lotions and bath oils and soaps, thatês the estrogen hat trick."
Leonard,"What it is is a cacophonous assault of eucalyptus, bayberry, cinnamon and vanilla. Itês as if my head were trapped in the pyjamas of a sultan."
Raj,"Sheldon, if you donêt like this stuff, letês just go next door and build her a bear."
Sheldon,"I told you before, bears are terrifying."
Howard,"Come on, bath stuff, itês perfect! You got a scented candle, a cleansing buff, spearmint and green tea scented bath oil, promotes relaxation."
Sheldon,That presupposes Penny is tense.
Raj,She knows you. Sheês tense. We all are. Buy a basket!
Howard,"Excuse me, weêre ready."
Sheldon,"No, weêre not. Letês say for a moment that I accept the bath item gift hypothesis, I now lay the following conundrum at your feet, which size?"
Howard,This one. Letês go.
Sheldon,You put no thought into that.
Howard,"Iêm sorry. Uh, this one. Letês go!"
Sheldon,"I have insufficient data to proceed. Excuse me, miss?"
Sheldon,"If I were to give you this gift basket, based on that action alone and no other data, infer and describe the hypothetical relationship that exists between us."
Sheldon,"Here. Now, are we friends? Colleagues? Lovers? Are you my grandmother?"
Howard,See? Sounds just like you and Penny. Weêll take it.
Leonard,"Oh, hey, Dave. And Penny, what a surprise."
Penny,"Hey, Leonard. Dave was just showing me around the university. You know, this place is unbelievable!"
Leonard,"Yeah, I know. Iêve been offering to show you around for a year and a half. You always said you had yoga."
Penny,I never said that.
Leonard,Maybe I heard you wrong. A lot of words sound like yoga.
Penny,"Oh, shut up!"
Leonard,"Yes, please shut up. So, um, Dave, donêt you think you and I should get back to the lab? You know, that dark matter isnêt going to detect itself."
Penny,Really? Weêre going to do an experiment?
Penny,Itês not an experiment! You saw what happened last night.
Penny,"Yeah. Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?"
Leonard,"Thatês funny. By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking."
Sheldon,"Mmm, great news, Leonard, Iêve solved my Penny gift dilemma."
Sheldon,"You see, the danger was that I might under or over-reciprocate, but I have devised a foolproof plan. See, I will open her gift to me first and then excuse myself, feigning digestive distress."
Sheldon,"It is, isnêt it? Is it okay if I hide them in your room? The smell makes me nauseated."
Leonard,Do whatever you want.
Sheldon,"Thank you, thatês very gracious.     Gentlemen."
Howard,Why couldnêt you have just done what Leonard did and get Penny a new boyfriend?
Leonard,My leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.
Leonard,"Okay, I have just one question for you. While I am perfectly happy with the way things are between us, you said that you didnêt want to go out with me because I was too smart for you! Well, news flash, lady, David Underhill is ten times smarter than me! Youêd have to drive a railroad spike into his brain for me to beat him at checkers! Next to him, Iêm like one of those sign-language gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes! So, my question is, whatês up with that?"
Penny,Why are you yelling at me?
Leonard,"Sorry, Iêm sorry, Iêm sorry! Never mind, weêre cool."
Penny,Dave is not smarter than you. Heês an idiot.
Leonard,Really? Why would you say that?
Penny,Because a smart guy takes the nude photos of his wife off his cell phone before he tries to take nude photos of his girlfriend.
Leonard,He tried to take nude photos of you?
Penny,Thatês what you took from that? The guy is married!
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. Iêm soÑ oh, thatês terrible."
Penny,"And you, if you are so okay with the way things are between us, why are you so jealous?"
Leonard,"Well, uh, the important thing is heês married and thatês terrible!"
Penny,"Nice save, genius. Eggnog?"
Penny,Itês just rum. It stopped being eggnog like half an hour ago.
Penny,Smoother than you.
Leonard,"Come on, itês Christmas, just give me this one."
Penny,"Okay, Merry Christmas."
Leonard,"By the way, my leg is killing me. Thanks for asking."
Penny,Merry Christmas.
Leonard,Merry Christmas.
Penny,Howês your leg?
Leonard,"Very good, thanks for asking. Come on in."
Sheldon,"Ah, good, Penny, youêre here to exchange gifts. Youêll be pleased to know Iêm prepared for whatever you have to offer."
Penny,"Okay, here."
Sheldon,"I should note Iêm having some digestive distress, so, if I excuse myself abruptly, donêt be alarmed. Oh, a napkin."
Penny,Turn it over.
Sheldon,"To Sheldon, live long and prosper. Leonard Nimoy."
Penny,"Yeah, he came into the restaurant. Sorry the napkinês dirty. He wiped his mouth with it."
Sheldon,I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?!
Penny,"Well, yeah, yeah, I guess. But look, he signed it."
Sheldon,Do you realize what this means? All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!
Penny,"Okay, all Iêm giving you is the napkin, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Be right back.
Penny,Here. Open it.
Leonard,"Oh, a gift certificate for motorcycle lessons. Very thoughtful."
Penny,"Yeah, and I checked. Not letting the bike fall on you while standing still is lesson one."
Leonard,"Oh, then, I think youêll appreciate what I got you."
Penny,Okay. 101 Totally Cool Science Experiments for Kids.
Leonard,"You know, êcause youêre so into science."
Penny,Sheldon! What did you do?!
Sheldon,"I know! Itês not enough, is it? Here."
Penny,"Leonard, look! Sheldonês hugging me."
Leonard,Itês a Saturnalia miracle.
Howard,"All right, thatês the last servo. Behold the Mobile Omnidirectional Neutralization and Termination Eradicator. OrÑ"
Howard,"Featuring one articulated razor-sharp killing saw, one polycarbonate grinding and flipping wheel, steel armour plate exoskeleton top and bottom, and enough horsepower to drive a 110 pounds of mechanized death from zero to holy crap in 4.8 seconds."
Sheldon,Is it wrong to say I love our killer robot?
Raj,"As with my father, I both love and fear it."
Howard,"All right, enough chitchat, letês destroy something."
Raj,Okay. What shall be first to taste the wrath of Monte?
Leonard,Maybe we should start small.
Raj,"Okay. Ooh, perhaps today is the day we finally find out whatês inside the Magic Eight Ball."
Sheldon,Did it when I was four. Itês an icosahedral dye floating in tinted blue water.
Raj,"Man, call spoiler alert before you say things like that."
Leonard,How about the toaster oven?
Sheldon,What did the toaster oven ever do to you?
Leonard,"What did I ever do to Jimmy Mullins in the third grade? He still punched me in the face with my own fists. Sorry, you little nerd, you were just in the wrong boysê room at the wrong time."
Howard,"Gentlemen, goggles."
Sheldon,"Yeah, this is an auspicious moment. Yeah, like Robert Oppenheimer or Neil Armstrong, we need the appropriate words to mark this historic scientific event."
Raj,"How about _Die, toaster, dieî?"
Leonard,Thatêll do it.
Raj,"All right, whatês next?"
Penny,"No, I think Iêm just going to stay in tonight and do laundry. "
Howard,"Oh yeah, they still got the full Monte."
Penny,What the hell?
Leonard,Killer robot. We built it.
Penny,"Yeah, well, it almost killed me."
Sheldon,"If it wanted to kill you, youêd be dead."
Penny,"So, who exactly does it want to kill?"
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, are you unaware of the upcoming Southern California Robot Fighting League Round Robin Invitational?"
Penny,"You know, since I moved last year, not all my mail has been forwarded."
Howard,Itês a big deal. Thereês an awards banquet and a dance afterward. Perhaps youêd like to come with me. I know the other fellas would be really excited to see a girl there.
Penny,How is it supposed to be a dance if Iêm the only girl?
Howard,"Well, that may be a slight exaggeration. Youêd be the only doable girl."
Penny,"Youêre a pig, Howard."
Howard,How is doable anything but a compliment?
Leonard,"Howard, why donêt we just work on the robot?"
Howard,"Please, Leonard, not now. Once again, Penny and I have begun our little tango."
Penny,Our tango?
Howard,"The carnal repartee, the erotic to and fro. But as delicious as the appetizer might be, at some point we will have to succumb and eat the entree while itês stillÑ hot."
Leonard,"Iêm begging you, stop talking."
Penny,"Look, normally I can just ignore you. I mean, I get it, youêre a little peculiar. You know, like Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Yeah, excuse me, Penny, but in this room, youêre the one whoês peculiar."
Penny,"Yeah, you might be right. But back to you. I know you think youêre some sort of smooth-talking ladiesê man, but the truth is, you are just pathetic and creepy."
Howard,"Um, so what are you saying?"
Penny,"I am saying it is not a compliment to call me doable. Itês not sexy to stare at my ass and say, _Ooh, it must be jelly êcause jam donêt shake like that.î And most important, we are not dancing a tango, weêre not toêing and froêing. Nothing is ever going to happen between us. Ever."
Howard,"Wait a minute. This isnêt flirting, youêre serious."
Penny,"Flirting? You think Iêm flirting with you? I am not flirting with you, no woman is ever gonna flirt with you, youêre just gonna grow old and die alone."
Howard,Thanks for the heads up.
Leonard,"Howard, where you going?"
Howard,"Iêm going home to live my creepy, pathetic life."
Penny,"Well, someone had to say it.  What?"
Leonard,He said maybe we should enter you in the killer robot competition.
Howard,"Hereês a crazy idea, Ma, answer it!"
Howard,"I donêt go to school, Ma. I work at a university."
Howard,I donêt want to talk to anybody.
Howard,I donêt have homework. Iêm a grown man with a masterês degree in engineering!
Howard,"Cherry, please!"
Howard,You make me want to kill myself.
Raj,Whatês going on?
Leonard,"I donêt know, now theyêre just yelling about Popsicles. Sounds like Penny really got to him."
Raj,"Iêm not surprised. Despite his hard and crusty shell, Howard is a very sensitive man. Do you know he writes poetry? Mostly about men from Nantucket and hermits named Dave, but he does it with real sensitivity."
Leonard,"Yes, we did, Kripke."
Sheldon,His name is Monte.
Leonard,"Come on, is that really necessary?"
Sheldon,"Leonard, I believe it is. This is trash talk, and trash talk is a traditional component in all sporting events. Kripke, your robot is inferior and it will be defeated by ours because ours exceeds yours in both design and execution. Also, Iêm given to understand that your mother is overweight."
Raj,"Oh, snap."
Sheldon,"Now, of course, if that is the result of a glandular condition and not sloth and gluttony, I withdraw that comment."
Raj,What difference does it make? Fat is fat.
Sheldon,There are boundaries.
Sheldon,What do you mean?
Sheldon,We accept your challenge. Name a time and place.
Sheldon,Make it so.
Leonard,"No, donêt make it so. Barry, we canêt fight you tomorrow, our engineer is incapacitated."
Raj,Heês depressed because heês pathetic and creepy and he canêt get girls.
Raj,"Iêm curious, what part of America is that accent from?"
Leonard,"Hey, you got a minute?"
Penny,"Yeah, come on in. Whatês up?"
Leonard,I need you to apologize to HowÑ
Penny,Get out.
Leonard,Come on. Wolowitz wonêt come out of his house and we need him for a robot battle.
Penny,"Well, then have the robot go and get him."
Leonard,The robot didnêt hurt his feelings.
Penny,His feelings needed to be hurt.
Leonard,Heês been in bed for two days.
Penny,"Yeah, probably with a blow-up doll."
Leonard,Heês not with aÑ does it really matter who or what heês with? The guy is devastated.
Penny,"Oh, please, how could I possibly devastate Howard?"
Leonard,"Okay, donêt take this as a criticism, but you kind of have that overexposed-to-gamma-rays thing going on."
Penny,What does that mean?
Leonard,"You know, like, most of the time, youêre the easygoing Bruce Banner, but then, when you get angry, you kind of turn into, like, you know, grrrrr!"
Penny,I turn into a bear?
Leonard,"Seriously? Gamma rays? Bruce Banner? You didnêt get The Incredible Hulk from that? Never mind, just, please go talk to him."
Penny,"And say what? That I didnêt mean it, because I meant it."
Leonard,"Well, maybe you can go at it from a different angle, like, um, you see a glimmer of goodness in him and you only said what you said because you want to nurture it and make it shine."
Penny,"Oh, pthththth."
Leonard,"Okay, letês try it this way. Remember the day that we first met and you asked me to go to your boyfriendês apartment to get your TV back and he was nine feet tall and he took my pants off and you saidÑ what was that? What did you say? Oh, yes, you said you owed me one."
Penny,"Okay, come on, thatês not fair."
Leonard,I came home with no pants.
Penny,"Fine, Iêll go over there tomorrow."
Leonard,Thank you. I should probably give you a heads up about his mother.
Penny,What about her?
Leonard,Sheês a delightful woman. Youêll love her.
Howard,I donêt want to talk to her.
Penny,"So, I just came by to see how you were doing."
Howard,Iêm fine.
Penny,Good. Your mom seems nice.
Howard,People move away from her on the bus. What do you want?
Penny,"Okay, look. Howard, I just want to apologize for some things that I have said. About you. Iêve been informed that you have feelings. And apparently, I have hurt them. So, Iêm sorry. Howard."
Howard,"Fine, youêre sorry. Good-bye."
Penny,"So, youêre okay?"
Howard,"Hey, Iêm a big boy. Iêm not traumatized by some random comment from some random woman. I mean, get over yourself."
Penny,"Okay. Well, bye. "
Leonard,"Oh, my God. Thatês Kripkeês robot?"
Raj,I canêt watch anymore.
Leonard,"Sheldon, we have to call it off."
Sheldon,"We donêt have that option, weêve accepted the challenge. We canêt run away from a fight."
Leonard,"Oh, please, weêve spent our whole lives running away from fights. Personally, I can squeeze through a hole in a fence half my size."
Sheldon,"Impressive as that may be, Monte is not us. Monte has no fear."
Raj,"Sheldon, did we all not just watch the same video? Kripkeês robot just had angry sex with a mid-sized automobile."
Sheldon,You are overlooking the fact that we now know what weêre up against and we can modify Monte so that heês prepared.
Leonard,You want to prepare him? Install a bladder and a pair of shorts so he can wet himself.
Raj,"Excuse me, but how are we going to make any modifications without Wolowitz? Have you heard from Penny yet?"
Leonard,Not yet.
Sheldon,"Have faith, gentlemen. We donêt need Wolowitz, engineering is merely the slow younger brother of physics. Watch and learn. Do either of you know how to open the toolbox?"
Howard,"And then, when I was 14, I met Marcy Grossman. She was so beautiful. She just got her braces off but they left a little of the overbite. It was so hot, like a sexy little chipmunk. I didnêt have the courage to ask her out, but I dedicated a song to her at the ninth grade talent show."
Penny,"Aw, that sounds sweet."
Howard,"Marcy Grossman is sunshine, on a cloudy day, when itês cold outside, Marcy Grossman is the month of MayÑ"
Penny,"Oh, itês cute."
Howard,"I guess youêd say, what can make me feel this way, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman, Talkinê êbout MarcyÑ"
Penny,Thatês great.
Penny,"Oh, itês fun."
Howard,And then she came up with that sexy little chipmunk mouth and spit in my hair. Which brings us to tenth grade.
Penny,"Howard, do you think maybe sometimes you try too hard?"
Howard,Look at me. What chance do I have if I donêt try too hard?
Penny,"Well, youêd have a terrific chance. I mean, youêre smart, youêre funny, you have a cool job. You build stuff that goes into outer space."
Howard,I guess.
Penny,"Look, Iêm telling you, Iêve known you for, like, a year and a half and this is the first time I feel like Iêm talking to a real person. And you know what? I like him, heês a nice guy."
Howard,You really think so?
Howard,I donêt know.
Penny,I do. 
Leonard,Nice little bot youêve got here.
Leonard,"Whatês this do, spin?"
Leonard,"Neat. Good work. Sheldon, weêve got to call this off."
Sheldon,"No, Leonard. For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have made my life a series of painful noogies and humiliating wedgies and the insensitively named Indian burns. That stops now."
Raj,"But, Sheldon, we donêt have a chance. The only improvement you were able to make on the robot was to put fresh batteries in the remote."
Sheldon,"What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers from a fatal flaw, overconfidence from his robotês massive size and its overwhelming power."
Raj,"Thatês not overconfidence, thatês observation."
Sheldon,"Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey to my psychological warfare. Observe. Kripke! I would ask if your robot is prepared to meet its maker, but as you are its maker, clearly the two of you have met."
Raj,"Way to bust out the Jedi mind tricks, dude."
Leonard,"I just want to make sure that weêre all clear, standard robotic fighting league rules apply."
Sheldon,"Heês right, Leonard. The paradigm is to the death."
Sheldon,Never. Iêd rather see Monte dead than in your hands.
Sheldon,Do it.
Raj,"Come on, Sheldon, you got this."
Sheldon,Indeed. We are prepared for anything he can throw at us.  Thatês new.
Leonard,"Run, Monte, run!"
Raj,"Go, Monte! Go Monte!"
Leonard,"Go, go, go, go!"
Sheldon,"Donêt hurt us, donêt hurt us,"
Leonard,"Well, so much for making up for the emotional wounds of childhood."
Sheldon,"I did this. Monte was killed by my hubris and my pride. No matter what anybody says, this is my fault."
Raj,"No oneês arguing with you, dude."
Howard,I got your text. How bad isÑ Oy.
Leonard,Forget the robot. What happened to you?
Penny,He slipped and fell.
Howard,"Yes, I slipped and fell. In the bathroom. Bounced right off the tub."
Penny,"Yes, now he knows what bathtubs are capable of doing when you donêt treat them with respect."
Howard,Yeah. They sucker punch you when your eyes are closed.
Sheldon,"So what do you think, Howard? Itês not that bad, right?"
Howard,"Oh, no. A little electrical tape, some solder. Are you insane? Iêve seen space probes that crashed into the desert that were in better shape than this."
Sheldon,"Youêre right. Monteês gone. Weêll bury him in the morning. A simple ceremony. Iêll speak. Leonard, youêll play your cello."
Penny,"Sheldon, honey, arenêt you getting a little carried away? I mean, itês just a toy robot."
Sheldon,Just a toy robot?
Penny,"I know, I got it. Sheldon, Iêm sorry."
Howard,"Well, donêt get the wrong idea. The way I see it, Iêm halfway to pity sex."
Raj,"Mmm, gentlemen, I put it to you, the worst tapioca pudding is better than the best pudding of any other flavour."
Sheldon,"First off, that is axiomatically wrong, because the best pudding is chocolate. Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death. It is extracted from the plantÑ"
Howard,"Hey, Iêm thinking of growing a mustache."
Leonard,"Ah, no kidding! A Fu Man Chu? A handlebar pencil?"
Sheldon,It is extracted from the plantÑ
Howard,"Iêm not sure yet. You know, George Clooney has one now!"
Raj,Really? I once saw him shopping at Ralphês. He was buying tequila.
Howard,"Oh, youêd think a guy like that would have some kind of booze lackey."
Leonard,"Alright this is cruel, we better let him finish before his head explodes."
Howard,"Alright Sheldon, why is tapiocaÑ"
Sheldon,Tapioca is extracted from the root of the plant Manihot Esculenta. Due to a high concentration of cyanide it is poisonous in its raw form and lethal if prepared improperly.
Raj,Feel better now?
Sheldon,"It is also indigenous to Brazil, as is the Cocoa Bean, from which we get chocolate, the best pudding. And you promised you wouldnêt do that anymore!"
Leonard,Hey Kripke.
Howard,What a jerk.
Raj,"Donêt feel bad Leonard, negative results are still results."
Howard,Even twenty thousand of êem.
Leonard,"Alright, please donêt cheer me up anymore."
Howard,"Cêmon, donêt let him get to you. Itês Kripke."
Raj,"Yeah, heês a ginormous knob."
Howard,"Thatês why he eats by himself, instead of sitting here at the cool table."
Raj,Foê shizzle.
Sheldon,"Hey itês true, Kripke lacks the basic social skills that we take for granted, but he also controls the new open science grid computer that I need to use to run some simulations of structure formation in the early universe."
Leonard,Good luck getting time on it. The only people he lets use it are his friends.
Sheldon,"Well then, the solution is simple. I shall befriend him. Kripke!"
Sheldon,Whatêd you say of the idea of you and I becoming friends?
Sheldon,"Really? That seems rather short sighted, coming from someone who is generally considered altogether unlikable. Why donêt you take some time to reconsider?"
Sheldon,Well I think weêre off to a terrific start.
Leonard,There you go. Now any e-mail from Wolowitz will go right into your spam folder.
Penny,Thanks! I mean the e-mail doesnêt bother me as much as the vacation pictures of him in a bathing suit.
Leonard,"Yeah, I got the same one. And thatês not a bathing suit, itês a tan line."
Sheldon,"Hello. This is Sheldon Cooper. Iêm leaving a message for Barry Kripke. Barry, It was pleasant seeing you today in the cafeteria. I saw that you purchased the chefês salad. Apparently, you did not know that the chefês salad is kitchen trickery, to utilize scrap meat. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoyed it. Iêm following up on our pending friendship, and I look forward to hearing from you regarding its status. Sheldon Cooper."
Penny,Whatês up with Ichabod?
Leonard,Oh heês trying to make a new friend.
Penny,"Oh really? Well, good for him."
Leonard,"Well, unless heês makes one out of wood like Gepetto, I donêt think itês gonna happen."
Penny,"Well, how did you guys become friends?"
Leonard,There was a flier on the bulletin board at the university. Roommate wanted. Whistlers need not apply.
Penny,And you moved in anyway?
Leonard,I assumed he was joking. Youêd be surprised how many particle physicists have a whimsical side.
Penny,"Well, what about Howard and Raj, I mean how did you become friends with them?"
Leonard,"I donêt know, how do carbon atoms form a benzene ring? Proximity and valence electrons."
Penny,"Well yeah, sure. When you put it that way. But it all worked out, right?"
Leonard,I suppose. I do miss whistling though.
Penny,"Oh come on, really? "
Sheldon,First warning.
Penny,Hello Sheldon.
Penny,What is this?
Sheldon,"Itês a questionnaire I devised. Iêm having some difficulty bonding with a colleague at work, so Iêm doing a little research to better understand why my current friends like me."
Penny,"Yes. Well, that is a good question. But is this really the best way to figure it out?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, I agree, the social sciences are largely hokum. But, short of putting electrodes in your brain and monitoring your response to my companionship, this is the best I can do."
Penny,"Okay, question 1. Rank the following aspects of Sheldon Cooper in order of appeal. Intelligence. Ruthless attention to hygiene. Playfulness. Java applet writing?"
Sheldon,"I know, I may have started off with a fairly obvious one. You did an aspect of my most appealing trait, playfulness. Why donêt you just go ahead and write that number 1. Iêm afraid youêre on your own for the rest. It should take you no more than 3 hours."
Penny,Wait! How many questions are on this thing?
Sheldon,"Only 211. Donêt worry, in deference to you, Iêve kept them on a high school graduate reading level."
Penny,Thanks pal.
Sheldon,"You got it, buddy."
Penny,"Sheldon honey, did you ever consider making friends by being, I donêt know, pleasant?"
Sheldon,Well thatês certainly a thought-provoking hypothesis. May I suggest it as the topic for your essay.
Sheldon,"Your questionnaire, very disappointing."
Leonard,I answered every question Sheldon.
Sheldon,You answered the multiple choice questions in a pattern. A B B A C. A B B A C.
Leonard,"Aw, you picked up on that huh?"
Sheldon,How could I not?
Leonard,"Come on! Thereês over 200 questions. And look at some of these things. Sheldon is to camaraderie, as the space shuttle is to blank?"
Sheldon,"There are a number of acceptable answers, for example, C: near earth transport, but certainly not B: avocado rancher. And your essay, suggesting that Iêd have better luck making friends if I wait êtil the Cylons take over? Please."
Leonard,Hold on. I put some real work into that!
Sheldon,"Yes, well itês better than what Wolowitz did. He drew a raccoon with what appears to be, a distended scrotum."
Leonard,"Itês kinda cute, until you get to the scrotum."
Sheldon,What hope do I have for establishing new relationships given that my current friends apparently cannot take a few hours out of their lives to help me?
Leonard,"Sheldon, Iêm not going to defend a big-balled raccoon."
Sheldon,I donêt see how you could.
Leonard,"What Iêm trying to say is that, maybe you canêt approach this as a purely intellectual exercise."
Sheldon,What do you mean!?
Leonard,"Well, remember when you tried to learn how to swim using the internet?"
Sheldon,I did learn how to swim.
Leonard,On the floor.
Sheldon,The skills are transferrable. I just have no interest in going in the water.
Leonard,Then why learn how to swim?
Sheldon,"The ice caps are melting Leonard. In the future, swimming isnêt going to be optional. But you do bring up an interesting point. I donêt have to break new ground here, Iêm sure much of the research already exists."
Leonard,"No! no, my point is, if you want to learn how to make friends, then just go out to a coffee shop or a museum. Meet people. Talk to them. Take an interest in their lives."
Sheldon,Thatês insane on the face of it. Come on.
Leonard,Where are we going?
Sheldon,Youêre driving me to the mall. Iêm going to acquire a book that summarizes the current theories in the field of friendmaking.
Leonard,Why donêt you just lie down on the floor and swim there?
Sheldon,Coping with the death of a loved one. My condolences.
Sheldon,Family or friend?
Sheldon,"Too bad. If itêd been a friend, Iêm available to fill the void.  Itês just as well, she smelled like moth balls."
Leonard,"Okay, if youêre gonna start sniffing people, Iêm gonna go get a hot pretzel."
Sheldon,Excuse me. Do you have any books about making friends?
Sheldon,I assume the skills can be extrapolated and transferred.
Sheldon,Oh! I love trains!
Sheldon,"Oh my! Thatês awfully sticky. Alright, letês see. Bernie Bunny has Two Daddies Now. Itês probably about homosexual rabbits. Jerry the Gerbil and the Bullies on the Bus. Read it, not helpful. Oh! Here we go. Stu the Cockatoo is New at the Zoo. Author Sarah Carpenter lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with her husband and best friend Mark, and their cockatoos too. Hardly makes her an expert in making friends, wouldnêt you agree?"
Sheldon,Me too! Most people donêt see it. What are you reading?
Sheldon,Oh I do like monkeys!
Sheldon,"Somewhat anthropomorphized but yes. Say, maybe sometime you and I can go see monkeys together. Would you like that?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, what are you doing?"
Sheldon,Iêm making friends with this little girl. Whatês your name?
Sheldon,"Hi Rebecca, Iêm your new friend, Sheldon."
Leonard,"No youêre not, letês go."
Sheldon,We were really hitting it off.
Leonard,"Donêt look up, thereês cameras."
Raj,"Iêm curious. In the _How Well Do You Know Sheldonî section, what do you put for his favourite amino acid?"
Raj,Damn it. I had Lysine and changed it.
Sheldon,Oh good! Youêre just in time. I believe Iêve isolated the algorithm for making friends.
Leonard,"Sheldon, there is no algorithm for making friends!"
Howard,"Hear him out. If heês really on to something, we can open a booth at Comic-Con, make a fortune."
Sheldon,"See, my initial approach to Kripke, had the same deficiencies as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo, when he was new at the zoo."
Raj,Stu the cockatoo?
Leonard,"Yes, heês new at the zoo."
Sheldon,Itês a terrific book. Iêve distilled its essence into a simple flowchart that would guide me through the process.
Howard,Have you thought about putting him in a crate while youêre out of the apartment?
Sheldon,"Hello, Kripke. Yes, Sheldon Cooper here. It occurred to me you hadnêt returned any of my calls because I hadnêt offered any concrete suggestions for pursuing our friendship. Perhaps the two of us might share a meal togetherÑ I see. Well then perhaps youêd have time for a hot beverage. Popular choices include tea, coffee, cocoaÑ I see. No, no, no, wait. Donêt hang up yet. What about a recreational activity? I bet we share some common interests. Tell me an interest of yours. Really? On actual horses? Tell me another interest of yours. Oh no, Iêm sorry, I have no desire to get in the water until I absolutely have to. Tell me another interest of yours."
Leonard,"Uh-oh, heês stuck in an infinite loop."
Howard,I can fix it.
Sheldon,"Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Itês interesting. But isnêt ventriloquism, by definition, a solo activity? Yeah? Tell me another interest of yours. Hmmm. Is there any chance you like monkeys? What is wrong with you? Everybody likes monkeys. Hang on, Kripke.  A loop counter? And an escape to the least objectionable activity! Howard, thatês brilliant! Iêm surprised you saw that."
Howard,Gee. Why canêt Sheldon make friends?
Sheldon,"Alright Kripke, that last interest strikes me as the least objectionable and I would like to propose that we do that together. Tomorrow. Yes, Iêll pay. Alright, goodbye. Alright! Time to learn rock climbing."
Sheldon,"You know, I am a fan of ventriloquism. Maybe you, me and your dummy could go get a hot beverage. He could talk while you drink."
Sheldon,"This appears significantly more monolithic than it did on my laptop. No, one expects to see Hominids learning to use bones as weapeons."
Sheldon,"Hardly. Fear of heights is illogical. Fear of falling, on the other hand, is prudent and evolutionary. What would you say is the minimum altitude I need to achieve to cement our new-found friendship?"
Sheldon,"Little kid Hominids, perhaps.  Is this your entire job? Your parents must be so proud."
Sheldon,"Coming, Kripke. Okay. Harness seems to be secure. Small amount of incontinence just now, but the website said thatês to be expected. Hey, this isnêt so bad. A bit like vertical swimming."
Sheldon,I am? I was wrong. It IS a fear of heights.
Sheldon,Not really. I feel somewhat like an inverse tangent function thatês approaching an asymptote.
Sheldon,What part of an inverse tangent function approaching an asymptote did you not understand?
Sheldon,"Yeah, I donêt think I can."
Sheldon,"No, that doesnêt seem any more likely."
Sheldon,"Well, itês not exactly a plan but I think Iêm going to pass out."
Leonard,Iêm sorry. Can we please just do it one more time?
Howard,"Okay. 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 andÑ "
Leonard,Itês a little thing but you really do miss it.
Sheldon,"Hello, everyone. I brought my new friend, Barry Kripke, home for dinner."
Leonard,How was rock climbing?
Sheldon,D-d-d! Thatês where I sit.
Howard,How much time you got?
Leonard,Want some Chinese food?
Leonard,In the bathroom.
Penny,"Sheldon, are you okay?"
Sheldon,"Oh yes, I pass out all the time. But, it was worth it. Iêve made substantial progress in bonding with Kripke, which brings me to an awkward moment."
Leonard,Whatês that?
Sheldon,"Maintaining five friendships promises to be a Herculean task. So, Iêm going to have to let one of you go."
Howard,"Me, me. Let it be me."
Sheldon,"Leonard, you are my roommate, my source of transportation and you help me fold my sheets when they come out of the dryer. You are safe."
Leonard,Can I whistle?
Sheldon,"Donêt be silly. Howard, you do not have a PhD, your cologne is an assault on the senses and youêre not available for video games during the Jewish high holidays."
Howard,Guilty as charged. Iêm out.
Sheldon,"You, too, are safe."
Howard,Oh come on. What do I have to do?
Penny,Okay. You know what? I see where this is going. Iêm not one of you guys. Iêm not a scientist. So justÑ
Sheldon,"Penny, Penny, Penny. Everything youêre saying is true, but please allow me to continue. Raj, youêre out. The good question, while you do provide a certain cultural diversity to an otherwise homogenous group, your responses to the questionnaire were truly disturbing. How could you, for a moment, think that my favourite amino acid is Glutamine?"
Leonard,He had Lysine but changed it.
Sheldon,"Yeah. Shoulda, woulda coulda, Raj."
Howard,"Suddenly Iêm looking pretty good, huh?"
Sheldon,"So uh, Kripke, I was wondering if thereês any chance you could get me some time on the open science grid computer."
Sheldon,No? But weêre friends!
Sheldon,Iêm confused. I was given an understanding that you allow your friends time on the machine?
Sheldon,"Oh. This entire endeavour seems to have been an exercise in futility. Raj, youêre back in. He likes monkeys."
Howard,You gotta give him credit for sticking with it.
Leonard,I didnêt think he had it in him.
Raj,He almost made it to the top this time.
Sheldon,The problem appears to be unsolvable.
Raj,Maybe you could run some computer simulations.
Howard,There are too many variables. It would take forever.
Leonard,"Weêve got to be missing something. Letês start again. The movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45."
Sheldon,"Right, these theatres have to be eliminated."
Leonard,"Why? Theyêre state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound."
Sheldon,"Yes, but they have no Icee machines. Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, I might add."
Raj,What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.
Sheldon,They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines. No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.
Leonard,"Well, itês gonna take at least an hour to eat, and I donêt see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre."
Raj,We could eat after the movie.
Sheldon,"Unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow morningês bowel movement occurring at work."
Raj,"Hang on, hang on. Thereês a 7-Eleven here. We smuggle Slurpies, which are essentially Icees, in under our coats, after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here."
Howard,Wow. I donêt see how we missed that.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, in what universe are Slurpies Icees?"
Raj,Thatês how we missed it.
Leonard,"Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?"
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, you know I canêt do that."
Howard,"Okay, I guess we only have one option."
Raj,"Yep, I donêt see any way around it."
Leonard,"Bye, Sheldon."
Howard,See ya.
Raj,"Later, dude."
Sheldon,"Theyêre right, it was the only option."
Penny,"Ooh, ooh, shut the door, shut the door."
Penny,Just do it!  Get inside and shut the door.
Sheldon,"Well, you didnêt specify."
Penny,Is Leonard around?
Sheldon,"He went to the movies without me. It was the only option. Iêm sorry, I donêt understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?"
Penny,"The building managerês showing an apartment downstairs, and I havenêt paid my rent."
Sheldon,"Oh, I see. Penny, Iêm not sure Iêm comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation."
Penny,Itês no big deal. Iêm just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.
Sheldon,"If you recall, I pointed out the _check engineî light to you several months ago."
Penny,Well the _check engineî light is fine. Itês still blinking away. Itês the stupid engine that stopped working. It cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.
Sheldon,"You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money."
Penny,"Yes, it occurs to me, too."
Sheldon,Hang on a moment.  Here. Take some. Pay me back when you can.
Penny,"Wow, you got a lot of money in there."
Sheldon,Thatês why itês guarded by snakes. Take some.
Penny,Donêt be silly.
Sheldon,Iêm never silly. Here.
Penny,"No, I canêt."
Sheldon,Donêt you need money?
Penny,"Well, yeah, butÑ"
Sheldon,This is money Iêm not using.
Penny,But what if you need it?
Sheldon,"My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. The rest is divvied up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. Or her own protection. Take some."
Penny,"Really? I mean, are you sure?"
Sheldon,I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.
Penny,Are they working on that?
Sheldon,I sincerely hope so.
Penny,"Okay. Well, thank you. Oh, God, no, I canêt. Sheldon honey, I donêt want things to be weird between us."
Sheldon,Wonêt it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and youêre living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?
Penny,Iêll pay you back as soon as I can.
Sheldon,Of course you will. Itês impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.
Penny,Iêm regretting this already.
Sheldon,"You know, Iêve given the matter some thought, and I think Iêd be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens."
Sheldon,Ask me why.
Leonard,Do I have to?
Sheldon,Of course. Thatês how you move a conversation forward.
Sheldon,"The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally, I like having my belly scratched."
Leonard,"Hey, Penny. How was work?"
Penny,Great. I hope Iêm a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.
Sheldon,Was that sarcasm?
Sheldon,Was that sarcasm?
Sheldon,Was that sarca..
Leonard,Stop it!
Sheldon,"Penny, you appear to have a package here."
Penny,"Oh, thanks. This must be the beret I ordered. A couple of months ago. It was back-ordered."
Sheldon,Did you know the beret is an example of piece of womenês fashion adapted from male military uniforms? Another fascinating example is the epaulet.
Leonard,"Heês not lying, he does find that fascinating."
Penny,"Okay, whatever. Itês not like Iêm running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one, like, a month ago, and it was back-ordered, look, it finally arrived, all right?"
Sheldon,All right.
Penny,"Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?"
Sheldon,"Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. I wasnêt sure."
Leonard,Did you guys have an argument?
Leonard,"Well, you clearly did something to aggravate her."
Sheldon,"Iêm at a loss. If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if thereês a blunder I overlooked."
Leonard,"Here you go. Oh, you owe me another two dollars. The price of mu-shu pork went up."
Howard,Itês getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew.
Leonard,"Here you go, Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce."
Penny,"Thank you, Leonard. Whatês my share?"
Leonard,Donêt worry about it. Itês my treat.
Penny,"No, really, how much?"
Leonard,"Itês, whatever. Ten, eleven dollars."
Penny,"Well, which is it, ten or eleven?"
Leonard,"Fourteen fifty, but itês no biggie, youêll get the next one. "
Howard,He was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top if heêd get his shrimp lo mein for free.
Penny,What are you saying? That Iêm using my body to get dinner? That Iêm some kind of Chinese food prostitute?
Howard,"Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?"
Penny,"‚Cause let me tell you something, buddy, I pay my own way in this world, okay? I donêt rely on anybody!  What was that about?"
Howard,He has a nervous bladder when heês stressed out. Kind of like a puppy.
Penny,"Here, Leonard, ten, eleven, twelve, uh, fourteen dollars."
Leonard,"It was fourteen fifty, but itês okay."
Sheldon,"Oh, good. Dinnerês here."
Penny,"Yes, dinnerês here, and Iêm having some. Iêm having takeout food."
Penny,"Youêre damn right itês okay. Iêve been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and I wanted something different. So sue me."
Sheldon,"Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit."
Penny,"Sheldon, look, I will pay you back as soon as I can. You just have to give me more time."
Leonard,"Oh, wait, you lent her money?"
Penny,She needed money. You seem under pressure. Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more.
Penny,"Oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldnêt you? Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who canêt pay her bills."
Leonard,Where are you going?
Penny,"Going home, where I wonêt be interrogated like a criminal. I forgot my fortune cookie."
Sheldon,"In case either of you have larceny in your heart, you should know that Iêve moved my money out of the snake can."
Leonard,"But if youêre ever short, thereês always a couple of fifties in Green Lanternês ass."
Leonard,"A little mood lighting, huh?"
Penny,"Yeah. When I didnêt pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience."
Leonard,"Yeah, theyêre very considerate that way."
Penny,"I used Sheldonês money to pay my rent, then I had like fourteen dollars left over."
Leonard,"Fourteen dollars, huh?"
Penny,"Put it back in your pocket, or Iêll find some other place to put it."
Leonard,"Back in the pocket it goes. Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesnêt care when he gets the money back. Itês actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesnêt make you want to, you know, kill him."
Penny,"Yeah, well, thatês not really my big problem."
Leonard,So youêre a little behind on your bills. Everybody gets behind on their bills.
Penny,"Yeah, I know, itês just, this wasnêt the plan, it wasnêt supposed to go this way."
Leonard,"Well, what was the plan?"
Penny,"Um, waitress for six months and then become a movie star."
Leonard,Was there a plan B?
Penny,TV star.
Leonard,"Itês probably not as bad as you think. Letês take a look. Maybe we can find some corners to cut. Oh, hereês something, if you donêt have electricity, then you probably donêt need cable. Just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?"
Penny,"Oh, no, I canêt give up my acting classes. Iêm a professional actress."
Leonard,Youêve had an acting job where you got paid?
Penny,That is not the definition of professional.
Leonard,"Actually, it kind ofÑ letês keep looking. Whoa, whatês eighteen hundred dollars to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?"
Penny,"Oh, thatês nothing."
Leonard,"Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour."
Penny,"Well, remember Kurt?"
Leonard,Your ex-boyfriend?
Penny,Yeah. He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.
Penny,He was drunk.
Leonard,I would hope so.
Penny,"Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines."
Leonard,Did he pay you back?
Penny,"No, but he will."
Leonard,And thatês based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?
Penny,"Leonard, Iêm not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money."
Leonard,Well what are you gonna do?
Penny,"I donêt know, but I may have to find a cheaper place to live."
Leonard,"Oh, no. Oh, you donêt want to do that."
Penny,Why not?
Leonard,"Well, moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if theyêre not clean, then your books smell like melons, and itês just, likeÑ Why donêt you just get a roommate and stay here?"
Penny,"Well, do you know anybody?"
Leonard,"Well, Iêm sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldnêt mind moving in with you."
Penny,"Oh, Leonard, honey, if we started living together, I wouldnêt be able to keep my hands off you."
Penny,And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.
Howard,Ugh. This mu-shu porkês burning a hole through my duodenum.
Raj,Leviticus 11:3: _Only that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud among the beasts shall ye eat.î
Howard,"Hey, do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita every time you scarf down a Whopper?"
Leonard,"Hey, whatês going on?"
Raj,Weêre on a quest through the Valley of Fire to acquire the sacred crown.
Howard,You want the Valley of Fire? Itês right here.
Leonard,"Hey, you guys want to go on a real live quest?"
Sheldon,Outside? I just made cocoa.
Leonard,_ Come on. Itêll be fun.
Howard,What is it?
Leonard,"Do you guys remember Pennyês ex-boyfriend Kurt?  Yeah, thatês him. It turns out he owes Penny a lot of money, and Iêm gonna go get it from him."
Howard,"Ooh, double sixes."
Leonard,Really? Youêre just gonna let me go by myself?
Raj,"Oh, cool, I got a sword."
Leonard,I could use some help.
Leonard,"You guys are unbelievable, you play a game to simulate adventure, but when thereês real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out."
Sheldon,"Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman, we returned home without pants?"
Leonard,I do.
Sheldon,Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you donêt.
Leonard,Iêm not afraid of him.
Sheldon,"All right. Leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Pennyês steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? Say hi to Kurt for us."
Leonard,"Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor, didnêt Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?"
Sheldon,They did.
Sheldon,"They had a terrible time of it, Leonard."
Raj,"Plus, no one stole their pants."
Leonard,Fine. Just enjoy your little game. Iêll make this quest on my own.
Howard,"Leonard, wait. Take a jacket, itês spritzing a little."
Leonard,"You guys suck.  Come on, please? Heês so big."
Leonard,"Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?"
Howard,"Yes. Koothrappaliês going to wet himself, Iêm gonna throw up, Sheldonês gonna run away, and youêre going to die. Shall we synchronize our watches?"
Leonard,"Guys, there are four of us and one of him."
Sheldon,Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.
Leonard,"Okay, how about this? Iêll do the talking, you just stand behind me and try to look formidable."
Raj,I shouldêve peed before we left.
Leonard,"Hi, Kurt."
Leonard,"I donêt really go by Lenny, but thatês okay. Um, you remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj."
Sheldon,You donêt remember me? How could he not remember me?
Leonard,"Sheldon, not now."
Sheldon,I remember him.
Leonard,"Okay, here it is. Pennyês in kind of a financial jam, and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems."
Leonard,"No, no, sheês too proud to ask for the money. I, on the other hand, feel you should honour your debt."
Leonard,"Feel is a kind of aÑ itês a strong word. Um, I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part."
Howard,"Well, there you go. Problem solved."
Raj,A successful quest. Now letês go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.
Leonard,"No, the problem isnêt solved. He just blew us off."
Sheldon,Iêve got it. He didnêt remember me because the last time we met I was in a Halloween costume.
Howard,"Come on, Leonard, letês go"
Leonard,You can leave if you want to. Iêm gonna see this through.
Howard,Okay.  
Leonard,"I guess, technically, that was my fault.  Iêm not leaving here without Pennyês money."
Leonard,I donêt need backup. I have right on my side. And Iêm wearing cargo shorts under my pants.
Sheldon,"Congratulations. You may not have succeeded in getting cash, but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt.  "
Howard,Maybe we should have your head notarized.
Raj,"If anybody cares, I still have to pee."
Penny,"Hey, is Sheldon here?"
Leonard,Yeah. Hang on. Sheldon!
Penny,Nice hat.
Leonard,Itês kind of a fashionable look these days.
Penny,Maybe if youêre working on a tuna boat.
Sheldon,"Hello, Penny."
Penny,"Sheldon, here is your money. Thank you very much. It helped a lot."
Sheldon,Darn. I canêt seem to get the hang of that.
Leonard,"Hey, I know itês none of my business, but where did the money come from?"
Penny,"Well, I cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant, but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, Kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me."
Leonard,Really? Did he say why?
Penny,"Yes, he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right."
Leonard,Thatês it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?
Penny,"Nope. I just think heês really changed. Weêre having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret. Bye, guys."
Sheldon,"Well done, Leonard. The true hero doesnêt seek adulation, he fights for right and justice simply because itês his nature."
Leonard,Pennyês hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!
Sheldon,"Thatês your badge of honour, your warriorês wound, if you will. I was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you."
Sheldon,"There once was a brave lad named Leonard, with a fi-fi-fiddle-dee-dee. He faced a fearsome giant, while Raj just wanted to pee."
Penny,"Fellas, please."
Howard,"Penny, come on, we were just finding our sound."
Penny,You found it. Itês the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.
Leonard,"Iêm really very busy. Is there any way that we can put this off until I have more time to prepare? Of course. But, uh, you understand my trepidation."
Penny,Whatês that about?
Howard,Not a clue.
Leonard,Canêt we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?
Sheldon,"This should be fairly easy to deduce. Heês holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so heês using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller."
Leonard,"No, I didnêt realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess thereês no other choice but to just go ahead and do it."
Sheldon,"Heês referring to an activity he has done before. Itês unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy."
Leonard,"Arenêt there any other options? Thereês not a lot of room, itês gonna be uncomfortable."
Sheldon,"Yes, yes. Yeah, Iêm definitely going with colonoscopy."
Leonard,"Okay, bye. My motherês coming to visit."
Howard,"How about that, you were right."
Penny,Itês out of order.
Penny,I think it implies that the elevator doesnêt work.
Penny,You must be Leonardês mother.
Penny,"Uh, Iêm Penny. Iêm his neighbour."
Penny,"Oh, nice to meet you."
Penny,"Uh, why donêt you come with me. Iêll walk you to the apartment."
Penny,"Yeah, sure, I guess."
Penny,"Okay. You know, Iêve always been curious. What was Leonard like when he was little?"
Penny,"Right, okay. What was he like when he was young?"
Penny,"Oh, um, okay, like, five or six. Five."
Penny,"Yeah, Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist."
Penny,"Oh, well, Iêm an actress."
Penny,What do you mean why?
Penny,"Yeah, I donêt know what that means."
Penny,"Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood."
Penny,"I know my dad wanted a boy. I just, I tried being good at sports, but I hated getting dirty!"
Penny,"Uh-huh, he called me Slugger until I got my first training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasnêt Slugger anymore. Your motherês here!"
Leonard,"Good to see you, Mother."
Leonard,"Hereês your tea, Mother."
Leonard,Iêll start again.
Sheldon,I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.
Sheldon,That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.
Sheldon,Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.
Leonard,"Hereês your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking about?"
Sheldon,The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.
Leonard,"Swell. If youêre lucky, maybe sheêll show you the PowerPoint presentation."
Leonard,"So, Mother, whatês new?"
Leonard,"All right. Uh, whatês new with you?"
Leonard,Maybe something less personal.
Leonard,"Oh, my God. What happened?"
Sheldon,What a remarkable woman.
Leonard,"Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off."
Sheldon,I envy you your childhood.
Leonard,"I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd."
Sheldon,"Youêre clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and Iêm betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldnêt eat your Brussels sprouts."
Leonard,"Sheldon, you donêt give your mother enough credit. Sheês warm, sheês loving, she doesnêt glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training."
Sheldon,"You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG, I had to attach my own electrodes."
Howard,"So, Dr. Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister."
Leonard,"Please, donêt go there, Howard."
Howard,"I understand that unlike Leonard, theyêre at the top of their respective fields."
Leonard,"Boy, you suck."
Howard,"So, sheês close to curing diabetes?"
Howard,"Wow, you must be very proud."
Leonard,Why are you doing this?
Howard,"You know the rules. You brought your mom to work, you must suffer."
Sheldon,"Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you."
Raj,"Yeah, youêre like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family."
Howard,"Oh, meesa think yousa lookinê so so sad."
Leonard,"You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it."
Raj,"Nope, I think mocking you is more fun."
Howard,"Next time, donêt yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day?"
Leonard,That was fast.
Sheldon,"Itês totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in real estate, itês location, location, location."
Leonard,Howard lives with his mother and Raj canêt speak to women unless heês drunk. Go.
Howard,"Itês just temporary, I pay rent."
Leonard,He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.
Howard,Say what?  Thatês basically what I just said.
Leonard,"You brought your husband to work, you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha."
Leonard,"Thereês no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other."
Sheldon,Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one oêclock.
Leonard,Fine. Letês go. I think youêll find my work pretty interesting. Iêm attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.
Howard,"Just for the record, weêre not in an ersatz homosexual relationship."
Raj,"Well, then why didnêt you say that to her?"
Howard,Why is it always my responsibility?
Raj,"Itês not always your responsibility. I swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week."
Howard,I canêt believe youêre bringing that up.
Raj,I didnêt bring it up. You did.
Howard,Weêll talk about this later.
Raj,"You always say that, but we never do."
Sheldon,You went to the comic book store without me.7
Leonard,You got alcohol?
Penny,Your mom still here?
Penny,"Come on in. Wait, wait, sheês not gonna come here looking for you, is she?"
Leonard,"Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan."
Penny,"Oh, my God. What happened?"
Leonard,Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.
Penny,"Geez, what a fun couple."
Leonard,Sheês only been here a day and a half and Iêm seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.
Penny,"Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and Iêve been half bombed ever since."
Leonard,You canêt let her get into your head.
Penny,"My head, what about yours?"
Leonard,Itês too late for me. My head is her summer house.
Penny,"She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me."
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom."
Penny,"I mean, do you know where I was all morning? Auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial. And for what? So Iêll finally get my daddyês approval?"
Leonard,Did you get the part?
Penny,"No, they said I was too perky."
Leonard,"Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?"
Penny,"Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldnêt let go. Your mother told me."
Leonard,"Of course she did. Anyway, thatês not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine."
Penny,A hugging machine?
Leonard,"Yeah. I got a dressmakerês mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back."
Penny,"Oh, that is so sad."
Leonard,You know what the saddest part was?
Leonard,My father used to borrow it.
Sheldon,I know. Although Iêve always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.
Sheldon,Iêd love to see a scan of your brain sometime.
Sheldon,"Oh, I canêt believe that."
Sheldon,My apologies. Iêve been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.
Sheldon,Can I make you a cup of tea?
Sheldon,I feel very comfortable around you.
Sheldon,"Itês surprising because I generally donêt feel comfortable around, well, anyone."
Sheldon,What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?
Sheldon,Iêd like to do the math.
Penny,"Okay, now this timeÑ"
Penny,"Youêre gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and then bite the lime."
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, I didnêt hear anything after lick."
Penny,"Neck, shot, lime.  Okay, shot, lime."
Leonard,"Right. Ah! Whereês the lime?  Oh, okay, weêre sharing."
Sheldon,"So, what do you think?"
Sheldon,"Normally, Iêd feel the same way. But based on everything Iêve observed about us, I canêt help but speculate weêd be very good together."
Sheldon,"I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. Itês quite satisfying."
Sheldon,"You see right through me, donêt you?"
Leonard,This is actually gonna happen.
Penny,"Honey, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush."
Leonard,"You shush, Iêm happy, I want to talk about it. You know what my mother would say about this? She would say because you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didnêt get as children."
Penny,Why would you bring that up right now?
Leonard,I donêt know. Foreplay?
Penny,"So youêre saying youêre not having sex with me, youêre having sex with your mother?"
Leonard,"Ummm, Iêm gonna go with _no.î"
Penny,That is the sickest thing Iêve ever heard.
Leonard,"Come on, youêre trying to have sex with your father, and Iêm okay with that."
Penny,Get out!
Leonard,She said shush. I should have shushed. 
Leonard,"All right, Mother. Um, have a nice flight."
Penny,"Oh, good morning."
Penny,"Look, I was just coming over to talk to you."
Leonard,You donêt have to. Ever.
Leonard,"Good-bye, Mother."
Penny,"I mean, my mom couldêve just said, _Bob, get over it, sheês a girl, move on.î But she didnêt. Not one word."
Penny,Would it help?
Howard,That was close.
Raj,"God, I love the smell of paintballs in the morning."
Howard,"Yeah, still funny, Raj."
Leonard,Thereês no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.
Howard,But what about the creek bed?
Sheldon,"The Pharmacology Department controls that, and theyêre all hopped up on experimental steroids."
Raj,"Well, thatês it then, weêre doomed."
Sheldon,I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.
Howard,"I told you my mom has spider veins, I had to take her to the laser clinic."
Sheldon,And I told you I wanted to see a doctorês note.
Raj,We need a plan. How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?
Leonard,I forget. Which one is Hammer of the Gods?
Raj,We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.
Howard,No go. The Dumpsters are deep in Astronomy Department territory.
Leonard,"No, that shouldnêt be a problem, Venus is up during the day. Theyêre probably just all staring at the sky."
Sheldon,"All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earthês Athens and Sparta? Not important. Leonard, Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away, Howard will cover us."
Howard,Why donêt I run away and you cover me?
Sheldon,"Because you chose your motherês veins over victory. On three. One, two, three, go!"
Howard,I had to take her! Itês almost bathing suit weather!
Howard,"Oh, Leslie, thank God."
Howard,"Ah, they left me here to die. What about yours?"
Howard,"Well, weêre surrounded, so I guess thereês nothing for us to do but wait to be captured or killed."
Howard,All the while knowing that thereês a paint pellet out there with your name on it.
Howard,It kind of does.
Howard,I agree. How exactly do we do that? 
Leonard,"Howard, why arenêt you covering us? Weêre getting slaughtered out here!"
Howard,War is hell.
Raj,Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?
Leonard,"Yeah, more cutbacks."
Sheldon,Unacceptable. It baffles me why they donêt simply let some of you go so that thereês money available for my research.
Leonard,"You know what baffles me, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,"Based on your academic record, any number of things, I would imagine."
Leonard,"Hey, Leslie."
Howard,"Thatês great, Leslie. Thanks."
Raj,What was all that about?
Howard,"Oh, uh, no big deal. They gave Leslie control of some unrestricted grant money."
Leonard,"Yeah, okay, but whatês with the back-scratching and the meow!"
Sheldon,I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.
Leonard,Thank you.
Sheldon,"The mrow, that sounded to me like an African civet cat."
Leonard,Are you done?
Sheldon,"Despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat. Now Iêm done."
Raj,You know what Iêm thinking? Iêm thinking Howard wasnêt making a back-scratching metaphor. Iêm thinking there was some actual scratching involved.
Leonard,"What about it, Howard?"
Howard,"Okay, I didnêt want to say anything êcause I know you and Leslie have a little history."
Leonard,I donêt care about that.
Howard,"Great, êcause Iêve been dying to say something."
Leonard,You and Leslie?
Howard,In the paintball shed! Twice!
Sheldon,Is that why you didnêt cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?
Howard,"Oh, yeah, sorry about that."
Sheldon,"My good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense."
Howard,"Court-martial, schmort-martial, Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl Iêve ever had sex with. I mean, for free."
Raj,"And plus, you got a rapid prototyper. Thatês an expensive piece of equipment, dude."
Leonard,And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.
Howard,"Okay, one way to look at this is that Iêm getting new equipment, and youêre not, and thatês unfair. But a better way to look at this is that Iêm getting sex and youêre not, and thatês delightful."
Penny,The whole thing froze. I donêt know what happened.
Leonard,Calm down. Weêll figure it out.
Penny,How can I calm down? Iêm gonna lose my whole shopping cart. Thatês three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.
Sheldon,"Hello, Penny."
Penny,"Hello, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Youêre in my spot.
Penny,Are you planning on sitting here?
Sheldon,"No, Iêm going to the comic book store."
Penny,Then what difference does it make?
Sheldon,What difference does it make?
Leonard,Here we go.
Sheldon,"That is my spot. In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero."
Leonard,Donêt sit in his spot.
Penny,Fine.   Happy?
Sheldon,Iêm not unhappy.
Penny,"Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle."
Leonard,"Okay, that should do it."
Penny,"Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver."
Leonard,Thatês a lot of shoes you ordered.
Penny,"Yeah, you know the sad thing is, itês really not. Ooh, is this one of those paintball guns?"
Leonard,Yeah. You ought to come out with us sometime.
Penny,"Oh, no, thanks. Iêm from Nebraska. When we shoot things, itês because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone. "
Howard,"Well, itês partly you, partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia."
Howard,Can I assume that you likewise found the experienceÑ
Howard,"That wasnêt quite the word I was looking for, but sure, Iêll do this pass-fail."
Howard,"Oh, itês great. Everybody in the Engineering Department is eating their hearts out."
Howard,"You know, most people donêt get that."
Howard,"Oh, great."
Howard,"Iêm busy, Ma!"
Howard,"Donêt come in, Ma!"
Howard,"Oh, thereês the arrhythmia."
Howard,Are you Jewish?
Penny,You think heêll notice?
Leonard,Thereês a chance.
Penny,"Oh, what are we gonna do?"
Leonard,"We? No, no, no, you had your chance to be we for, like, a year and a half now. Right now, you are you, and you are screwed."
Penny,Why do we have to tell him I did it?
Leonard,"Well, weêre not gonna tell him I did it."
Penny,"Okay, okay, how about this? We tell him somebody broke in."
Leonard,Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?
Penny,"Iêm sorry, I buy it. All those people are on drugs."
Leonard,We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.
Penny,"Okay, fine. Well, what if we just flip it over? There. Looks fine, right?"
Leonard,"Mm, butt print. Thereês no discernible butt print."
Penny,"Oh, come on.  There, butt print."
Leonard,Itês too small and too perfect.
Penny,Thank you.
Leonard,Youêre welcome.
Penny,Shh! Act normal.
Leonard,Sheldon! How was the comic book store?
Sheldon,Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.
Leonard,"Great, great. Did you walk the whole way? Itês a little chilly."
Sheldon,Koothrappali picked me up.
Leonard,Isnêt that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?
Sheldon,They donêt talk incessantly for no particular reason.
Leonard,"No, no, friends forgive the little things."
Penny,"You know, I gotta go home and wash my hair."
Leonard,"Donêt you dare, missy."
Sheldon,"Hello, fastest man alive. Want to see me read your entire comic book? Want to see it again? Somethingês wrong."
Leonard,What do you mean?
Sheldon,Iêm not sure. It doesnêt feel right.
Leonard,"I donêt know what youêre talking about. Oh, that. Penny did that."
Leonard,Why donêt you just eat in your desk chair?
Sheldon,Why donêt I just eat in my desk chair?
Penny,Here we go.
Sheldon,"That is my desk chair, that is where I work. I donêt eat in my desk chair and I donêt work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot."
Howard,"You know, thereês kind of an obvious solution here.  Nobody cares where youêre going to sit. Youêre not crazy."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, but the problem is not solved. If your head had been accidentally amputated, and we transplanted a dogês head in its place, would that be _problem solvedî?"
Leonard,"If it were your head, it would be."
Penny,"Sheldon, I am really, really sorry, but itês only for a week. Canêt you be a little bit flexible? Yeah, sorry. I didnêt really think that through."
Sheldon,"You claim itês going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner."
Penny,Why not?
Sheldon,Did you notice the sign on his counter? Heês not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.
Leonard,"Oh, for Godês sake, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Focus is important. Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? _Thanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?î"
Howard,"Ooh, looks like Iêm gonna have sex tonight. Hey, babyÑ"
Penny,His right hand is calling him?
Leonard,"No, itês Leslie Winkle. Itês a long story."
Howard,"Iêll pick you up in ten minutes. Gentlemen, adieu."
Leonard,I thought we were going to play Halo tonight.
Howard,"What am I supposed to do, Leonard? Thereês a woman out there anxious to have sex with me. You understand, right?"
Penny,Not at all.
Howard,"Nevertheless, I must depart. By the way, did I tell you? Leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip to Geneva to check out the CERN Supercollider."
Leonard,Thatês not fair. Youêre not even a physicist.
Howard,"Okay, there are two ways of looking at thisÑ"
Leonard,Get out.
Howard,Thank you. It helps when I get to practice with a real woman.
Howard,"Yeah, gee, Iêd really rather not."
Howard,"When I go to weddings, itês to scam on chunky bridesmaids. I donêt know what I would do with a date."
Howard,What about it?
Howard,When did that happen?
Howard,"Well, hold on. Are you saying if I donêt go to the wedding, I canêt go to Geneva?"
Howard,"Okay, Iêm sorry, but that makes me a little uncomfortable."
Howard,Because itês like youêre controlling me with new equipment and research trips.
Howard,How so?
Howard,"So, bottom line, Iêm just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy."
Howard,"Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!"
Leonard,Why are you crouching there?
Sheldon,This is my spot. Where else am I supposed to crouch?
Leonard,I donêt know. Texas?
Penny,"Here you go. Fresh from the cleaners, good as new."
Leonard,"Really? Great. Sheldon, look. Good as new."
Sheldon,"From that key maker, I highly doubt it."
Penny,"Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try."
Sheldon,All right.
Penny,"There, nice and comfy cosy. Zero, zero, zero."
Sheldon,Thereês one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.
Penny,Sit on the damn couch.
Penny,"What do you mean, nope? Whatês wrong with it?"
Leonard,"Nothing, itês whatês wrong with him."
Penny,Itês exactly the sameÑ
Leonard,"Penny, Penny, I think I know what to do. Sheldon, I have some bad news."
Leonard,Iêm afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?
Sheldon,Yes. From Szechuan Palace.
Leonard,Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.
Sheldon,Wh-Where did my cashew chicken come from?
Leonard,Golden Dragon.
Sheldon,"No, this isnêt right. Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers."
Leonard,"Yeah, well, before they went out of business, I bought 4,000 containers. I keep them in the trunk of my car."
Sheldon,"But. Oh, this changes everything."
Leonard,I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.
Sheldon,Whatês real? What isnêt? How can I know?
Penny,"You did make that up, right?"
Leonard,"Oh, God, I wish I had."
Leonard,"Yeah, buddy?"
Sheldon,I still donêt like this cushion.
Leonard,"Okay, first of all, Penny, thank you for coming."
Penny,Thanks for the shoes.
Leonard,Penny is an amazing shot. I think we have a real chance to win this week.
Howard,Whatês the plan?
Leonard,"Okay. Now, we all run out. Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees. Raj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. Then weêll all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight."
Sheldon,"Right, just one thing before we start."
Leonard,"What is it, Sheldon? "
Penny,What the hell?
Sheldon,That was for my cushion.
Leonard,"Sheldon, Penny was our only hope."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, Leonard. But revenge is a dish best served cold."
Penny,Screw that. 
Sheldon,She canêt shoot me. Sheês dead.
Leonard,Heês right. You canêt. 
Sheldon,"Well, if weêre going to descend into anarchy "
Howard,"Okay, see you."
Leonard,Where are you going?
Howard,"Okay, Raj, hand me the number six torque screwdriver."
Sheldon,"Stop. We canêt do this, itês not right."
Raj,"Sheldon, you have two choices. Either you let him put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo, or you delete stuff before we go out of town."
Sheldon,"But once you open the box, youêve voided the warranty. The warranty is a sacred covenant weêve entered into with the manufacturer. He offers to stand by his equipment, and we in return agree not to violate the integrity of the internal hardware. This little orange sticker is all that stands between us and anarchy."
Leonard,"Okay, then we wonêt touch the hard drive. Weêll just erase the first season of Battlestar."
Sheldon,There. Weêre outlaws.
Penny,"Here you go, Leonard. Is this going to be big enough?"
Leonard,Itês perfect.
Howard,For taking daffodils to your unicorn.
Leonard,"Itês just for my notebooks. Thanks, Penny."
Penny,"Oh, I love San Francisco. I wish I was going with you."
Sheldon,"I understand your envy. This is a canêt-miss symposium. There are going to be discussions on bioorganic cellular computer devices, the advancements in multi-threaded task completion, plus a roundtable on the nonequilibrium Greenês function approach to the photoionization process in atoms."
Penny,"When I go, I usually just get hammered and ride the cable cars."
Leonard,This conference is kind of a big thing. The keynote address is being delivered by George Smoot.
Penny,"Oh, my God, the George Smoot?"
Leonard,Youêve heard of him?
Penny,Of course I havenêt.
Sheldon,"George Smoot is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, one of the great minds of our time. His work in black body form and anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation cemented our understanding of the origin of the universe."
Penny,"Itês kind of a funny name, though, Smoot."
Sheldon,Itês like talking to a chimp.
Penny,"Okay, now that Iêve been completely insulted, have a good flight."
Leonard,"Yeah, I wish."
Sheldon,"Weêre not flying, weêre taking the train."
Penny,"Oh, cool."
Howard,"Yeah, cool. Seven times as long as flying, and costs almost twice as much."
Penny,"Well, then why are you doing it?"
Leonard,"Well, we had a vote. Three of us voted for airplane, Sheldon voted for train, so weêre taking the train."
Sheldon,"Donêt say it like that, Leonard, say it like: weêre taking the train!"
Leonard,"Hey, weêre all going over to the Apple store to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar. You want to come?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I always enjoy that, but Iêm a little busy."
Leonard,What are you doing?
Sheldon,"Iêm simplifying the task of packing for our trip. See, by attaching RFID tags to my clothing, it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand. I will then cross-reference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera."
Leonard,"Well, that does sound much simpler. How long is this going to take?"
Sheldon,"Assuming I can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes, and plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation."
Leonard,Wow. Teasing the guys at the Apple store seems a little redundant now.
Sheldon,I donêt follow.
Leonard,I wouldnêt expect you to. Iêll see you later.
Sheldon,"Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue. Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue."
Sheldon,What on earth are you doing?
Raj,"Whatever it is, Iêm guessing weêre doing it wrong."
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight, one of the great American trains operating on one of the classic American routes. On this side, youêll see panoramic ocean vistas inaccessible to any other form of transportation, while on your side, youêll be treated to 350 miles of CostCos, Jiffy Lubes, and cinderblock homes with above-ground pools."
Howard,"Come on, Raj."
Raj,Whatês wrong with Jiffy Lubes?
Leonard,Why not?
Sheldon,Thatês over the wheelbase. Are you completely unfamiliar with the suspension characteristics of a pre-1980 Pullman-built Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?
Leonard,"Sheldon, weêve been on this train 90 seconds, and youêve already said a thousand words. Just tell us where to sit and shut up."
Sheldon,"Here. Iêm hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails, your sour disposition will abate."
Leonard,"Yeah, maybe. Meanwhile back in the 21st century, people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position êcause itês time to land in San Francisco."
Raj,"Itês not so bad, really. At least these trains have modern plumbing. In India, you squat over a hole in the train and expose your naked buttocks to the chilly air of Rajasthan."
Sheldon,"He is referring, of course, to third class on Indian Railwaysê magnificent Ranakpur Express and its twelve hundred kilometer journey from Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction."
Leonard,"Oh, look, now heês boring on an international scale."
Raj,Holy crap! Look!
Leonard,Is that who I think it is?
Howard,It canêt be. What would Summer Glau be doing riding the train?
Leonard,Maybe John Connorês aboard and sheês protecting him from an evil Terminator.
Sheldon,"Unlikely. Thatês a television show, Leonard."
Leonard,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Of course, if SkyNet actually did exist in the future, a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy mankind would be to send Terminators back posing as actors who have played Terminators in popular films and television series, lulling us into a false sense of security, i.e., thatês Summer Glau from The Sarah Connor Chronicles. No, Summer, donêt kill me! Iêm pro-robot! Ahh!"
Leonard,At least heês off the train crap.
Howard,"Sheldon, I owe you an apology. Taking the train was a stroke of brilliance! Iêve actually got a shot at a Terminator."
Raj,"Oh, please.When it comes to Terminators, youêve got a better shot of scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger."
Howard,"Youêre overlooking something. I have 11 hours with her in a confined space. Unless sheês willing to jump off a moving train, tuck and roll down the side of a hill, she will eventually succumb to the acquired taste that is Howard Wolowitz."
Leonard,My moneyês on tuck and roll.
Sheldon,Iêm confused. I thought you were involved in some sort of socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.
Howard,"Sheldon, let me explain to you how this works."
Sheldon,All right.
Howard,Thatês Summer Glau.
Howard,Thatês it.
Raj,Hang on a sec. Why do you get first crack at her?
Howard,"Um, well, letês see, couple reasons. One, I saw her first."
Raj,"No, you didnêt. I did."
Howard,"Fair enough. But then let me move on to number two, unlike you, I can actually talk to women when Iêm sober."
Raj,"You fail to take into account that even mute, I am foreign and exotic, while you, on the other hand, are frail and pasty."
Howard,"Well, you know the old saying, pasty and frail never fail."
Leonard,"Excuse me, but what about me? Why donêt I get a shot?"
Howard,"Fine, go ahead. Take a shot."
Leonard,"You know, Iêve already got a gorgeous blonde back home at I canêt score with. I think Iêll let you two take this one."
Raj,"Sheldon, is there a place on this train to get alcohol?"
Sheldon,"Interesting that you ask. The Coast Starlight recently added the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car. Built in 1956 and originally known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car, the lower level is a theatreÑ"
Raj,"Yeah-yeah, which way?"
Sheldon,and the upper level is a bar that offers wine tastings if youêre going as far as Portland.
Leonard,So arenêt you going to go talk to her?
Howard,"I will, Iêm just working on my opening line."
Leonard,"Sheês probably heard every possible line, Howard. Why donêt you just try hello?"
Howard,"No, no, no, that always creeps girls out. I need to come up with something thatês funny, smart and delicately suggests that my sexual endowment is disproportionate to my physical stature."
Leonard,Youêre going to need more than 11 hours.
Sheldon,"Oh, no."
Leonard,Whatês the matter?
Sheldon,I forgot my flash drive.
Sheldon,So we have to go back.
Leonard,"Okay, Sheldon, Iêm going to say why and your answer cannot be because I forgot my flash drive."
Sheldon,You donêt understand. My flash drive has my paper on astrophysical probes of M-theory effects in the early universe that I was going to give to George Smoot at the conference.
Leonard,Why do you have to give your paper to George Smoot?
Sheldon,Itês brilliant. He needs to read it.
Leonard,So youêll send him an e-mail when we get back.
Sheldon,Then I wonêt get to see his face light up as he reads it.
Leonard,Right. Of course.
Sheldon,"Oh, this is an unmitigated disaster."
Leonard,"Well, thereês nothing you can do about it, so relax, sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of the steel wheels on the polished rails."
Sheldon,"You forgot your flash drive, You forgot your flash drive "
Leonard,"Only ten hours, 55 minutes to go."
Sheldon,"Okay, Iêve found the perfect solution. We get off the train at the next stop in Oxnard. We then take the 1:13 train back to Union Station. We take a cab back to the apartment, get my flash drive, and then race to San Luis Obispo, where, assuming the lights are with us and minimal traffic, weêll meet the train."
Leonard,Iêve got a better idea.
Sheldon,Are you going to be sarcastic?
Leonard,"Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.  But look, Pennyês home. Why donêt we just call her, have her go in the apartment, get your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?"
Sheldon,But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk.
Sheldon,The key is hidden in my room.
Sheldon,Penny would have to go into my room.
Sheldon,People donêt go in my room!
Leonard,"I see. Well, it seems once again, youêre caught between a rock and a crazy place."
Sheldon,"Oh, I hate when that happens."
Howard,Itês hot in here. It must be Summer. Itês hot in here. Must be Summer. Itês hot in here. Must be Summer.
Raj,Itês hot in here. Must be Summer.
Raj,Really? I just made it up. Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?
Raj,Itês loosely based on my life.
Penny,"Yeah, weêre putting the play on for one night in this little 99-seat theatre. Can you come? Oh, great. Do you know 98 other people that might want to come? Oh, hang on.  Hello?"
Sheldon,"Listen carefully. Iêm about to give you a set of instructions, which you must follow to the letter."
Penny,Just a sec.  Hello?
Sheldon,"Okay, step four. Do you see that small plastic case on my dresser?"
Penny,Your dresser? Who is this?
Sheldon,Itês Sheldon.
Penny,"Oh, hey, Sheldon! How is San Francisco?"
Sheldon,Iêm not in San Francisco. Iêm on a train. Were you even listening to me?
Penny,"Uh, no, I was talking to my friend, but whatês up?"
Sheldon,"Whatês up? Iêll tell you whatês up. Iêm in a crisis situation, and I need you to marshal your powers of concentration, limited as they may beÑ"
Leonard,"Give me the phone. Hi, Penny. Itês Leonard."
Penny,"Hey, Leonard. Whatês going on with Dr. Wackadoodle?"
Leonard,"Heês calling to ask you a favour. You might be confused because he didnêt use the words, Penny, Sheldon, please or favour."
Sheldon,"Okay. Enough chitchat. Okay, step one, locate your emergency key to our apartment. Step two, enter our apartment. Step three, enter my bedroom."
Penny,"Oh, hang on, Sheldon, getting another call."
Sheldon,"No! Leonard, let me tell you something. Personal robots cannot get here soon enough."
Raj,"And that bright little star peeking her head out early today, thatês Venus."
Raj,"Come on. When you were on TV in Firefly, you were actually in space."
Raj,"You mean one of the hopeless geeks? Those are crazy people. Howard, be a dear and get me another one of these. Now, him, heês one of those geeks."
Sheldon,"All right, now, before you enter my bedroom unescorted, I need you to understand that this onetime grant of access does not create a permanent easement. Easement. Itês a legal right"
Howard,"Do you believe him? Normally around women, he has the personality of a boiled potato. Put one beer in him, and heês M. Night Charmalarmalon."
Leonard,Is that what heês drinking? Itês not even real beer.
Leonard,Look at it. Non-alcoholic beer.
Howard,Whatês going on?
Leonard,"I donêt know. Some sort of placebo effect, I guess."
Howard,"Placebo, you say. Interesting."
Sheldon,"Yes, Iêm still here. Where am I going? Iêm on a train. Now, what youêll be looking for is a small wooden box located between a Hobermanês sphere and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite. Hobermanês Sphere. Itês a collapsible icosidodecahedron. No, the thing with the time on it is my alarm clock."
Raj,"Actually, in India, the names of constellations are different. Where you have the Big Dipper, we have the Big Curry Pot."
Raj,You got me. Now what are you going to do with me?
Raj,What am I looking at?
Howard,You tell me.
Raj,Non-alcoholic bee-ee-eeuh 
Howard,"Hi, Iêm the small package good things come in."
Penny,"Okay, I got a box, but thereês no key in here. Just letters."
Sheldon,Thatês the wrong box. Put it back.
Penny,"Oh, Sheldon, are these letters from your grandmother?"
Sheldon,Donêt read those letters!
Penny,"Oh, look, she calls you Moon Pie. That is so cute."
Sheldon,Put down the letters!
Leonard,"Hey, Penny. Itês Leonard."
Penny,"Hey, Leonard. Howês the train ride?"
Leonard,"Delightful. Listen, I donêt know what youêre doing right now, but there are little bubbles forming on the corners of Sheldonês mouth."
Penny,"Okay, yeah, I kind of crossed a line. Put him back on."
Leonard,Thank you.
Sheldon,Iêm back.
Penny,"What up, Moon Pie?"
Sheldon,Nobody calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!
Leonard,"Hey, Penny. Leonard again."
Howard,"So anyway, in the dream, you and I were ice skating, just the two of us. And then, I picked you up by your ankles and twirled you round and round until your legs tore off. I tried to stick them back on, but before I could, you turned into a giant loaf of pumpernickel bread. What do you think that means?"
Howard,Iêll give you a little clue. My favourite sandwich? Salami on pumpernickel.
Howard,"And did you know the word _pumpernickelî comes from the German words pumper and nickel, which loosely translates to fart goblin?"
Penny,"Okay, I found the box. Now what?"
Sheldon,"Youêre holding a Japanese puzzle box, which takes ten precise moves to open. First, locate the panel with the diamond pattern and slide the centre portion one millimetre to the left. Then, on the opposite end of the box, slide the entire panel down two millimetres. Youêll hear a slight click."
Penny,"Hang on. Sheldon, do you have any emotional attachment to this box?"
Sheldon,"No, itês a novelty I ordered off the Internet. Now, did you hear the click?"
Penny,Not yet. There it is.
Howard,"Okay, hereês another one. If you married the famous rock guitarist Johnny Winter, youêd be Summer Winter."
Howard,"Okay, Iêm going to just go for broke here and say I like you."
Howard,"So hereês my question, do you realistically see any conversational path that would take me from where we are right now to a place where I could ask you out and youêd say yes?"
Howard,Fair enough. Iêll leave you in peace.
Howard,"But before I go, would you mind if I just take one picture of us together for my Facebook page?"
Howard,"Okay. Great. Now, can I take one where it looks like weêre making out?"
Sheldon,"Okay, now youêre going to insert the flash drive into the USB port. She calls me Moon Pie because Iêm nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up, now, please put the flash drive in the USB port. The one that looks like a little duckês mouth."
Leonard,"Hey, howêd it go?"
Howard,Terminator broke my phone.
Leonard,"Excuse me.  Okay, Iêll be honest with you. Iêve just spent the last two hours imagining various scenarios in my head, trying to come up with some clever line to say to you. But then I finally realized youêre a human being; Iêm a human being. I could just say to youÑ"
Leonard,"Hi, my nameês Leonard."
Sheldon,"So, Iêm thinking, you won the Nobel Prize what, three years ago? So you must deal with a whole lot of what has Smoot done lately? My thought is we continue my research as a team, you know, Cooper-Smoot, alphabetical, and when we win the Nobel Prize, youêll be back on top."
Sheldon,"Fine! Smoot-Cooper. Wow, what a diva."
Raj,Knight to queenês bishop-five.
Howard,"Oh, very nice. Whatês Leonard going to do? Does he give up the pawn or does he give up the position?"
Raj,"Letês find out. Leonard, ready?"
Raj,Go. 
Leonard,Damn it. I slipped.
Howard,"Too bad. You know the rules of Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess. Uh, Leonard died again, Sheldon. Youêre up."
Sheldon,"Despite my deep love of chess, lasers and aerosol disinfectant, I must forfeit."
Sheldon,_ Because itês almost eleven oêclock.
Sheldon,"So, Penny has a donêt knock on my door before eleven oêclock  or I punch you in the throat rule."
Howard,"Hey, you know whatêd be a great idea? We get some girls over here and play Laser Obstacle Strip Chess."
Leonard,"Believe me, Howard, any girl who would be willing to play that, you donêt want to see naked."
Howard,You underestimate me.
Sheldon, Penny.
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Itês eleven am.
Penny,I know. Youêre safe.
Sheldon,This package came while you were at work.
Penny,"Oh, great, my rhinestones. Thank you."
Sheldon,Excuse me.
Sheldon,You have to sign this.
Penny,What is it?
Sheldon,"When I signed for the package, I was deputized by the United Parcel Service and entrusted with its final delivery. I now need you to acknowledge receipt of the package so that Iêm fully indemnified and no longer liable."
Penny,"Sheldon, itês just a box of rhinestones."
Sheldon,"Well, the contents are irrelevant. A legal bailment has been created. Does that mean nothing to you?"
Penny,"It means nothing to anybody. Come here, let me show you what Iêm doing."
Sheldon,"Bailment describes a relationship in common law where a physical possession of personal property, or chattels, is transferred from one person, the bailor, to another person, the bailee."
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, look, look! I started a business."
Sheldon,"Obviously, not a cleaning business."
Penny,"No, Iêm making flower barrettes. See? I call them Penny Blossoms. I made one for myself, then all the girls at work wanted one. Then I showed some to this lady who runs a shop in Old Town. She sells cards and homemade jewellery. She said she wanted to sell them. I said okay, and in one week, I made a $156."
Sheldon,Good for you. Sign here.
Penny,"Sheldon, donêt you get it? If this takes off, I wonêt have to be a waitress anymore."
Sheldon,But then who will bring me my cheeseburger on Tuesday nights?
Penny,Another waitress.
Sheldon,Whatês her name?
Penny,I donêt know.
Sheldon,And youêre going to let her handle my food?
Penny,Nancy. Her name is Nancy.
Sheldon,I think youêre just making that up.
Penny,"Sheldon, Iêm sorry about your hamburger, okay? I just donêt want to be a waitress for the rest of my life."
Leonard,Cheeseburger. I get a cheeseburger.
Penny,"Fine, cheeseburger."
Sheldon,Maybe Iêd be better off with Nancy.
Penny,"So, what do you think? I mean, this could be a business, right?"
Sheldon,How many of these can you make a day?
Penny,About twenty.
Sheldon,And how much profit do you make per Penny Blossom?
Penny,"I donêt know, like, 50 cents. Iêm not sure."
Sheldon,"No, Of course youêre not. All right, ten dollars a day times five days a week times 52 weeks a year is two thousand six hundred dollars."
Penny,Thatês all?
Sheldon,Before taxes.
Penny,"Well, I donêt have to pay taxes on this stuff."
Sheldon,"I believe the Internal Revenue Service would strongly disagree. But, if you took advantage of modern marketing techniques, and you optimized your manufacturing process, you might be able to make this a viable business."
Penny,And you know about that stuff?
Sheldon,"Penny, Iêm a physicist. I have a working knowledge of the entire universe and everything it contains."
Penny,Whoês Radiohead?
Sheldon,I have a working knowledge of the important things in the universe. Good luck.
Penny,"Sheldon, hold on. Could you maybe show me how to make more money with this?"
Sheldon,Of course I could.
Penny,"Sheldon, wait! Will you?"
Sheldon,"Just to be clear here, youêre asking for my assistance."
Sheldon,And you understand that will involve me telling you what to do?
Penny,I understand.
Sheldon,And youêre not allowed to be sarcastic or snide to me while Iêm doing so.
Sheldon,Good. Letês begin with the premise that everything youêve done up to this point is wrong.
Penny,"Oh, imagine that."
Sheldon,Sarcasm. Good-bye.
Penny,"No, sorry. Wait! Please come back!"
Penny,There. Done.
Sheldon,All right. 12 minutes and 17 seconds.
Penny,"Pretty good, right?"
Sheldon,"Thatês 4.9 Penny Blossoms per hour. Based on your cost of materials and your wholesale selling price, youêll effectively be paying yourselfÑ $5.19 a day."
Penny,A day?
Sheldon,There are children in a sneaker factory in Indonesia who outearn you.
Penny,That just canêt be right.
Sheldon,Youêre questioning my math?
Penny,"No, sorry."
Sheldon,Want me to show my work?
Penny,"Oh, God, no, no. Just please tell me what to do about it."
Sheldon,"All right, are you familiar with the development that resulted from Honor_ Blancês 1778 use of interchangeable parts? The assembly line, of course."
Penny,"Okay, you know what, if Iêm not allowed to be snide, youêre not allowed to be condescending."
Sheldon,"That wasnêt a part of our original agreement, and I do not agree to it now."
Penny,"All right, fine. How are we supposed to set up machines and conveyor belts in my apartment?"
Sheldon,"Youêre thinking of the moving assembly line, an understandable but not excusable mistake. The moving assembly line, that was introduced by Henry Ford in 1908. That innovation is what made possible our modern consumer culture by enabling a low-unit cost for manufactured goods. I guess that isnêt one of the topics discussed on your Radiohead."
Leonard,Letês go. Weêre going to miss the coming attractions.
Raj,Whatês the matter?
Howard,I think I bruised a testicle capturing that last pawn.
Leonard,"W-W-Wait, whatês going on?"
Sheldon,I assume youêre referring to the sea shanty. Itês a rhythmic work song designed to increase productivity.
Penny,"Yeah, itês crazy, but it totally works. Look, we made this Penny Blossom in under three minutes."
Leonard,"Terrific, but that kind of raises more questions than it answers."
Sheldon,"Pennyês making hair accessories. Iêm helping her optimize her manufacturing process. All right, breakês over. "
Howard,Hold on. What are you using as a bonding agent?
Sheldon,Hot glue.
Howard,Youêre kidding. Any of the cyanoacrylates would do a better job.
Sheldon,"It wonêt work, the flowerês too porous."
Leonard,What if we infused the bottom layer with silicone-RTV to provide a better mounting surface?
Howard,"Good question, what are you marketing and distribution channels?"
Penny,"Well, there are the waitresses at my work, and this cute, little shop in Old Town."
Sheldon,"Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush, virtually non-existent. Iêm thinking that we set her up with a hosted turnkey e-commerce system to start."
Howard,Why not eliminate the middle man? We could install a small server farm with a static IP in her bedroom.
Leonard,Sheêd need some kind of industrial cooling system.
Sheldon,"Of course, but before we set up a marketing and distribution infrastructure, we should finish optimizing the manufacturing process. To start with, she has a terrible problem with moisture-induced glitter clump."
Penny,"Yeah, itês a bitch."
Howard,"Uh, Iêve seen this before."
Howard,"Itês a common stripper problem. They dance, they sweat, they clump."
Leonard,Are you thinking about adding a desiccant like calcium sulphate?
Howard,"Actually, Iêm thinking about this one stripper named Vega. But sure, calcium sulphate could work."
Sheldon,Letês think out of the box for a moment. How about a molecular sieve?
Penny,Iêve got a spaghetti strainer in the kitchen.
Leonard,"Hey, we could liberate some micro-porous charcoal from the chem lab."
Sheldon,"Oh, great. Raj, why donêt you and Howard go get the charcoal? Leonard, why donêt you start working on some preliminary Web site designs. Iêll make some space in our apartment so we can move the manufacturing process."
Penny,"Well, whatês wrong with my apartment?"
Sheldon,Itês not my apartment.
Penny,"Wait, wait, what am I going to do?"
Leonard,"Uh, hey, itês your business. Do whatever you want."
Penny,"Oh, okay, cool. Iêm going to take a nap."
Leonard,"Iêm still tweaking things a little bit, but this will give you the general idea of the Web site. So, what do you guys think?"
Howard,"Uh, pretty much any way I say that is going to hurt his feelings."
Leonard,"Okay, whatês wrong with it?"
Sheldon,_ Whatês wrong with it?
Leonard,Not you. I wasnêt asking you. Penny?
Penny,"Uh, well, itês a little juvenile. I mean, it kind of looks like the MySpace page of a 13-year-old girl."
Leonard,"No, it doesnêt."
Howard,Please. Dateline could use it to attract predators.
Sheldon,"Penny, this is your enterprise, so itês ultimately your decision, but based on the quality of his work, Iêd strongly recommend that we let Leonard go."
Leonard,You want to fire me?
Sheldon,What I want is irrelevant. This is Pennyês decision. Penny?
Leonard,"Excuse me, but if I did such a bad job then why do we already have orders?"
Penny,We do?
Leonard,"Uh-huh. Look. Mrs. Fiona Fondell from Huntsville, Alabama has ordered two."
Penny,No kidding. Two?
Leonard,Uh-huh. Look at the comments.
Penny,"Thank you, Penny Blossoms. These will be perfect to cover my bald spot. Aww, that is so sweet."
Sheldon,Camouflaging bald spots. Thatês primarily a male concern. Perhaps we could expand our market.
Penny,How are flower barrettes going to appeal to men?
Howard,We add Bluetooth!
Sheldon,Brilliant. Men love Bluetooth.
Penny,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, you want to make a hair barrette with Bluetooth?"
Sheldon,"Penny, everything is better with Bluetooth."
Leonard,Holy crap. Someone just ordered a thousand Penny Blossoms.
Penny,Get out! Who needs a thousand sparkly flower barrettes with rhinestones?
Leonard,"The Fifth Annual East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance Luau."
Sheldon,"Oh, another market to expand into, balding gay men."
Howard,And Iêll bet lesbians love Bluetooth.
Sheldon,We should get to work.
Penny,"Wait, wait, wait, why does it say one-day rush? Since when do we offer a one-day rush?"
Leonard,Amazon offers one-day rush.
Penny,"Yeah, but they donêt have to glue the books together. How the hell are we going to make a thousand Penny Blossoms in one day?"
Leonard,Donêt yell at me. Iêm not manufacturing. Iêm just Web design.
Penny,"Okay, well, Iêm gonna have to call them and cancel the order."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, but was this not your goal? Financial independence through entrepreneurial brilliance and innovation? My brilliance and innovation, of course, but still."
Penny,I just donêt see how see can pull this off.
Sheldon,"Okay, that, right there, that equivocation and self-doubt, that is not the American spirit. Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo? Did Jim Bowie?"
Howard,"They didnêt quit. They were massacred by, like, a gazillion angry Mexicans."
Sheldon,"Alright, let me put it this way. Your gross receipts on this one order will be over $3,000 for one nightês work."
Penny,You guys get started.
Leonard,What are you doing?
Penny,Going online to buy shoes!
Raj,"You know, if I wanted to spend my Saturday nights doing this, I could have stayed in India."
Howard,"Oh, stop with the fake third world crap. Your fatherês a gynaecologist, and you had a house full of servants."
Raj,We only had four servants. And two of them were children.
Leonard,How are we doing?
Raj,We have 128 assorted Penny Blossoms ready to ship.
Howard,"Oh, God, weêre never gonna finish in time. Who made Sheldon the boss anyway?"
Sheldon,I believe Iêm hearing some negativity on the factory floor.
Sheldon,"Penny, the labour force is a living organism that must be carefully nurtured. Any counterproductive grumbling must be skilfully headed off by management. Observe. Hey! Less talk, more work!"
Penny,Nicely done.
Sheldon,"Thank you. You hear any union talk, you let me know."
Leonard,Someoneês in the kitchen with DinahÑ
Howard,Someoneês in the kitchen I know-ow-ow-ow
Sheldon,‚Cause I sold my soul to the company store.
Penny,"Honey, do you want some coffee?"
Sheldon,"No, I donêt drink coffee."
Penny,"Come on, but if you donêt stay awake weêll never finish in time."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, coffeeês out of the question. When I moved to California, I promised my mother that I wouldnêt start doing drugs."
Penny,"Leonard, help."
Leonard,"Sheldon, we still have 380 of these things to make."
Sheldon,I have complete faith that you will make them. Good night.
Leonard,"Yeah, no. But, Sheldon, without your insight and leadership this entire enterprise will surely fail."
Sheldon,"Youêre right, of course."
Penny,"Here, this will help."
Sheldon,"Very well, but if this leads to opiates or hallucinogenics, youêre going to have to answer to my mother."
Sheldon,"Look at Planckês Constant. People say itês arbitrary. It could not be less arbitrary. If it varied even slightly, life as we know it would not exist. Bam! Now, now, letês reconsider the entire argument, but with entropy reversed and effect preceding cause, so you are thinking of a universe thatês not expanding from the centre, no, it is retreating from a, from a possibility space. Bam! This is a space where we are all essentially Alice through the looking glass, standing in front the Red Queen, and weêre being offered a cracker to quench our thirst. Bam! Of course, in another universe, letês call it universe prime, thereês another Sheldon, letês call him Sheldon primeÑ"
Penny,We should have let him go to bed.
Leonard,I canêt believe we actually did it.
Howard,"1,000 frigginê Penny Blossoms."
Penny,"I just want you guys to know I am really grateful for your help, and for every dollar I make, Iêm going to give you 20 cents."
Howard,Thatês your entire profit margin.
Penny,Oh. Then never mind.
Leonard,Iêll print out the shipping label. Uh-oh.
Leonard,"We got an e-mail from the East Rutherford, New Jersey, Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Alliance. They want another thousand Penny Blossoms."
Leonard,One-day rush. I really need to take that off the Web site.
Penny,"Okay, well. Guess weêd better get started."
Howard,You canêt be serious.
Penny,Come on. What about the living organism of the workforce and the American spirit and Jiminy Crockett at the Alamo?
Leonard,Davy Crockett. Jiminy Crockett was a cricket.
Penny,"Yes, yes, I know that, okay? Iêm tired, Iêve had like 18 cups of coffee. The point is, if we all just pull together, we can do this. Whoês with me?"
Howard,"Penny, although you may find it hard to believe, we do have lives."
Leonard,"Sorry. My apologies to the gay community of East Rutherford, New Jersey."
Sheldon,"Zoom, zoom, zoom! Whereês the coffee?"
Penny,Weêre all out.
Sheldon,"No problem. Iêll be back before this banana hits the ground. Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom! Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom!"
Howard,"Sorry, guys, but Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Lunch is just stupid."
Penny,"Okay, itês done. Look, guys, for the future, I donêt mind killing the big spiders, but you have to at least try with the little ones."
Sheldon,"Penny, please, weêre facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids."
Leonard,"Sheldon, itês not that bad."
Sheldon,"Not bad? Itês horrible. I mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing, but you never think itêll happen to you."
Leonard,"So they steamed your dumplings, get over it. New topic, please."
Howard,"All right, Penny, let me take this opportunity to point out that you are looking particularly ravishing today."
Penny,"Not with a thousand condoms, Howard."
Howard,"So, there is a number."
Penny,"Okay, new topic, please. Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5A are moving out?"
Penny,The people upstairs are moving out.
Sheldon,The horror!
Leonard,Why would you just say something like that?
Sheldon,"No, no, no, no, no, no, noÑ"
Penny,How else was I supposed to say it?
Leonard,"Slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. You donêt just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while."
Sheldon,The horror!
Penny,"Sheldon, Iêm sure itês going to be fine."
Sheldon,"No, itês not going to be fine, change is never fine. They say it is, but itês not."
Penny,"Okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?"
Sheldon,"I never met them. Thatês what made them perfect, there were no awkward hellos in the halls, there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors, they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell."
Penny,"Well, Iêm sure the new people will be just as quiet."
Sheldon,You canêt know that. How can you possibly know that?
Penny,"Youêre right, I canêt. You know what? Anyone could rent that apartment now, an opera singer, the cast of stomp, yeah, a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg."
Leonard,Why are you making it worse?
Penny,"I tried making it better, he wouldnêt go for it."
Howard,"Youêre right, thatês a great idea."
Howard,"Iêll take the apartment upstairs. I can finally get away from my mother, and we can all spend some more time together, if you catch my drift."
Penny,The horror!
Sheldon,"Hold on. You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping Wolowitz move, and then he only need buy us a pizza?"
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, that really is how it works."
Sheldon,"Youêre tricking me. You tell me the truth, what do we get?"
Leonard,"Raj, help me out here."
Raj,You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.
Sheldon,"I knew it! PS3, definitely  PS3, who would pick a mountain bike?"
Howard,"Enough with the guilt, ma, weêll still see each other. Iêll come over every night and have dinner with you."
Howard,"Okay, I get it, youêre angry. You donêt want to see your little bird leave the nest."
Howard,"Fine, Iêll stay! You happy, crazy lady? I sure as hell hope so, because youêre ruining my life!"
Leonard,"Hey, Penny, itês Leonard. Good news, you can take your head out of the oven."
Sheldon,I guess I wonêt be needing this.
Sheldon,"Oh, no, the new ones, theyêre here."
Leonard,"Stay calm, we donêt know anything about them yet. What are you doing?"
Sheldon,Iêm checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like castanets to you?
Leonard,The box says kitchen.
Sheldon,So? Do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box?
Leonard,"That is so great. Oh, Iêm Leonard, I live downstairs. Upstairs from here, but under you. Not under you per se, but under your apartment."
Leonard,"Yeah, it is."
Sheldon,"If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate, hello."
Sheldon,Hello. On a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline?
Sheldon,Is that your answer or do you not understand the question? Weêll come back to that one.
Sheldon,"Hang on. Are you now or have you ever been a salsa, Irish folk or break-dancer?"
Leonard,Youêre making her uncomfortable.
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm sorry. Well, if it helps you feel any better youêre doing very well so far. Next question, are you fertile?"
Sheldon,Iêm trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.
Sheldon,"If that changes, let me know. And finally, area rugs, pro or con?"
Sheldon,Welcome to the building.
Leonard,Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.
Penny,"Oh, hey, guys."
Leonard,"Hey, Penny. this is Alicia, our new neighbour."
Leonard,Iêm helping.
Penny,I can see.
Sheldon,"Aliciaês non-musical, childless and pro-rug. Sheês still on probation, of course, but I like her."
Penny,"Oh, yeah, I donêt usually dress like this. Iêm going jogging."
Sheldon,You donêt jog.
Penny,I can start.
Sheldon,"True, but the more likely explanation for your attire is that youêre out of clean clothes again."
Penny,"Thank you, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Youêre welcome, Penny."
Leonard,I think you look fantastic.
Penny,"Oh, yeah, be careful."
Penny,"See ya. Iêm dressed like a slob today, too."
Sheldon,"Oh, mimicry. I enjoy mimicry. Iêve been working on Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi. _Itês a trap.î You have to imagine me with a giant squid head. _Itês a trap. Itês a trap. Itês a trap.î"
Sheldon,"Congratulations, I see you did your laundry."
Penny,"Well, sort of."
Sheldon,How does one sort ofÑ
Penny,"I bought new clothes, okay? Is Leonard around?"
Sheldon,Heês upstairs at Aliciaês.
Penny,"Oh. all right, thatês cool, no biggie. He said heêd help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait. What exactly is he doing up there?"
Sheldon,"In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me, he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo."
Penny,"Oh, theyêre all up there, huh? Hmm, typical."
Sheldon,"Itês axiomatically atypical. Up until recently, they did not know Alicia, and had no encounters with her in a previous location. They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants, so your characterization of their behaviour as typical Is demonstrably fallacious."
Penny,"Okay, now I see the giant squid head. "
Sheldon,"Oh, great! now, I have to start all over again. "
Howard,"Yeah, I thought about renting this apartment, but Iêm really more of a downtown loft kind of guy."
Howard,"Oh, actually Iêm, uh, living with a woman in Altadena. Purely platonic, sheês also my maid."
Howard,"I wonêt lie, itês pretty dope."
Penny,"Hey, I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift."
Penny,"Oh, this? Iêm dressed like a slob today."
Howard,"Oh, pish-posh.  Shucks means shucks. Let one go once in a while."
Leonard,"Hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?"
Leonard,"Alicia is an actress, just like you."
Penny,That is so awesome.
Penny,"Yeah, I know, tell me about it."
Penny,"Thatês why I work at the Cheesecake Factory, Iêm holding out for the right part."
Leonard,"Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?"
Leonard,"Well, DTS has more low end, soÑ okay."
Penny,"Uh, hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this, I read the best science joke on the internet. Alicia, you wonêt get it, but itês right up their alley. Anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlour every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself, and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what heês doing. The man says, _well, Iêm a physicist, and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.î The owner then says, _well, lots of single, beautiful women come in here every day, why donêt you buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you?î And the physicist says, _yeah, but what are the odds of that happening?î"
Leonard,"Itês a little insulting, donêt you think?"
Penny,How would I know? Iêm not even sure I get it.
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, Iêd love to."
Penny,"Uh, hey, maybe when youêre done with her printer, you could set up mine. You know, like you promised a week ago."
Leonard,"Yeah, Iêll get to it, donêt nag me."
Raj,Hello there
Sheldon,"Who is it? Oh hello, Penny, itês open, come in. Sarcasm."
Penny,"Well, theyêre all still up there."
Sheldon,"You think I canêt hear them? Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp. Thatês Wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one."
Penny,"I donêt even know why I care. I donêt care. All right, I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke, but thatês all I care."
Sheldon,"You know, Penny, thereês something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. When this happens, the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains."
Penny,"What are you saying, that Iêm threatened by Alicia? That Iêm like the old queen of the hive and itês just time for me to go?"
Sheldon,Iêm just talking about bees. Theyêre on the discovery channel. What are you talking about?
Penny,Bees. Aaah! I just got that physicist joke.
Leonard,"Gee, Penny, thanks for buying us dinner."
Howard,"Yeah, whatês the occasion?"
Penny,"No, no occasion, just felt like getting some Chinese chow for my peeps."
Sheldon,"Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?"
Sheldon,Even though the menu description specifies shredded?
Sheldon,"Brown rice, not white?"
Sheldon,You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?
Sheldon,Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?
Sheldon,"Good. See how itês done, Leonard?"
Penny,"So, what do we got going on tonight, huh? Playing Halo watching Battlestar, drop some mentos in diet coke?"
Leonard,You want to watch Battlestar?
Penny,"What can I say? I got my geek on, boys."
Leonard,Whatês wrong?
Leonard,"Oh, Iêd watch that."
Leonard,"Okay, well, Iêll take you."
Howard,Iêll run lines with you in the car.
Penny,"Oh, actually, thatês okay. we already haveÑ"
Howard,Yum. Starving.
Penny,Ñchinese food right here.
Sheldon,"Theyêre gone, Penny. They canêt hear you."
Penny,"I cannot believe theyêre letting her just use them like that. I mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week, she had Howard drive all the way to her uncleês house in Orange County to pick up her TV?"
Sheldon,You once had Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.
Penny,"Apples and oranges here, Sheldon. Iêm telling you, that girl is a user, iceskating through the life on her looks, taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows. It creams my corn."
Sheldon,May I interject something here?
Sheldon,You got the wrong mustard.
Penny,Oh boy.
Penny,"Uh, no. No, no, no, you know, congratulations, I think youêll make a great hooker."
Penny,"Um, I donêt know, I donêt think a lot."
Penny,"Um, hey, hey, can I talk to you about that for a second?"
Penny,"Well, you know, itês just that Leonard and Howard and Raj, they arenêt like other guys. Theyêre special."
Penny,"Oh, letês see, how can I explain this, um, they donêt know how to use their shields."
Penny,"Yeah, you know, like in Star Trek, when youêre in battle and you raise the shields? Where the hell did that come from? Anyways, um, you know how guys like this are, so, please donêt take advantage of them."
Penny,"Come on, theyêre doing everything for you, because youêre leading them on."
Penny,Excuse me?
Penny,"Okay, lady, you are way out of line."
Penny,"Yeah, youêre out of line."
Raj,"I like green lantern, Iêm just saying itês pretty lame that He can be defeated by the colour yellow."
Sheldon,Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.
Leonard,Golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.
Raj,"Great, so I can take them both out with a number-two pencil?"
Howard,"Oh, my God! Girl fight! "
Leonard,What are you doing?
Howard,I know you. youêre stupid enough to break it up.
Howard,May I say you look very comely tonight?
Penny,Thank you.
Howard,"Youêre right, this fillyês been broken."
Sheldon,"You set it on DTS, didnêt you?"
Leonard,"I had to, she called me cutie."
Howard,"According to Aliciaês facebook page, sheês hooking up with one of the producers on CSI."
Penny,"Well, dead whore on TV, live one in real life."
Sheldon,"Oh, great now sheês jumping up and down on the bed."
Sheldon,Hu-u-u-uhÑ. Hu-u-u-uh!
Sheldon,This is Thai food.
Howard,Here we go.
Sheldon,We donêt have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.
Leonard,"Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday."
Sheldon,"Well apparently the news didnêt reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday."
Howard,"Come on, the whole idea behind Anything Can Happen Thursday is to get out of this rut weêve been in lately."
Sheldon,"Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if weêre going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Letês call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra."
Raj,I could go for some goat.
Leonard,"Sheldon, we agreed weêd do something different tonight."
Sheldon,All right. Letês go to the comic book store.
Raj,We went to the comic book store last night.
Sheldon,"Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic book night. Tonight, weêll be going on Thursday, because itês Anything Can Happen Thursday."
Leonard,"Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon."
Raj,So what are we going to do tonight?
Howard,"If I may proffer a suggestion, in bars all across this great nation of ours, Thursday night is Ladiesê Night. Which means, as the evening progresses, we will get better looking courtesy of 99 cent margaritas and two-for-one Jell-O shots."
Leonard,"Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero."
Howard,Really? Are you familiar with the Drake Equation?
Sheldon,"The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?"
Howard,"Yeah, that one. You can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in Los Angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive, and what I call the Wolowitz Coefficient."
Raj,The Wolowitz Coefficient?
Howard,"Neediness times dress size squared. Crunching the numbers, I come up with a conservative 5,812 potential sex partners within a 40-mile radius."
Leonard,Youêre joking.
Howard,"Iêm a horny engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math or sex."
Raj,"Well, what are we waiting for? Letês bounce, bitches."
Leonard,"Youêre right. Itês Anything Can Happen Thursday, letês hit the clubs and meet hot women!"
Raj,Here we go. Lock up your daughters! Weêre going to hit it and quit it.
Leonard,Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.
Raj,Also a good plan.
Howard,"Alright, but next Anything Can Happen Thursday, weêre definitely going to a bar."
Leonard,"Oh, absolutely."
Raj,"You heard that, Ladiesê Night ladies? Weêre eventually coming for you!"
Penny,"Oh hey, guys, whereêre you headed?"
Sheldon,"To the comic book store. Youêre probably thinking, the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, Iêve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday."
Penny,"You got me. While youêre there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephewês birthday?"
Sheldon,I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.
Penny,"Leonard, could you pick me up a few comics for my nephewês birthday?"
Leonard,Sure. What does he like?
Penny,"I donêt know, heês 13. Just pick out anything."
Sheldon,"Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows."
Penny,Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.
Sheldon,"Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099?"
Leonard,"You know this can go on all night, why donêt you just come with us?"
Penny,"Ugh, thatês what I was trying to avoid."
Sheldon,"Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man."
Penny,"Oh, what a cute, little store. Everybodyês staring at me."
Leonard,"Donêt worry, theyêre more scared of you than you are of them."
Penny,"Unlikely. Here, what about this one for my nephew?"
Sheldon,A superb choice.
Penny,"Oh, great."
Sheldon,"Yeah, provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC multiverse."
Penny,Whatês a multiverse?
Sheldon,Get her out of here.
Leonard,"Come on, Iêll help you pick something."
Raj,Thatês right. Sheês with us. Guys like that are so pathetic.
Howard,"Tell me about it. Look, a new Batman belt buckle."
Leonard,"Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny. Sheês looking for some comic books."
Leonard,"I think weêre fine, Stuart."
Penny,Thanks. He seems like a nice guy.
Leonard,You mean for someone whoês into comic books?
Penny,"No, no, no, I just meant forÑ yeah."
Leonard,"Penny, just because people appreciate comic books doesnêt make them weirdos. Stuartês a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design."
Penny,What about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?
Leonard,"Ah, yeah, thatês Captain Sweatpants. He doesnêt really help the point Iêm trying to make."
Howard,"Let it go, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Why should I let it go? I saw it first.
Howard,"Yes, but I saw it from the front."
Sheldon,A far less impressive feat.
Howard,"Oh, come on! I need this for my Batman collection."
Sheldon,I need it for my Robin collection.
Sheldon,Why would I gamble? Itês mine. Let go.
Howard,You let go.
Sheldon,"No, you!"
Sheldon,"Yes, he wonêt let go of my comic book."
Howard,Itês my comic book!
Sheldon,"Leonard, we need a ruling."
Leonard,"Uh, cut it in half?"
Penny,Excuse me.
Penny,Hi. What would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?
Penny,"Oh, Hellblazer. Whatês this about?"
Penny,"Well, if that doesnêt make me the favourite aunt, I donêt know what will. Is this me?"
Penny,Itês really good.
Penny,"Thatês so sweet, but what if I didnêt like it?"
Leonard,I donêt believe it. Stuartês putting the moves on Penny.
Howard,I have got to learn how to draw. Hey!
Sheldon,"Once again, defeated by your own prurient interests."
Raj,"Guys, have you seen Stuart all up in Pennyês business over there?"
Leonard,"Nobodyês up in anybodyês business, letês just buy our stuff and go."
Penny,"Okay, youêve got my number, now, give me the picture."
Penny,"All right. So, um, just give me a call."
Sheldon,"So, Leonard, how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?"
Sheldon,"Look at that, thatês a dent. Thank you, Howard Ham-Fisted Wolowitz. Did you just shut the TV off in the middle of the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode?"
Leonard,Apparently so.
Sheldon,Are you ill?
Sheldon,All right. Then is it fair to say that youêre experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?
Leonard,When did you pick up on that?
Sheldon,"A moment ago, when you turned off the TV in the middle of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?"
Leonard,"Sure, why not?"
Sheldon,"Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section."
Leonard,"Gee, thanks a lot."
Sheldon,Would you rather I offer my personal insight?
Leonard,I donêt need any insights. I just want to know why Pennyês more interested in Stuart than me. Weêre practically the same guy.
Sheldon,"Oh, I disagree. Stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books."
Leonard,"Youêre right, I really should be asking strangers on the Internet."
Sheldon,My original point.
Sheldon,"Chinese food, vintage video games. After the nightmare of Anything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way it was meant to be."
Howard,Whoês up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?
Penny,"Oh, hey guys."
Leonard,"Hey, PennyÑ and Stuart, hey Stuart."
Howard,So what are you kids up to?
Penny,"Uh, Stuart has a piece in an art show thatês opening tonight."
Leonard,"And you guys are going together, greatÑ"
Penny,"Itês Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage video games, right?"
Sheldon,"Vintage doesnêt even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, Zork. Itês the buggy beta version."
Penny,"Wow, Zork. Well, you guys have fun."
Howard,"See you, Stuart."
Leonard,"Hey, Howard?"
Leonard,Take me to a bar with women.
Howard,Okay! Let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.
Howard,"Well, if I get lucky, I donêt want to be caught in my Aquaman briefs."
Raj,"May I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?"
Howard,"No, he may not."
Howard,Iêm not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.
Raj,Fine. Iêll have a chocolate martini.
Howard,Wrong again!
Raj,"Come on, you know I canêt talk to women unless Iêm lit up like the Hindu festival of Diwali."
Howard,"Look, there are plenty of bars in Los Angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldnêt have to because there are no women in them."
Raj,Gotcha. Iêll have a Brandy Alexander.
Howard,"All right, the Three Musketeers just became the Dynamic Duo."
Leonard,Should we talk to some of these women?
Howard,"Itês way too early in the night for that. See, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame."
Leonard,Thatês your system?
Howard,"Thatês my system. Oh, and if you spot a chick with a Seeing Eye dog, sheês mine."
Penny,Oh come on. I think itês nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening.
Penny,"Um, you know, itês kind of early. Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?"
Penny,"Oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. Come on, I think I have decaf."
Sheldon,"Oh, good, Stuart, I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?"
Penny,"Sheldon, weêre a little busy here, soÑ"
Sheldon,What are you doing?
Sheldon,Isnêt it a little late for coffee?
Penny,Iêll just go look for it.
Sheldon,"Well, Iêve spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom, and I need your help."
Sheldon,"I am asserting, in the event that Batmanês death proves permanent, that original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl."
Sheldon,More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.
Sheldon,Has to be? Has to be? I hope youêre being deliberately provocative.
Penny,I found the decaf!
Sheldon,"Yeah, herbal tea for me, please."
Raj,Barkeep! Alexander me.
Leonard,How about those two?
Howard,"Nah, theyêre eating peanuts, and my allergies, one kiss would put me in Cedar-Sinai for a week."
Leonard,What about the ones in the corner?
Howard,"Possible, very possible. Do you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking?"
Leonard,I think Blinkyês cute.
Howard,"You got it, sir."
Leonard,"Wait, so we just go over there?"
Howard,"No, we have a little prep work to do. Put this in your mouth. We walk past them, you stumble a bit. I say, sorry, my friendês had a little too much, and then I start to pull it out of your mouth and say, a little too much fun. Get it? I mean, theyêre laughing, weêre laughing, and then we get them up to about a .15 blood alcohol level, and tell them weêre millionaires."
Leonard,What else you got?
Howard,Depends. Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?
Howard,"I canêt sit on your lap, you donêt know the routine."
Sheldon,Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batmanês parents effectively deprived him of his raison dêêtre.
Sheldon,Au contraire.
Sheldon,I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.
Sheldon,"So, I win."
Sheldon,"So, I win."
Sheldon,"Darn tootinê, I win."
Sheldon,"No, no, no, no, donêt wake her. Sheêll maul you like a rabid wolverine."
Howard,"Wait, is this your card or isnêt it? Trust me, this was their card."
Leonard,I thought you were good at this. Youêre always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.
Howard,"I do, all the time."
Leonard,"Well, what happened? Weêve been sitting here all night and the longest conversation youêve had with a woman was when your mom called."
Howard,"Wow, youêre just going to make me come out and say it, arenêt you?"
Leonard,Say what?
Howard,Youêre weighing me down. Iêm a falcon who hunts better solo.
Leonard,Fine. Iêll sit here. You take flight and hunt.
Howard,"Donêt be ridiculous, you canêt just tell a falcon when to hunt."
Leonard,"Actually, you can. Thereês a whole sport built around it. Falconry."
Howard,"Shut up. Letês just get Koothrappali and go.  Hello. I am Sanjay Wolowitz from Bombay. Okay, Iêm stumped."
Howard,"Okay, are you from Star Wars universe?"
Howard,Were you in the original trilogy?
Howard,Is there a picture of you in my wallet wearing a metal bikini?
Leonard,"God, I hope not. And no, Iêm not Princess Leia."
Raj,"Oh, okay, okay, my turn. Are you in the six Star Wars movies?"
Raj,Interesting. Are you a Droid?
Raj,Do you kind of look like a shiny Sheldon?
Leonard,You got it.
Sheldon,"Thatês preposterous. I do not resemble C3PO. Donêt get me wrong, Iêm flattered, I just donêt see it."
Howard,"Leslie Winkle. Youêve reached friends with benefits. For a booty call, press one now."
Sheldon,"What exactly does that expression mean, friends with benefits? Does he provide her with health insurance?"
Leonard,"Look, imagine you maintained a friendship with someone you had sex with, but you were free to date whoever you wanted."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, I canêt imagine any of that."
Leonard,"Alright, back to the game."
Sheldon,"I believe itês my turn, you may begin your questions whenever youêre ready."
Raj,Are you Spock?
Sheldon,I donêt like this game.
Howard,"So, where were we?"
Raj,Arenêt you leaving for your booty call?
Howard,"No, it was something else. Why does everything have to be about sex with you? Come on. Whoês turn is it?"
Leonard,We were up to you.
Howard,"Great, just start."
Leonard,"Okay, letês see. Are you from a TV series?"
Howard,She dumped me!
Sheldon,"I bet heês someone from Babylon 5, weêre never going to guess."
Raj,"What happened with Leslie, why did she dump you?"
Howard,"I donêt know. She just said Howard, mommaês a rolling stone. And then her call waiting beeped and she was gone."
Sheldon,I donêt understand. If you were in a non-emotional relationship then why are you having  what appears be an emotional response?
Leonard,"Sheldon, he obviously had feelings for her."
Howard,"Of course I had feelings for her, I saw her naked for Godês sake!"
Leonard,"Okay, uh look, you just need to get your mind off it. Do you want to go to the comic book store? Maybe go see a movie?"
Howard,I donêt want to go anywhere.
Sheldon,"You know, Iêm given to understand that there is an entire city in Nevada designed specifically to help people like Howard forget their problems. Where  you can replace them with new problems such as alcoholism, gambling addiction and sexually transmitted diseases."
Raj,"Is it me, or was that Sheldonês way of saying Vegas baby!"
Leonard,"Iêve never been there, have you?"
Raj,Me? I just got Vegas baby from Vince Vaughn in Swingers. .
Howard,"It could be fun. I know my weekendês wide open, now thatÑ"
Leonard,"Okay, then letês do this, lets go to Las Vegas."
Howard,Now? Right now?
Leonard,"Why not? People do things right now all the time. Why canêt we be right now people too. Go home, pack a bag and weêll be right now people. I have to stop at the drug store to refill a prescription, but after that weêll go right now."
Raj,"What do you say, Howard?"
Howard,I say Vegas baby!
Raj,What are you going to tell your mother?
Howard,"Sea World, baby!"
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, are you coming?"
Sheldon,Iêd rather have a blowfly lay eggs and hatch larvae in my auditory canal.
Leonard,"Great, weêll bring you back a tee-shirt."
Sheldon,"Thank you. Hello, neighbour."
Penny,"Hello, Sheldon."
Sheldon,And how are you doing this fine evening?
Sheldon,Good. Iêm glad.
Penny,Really? Are you drunk?
Sheldon,"Iêm just in a good mood. While my compatriots are in Las Vegas, I will be enjoying a blissful evening in my personal Fortress of Solitude."
Penny,"Thatês Supermanês big ice thing, right?"
Sheldon,"Do you know, Iêm such a good mood, Iêm actually finding your tenuous grasp of the English language folksy and charming today."
Penny,"Mmm, what smells so good?"
Sheldon,"That is the intoxicating aroma of Kadhai Paneer, a perfect culinary representation of the freedom this evening holds. Not only is it Indian cuisine, which Koothrappali loathes, it contains a generous helping of peanuts, which would reduce Wolowitz to a wheezing 97 pound blister. And finally, itês main ingredient is Paneer, a farmerês cheese which would cause Leonard to render any room uninhabitable within minutes."
Penny,"Yum. Well, enjoy your big evening."
Sheldon,"Penny. I realize you are also on your own tonight, so if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do, please do not disturb me."
Penny,"Have fun, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Oh, I shall.  No!"
Penny,"Whatês wrong, Superman? Locked out of your big ice thingy?"
Raj,"Look at this, mouthwash, lotion, body wash, shampoo and conditioner together in one tiny bottle. I love Las Vegas."
Leonard,"Howard, could I borrow some after shave?"
Howard,"Black case, top compartment."
Leonard,That is a lot of cologne.
Howard,"First row are your musks, second is wood, leathers and botanicals, third is assorted pheromones, tread lightly."
Raj,"Thatês the spirit, Howard. Yes, we can."
Leonard,"Come on, letês go."
Howard,"You guys go ahead, I just have to finish up an email."
Leonard,"Thatês not an email, thatês Leslieês facebook page."
Howard,"Okay, fine, Iêm checking her facebook page, look at her status update, sheês saying she dumped me, people need to know I dumped her."
Raj,But she did dump you.
Howard,"Grow up, Raj,thereês no place for truth on the internet. Just go, Iêll catch up with you."
Raj,"Oh, we should have a plan in case one of us gets lucky."
Leonard,"Okay, uh, if I get lucky Iêll take her to my stately manor outside Gotham City, and if you get lucky, Iêll sleep on the moon."
Raj,Sounds like a plan.
Penny,"Hang on, I think the emergency key is around here somewhere."
Sheldon,We have a bowl. Our keys go in a bowl. You should get a bowl.
Penny,"So, how did the beautiful mind of Sheldon Cooper forget his key in the first place."
Sheldon,I left them in the bowl.
Penny,Oh-oh. I just remembered where the emergency key is.
Penny,In your apartment.
Sheldon,Whatês it doing in my apartment?
Penny,"Well, I went in there a few weeks ago when you guys werenêt home, and I forgot it there."
Sheldon,You were in myÑ why would youÑ what are you saying?
Penny,"Itês not a big deal, I was making coffee and I ran out of milk."
Sheldon,Youêre the milk thief! Leonard said I was crazy but I knew that carton felt lighter.
Penny,"Alright, Sheldon, letês just calm down and weêll call the building manager, heêll come open your door, you just eat your dinner here while youêre waiting."
Sheldon,Eat? My dinner? In your apartment?
Penny,"Yeah, why not?"
Sheldon,"Sure, why not? And after the sunês down we can all pile in my pick-up and go skinny-dipping down at the creek. ‚Cause todayês the day to stop making sense."
Raj,"Iêm telling you, Leonard, video slot machines, free drinks brought to us by a bosomy barmaid and all you can eat shrimp for $3.95. Disneyland can suck it. This is the real happiest place on earth."
Leonard,"Dude, check it out. Thatês laundry for a month!"
Raj,Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali.
Raj,"Hello, Michaela."
Raj,"Why, yes, I love to party. Party is my middle name. Or it would be, if it werenêt Ramayan."
Leonard,"Uh, Raj, can I, can I talk to you for a moment."
Raj,"Not now, Leonard, Michaelaês inviting me to a party. You better call the moon and you make sure that they have a bed for you."
Leonard,"Yeah, I really need to talk to you."
Raj,"Excuse me, Iêll be right back. Donêt go anywhere. Donêt move. Just stay the beautiful unspoiled American flower that you are.  Whatês wrong with you dude, that woman was all up in my jammy."
Leonard,"Okay, I hate to break this to you and whatever your jammy is, but, Iêm pretty sure she is a prostitute."
Raj,..
Leonard,"Okay, let me put it this way, in your entire life, how many gorgeous women have walked straight up to you in a bar and asked if you wanted to party."
Raj,Maybe I can save her.
Leonard,"Maybe, but Iêm guessing it will cost you about $500 an hour to try."
Raj,"It was lovely meeting you, best of luck in your future endeavours."
Raj,"Oh, I miss her already."
Leonard,"Oh, Howardês losing it. Check out his latest twitters. _Iêm at the bottom of a black hole staring into the abyss. My life is meaningless, my future is without hope.î"
Raj,Why donêt we take him to see the Blue Man Group?
Leonard,You think thatêd help?
Raj,USA Today calls them exuberant fun for the whole family.
Leonard,"I donêt know, Howard isnêt really the family fun kind of guy."
Raj,"Itês too bad he wasnêt here for that hooker. Sheês exactly his type. A hooker. You know, I bet if we hired her, that would cheer him up."
Leonard,Weêre not going to get Wolowitz a hooker.
Raj,_Iêm so lonely and horny I may open this $20 jar of peanuts and end it all.î
Leonard,Suppose it wouldnêt hurt to get an estimate.
Sheldon,"So, how was your day?"
Penny,"Are you trying to make small talk? Oh, sweetie, you really donêt have to."
Sheldon,"No, itês the accepted convention. How was your day?"
Penny,"Well, uh, they shifted my schedule around at the restaurant so my hours are going to be a little differentÑ"
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, thatês not going to interest me at all, just eat."
Raj,Hello again.
Leonard,"Yeah, hi, listen, m, if youêre not busy, well, w-we were thinking you couldÑ well, we were wonderingÑ"
Raj,If youêre really a prostitute.
Leonard,"Okay, great. UmÑ uh, the thing is, weêve got this friend, and heês kind of down in the dumps, and we thought that maybe you could cheer him up."
Raj,With sex.
Leonard,I think she knows what I meant.
Raj,How can she when you beat around the bush. Sheês from the mean streets where they shoot from the hip and keep it real.
Leonard,"Okay, terrific. Um, uh, listen, is there a way that we can do this where he doesnêt know that youêre aÑ you knowÑ"
Leonard,"Yes, yeah, exactly, the girlfriend experience."
Raj,"Uh, actually, if itês not too much to ask, could we have the Jewish girlfriend experience."
Sheldon,"Okay, thatês question 20, you have to guess."
Penny,"Oh, God, I donêt know Sheldon, are you Star Wars?"
Sheldon,How can one person be a whole movie?
Penny,"Okay, I give up, can we just do something else?"
Sheldon,Fine. I was Spock. Are you and Leonard friends with benefits.
Sheldon,Are you and Leonard friends with benefits?
Penny,"Where did that even come from, did he say we were?"
Sheldon,"No, Leonard said nothing, but who knows what goes on over here when he pretends your mail was misdelivered."
Penny,"No, just mail, no benefits."
Sheldon,"Hmm, I see."
Penny,Why are you asking?
Sheldon,"Iêm curious about the whole social construct. On its face, the idea of satisfying ones sexual appetite, assuming one is afflicted with such, without emotional entanglement, that seems eminently practical. What Iêve observed, however, is Howard Wolowitz crying like a little girl."
Penny,"Well, some people just canêt handle that kind of relationship."
Sheldon,Can you?
Penny,Excuse me?
Sheldon,Are you able to have sex with men without developing an emotional attachment?
Penny,"Sheldon, I really donêt want to talk about this with you."
Sheldon,Is this conversation making you uncomfortable?
Penny,"Of course itês making me uncomfortable, canêt you tell?"
Sheldon,"I really have no idea. I donêt particularly excel at reading facial expressions, body languageÑ"
Penny,"Iêm uncomfortable, Sheldon!"
Sheldon,"Thank you, thatês very helpful."
Howard,"Alright, where are these amazing shrimp?"
Howard,"Seriously, you think this is the size of a babyês arm?"
Raj,A little baby.
Howard,Iêm going back to the room.
Howard,"Hi there, Howard Wolowitz."
Penny,"I donêt think the managerês coming tonight so, here."
Sheldon,Are you suggesting I sleep on the couch.
Penny,"Well, it wasnêt the first suggestion that came to mind, but itês the one Iêm going with."
Sheldon,"I canêt sleep on your couch. I sleep in a bed. And given itês dimensions I have no intention of living out E.M. Snickeringês beloved childrenês book , The Tall Man From Cornwall."
Sheldon,"There was a tall man from Cornwall whose length exceeded his bed. My body fits on it, but barely upon it, thereês no room for my big Cornish head."
Penny,"Oh, alright. I will give you my bed on one condition. That you promise to zip your hole for the next eight hours."
Sheldon,May I say one last thing.
Penny,Only if it doesnêt rhyme.
Sheldon,Alright. Goodnight.
Howard,"Really, me too."
Howard,Yeah. Excuse me for a moment.
Leonard,"Hey, howês it going."
Howard,"Cut the crap, you set this up, didnêt you?"
Howard,"Sheês a hooker, isnêt she."
Raj,"A prostitute, yes."
Howard,You already gave her the money?
Howard,Thank you!
Sheldon,I canêt sleep. how are you going?
Penny,Maybe thatês because your hole is still open.
Sheldon,Iêm homesick.
Penny,Your home is twenty feet from here.
Sheldon,"Twenty feet, twenty light years, it doesnêt matter. Itês in a galaxy far, far away."
Penny,Damn it. What do you want me to do
Sheldon,Sing soft kitty.
Penny,Thatês only for when youêre sick.
Sheldon,Homesick is a type of being sick.
Penny,"Come on, do I really have to?"
Sheldon,I suppose we can stay up and talk.
Penny,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, umÑ"
Sheldon,Sleepy kitty.
Penny,Sleepy kiÑ
Sheldon,Start over.
Penny,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
Sheldon,Thank you for letting me stay here.
Penny,"Oh, youêre welcome sweetie."
Sheldon,"Okay, Iêm sleepy now, get out."
Sheldon,"Oh, good, youêre finally home."
Leonard,What were you doing at Pennyês?
Sheldon,"Well, we had dinner, uh, played some games, and then I spent the night. Oh, youêll be happy to know that I now have a much better understanding of friends with benefits."
Sheldon,"Smell that? Thatês the smell of new comic books. Oh, yes!"
Howard,"Theyêre on me today, boys."
Raj,Youêre paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?
Howard,"No, Iêm celebrating. As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System."
Raj,"Oh, get over yourself, itês a high-tech toilet."
Leonard,"Just think. Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go"
Howard,Is that supposed to be funny?
Sheldon,I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.
Howard,"Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, Iêm the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology."
Raj,"Heês right. This is an important achievement, for two reasons. Number one, and, of course, number two."
Sheldon,"Oh, clever! Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, spoiler alert."
Sheldon,"You told me itês mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown."
Sheldon,Said the Grinch to Christmas.
Leonard,"Oh, sure, whatês up?"
Leonard,"Yeah, vaguely."
Raj,Sure you remember. You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.
Leonard,What about it?
Leonard,"Oh, too bad. I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on."
Leonard,Why the hell not?
Sheldon,"Excuse me, Stuart. Have you read the new Flash?"
Sheldon,"Well, I have and it will knock your socks off! Good luck getting them back on."
Leonard,Nobody wants that.
Leonard,"Uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. You know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?"
Leonard,"Yeah, or you call me."
Leonard,Or nobody calls anyone.
Raj,Interesting. Pennyês current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.
Leonard,"You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj."
Howard,"Hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?"
Leonard,Iêm listening.
Howard,Just tell him to do everything youêve done with her for the last two years.
Penny,"Hey, Leonard."
Leonard,"Oh, hi."
Penny,Howês it going?
Leonard,"Good, good. You?"
Penny,"Fine. Oh, hey, can I ask you something?"
Penny,You know your friend Stuart?
Penny,"Well, he asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first."
Leonard,About what?
Penny,"Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? ‚Cause you know, you and meÑ"
Leonard,"No, no thatês the past. Iêm really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, êcause, well, thatês my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesnêt bother me."
Penny,"Okay, well, thatês really cool of you."
Leonard,"Yeah, well I wouldnêt say cool, Iêd just say, thatês Leonard!"
Penny,"Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?"
Leonard,About Stuart? Love to.
Penny,"Heês very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?"
Leonard,"Well, uh, first of all, donêt underestimate the value of discomfort."
Leonard,"Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, thatês why he works in a comic book store."
Leonard,Oh. Itês Stuart.
Sheldon,Youêre not going to answer it?
Leonard,He wants to talk about Penny. I donêt want to talk about Penny.
Sheldon,"Youêre making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance."
Leonard,Why would he call me?
Sheldon,"We donêt know. And if you donêt answer the phone, we canêt know."
Leonard,"Iêm not answering the phone, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Answer the phone, Leonard."
Leonard,"No! There, it went to voice mail."
Sheldon,Arenêt you going to check your messages?
Sheldon,"You have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy."
Leonard,It must be hell inside your head.
Sheldon,At times.
Howard,"Guys, we have a code red."
Sheldon,"Do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert, code red the computer worm, or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?"
Howard,"Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve."
Leonard,How teeny tiny?
Howard,Itês gonna fail after about ten flushes.
Sheldon,But the mission is for six months.
Howard,"Yeah, see, thatês the code red. Itês kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box."
Sheldon,Have you notified NASA?
Howard,Are you crazy?What am I gonna say? I screwed up your toilet and pretty soon thereês gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station?
Leonard,"Well, what are you gonna do?"
Howard,"Iêm gonna figure out how to fix it, then Iêll tell them."
Leonard,"So, what do you need us for?"
Raj,He canêt figure out how to fix it.
Howard,"Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive."
Raj,"Iêm trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny."
Sheldon,I agree. Itês the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.
Howard,"All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the International Space Station."
Raj,Donêt you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?
Leonard,Good one.
Howard,"Yeah, ha, itês hilarious. Now, hereês an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine."
Raj,You mean so it doesnêt hit the fan?
Sheldon,"Yeah, I have to say, I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop. "
Leonard,Hey Stuart.
Howard,"Classified, Leonard."
Leonard,"Yeah, itês a regular Manhattan Project. Whatês up?"
Leonard,"Yeah, Iêm sorry, itês been broken."
Leonard,"Yeah, that too. Everythingês broken."
Leonard,"All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial."
Leonard,"You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, donêt make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear."
Leonard,"Yeah, like, youêre afraid that if you touch her, sheêll break."
Leonard,"Good, good. Well, you kids have fun tonight."
Howard,You donêt know what this is?
Howard,Good. Get out.
Raj,"Be afraid of Penny, nice, very crafty."
Leonard,It wasnêt bad advice. It just wasnêt particularly helpful.
Sheldon,"For what itês worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry."
Sheldon,"All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support?"
Howard,"No good. I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there? This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet."
Leonard,I feel terrible.
Howard,"Maybe if you were helping, youêd feel better about yourself."
Leonard,I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuartês date with Penny.
Raj,"Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma, dude."
Sheldon,"You donêt really believe in that superstition, do you?"
Raj,"Itês not superstition. Itês practically Newtonian. For every action, thereês an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch, therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. Itês actually a very elegant system, you know, what goes around comes around."
Howard,Speaking of what goes around comes aroundÑ
Raj,"Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?"
Sheldon,It wonêt work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.
Raj,What if we reposition the collection tank?
Sheldon,It wonêt work. No way to mount it.
Howard,"Okay, hereês an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel?"
Sheldon,That could work.
Penny,Morning. Whatês up?
Leonard,Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravityÑ pasta maker. Iêm gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?
Penny,"Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee."
Leonard,Great. So howêd it go with Stuart last night?
Penny,I really donêt want to talk about it.
Leonard,"Yeah. Right. Sure. The thing is, before you guys went out, I spoke to him andÑ"
Penny,I said I donêt want to talk about it.
Leonard,OkayÑ I justÑ I kind ofÑ
Penny,"Look, Leonard, what goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business. So just leave it alone, okay?"
Raj,"If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freakinê latte."
Howard,"Hang on, I think Iêve got this. Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod."
Sheldon,Youêre overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure youêre building.
Howard,"Sheldon, I know what Iêm doing."
Sheldon,"If you knew what you were doing, there wouldnêt be a space toilet where my coffee table should be."
Raj,"Howard, wait. Why donêt you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?"
Howard,Because this is not a spare part from the space station. This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.
Raj,"That what thatês for? In India, the lid just touches the cheese. Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie."
Howard,Where are you going?
Leonard,Comic book store.
Sheldon,"Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break."
Raj,"Me, too."
Howard,"Hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space."
Sheldon,Why does Leonard get to go?
Leonard,"‚Cause heês upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, Iêm going to kick him in his ovaries."
Leonard,"Thanks for understanding, Howard."
Howard,"I got your back, sister. All right, I think weêve got a prototype ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware."
Raj,"Wow, thatês heavy."
Howard,"Damn right itês heavy, itês my motherês meat loaf, itês been testing toilets for generations."
Sheldon,"I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your masterês degree."
Howard,"Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three, two, one. "
Raj,What do you think the problem is?
Howard,Not enough bread crumbs.
Leonard,"Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you."
Leonard,"I think I gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize."
Leonard,It was?
Leonard,Youêre kidding. Never worked for me.
Leonard,Wine? I didnêt say to give her wine.
Leonard,"During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once."
Leonard,"Yeah, no, yeah, wow, Iêm sorry. That mustêve been the last thing you wanted to hear."
Leonard,"No doubt, no doubt. Okay, well, Iêm sorry it didnêt work out."
Leonard,"Yeah, how about that? See you soon."
Howard,"Yes, sir, I understand classified. Weêll keep it all classified, no one has to know but you and me."
Penny,Whatês classified?
Leonard,Howardês space toilet. Iêll tell you later.
Howard,"Well, theyêve deployed our solution. Letês just all hope it works."
Sheldon,"I donêt see why I have to worry. My careerês not hanging in the balance. That was a joke. Itês funny, because itês true."
Penny,"Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?"
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, were you talking to me?"
Penny,"Yeah, I said Leonard."
Leonard,"Yes, you did, didnêt you?"
Penny,What the hell is that?
Leonard,What was it doing on the ceiling?
Howard,Thatês classified.
Sheldon,"Oh, boy."
Sheldon,I canêt comment without violating our agreement that I donêt criticize your work.
Leonard,"Then what was oh, boy?"
Sheldon,Great restraint on my part.
Leonard,Thereês nothing wrong with the science here.
Sheldon,Perhaps you mean a different thing than I do when you say science.
Leonard,"Okay, howês that?"
Sheldon,"You actually had it right in the first place. Once again, youêve fallen for one of my classic pranks. Bazinga! Well, now hereês a peculiar e-mail. The president of the university wants me to meet him at his office tomorrow morning at 8 a.m."
Sheldon,It doesnêt say. It must be an emergency. Everyone at the university knows I eat breakfast at eight and move my bowels at 8:20.
Leonard,"Yes, how did we live before Twitter? I guess youêll find out what it is in the morning."
Sheldon,"Thatês 14 hours away. For the next 840 minutes, Iêm effectively one of Heisenbergês particles, I know where I am or I know how fast Iêm going, but I canêt know both. Yet how am I supposed to carry on with this huge annoying thing hovering over my head?"
Leonard,"Yeah, I know the feeling."
Sheldon, Leonard.
Leonard,"Sheldon, itês two oêclock in the morning."
Sheldon,Why is everybody keep telling me what time it is?
Sheldon,"You, the president of the university, his wife, their sullen teenage daughter. That entire family is fascinated by what time it is and whether people know it."
Leonard,You went to President Seibertês house in the middle of the night?
Sheldon,"He didnêt respond to my e-mail, his phone number is unlisted. Tell me what my other option was."
Leonard,"You could have waited until morning. I know, look who Iêm talking to."
Sheldon,Do you remember the grant proposal I submitted to the National Science Foundation to detect slow-moving monopoles at the magnetic North Pole?
Leonard,Hardly a day goes by when I donêt think about it.
Sheldon,"Aw, how nice. Well, a space opened up at the last minute on the NSF expedition to the Arctic Circle."
Leonard,Wait a minute. He offered to send you to the North Pole?
Sheldon,"Yes. In fact, he was quite enthusiastic. He said, _Frankly, if I could send you tonight, I would.î"
Leonard,"Okay, well, do you want to go?"
Sheldon,"Of course not. Iêm a theoretical physicist, a career I chose in no small part because itês indoors, but if Iêm able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientist to confirm string theory. People will write books about me. Third-graders will create macaroni-art dioramas depicting scenes from my life."
Leonard,"Sure, maybe a tableau of me trying to pummel you to death."
Sheldon,"Iêm on the horns of a dilemma. Can you imagine me, Sheldon Cooper, at the North Pole?"
Leonard,"Easy peasy, Iêm doing it right now."
Sheldon,"Iêm not good with cold, Leonard. How often have we had to leave a movie theatre because I got a headache from drinking the Icee too fast? I canêt go."
Leonard,"Well, then donêt go."
Sheldon,How can you say that? The scientific opportunity of a lifetime presents itself and my best friend says donêt go.
Leonard,"All right, then go."
Sheldon,Listen to you. How can I possibly go?
Leonard,"Sheldon, what are the words I can say right now to end this conversation and let me go back to sleep?"
Sheldon,"Odd, President Seibert posed the exact same question."
Leonard,How was it resolved?
Sheldon,It wasnêt. His wife set their dogs on me and rendered the question moot.
Howard,"Just imagine. If he says yes, weêll have an entire summer without Sheldon."
Raj,We could play outside.
Howard,We could sit on the left side of the couch.
Leonard,I could use the bathroom at 8:20.
Raj,"Our dreams are very small, arenêt they?"
Sheldon,"Good news, gentlemen, I have tentatively acceptedÑ"
Sheldon,Ñthe invitation to join the Arctic Expedition.
Leonard,Itês not gonna be the same without you.
Sheldon,"Thank you, but your sentiments may be premature."
Raj,"Ooh, I donêt like where this is going."
Sheldon,I would like to propose that the three of you accompany me.
Howard,To the North Pole?
Raj,Is this just so we wonêt touch your stuff while youêre away?
Sheldon,"Iêll admit that was a concern. But the fact is, Iêll need a support team. And the three of you are my first choice."
Sheldon,"Well, there are others who might be more qualified, but the thought of interviewing them gave me a stomach ache. Now, I know Iêm proposing an enormous undertaking, so why donêt you take a few moments to discuss it?"
Howard,"Weêre not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?"
Sheldon,Iêm still within earshot! You may want to wait for my door to close.
Howard,"Weêre not really gonna go to the North Pole with him, are we?"
Leonard,Hang on. Letês talk about it. This is a National Science Foundation expedition. I donêt know how we can turn it down.
Howard,"Easy. Instead of saying, no, we donêt want to go on an NSF expedition, say, no, we donêt want to spend _three months stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle with an anal nutbag.î"
Raj,"But if we were part of the team that confirmed string theory, we could drink for free in any bar in any college town with a university that has a strong science program."
Leonard,"Howard, this is big science. You could be the engineer who builds the equipment that puts us on the cover of magazines."
Howard,I could also be the engineer who builds the crossbow that kills Sheldon.
Raj,You still might get on a magazine.
Howard,So you guys are seriously considering this?
Howard,And you think you can put up with Sheldon?
Raj,"Well, Iêm a Hindu. My religion teaches that if we suffer in this life we are rewarded in the next. Three months at the North Pole with Sheldon and Iêm reborn as a well-hung billionaire with wings!"
Sheldon,"Well, gentlemen, have you reached a decision?"
Leonard,Iêm in.
Raj,"Me, too."
Howard,"Oh, damn it. Peer pressure. Fine."
Sheldon,"Excellent. And just an FYI, as I am the expeditionês team leader, protocol dictates that be phrased fine, sir. But donêt worry, there will be a briefing."
Sheldon, Penny.
Penny, Sheldon.
Sheldon, Penny.
Penny, Sheldon.
Sheldon, Penny.
Penny, Sheldon.
Sheldon, Penny.
Penny, Sheldon.
Sheldon, Penny.
Penny, Sheldon.
Sheldon, Penny.
Penny, Sheldon.
Sheldon, Penny.
Penny,What do you want?
Sheldon,I need access to the Cheesecake Factoryês walk-in freezer.
Penny,"Now, honey, I already told you, the hamburger meat is fresh and stored at a safe temperature."
Sheldon,This is to train for a three-month expedition to the magnetic North Pole.
Sheldon,"I donêt know how that sentence could possibly confuse you, but to elaborate, Iêm going to the Arctic Circle with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali."
Penny,Youêre all going?
Penny,For three months?
Penny,Excuse me.
Sheldon,Is that a yes or a no on the freezer? The woman has the attention span of a gnat.
Penny,"Hey, Leonard."
Penny,Sheldon says youêre going to the North Pole.
Leonard,"Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?"
Penny,Yeah. Iêm just a little surprised you didnêt tell me.
Leonard,"Oh, well, it all happened kind of fast, and we had to get physicals and buy thermal underwear and study up on, you know, snow and stuff. Sorry, I was gonna tell you."
Penny,"Oh, hey, no, you donêt have to apologize. Thereês no reason you have to tell me. I was just, you know, surprised."
Sheldon,"Yes, yes, you were busy, you were surprised, all very fascinating. Now where do we stand on the freezer?"
Penny,Is he serious?
Leonard,"Actually, it would help."
Penny,"All right, Iêll see what I can do. So, three months at the North Pole. Wow, that is awesome."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, but at what point do you put this see what you can do plan into action?"
Penny,"Just a warning, Sheldon, the freezer locks from the outside."
Leonard,Did she seem upset to you?
Sheldon,Did she seem upset to you?
Sheldon,"Oh, good, I got it right. Are you upset?"
Leonard,A little bit.
Sheldon,Two for two. Iêm on fire.
Leonard,"I mean, I know sheês not my girlfriend or anything, but wouldnêt you think sheêd feel a little bad that Iêm going to be gone for the whole summer?"
Sheldon,"That feels like a bonus question. Iêm going to stop here while Iêm ahead, but Iêve had a great time."
Sheldon,"Alright, now the purpose of this drill is to acclimate us to the use of tools in extreme temperatures such as we will face in the Arctic Circle."
Raj,Where are your tools?
Sheldon,"Right here. All right, team, open up your practice kits. As the university did not permit me to bring the actual equipment weêll be using to the Cheesecake Factory, because apparently Iêm _ridiculous,î Iêve provided substitutes which will exercise your fine motor skills. Leonard, you will be doing a series of complex mathematical problems on a vintage Casio model 1175 calculator watch I received when I won the Earth Science medal in 3rd grade. Treat it with respect. Raj, you will be painting sideburns and a Van Dyke on a six-inch figurine of Legolas the elf. Now, remember, a Van Dyke is a goatee without a moustache. Wolowitz, you will be completing a series of delicate surgical procedures on the classic childrenês game, Operation. To begin with, you will remove funny bone for two hundred dollars."
Howard,For this I went to MIT.
Sheldon,And begin.
Raj,I think I swallowed some paint!
Leonard,"I canêt press any of the buttons with my gloves. Oh, son of a bitch!"
Sheldon,Adversity is to be expected. Continue.
Howard,"Oh, boy, am I gonna get sued."
Leonard,"Okay, I canêt do this."
Raj,Me either.
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, use your imagination. Innovate. Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth? He cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up."
Howard,You heard the man. Hold him down and Iêll cut him open.
Leonard,"Hang on, I know I donêt possess the tools of leadership, but I donêt understand why we canêt assemble the equipment inside the hut and then take it outside."
Sheldon,I hadnêt thought of that. I guess weêre done here.
Sheldon,"Here, drink slash eat this."
Leonard,What is it?
Sheldon,Itês hot chocolate with a stick of butter.
Howard,"Okay, why?"
Sheldon,"Because in the frigid temperatures in the Arctic, we need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day just to maintain our body weight."
Leonard,"Sheldon, you know I canêt eat butter. Iêm lactose intolerant."
Sheldon,"Way ahead of you, thatês an _I Canêt Believe Itês Not Butterî stick."
Raj,"But mummy, all the other guys are going to the North Pole."
Raj,"If you were standing behind me nagging, I might."
Raj,"No, itês not. Howard, tell them."
Howard,"Doctor and Mrs. Koothrappali, namaste. I understand your concern, but if itêll make you feel any better, my mother is fine with me going, and this is a woman who kept a safety rail on my bed until I was 17."
Sheldon,"Thatês very unlikely, Mrs. Koothrappali. If Raj dies, itêll be from frostbite, gangrene, acute sunburn or being ripped to shreds by a fifteen hundred pound polar bear."
Howard,"Ma, Iêm putting you on speakerphone with Rajês parents. Can you tell them that youêre okay with me going to the Arctic?"
Howard,I didnêt say that. You never listen to me!
Penny,"Hey, Leonard, can I talk to you for a sec?"
Leonard,"Sure, but letês go out here where thereês a little less yelling and guilt. Whatês up?"
Penny,"Well, I got you a little going away present."
Leonard,"Oh, a blanket."
Penny,"Oh, no, no, no, not just a blanket. See, it has sleeves. Yeah!  So, you can, you know, be all snoodled up while you do your science stuff."
Leonard,"Oh, wow, cool."
Penny,"Oh, Iêm gonna miss you.  See you later."
Leonard,"Sheldon, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,"I want a cookie, Meemaw."
Leonard,"Sheldon, itês me."
Sheldon,But Meemaw just made cookies.
Leonard,"Listen, I donêt know if I can go on the expedition."
Leonard,I donêt think I can go to the North Pole.
Sheldon,"Okay, Leonard, I know youêre concerned about disappointing me but I want you to take comfort from the knowledge that my expectations of you are very low."
Leonard,"Yeah, thatês very comforting."
Sheldon,"Comforting is a part of leadership. Itês not a part I care for, but such is my burden."
Leonard,"Terrific, itês just that I donêt think Penny wants me to go."
Sheldon,"Assuming thatês a valid reason not to go, which it isnêt, how do you know this? Did she say it?"
Leonard,Not exactly. But she said she was gonna miss me and she gave me this.
Sheldon,What is it?
Leonard,Itês a blanket with sleeves.
Sheldon,"Oh, thatês clever. Let me see if I understand this correctly. Her missing you is an emotional state you find desirable?"
Leonard,"Yes, obviously."
Sheldon,"All right. Well, given that missing you is predicated on you leaving, logic dictates you must leave."
Leonard,"Yes, okay, but Iêm gonna be gone for three months. What if she doesnêt miss me that long and she meets someone else?"
Sheldon,She does have a short attention span.
Leonard,"So, I canêt go."
Sheldon,"Leonard, you may be right. It appears that Penny secretly wants you in her life in a very intimate and carnal fashion."
Leonard,You really think so?
Sheldon,"Of course not. Even in my sleep-deprived state, Iêve managed to pull off another one of my classic pranks. Bazinga!"
Penny,"Oh, Leonard, what time is it?"
Leonard,"Itês 7 a.m. Iêm sorry itês early, but weêre leaving soon, and I needed to talk to you."
Leonard,What did you mean when you said youêre going to miss me?
Penny,"Um, I donêt know. Youêll be gone and Iêll notice."
Leonard,"Okay, well, um, what about this? What does this mean?"
Penny,"Wine, credit card and late night television are a bad combination."
Leonard,"All right, fine. What about that really long hug? What did that mean?"
Penny,That wasnêt a long hug.
Leonard,It was at least five Mississippis. A standard hug is two Mississippis tops.
Penny,"Leonard, I donêt know what to tell you. It was just a hug."
Leonard,Glad we cleared that up.
Leonard,I guess Iêll see you.
Penny,"Okay, have a safe trip."
Leonard,Thank you. Bye.
Penny,"Okay, bye.  Means I wish you werenêt going."
Leonard,Damn it.
Leonard,Weêre out of ice.
Sheldon,"All right, men, we begin initial assembly and deployment of the testing equipment starting tomorrow at 0700 hours, but until then, you are all off duty. I suggest you keep the shenanigans to a minimum as medical help is 18 hours away by dogsled."
Raj,What are you working on?
Leonard,"Hey, guys, can I just say something? How about we take a moment to think about where we are right now? This is literally the top of the world. Only a handful of people in all of human history will ever see what we are going to see."
Raj,Heês right.
Howard,"Yeah, wow."
Sheldon,It is remarkable.
Raj,"So, whoês up for a movie?"
Howard,"Good idea, what do you think? Ice Station Zebra or John Carpenterês The Thing?"
Raj,I say double feature.
Leonard,Dinnerês ready!
Sheldon,What are we having?
Leonard,Reconstituted Thai food.
Sheldon,Did you bring the dehydrated low-sodium soy sauce?
Sheldon,Freeze-dried spicy mustard?
Sheldon,"Flash-frozen brown rice, not white?"
Leonard,"Uh, oh, sorry."
Sheldon,Not to worry. I hid it. Bazinga! Youêre in my spot.
Howard,Thereês no time for a crossbow. Find me an icicle.
Sheldon,Three months. This is gonna be great!
Leonard,"Oh, thank God weêre home."
Howard,I canêt believe we spent three months in that frozen hell.
Raj,It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.
Sheldon,"I donêt know what Arctic expedition you guys were on, but I thought it was a hoot and a half."
Sheldon,"Oh, hi mom. No, I told you Iêd call you when I got home, Iêm not home yet.  Alright, Iêm home. The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success, Iêm all but certain thereês a Nobel Prize in my future. Actually, I shouldnêt say that. Iêm entirely certain. No, mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that Iêm home safe is not proof that it worked, that logic is Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc. No, Iêm not sassing you in Eskimo talk."
Leonard,Iêm going to go let Penny know weêre back.
Sheldon,"Mother, I have to go. Yeah, love you. Bye.  Daddyês home."
Penny,"Leonard, youêre back."
Leonard,"Yeah, I just stopped by to sayÑ  Yeah, so, hi!"
Penny,Hi! 
Howard,"Dammit, I should have gone over and told her we were back."
Raj,"Yeah, it was first come, first served."
Sheldon,"I just want you both to know, when I publish my findings, I wonêt forget your contributions."
Sheldon,"Of course, I canêt mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech, but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote, and perhaps a signed copy."
Raj,We have to tell him.
Sheldon,Tell me what?
Howard,Damn his Vulcan hearing.
Sheldon,"You fellows are planning a party for me, arenêt you?"
Howard,"Okay, Sheldon, sit down."
Sheldon,"If thereês going to be a theme, I should let you know that I donêt care for luau, toga or under the sea."
Howard,"Yeah, weêll keep that in mind, look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole."
Sheldon,"If this is about the night the heat went out, thereês nothing to be embarrassed about."
Raj,Itês not about that.
Howard,And we agreed to never speak of it again.
Sheldon,So we slept together naked. It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.
Howard,Heês speaking about it.
Raj,"For me, it was a bonding moment."
Howard,"Sheldon, you remember the first few weeks we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding anything and you were acting like an obnoxious, giant dictator?"
Raj,I thought we were going to be gentle with him.
Howard,"Thatês why I added the tator. And then when we found our first positive data, you were so happy."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital D."
Howard,"Well, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasnêt so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it wasÑ static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off."
Raj,"He just went colon, capital O."
Sheldon,You tampered with my experiment?
Howard,We had to.
Raj,It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian. You see that? I added the ensian.
Sheldon,Did Leonard know about this? Leonardês my best friend in the world. Surely Leonard didnêt know.
Howard,"Actually, it was his idea."
Sheldon,Of course it was. The whole plan reeks of Leonard.
Penny,I missed you so much.
Leonard,"I missed you, too."
Penny,I couldnêt even think of anyone else while you were gone.
Leonard,"Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, itêsÑ donêt ask."
Sheldon, Leonard.
Leonard,Do not make a sound.
Sheldon,Whispering do not make a sound is a sound.
Leonard,"Damn his Vulcan hearing. Not a good time, Sheldon."
Sheldon, Penny.
Penny,"Oh, this is ridiculous. What?"
Sheldon,"Hello, Penny. I realize youêre currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?"
Penny,Itês great to see you too. Come on in.
Sheldon,Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. Do you have anything to say for yourself?
Leonard,"Yes, I feel terrible about it. I will never forgive myself, I donêt expect you to either, and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance."
Penny,"Okay, can someone please tell me whatês going on here?"
Sheldon,"Whatês going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy."
Penny,Is that true?
Leonard,It was the only way to make him happy.
Penny,Why did you have to make him happy?
Leonard,"Because when he wasnêt happy, we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death."
Sheldon,That seems like a bit of an overreaction.
Leonard,"No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush. Look, we kept the original data. You can still publish the actual results."
Sheldon,"Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful and Iêve already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that I have confirmed string theory and forever changed manês understanding of the universe."
Leonard,"Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldnêt have done that. So write another e-mail, set the record straight, itês no big deal."
Sheldon,"Youêre right, Leonard, itês not a big deal. All you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university. That, FYI, was sarcasm. I, in fact, believe it is a big deal"
Penny,"Oh, the poor thing."
Leonard,"Yeah, I feel terrible."
Penny,"Wait, wait. Arenêt you going to go talk to him?"
Leonard,"Uh, heêll be fine, the guyês a trouper, come here."
Penny,"No, youêre right, you shouldnêt talk to him. I will."
Leonard,"Man, I cannot catch a break."
Penny,Hey. Do you want to talk?
Sheldon,About what? Being betrayed by my friends? Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing? And I didnêt even get to go to Comic-Con!
Penny,"Oh, honÑ UhÑ   Soft kitty, warm kittyÑ"
Sheldon,Thatês for when Iêm sick. Sad is not sick.
Penny,Oh. Sorry. I donêt know your sad song.
Sheldon,I donêt have a sad song. Iêm not a child.
Penny,"Well, you know, I do understand what youêre going through."
Sheldon,Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?
Penny,"Well, no, but when I was a senior in high school, one of my friends heard I was going to be named head cheerleader. Oh, I was so excited. My mom even made me a celebration pie. Then they named stupid Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader. Big olê slutbag."
Sheldon,Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?
Penny,"Well, theyêre pretty tasty."
Sheldon,"And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?"
Penny,"Look, Sheldon, I just donêt think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay, you know what itês like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasnêt true, like saying Spock didnêt care his mom died?"
Sheldon,I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie!
Raj,I like the new look.
Howard,Thanks. I call it the Clooney.
Raj,"I call it the Mario and Luigi, but whatever. Hey, howês Sheldon doing?"
Leonard,"Well, he came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the Force, so Iêd say, a little better."
Howard,"If I may abruptly change the subject, did you and Penny finallyÑ you know."
Howard,"Personally, I donêt care, but my genitals wanted me to ask."
Leonard,"Well, tell your genitals what I do with Penny is none of their business."
Howard,He says they didnêt do it.
Howard,What are you doing?
Raj,I feel bad for the guy.
Leonard,"Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?"
Sheldon,"Because I am without friends. Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated."
Leonard,Come on. We said we were sorry.
Sheldon,Itês going to take more than Iêm sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what youêve done to me.
Sheldon,You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.
Sheldon,"All right, Iêve had enough. Attention, everyone. Iê m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. As many of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour."
Sheldon,My credibility may have been damagedÑ
Sheldon,"But I would like to remind you that in science, thereês no such thing as failure. There once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. That manês name was, surprise, surprise, Albert Einstein."
Sheldon,"Oh, you think youêre so clever. Well, let me just tell you, while I do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy."
Leonard,So much for our friendship with Sheldon.
Raj,"Well, weêll always have the night the heat went out."
Leonard,"Hey. Listen, since we got, you know, interrupted last night, I didnêt have a chance to give you this."
Penny,"Oh, Leonard, you shouldnêt have. Oh, boy! What is it?"
Leonard,Itês a snowflake. From the North Pole.
Penny,Are you serious?
Leonard,Uh-huh. Itêll last forever. I preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.
Penny,"Oh, my God. Thatês the most romantic thing anyoneês ever said to me that I didnêt understand."
Leonard,"Itês actually a pretty simple process. You see, cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize onÑ  "
Howard,"Red alert, Leonard. Sheldon ran away."
Leonard,"Man, I can not catch a break."
Penny,"So, how do you know he ran away?"
Howard,"Well, heês not answering his phone, he handed in his resignation at the university and he sent me a text that said, Iêm running away."
Leonard,"Okay, well, thanks for letting me know."
Penny,"Well, Leonard, arenêt you going to do something?"
Leonard,"Of course Iêm going to do something. Uh, Howard, you check the comic book store. Raj, go to the Thai restaurant. Iêll stay here with Penny in her apartment.  Oh, damn it. Itês Sheldonês mother. A break cannot be caught. Hi, Mrs. Cooper. He is? Sheldon went home to Texas. Yeah, no, I know he resigned. Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault. No, no, no, you, youêre right, someone needs to come talk to him. Donêt worry, Iêll take care of it. Yeah. All right. New plan. Howard, you and Raj go to Texas. Iêll stay here with Penny in her apartment."
Penny,"Well, youêre not gonna go with them?"
Leonard,"Well, you know, I gave you the snowflake and we were kissing andÑ Oh, come on, I donêt want to go to Texas!"
Howard,"Oh, right, and I do? My people already crossed a desert once, weêre done."
Leonard,"Trust me, youêll be fine. See ya."
Penny,"Well, wait a second, Leonard, come on, how can you not go? Heês your best friend."
Leonard,"Yeah, but I already saw him naked. Just come here."
Penny,I promise I will be here when you get back. Just go help Sheldon.
Penny,Yeah. We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days.
Leonard,Maybe you can.
Raj,"Boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?"
Sheldon,"Thanks, Mom."
Sheldon,"Aw, Mom."
Sheldon,My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.
Sheldon,Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.
Sheldon,Theyêre not my friends.
Sheldon,That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know thatês why they hated me.
Leonard,I canêt believe you bought a red cowboy hat.
Howard,"Hello? Iêm wearing a red turtleneck. Plus, it was the only boysê large they had."
Raj,"Iêm sorry, this does not look like Texas. Whereês the tumbleweeds? Whereês the saloons?"
Raj,"Yeah, like in the movies I saw growing up in India. You know, uh, Four for Texas, Yellow Rose of Texas."
Howard,This neighbourhood is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
Raj,I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.
Leonard,What can I tell you? They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there.
Leonard,Will you please take that stupid hat off?
Howard,"No, I want to blend in."
Raj,To what? Toy Story?
Howard,"Howdy, maêam."
Leonard,_ We took the red-eye.
Howard,Thank you kindly.
Leonard,"Uh, no, thank you."
Howard,"If yêall donêt mind, I got a hankerinê for a Lone Star beer."
Howard,Sorry. Iêll take a diet Yoo-Hoo if you have it.
Leonard,"Uh, if you donêt mind, Mrs. Cooper, thereês a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles, and you have no idea how much I want to be on it."
Leonard,"Uh, yes, maêam."
Sheldon,What are they doing here?
Leonard,We came to apologize.
Leonard,"And bring you home. So, why donêt you pack up your stuff and weêll head back."
Leonard,"No, this is my home now. Thanks to you, my career is over and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists."
Sheldon,"Evolution isnêt an opinion, itês fact."
Sheldon,I forgive you. Letês go home.
Leonard,How about that? I finally caught a break.
Leonard,You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?
Leonard,Why does it have to get weird?
Penny,I donêt know.
Leonard,"I mean, we were friends, and now weêre more than friends. Weêre whatever this is. But why label it, right? I mean, it is what it is andÑ"
Penny,Itês weird.
Howard,"Sheldon, youêre wrong. Wolverine was not born with bone claws."
Sheldon,"Howard, you know me to be a very smart man. Donêt you think if I were wrong, Iêd know it?"
Howard,"Okay, first of allÑ"
Raj,"Give it up, dude, youêre arguing with a crazy person."
Sheldon,Iêm not crazy. My mother had me tested.
Leonard,"Hey, guys."
Howard,What are you doing here?
Leonard,What do you mean? Itês new comic book night.
Raj,"Yeah, but since you and Penny finally hooked up, we thought you two would be having bouncy naked yum-yum night."
Leonard,"Thereês more to life than sex, Raj."
Howard,"Okay, who had Leonard flames out with Penny in less than 24 hoursî?"
Sheldon,I did.
Leonard,"Nothing flamed out. We donêt have to have sex every night, you know."
Howard,"You donêt have to, but itês highly recommended."
Raj,"Yeah, take advantage of that window of opportunity before it slams shut on your little dinky."
Leonard,Itês not a matter of opportunity. Weêre getting to know each other. Thereês a learning curve.
Howard,"Whatês there to learn? You get naked, do nasty things to each other, then somebody makes scrambled eggs and salami. Easy peasy."
Sheldon,Perhaps what Leonard is obliquely referring to is the occurrence of some sort of sexual dysfunction.
Raj,"Okay, who had Leonard gets a floppy disk?"
Sheldon,"Oh, a clever, albeit obsolete, euphemism for insufficient blood flow to the male sex organ."
Leonard,"Nothing like that happened, all right? The sex was just fine."
Raj,"Just fine? Oh, dude, the fourth Harry Potter movie was just fine."
Leonard,"Iêm not saying it was bad, Iêm just saying itÑ wasnêt great."
Howard,"Okay, when you say _it wasnêt great, do you mean for both of you? Because we can totally see it not being great for her. Am I right?"
Raj,"Oh, yeah."
Leonard,"To tell you the truth, I think we were both a little, I donêt knowÑ"
Raj,Disappointed? Let down?
Howard,Ashamed? Horrified? Repulsed?
Leonard,"All I know is, it wasnêt the way I dreamed it would be."
Howard,Sex is never the way I dream itês gonna be.
Raj,Thatês because in your dreams youêre a horse from the waist down.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, Wolverine: Origin. Miniseries issue two, page 22. Retractable bone claws. If you people spent less time thinking about sex and more time concentrating on comic books, weêd have far fewer of these embarrassing moments."
Leonard,"Sheldon, dinnerês here."
Sheldon,Tandoori Palace?
Leonard,"No, we went somewhere new."
Sheldon,"Youêre good-naturedly ribbing me, arenêt you?"
Leonard,"No, look, Mumbai Palace."
Sheldon,Why? Why would we change? We had a perfectly good palace. Tandoori Palace is our palace.
Leonard,"Trust me, this will be just fine."
Howard,You are the authority on just fine.
Leonard,Whatês that supposed to mean?
Howard,"Yeah, exactly. Not bad, but not great."
Penny,What are they talking about?
Leonard,I donêt know
Sheldon,I know. As Iêm sure youêre awareÑ
Sheldon,"If thatês Morse code, thatês terrible. As I was saying, you and Leonard had a disappointing sexual encounter. Earlier this evening, Leonard characterized it as just fine. So what youêre seeing here is a continuation of the mocking that followed."
Penny,"Okay, yeah, well, Iêm just gonna go eat my dinner elsewhere. Maybe an airplane headed for a mountainside."
Leonard,"Penny, wait. Aagh! What is wrong with you?"
Sheldon,I sense I may have crossed some sort of line.
Raj,"Yeah, youÑ"
Howard,"Uh, no, no, no, donêt tell him, letês see if he can figure it out."
Penny,"Ugh, I am so embarrassed!"
Leonard,Please donêt be mad.
Penny,What did you tell them?
Leonard,"Nothing bad, just that last night was fine."
Penny,Fine? You said it was fine?
Leonard,"Yeah, itês a perfectly good word. You put it in front of wine or dining, and youêve really got something. Okay, well, let me ask you this, how was last night for you?"
Penny,It wasÑ okay.
Penny,"Yeah, itês a perfectly good word. I mean, you put it in front of dokay and you really got something. All right, look, letês not overreact, you know? For a lot of couples, it takes time to get to know each otherês rhythms. Learn what the other person wants and likes."
Leonard,"So, youêve been through this before?"
Penny,"You know, I think this is one of those things where talking about it is not going to make it better. Want a glass of wine?"
Leonard,So much.
Penny,"Okay. See, we shouldêve done this last night, you know, have a little wine, take the edge off."
Leonard,"Actually, ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction in the nerve cells and stimulates reuptake receptors of inhibitory neurotransmitters like gamma-aminobutyric acid."
Penny,"Donêt talk, just drink."
Howard,"No, youêre misunderstanding. A shiksa goddess isnêt an actual goddess and we donêt pray to them, we prey on them."
Raj,"Whatever, dude. The point is, Leonardês got one and you donêt."
Sheldon,"Is this it? It was inappropriate to discuss Leonard and Pennyês sex life in front of Leonard and Penny.  Oh, good! Now I can eat."
Raj,Whatês that?
Howard,Sounds like a cricket.
Sheldon,"Hang on. Based on the number of chirps per minute and the ambient temperature in this room, it is a snowy tree cricket."
Howard,"Oh, give me a frickinê break. How could you possibly know that?"
Sheldon,"In 1890, Emile Dolbear determined that there was a fixed relationship between the number of chirps per minute of the snowy tree cricket and the ambient temperature. A precise relationship that is not present with ordinary field crickets."
Raj,How do you know what the exact temperature of the room is?
Sheldon,"Under the terms of my roommate agreement with Leonard, Iêve had unilateral control of the thermostat ever since the sweaty night of ê06."
Howard,"Okay, you were right about Wolverine and bone claws, but youêre wrong about the cricket."
Sheldon,"Howard, donêt embarrass yourself, the science chirps for itself. Humorous word play."
Howard,"No, no, not this time. I know insects, my friend, I spent many childhood years capturing them with nets, putting them in glass jars, sticking pins through them, mounting them on corrugated cardboard with Dymo labels underneath, identifying the genus and species. In Latin."
Raj,"Oh, dude, you are never getting a shiksa goddess."
Sheldon,That is a snowy tree cricket. Oecanthus fultoni. I was done with Latin by fifth grade.
Howard,"Okay, okay, tell you what. I am willing to bet anything thatês an ordinary field cricket."
Sheldon,I canêt take your money.
Howard,"Whatês the matter, you chicken?"
Sheldon,"Iêve always found that an inappropriate slur. Chickens are not, by nature, at all timid. In fact, when I was young, my neighbourês chicken got loose and chased me up the big elm tree in front of our house."
Raj,Chickens canêt climb trees
Sheldon,Thank God.
Howard,"Okay, I believe a chicken made you his bitch. But the cricket thing, I donêt buy. Bet me."
Sheldon,Fair enough. What stake do you propose?
Howard,"I will put up my Fantastic Four number 48, first appearance of Silver Surfer against your Flash 123, the classic Flash of two worlds issue."
Sheldon,"All right, you have a wager."
Raj,"Great. Now how are you going to settle it, hmm? There is no way to determine the species of the cricket without examining it."
Raj,I wonder what the non-pathetic people are doing tonight.
Leonard,More wine?
Penny,Hit me.
Sheldon,I donêt see anything.
Raj,Hallway. 
Sheldon,One at a time.  What was that?
Raj,"My stomach. Indian food doesnêt agree with me. Ironic, isnêt it?"
Howard,Shh! Elevator shaft.
Sheldon,Help me open it.
Howard,Are you crazy? We canêt go down an empty elevator shaft.
Sheldon,"Fine, if you donêt want to proceed, then you forfeit the bet, and Iêll take possession of your Fantastic Four."
Howard,Letês open her up.
Sheldon,Are you bothered that I can so easily manipulate you?
Howard,"Donêt push me, Sheldon. I may be small, but I took kung fu when I was 13, and I remember a good deal of it."
Sheldon,"Oh, really? Well, I grew up with an older brother and a very contentious twin sister and I believe I could easily best you in any physical confrontation, be it noogies, swirlies or the classic why are you hitting yourself?"
Raj,"Ooh, big talk from a man who was once treed by a chicken."
Leonard,What are we drinking now?
Penny,Peppermint schnapps.
Leonard,Why would you buy peppermint schnapps?
Penny,"Because I like peppermint, and itês fun to say schnapps. Hey, Leonard?"
Leonard,"Schnapps. Youêre right, that is fun."
Raj,Be careful.
Sheldon,"If I were not being careful, your telling me to be careful would not make me careful."
Sheldon,"Uh-oh, flashlight went out. I need some batteries. Fellas? Hello? Itês really dark down here."
Penny,"Oh, sweetie. You really canêt hold your liquor, can you?"
Leonard,"Iêm okay. Just a little mouthwash, and then Iêm gonna rock your world. "
Raj,"Ugh, Toby, what did you do in a past life to be so disgusting now?"
Sheldon,His name isnêt Toby. Toby is an absurd name for a cricket.
Raj,What would you name him?
Sheldon,"An appropriate cricket name. For example, Jiminy."
Howard,"All right, Sheldon, here we go, Kleingastês Field Guide to North American Insects. Hey, Toby. Right here, see it? The common field cricket, aka Gryllus assimilis, which is Latin for suck it, you lose."
Sheldon,"Hang on. Voil_, the snowy tree cricket, aka Oecanthus fultoni, which is Latin for Iêll suck nothing. Of course Iêm joking because the Latin for that is nihil exsorbibo."
Howard,"That is not Toby, this is Toby. Raj, what do you think?"
Raj,"Oh, I really donêt care anymore"
Leonard,"God, I had the most horrible night."
Raj,What happened?
Sheldon,Obviously another carnal fiasco with the shiksi goddess.
Howard,Shiksa. Shik-sa.
Sheldon,"Forgive me. Yiddish was not spoken in east Texas. And if it was, it wasnêt spoken for long."
Howard,"Yeah, fine, whatever. The point is, youêre wrong again."
Sheldon,We havenêt established that Iêm wrong once.
Howard,"All right. Tell you what, letês go down to the Entomology Department and let Professor"
Sheldon,"Heês a snowy tree cricket, and his name is Jiminy.  "
Leonard,I bet I could throw a rock in this room and come up with three better friends.
Raj,Holy crap. Itês like Silence of the Lambs down here.  Donêt do that!
Howard,Youêre such a girl. Theyêre just bugs.
Raj,"Yeah, well, I donêt like bugs, okay? They freak me out."
Sheldon,Interesting. Youêre afraid of insects and women. Ladybugs must render you catatonic. It was a joke. I made it to lessen your discomfort. Youêre welcome
Sheldon,"Excuse me, are you Professor Crawley?"
Sheldon,Iêm Dr. Cooper from the Physics Department.
Sheldon,Iêm sorry?
Howard,"No, you donêt understand. We just want to ask you a question."
Raj,Ask rhetorical questions that make people uncomfortable?
Raj,Iêm from New Delhi. Maybe you should find another entomologist.
Sheldon,"No, no. Weêre here, letês settle this. Professor, can you identify our cricket?"
Howard,"Well, could you look at Toby?"
Sheldon,Told you.
Sheldon,"No, no, wait. Dr. Crawley, are you sure?"
Sheldon,"Cruel as that may be, that is not in itself a credential."
Sheldon,"Well, apparently, I was wrong. Congratulations."
Raj,Enjoy Oxnard. Iêm sure your daughterês looking forward to having you.
Penny,"Oh, hey, Sheldon. What you got there? A new comic book?"
Sheldon,Old comic book. I just retrieved it from my safe deposit box.
Penny,What do you have a safe deposit box for?
Sheldon,Old comic books. I lost this to Wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager.
Penny,do they have Wii cricket now? That canêt be very popular.
Sheldon,"Penny, Iêd rather not talk about it."
Penny,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, Iêm not feeling so hot either."
Sheldon,Why would that make me feel better?
Penny,"I donêt know, empathy? Anyway, Iêm just saying that youêre feeling upset about something with Howard, and Iêm upset about something with Leonard."
Sheldon,"Yes, yes, the disappointing sex. Thatês an inexact parallel. You and Leonard can always return to being friends, whereas I can never return to a state in which Wolowitz has not bested me like Mrs. Rileyês chicken."
Penny,Whatês Mrs. Rileyês chicken?
Sheldon,A chicken that was owned by Mrs. Riley.
Penny,"Okay, forget the chicken."
Sheldon,"Well, I wish I could."
Penny,"No, no. You may be right about me and Leonard."
Sheldon,Of course Iêm right What are the odds Iêd be wrong twice in one week?
Penny,"No, I mean, we can always go back to being friends."
Sheldon,I just said that. This conversation has started to circle. Meeting adjourned.
Leonard,Hey. Whatês going on?
Sheldon,"Oh, youêd like to catch up on the events of the day. All right. Well, there was a half-hour wait at the bank to get into my safe deposit box, I was forced to talk to Penny about your sexual problems, and, oh, yes, in a moment filled with biblical resonance, pride wenteth before my fall, causing my Flash 123 to goeth to Wolowitz."
Leonard,Wait a minute. You talked to Penny about our sex life?
Sheldon,"Leonard, it astonishes me how you continually fixate on the trivial. I lost a bet to Wolowitz."
Leonard,"Right, right. Youêre saying you talked to Penny?"
Sheldon, Yes.
Leonard,Excuse me.
Sheldon,Have I crossed some sort of line again?
Leonard,Little bit. 
Sheldon,"Hmm. Oh, who cares?"
Penny,"Oh, hey."
Leonard,"Hey. Uh, what did Sheldon say to you?"
Penny,Not a lot. Just that we always have the option of going back to being friends.
Leonard,Is that what you want?
Penny,"I donêt know. I mean, you have to admit things seemed simpler when we were just friends."
Leonard,I guess.
Penny,It would take the pressure off.
Leonard,"It would, wouldnêt it?"
Penny,"So, weêll just be friends."
Leonard,"Good, good."
Penny,Come here. 
Penny,"Morning, Sheldon. Come dance with me."
Penny,Why not?
Sheldon,"Penny, while I subscribe to the many worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing."
Penny,Are you fun in any of them?
Sheldon,The math would suggest that in a few Iêm a clown made of candy. But I donêt dance.
Penny,"All right, want some French toast?"
Sheldon,Itês Oatmeal Day.
Penny,"Tell you what, next French Toast Day, I will make you oatmeal."
Sheldon,"Dear Lord, are you still going to be here on French Toast Day?"
Sheldon,"Look, Leonard, Penny made French toast."
Leonard,Sorry. I havenêt given her your schedule yet.
Sheldon,"Itês an iCal download, she can put it right in her phone. And I thought we agreed that youêd have your conjugal visits in her apartment."
Leonard,"We did, but there were extenuating circumstances."
Sheldon,I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping skills finally trump her perkiness?
Leonard,"No, her bed kind ofÑ broke."
Sheldon,That doesnêt seem likely. Her bedês of sturdy construction. Even the addition
Penny,A homunculus?
Leonard,Perfectly formed miniature human being.
Penny,"Oh, youêre my little homunculus."
Leonard,Donêt do that.
Penny,"Sorry. Okay, who wants syrup and who wants cinnamon sugar?"
Sheldon,I want oatmeal.
Penny,"Yes, well, I want a boyfriend whose roommate isnêt a giant pain in the ass."
Sheldon,"Iêm sure that will happen soon enough. But in the meantime, I still want oatmeal."
Penny,"You know what, I give up. Heês impossible."
Sheldon,"I canêt be impossible. I exist. I believe what you meant to say is, _I give up, heês improbable.î"
Leonard,"Sheldon, you really need to find a better way of dealing with Penny."
Sheldon,"What am I supposed to do, eat French toast on a Monday? Now, that would be impossible."
Leonard,"Iêm just saying, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."
Sheldon,You can catch even more flies with manure. Whatês your point?
Leonard,Itês aÑ 
Sheldon,"Boy, that does smell good. Too bad itês Monday."
Penny,"Okay, so Kim the night manager went on maternity leave, and her husbandês name is Sandy, right? So get this, her replacement is a woman named Sandy whose husbandês name is Kim."
Penny,I know. What are the odds?
Sheldon,"Easily calculable, we begin by identifying the set of married couples with unisex names. We then eliminate those unqualified for restaurant work, the aged, the imprisoned and the limbless, for example. Next we look atÑ"
Leonard,"Sheldon! itês an amazing coincidence, can we leave it at that?"
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry. Ooh, Penny, itês as if the Cheesecake Factory is run by witches."
Penny,"Ooh, Sheldon, itês as if you donêt think Iêll punch you."
Leonard,"Come on, you guys, let it go."
Penny,"Fine, whatever. Are you finished?"
Sheldon,"Well, thank you. How thoughtful. Would you like a chocolate"
Penny,"Um, yeah, sure, thanks."
Leonard,What was that?
Sheldon,You said be nice to Penny. I believe offering chocolate to someone falls within the definition of nice.
Leonard,"It does. But in my experience, you donêt."
Sheldon,"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy."
Leonard,"Yeah, yeah, now thatês you, obnoxious and insufferable."
Howard,"Whatês going on, day dwellers?"
Penny,"Oh, man, did the Kiss Army repeal donêt ask, donêt tell?"
Howard,Raj and I are going a goth club in Hollywood to hang with the night people. Anybody want to come along?
Penny,"Oh, wow, youêre actually going out like that?"
Howard,"No, no. Iêm going out like this. "
Leonard,"Howard, what did you do?"
Howard,"Theyêre called tattoo sleeves. Look. I bought them online, Raj got a set, too. Fantastic, right? Put them on, have hot sex with some freaky girl with her business pierced, take them off, and I can still be buried in a Jewish cemetery."
Sheldon,"You know, Iêve always wanted to go to a goth nighclub."
Sheldon,"Bazinga! None of you ever see my practical jokes coming, do you?"
Howard,"Okay, how about you two? Look, Iêve got some extra tat sleeves."
Leonard,Why are you carrying extras?
Howard,"Well, In case I snag one on someoneês nipple ring."
Penny,"Uh, yeah, I think weêll pass."
Howard,"Oh, is the missus speaking for the couple now?"
Leonard,"In this case, you bet she is."
Howard,"Yes, sheês pushy and yes, heês whipped, but thatês not the expression. Come on, I want to stop at Walgreens and pick up some more eyeliner."
Leonard,Theyêre gonna get beaten up at that club.
Penny,"Theyêre gonna get beaten up at Walgreens. Oh, sorry, Sheldon, I almost sat in your spot."
Sheldon,Did you? I didnêt notice. Have a chocolate.
Penny,Thank you.
Raj,I think weêre fitting in quite nicely.
Howard,Itêd help if you werenêt drinking light beer.
Raj,"Oh, whatês so gothic about vodka and cranberry juice?"
Howard,"Hello, it looks like blood. Did you even read the Wiki How link I sent you on being goth?"
Raj,"No, Iêm behind on my wiki-reading Iêm kind of on a John Grisham kick right now."
Raj,"Well, I finished reading The Pelican Brief and loved it so much, I dived right into The Client. He was a lawyer himself so his novels are accurate as well as entertaining."
Howard,"Just remember we are lost boys, children of the night."
Raj,"Great. Lost boys, children of the night. Got it. Can you pass the Chex mix, please. Thank you. We are lost boys."
Howard,Iêm actually much morelost than he is.
Howard,Thanks. Can we buy you ladies a drink?
Raj,"Light beers? Well, Wiki-how about that?"
Howard,Iêm Howard.
Howard,"Nice to meet you, Bethany."
Raj,"Yes, very nice."
Raj,Do either of you ladies enjoy the novels of John Grisham?
Penny,Whatês this cartoon called again?
Leonard,Oshikuru: Demon Samurai.
Sheldon,"And itês not a cartoon, itês anime."
Penny,"Anime. You know, I knew a girl in high school named Anna May. Anna May Fletcher. She was born with one nostril. Then she had this bad nose job and basically wound up with three."
Sheldon,Youêre here a lot now.
Penny,"Oh, am I talking too much? Iêm sorry. Zip."
Sheldon,Thank you. Chocolate?
Penny,Yes please.  Youêll never guess who they got to replace you at workÑ
Leonard,"Okay, I know what youêre doing."
Leonard,"Yes, youêre using chocolates as positive reinforcement for what you consider correct behaviour."
Sheldon,Very good. Chocolate?
Leonard,"No, I donêt want any chocolate! Sheldon, you canêt train my girlfriend like a lab rat."
Sheldon,"Actually, it turns out I can."
Leonard,"Well, you shouldnêt."
Sheldon,"Thereês just no pleasing you, is there, Leonard? You werenêt happy with my previous approach to dealing with her, so I decided to employ operant conditioning techniques, building on the work of Thorndike and B.F. Skinner. By this time next week, I believe I can have her jumping out of a pool, balancing a beach ball on her nose."
Leonard,"No, this has to stop now."
Sheldon,"Iêm not suggesting we really make her jump out of a pool. I thought the _bazingaî was implied. Iêm just tweaking her personality, sanding off the rough edges if you will."
Leonard,"No, youêre not sanding Penny."
Sheldon,"Are you saying that Iêm forbidden from applying a harmless, scientifically valid protocol that will make our lives better?"
Leonard,"Yes, youêre forbidden."
Sheldon,Bad Leonard.
Howard,"Oh, you know, goth stuff. Goth magazines, goth music."
Raj,Goth food.
Raj,UhÑ blackened salmon?
Raj,"Oh, weêre scientists."
Howard,"Yeah, you know, the dark sciences."
Raj,"Well, I am an astrophysicist and a lot of that takes place at night. When there are vampires and miscellaneous undead out and about."
Howard,Oy vay.
Raj,That sounds really cool.
Howard,"Does it? Okay, if you like space stuff, I design components for the international space station. Which is in space. Where, as Iêm sure you know, no one can hear you scream."
Raj,So what do you gals do?
Howard,Really? How about that? Iêve been to the Gap.
Raj,"Yeah, Iêve been there as well. I like your tee-shirts with the little pocket."
Raj,"Sure, we like fun."
Howard,We are fun people.
Raj,Dark and fun.
Howard,Did you bring the black condoms?
Raj,In my fanny pack.
Howard,Letês go.
Raj,Are you happy now?
Howard,Not particularly.
Penny,"Ohê my God, she didnêt!"
Leonard,What could she possibly be talking about for so long?
Sheldon,"Obviously, waitressing at the Cheesecake Factory is a complex socioeconomic activity, that requires a great deal of analysis and planning. Bazinga! You know, using positive reinforcement techniques, I could train that behaviour out of her in a week."
Sheldon,"If you let me use negative reinforcement, I can get it done before we go to bed."
Leonard,Youêre not squirting her in the face with water.
Sheldon,"No, of course not. Weêre talking very mild electric shocks. No tissue damage whatsoever."
Leonard,Forget it.
Sheldon,"Oh, come on, you canêt tell me that youêre not intrigued about the possibility of building a better girlfriend."
Leonard,"Iêm not. And Pennyês qualities, both good and bad, are what make her who she is."
Sheldon,"You mean, like that high-pitched, irritating laugh?"
Leonard,Youêre not changing how Penny laughs.
Sheldon,"No, that would be incongruous, I was going to lower the whole voice to a more pleasing register."
Sheldon,Come again?
Penny,"Yeah, freaky."
Sheldon,Have a chocolate.
Penny,Thank you.
Raj,Are you seriously going to deface your body just for the possibility you could have cheap sex with a strange girl you met in a bar?
Howard,"Uh, yeah!"
Raj,What is your mother going to say?
Howard,Sheês not going to see it. She takes my temperature orally now.
Howard,"Well, I canêt really decide between a screaming devil, this mean little skull or Kermit the Frog."
Howard,"You know  Hi ho, Iêm on Howardês butt!"
Howard,"Yeah, Iêd like the mean little skull, please."
Raj,"With my luck, hepatitis"
Howard,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
Howard,"I know, but it was cold. Ow, ow, ow!"
Howard,What comes after the stencil?
Howard,"Aaaaaargh! Okay, thatês it, no needle, no pain, no tattoo."
Howard,"No, I havenêt, look.  Iêm sorry, Iêm a fraud, heês a fraud."
Raj,Weêre both frauds.
Howard,"Yeah, I think I covered that."
Raj,But I was summing up.
Howard,"Weêre not goth, weêre just guys."
Raj,"Very, very smart guys."
Howard,Yes. And I wouldnêt blame you if you walked out of here and never wanted to see us again. Unless of course our bold honesty has suddenly made us attractive.
Raj,"When we tell this story, letês end it differently."
Howard,What are you thinking? Maybe a big musical number?
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm going to make some warm milk and then turn in. I trust if you two are planning in engaging in amorous activites, youêll keep the decibel level to a minimum."
Penny,Of course.
Sheldon,Thank you. 
Penny,"Mmm, these are so good"
Leonard,"I was just thinking, we should probably turn in too."
Penny,"well, my new bed got delivered, if you come over and put it together, you can stay at my place."
Leonard,"Really, thatês a lot of work, and itês kind of late."
Penny,"Yeah, but if we stay there, we wonêt have to be quiet."
Leonard,Letês go.
Sheldon,Interesting. Sex works even better than chocolate to modify behaviour. I wonder if anyone else has stumbled on to that.
Howard,"Okay, wait, how about this? We say there were four goth girls, the two girls in the club had two friends."
Raj,"I like it, I like it. Did they smell good despite their gothlike nature?"
Howard,Whatês that got to do with the story?
Raj,Engaging my olfactory sense helps make it real for me.
Howard,"Fine, they smelled good."
Raj,"Oh, they did. Like jasmine and honeysuckle."
Raj,"And then they held hands and did a sexy, demonic hokey-pokey for us."
Howard,"No, no. Look, let me say my story all the way through, and then you can say yours, and then weêll pick."
Raj,Iêm sorry. Go on.
Howard,"Okay. We got tattoos, and then the four girls took us to their place."
Raj,But we donêt have tattoos. What if someone asks to see our tattoos?
Howard,We say theyêre in a very intimate area.
Raj,"Oh, we are bad boys, arenêt we?"
Howard,"Right, right, so we go back to their place, and then the six of us end up in a hot tub."
Raj,But we just got tattoos. Wouldnêt we be concerned about bacterial infection?
Howard,"True. Okay, forget the hot tub. The point is, we each have a m_nage with sexy goth girls."
Raj,Wow. What a great night.
Howard,"Yeah. Hey, want to try a country bar tomorrow night."
Raj,"Yeah, maybe weêll get lucky with some sexy cowgirls."
Howard,Could happen.
Raj,I wonder how they smell.
Sheldon,This movie baffles me every time we watch it.
Leonard,What do you mean?
Sheldon,"Well, the instructions are very clear, donêt feed the gremlins after midnight, donêt get the gremlins wet. How hard is that?"
Penny,"Hi, guys. Hi, honey."
Howard,"Ooh, weêre honey now, are we?"
Sheldon,"Yes. Since their relationship became carnal, Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult."
Penny,Youêre boring people sweetie.
Sheldon,"Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely."
Penny,"So, what are you guys doing?"
Howard,Celebrating Columbus Day.
Leonard,"Weêre watching Goonies, Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes. They were all written by Chris Columbus."
Penny,Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?
Sheldon,The parade.
Penny,"Oh, you know, that reminds me, I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving, but this year theyêre calling it off on account of my brotherês trial."
Leonard,Whatês he on trial for?
Penny,"Oh, just a big misunderstanding. You know, youêd actually like my brother, heês kind of a chemist. Anyway, I was thinking Iêd have thanksgiving here, and you are all invited."
Leonard,Oh. Iêll be there.
Sheldon,Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?
Penny,I guess I could serve both.
Sheldon,You guess? You donêt seem to have much of a handle on this.
Howard,"Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil."
Howard,Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. Itês not as good as it sounds.
Penny,"Raj, what about you?"
Howard,"Oh, he usually comes to my house. Right, pal?  All right, this year, you donêt have to eat the tur-briska-fil. I donêt even chew it. I swallow it like pills."
Leonard,"So, whatês going on with Raj?"
Howard,"Well, the good news is, he has no problem with my motherês tur-brka-fil."
Penny,"Hard to believe, but go on."
Howard,"The bad news is, he says heês getting deported."
Leonard,"What do you mean, heês getting deported?"
Sheldon,"I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country thatês willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally, Iêd choose pirate."
Howard,"Penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?"
Penny,"Ugh, fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues."
Sheldon,"Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today, I understand thatês an all-male profession."
Howard,"Okay, sheês gone."
Raj,Sorry. I lost my cool.
Leonard,"So, whatês going on?"
Raj,"Okay, hereês the deal, six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end."
Raj,"So, my visaês only good as long as Iêm employed at the university, and when they find out Iêve got squat, theyêre going to cut me off. By the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat."
Leonard,"So, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?"
Raj,"You know, checking e-mail, updating my facebook status, messing up wikipedia entries. Hey, did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?"
Sheldon,And youêve continued to take the universityês money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate.
Raj,"I donêt want to go back to India. Itês hot and loud, and thereês so many people. You have no idea, theyêre everywhere."
Howard,"Okay, guys, think, how do we keep Raj in the country?"
Penny,Why doesnêt he just get another job?
Howard,What are you asking me for? I donêt know if you can talk now or not.
Raj,"Oh, beef, Iêm going to miss you so much. Do you know, at the Mumbai McDonaldês, you canêt get a Big Mac? All you can get is a Chicken Maharaja Mac. And the special sauce, curry, which, in India,"
Leonard,"Donêt worry, youêll find another job."
Raj,Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?î
Sheldon,"Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj."
Raj,Hello Sheldon.
Sheldon,"Forgive me, as you know, Iêm no adept at reading facial cues, but Iêm going to take a stab here, youêre either sad or nauseated."
Raj,Iêm sad.
Sheldon,I was going to say sad. I donêt know why I hedged.
Raj,What are you eating?
Sheldon,Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.
Raj,"Oh, beefaroni. I think Iêll miss you most of all."
Leonard,Iêve always been a little confused about this. Why donêt Hindus eat beef?
Raj,We believe cows are gods.
Sheldon,"Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God."
Raj,"Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood Iêm in, Iêll take you out, I swear to cow!"
Sheldon,Iêm sorry.
Raj,"Me, too. Iêm just, Iêm a little on edge."
Sheldon,"Understandable. Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best."
Raj,Thank you.
Sheldon,And youêre wrong about Hinduism and cows.
Howard,"Hey, Raj, guess what. Professor Laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution research team."
Raj,"You, youêre kidding. Thatês fantastic!"
Howard,"Come on, what are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview."
Raj,Iêm on it.
Sheldon,"Thatês happy, right?"
Sheldon,Nailed it.
Raj,"No, no, itês a very promising area. In a perfect world Iêd spend several more years on it. But I just couldnêt pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis."
Raj,"Itês a little early, isnêt it?"
Raj,"Thatês very good. Jolly amusing, but if you donêt mind, Iêll hold off until sunset on titan."
Raj,"Thank you, sir. "
Raj,"Well, I ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency."
Raj,"Thank you. Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? So, when do I start?"
Howard,What do you mean you didnêt get the job? How could you not get it?
Raj,"You know, heês British, Iêm Indian, ever since Gandhi they havenêt liked us very much."
Leonard,"Wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because we should file a complaint."
Raj,"Thatês okay. A complaint has been filed. So, thatês it. That was my last hope. Iêm going to be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin Sanjay. Or, as you may know him, Dave from AT&T customer service."
Howard,Iêm really going to miss you.
Raj,Will you come visit me in India?
Howard,"Gee, thatês, like, a 17-hour flight. How about I meet you halfway?"
Raj,Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan.
Howard,"Tell you what, weêll skype."
Sheldon,"Raj, did you get the job with Professor Laughlin?"
Sheldon,"I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, I have returned to save the day. Odd, usually, heês met by cheers. Anyway, I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that I could benefitÑ"
Leonard,"Excuse me, Sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?"
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, if you didnêt cheer at my entrance, itês too late to buy into the premise. Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and raj can come work for me."
Raj,You want me to work with you?
Sheldon,For me. Youêre going to have to listen more carefully when youêre on the job.
Raj,"Okay, uh, please donêt take this the wrong way, but Iêd rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you."
Sheldon,For me.
Raj,"Sheldon, are you busy?"
Sheldon,Of course Iêm busy.
Raj,Shall I wait?
Sheldon,"Yes, please.  How may I help you?"
Raj,Iêve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.
Sheldon,For me.
Raj,"Yes, for you. I do, however, have a few conditions. First, at all times, I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second, my contributions shall be noted in all published material. And third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture."
Sheldon,"Iêm impressed, Raj. Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions."
Raj,Thank you.
Sheldon,I reject them all.
Raj,Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, I believe youêve misunderstood. Iêm not giving you the job. Iêm simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, weêll get started with the interview."
Raj,WhaÑ Youêre kidding!
Raj,All right.
Sheldon,"So, thatês what you wear to an interview?"
Raj,"Come on, dude, weêve been friends for years."
Sheldon,"Oh, pulling strings, are we?"
Raj,"Sheldon, for Godês sakes, donêt make me beg."
Sheldon,Bazinga! Youêve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. Iêm your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.
Penny,"Ah, itês nice having the place to ourselves, isnêt it?"
Leonard,"Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I donêt have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy."
Penny,"Mm-hmm. Hey, want to get a little crazy?"
Leonard,What are you thinking?
Penny,Letês slide over to Sheldonês spot a make out.
Leonard,You are a dirty girl.
Penny,"Oh, God, how did he know?"
Leonard,"Hi, Howard."
Howard,Am I interrupting?
Leonard,"Little bit, yeah."
Howard,Guess I should have called.
Penny,"Yeah, maybe."
Howard,Tonightês the night I usually go line dancing with Raj at the palomino.
Howard,But heês working with Sheldon.
Penny,"Yes, we know."
Howard,Want me to leave?
Leonard,"You know, whatever."
Howard,"Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while. So what are we watching? Sex and the city."
Penny,"Hey, I happen to love this movie."
Howard,"Fine, letês watch it. Maybe all our periods will synchronize."
Sheldon,"All right, weêre going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space."
Raj,"Ooh, dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. I was making a joke."
Sheldon,Iêm the boss. I make the jokes.
Raj,"Sorry, go ahead and make your joke."
Sheldon,"This is not the time for joking. Weêre doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus."
Raj,"All right, letês buckle down and work."
Raj,I need an aspirin.
Sheldon,Top desk drawer.
Raj,Thank you.
Leonard,That was fun. Thank you.
Penny,"Leonard, honey, you donêt have to say thank you every time we have sex."
Leonard,Oh. Okay. Tomorrow youêre going to get a card in the mail. Just throw it away.
Howard,Top oê the morninêo ya!
Leonard,What are you doing here?
Howard,"Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but heês still working with Sheldon, so I thought Iêd come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. Itês the perfect meal for apres lêamour."
Penny,"Oh, kill me."
Howard,"By the way, I couldnêt help overhearing your big finish. Bravo, Leonard."
Penny,"See, if you had killed me when I said kill me, I wouldnêt have had to hear that."
Howard,"What do you guys think? Want to take in a matinee, maybe go rollerblading, catch a step class?"
Penny,Do something.
Leonard,"Yeah, okay. Um, Howard, we need to talk."
Howard,"Sure. ‚sup, homes?"
Leonard,"Uh, please understand that itês not that we donêt want you around, but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time."
Howard,"Oh. I get it, Iêm the third wheel. Sorry, I should have seen that. Iêll get out of your way. Uh, youêre gonna want to eat those eggs while theyêre still hot."
Leonard,"Thank you. Thereês lox and cream cheese in the fridge, the bagels are in the oven, I was warming them up."
Penny,Thatês great.
Howard,Ill just hang out with my mom. Thatês always fun.
Penny,Are we terrible people?
Leonard,I donêt know. What do you want me to do?
Penny,"Get him, bring him back."
Leonard,Are you sure?
Leonard,Okay. Howard come back.
Howard,"Oh, you guys had me scared for a minute."
Raj,"No, no, no, no! That rate is much too low for what weêd expect from this collision. Do you understand that weêre talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?"
Sheldon,Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?
Raj,Iêm the astrophysicist. Astro means space.
Sheldon,Astro means star.
Raj,"Okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, Iêd be kicking your butt."
Sheldon,English is your native language.
Raj,"Okay, you got me there, but youêre wrong about this!"
Sheldon,There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.
Raj,"My god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well, let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca."
Raj,It means doo-doo.
Sheldon,"All right! First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with meÑ"
Raj,Aha! So I am working with you.
Sheldon,"In this context, with me means for me."
Raj,"Ah, well, in this contextÑ "
Sheldon,"Oh! If Iêm wrong, prove it."
Raj,Okay. Hereês where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.
Sheldon,"No, no, no, youêve misstated the atomic weight of the target."
Raj,Let me finish.
Sheldon,Youêre defacing my work.
Raj,"Iêm not defacing it, Iêm fixing it."
Sheldon,Give me the eraser.
Sheldon,I said give it to me.
Raj,Come and get it.
Sheldon,"Fine.  Oh, lord. Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!"
Raj,You are not my superior.
Sheldon,I am in every way.
Raj,"Oh, yeah? Can you do this? "
Sheldon, Raj.
Raj,Iêm busy.
Sheldon,"Doing what?  All right, youêve made your point."
Raj,"What do you want, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,I looked over the board and it turns out you were right.
Raj,So you were wrong.
Sheldon,I didnêt say that.
Raj,Thatês the only logical inference.
Sheldon,"Nevertheless, I didnêt say it. Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me."
Raj,For you or with you?
Sheldon,In this context for me could mean with me.
Raj,"All right, but I have some conditions."
Sheldon,I reject them all.
Raj,Iêll take the job. See you Monday.
Sheldon,"Wait, you have to drive me home."
Raj,How did you get here?
Sheldon,I walked.
Raj,So walk home.
Sheldon,"I canêt. Thereês a big dog outside. On the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles."
Raj,All right. 
Howard,"All right, Raj has played his phantom warlord card, and I am going to back him up with my strangling vines. Choke on that, sucka."
Leonard,"Okay, well, then Iêll just cut your vines with my ruby sword. Thatês right, I did it. I cut êem."
Penny,"Um, I have a question."
Leonard,"Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf, elf beats water sprite, and basically everything beats enchanted bunny."
Howard,Unless you have the carrot power.
Penny,"Okay, Iêve got another question. When does this get fun?"
Howard,Are we going to talk or are we going to play Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?
Leonard,Just play a potion card.
Penny,Which one?
Sheldon,It doesnêt matter. You canêt possibly win.
Leonard,"Sheldon, donêt ruin the game."
Penny,How could he ruin the game?
Sheldon,"Given the cards that have already been played, Penny can only be holding necromancer potions, which are only effective against wraiths and day-walkers, and there are no more of either left to be drawn. The cards remaining in the undrawn stack are four fire weapons, a troll, two ogres and the jewel of Osiris."
Leonard,See? Ruined.
Penny,"Sheldon, that is incredible."
Sheldon,"From your vantage point, it certainly must seem so."
Leonard,Sheldon has kind of a photographic memory.
Sheldon,"Photographic is a misnomer. I have an eidetic memory, as Iêve told you many times. Most recently last year during lunch on the afternoon of may seventh. You had turkey and complained it was dry."
Howard,"Well, I guess gameês over."
Penny,"Really? Oh, great. I mean, aw. Okay, I gotta go."
Penny,"Because the last me I didnêt go, I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka."
Howard,Not Ka. Ka-ah.
Leonard,See ya. Still canêt believe sheês going out with me.
Raj,Nobody can.
Howard,"That reminds me, I have a bone to pick with you."
Howard,"You and I made a pact that if either of us ever got a hot girlfriend, that person would have his girlfriend hook the other guy up with one of her girlfriends."
Leonard,"Yeah, I donêt remember that."
Sheldon,"June 30th, 2004. Opening day of Spider-man 2 at the AMC Pasadena. They only had red icees, no blue."
Leonard,"Oh, yeah."
Howard,"So youêve been with Penny for like a month and a half now. Whereês my shorty, Morty?"
Leonard,"Howard, you canêt hold me to that."
Howard,Why not?
Leonard,"Because when I made that agreement, I didnêt think Iêd ever have a hot girlfriend. And I was positive you never would."
Raj,"Hey, how come I wasnêt part of this deal?"
Sheldon,You had left the refreshment stand in order to indulge in your customary preemptive pre-show urination.
Raj,"Oh, so thatês how it works? I have a teeny bladder and now I donêt get a hot girlfriend?"
Howard,"Yeah, Raj, thatês how it works."
Leonard,"Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?"
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, no."
Leonard,But you have a whole bunch of êem.
Sheldon,"Yes, Iêve moved to a four-napkin system. Lap, hands, face and personal emergencies. If you like, starting tomorrow, Iêll add a guest napkin, but Iêm afraid thereês nothing I can do for you today.  Good luck. Thatês the face napkin."
Howard,"So, have you talked to Penny yet?"
Leonard,"No, I havenêt."
Howard,Why not?
Leonard,"Because Iêve been busy, because I havenêt figured out a way to bring it up, and mostly, and I canêt stress how key this is, because I donêt want to."
Howard,"Leonard, a pact is a pact. You have to get Penny to fix me up."
Leonard,"Itês not that simple. What am I supposed to say? Penny, do you have any friends youêd like to never hear from again?"
Howard,"Come on, Iêm smart, I have good job and I have only three percent body fat."
Raj,"Itês true. Iêve seen him at the beach, heês like a human chicken wing."
Howard,"Leonard, come on."
Leonard,Fine. Iêll ask if she has a friend for you.
Howard,A hot friend.
Howard,And tall. I want our kids to be able to ride space mountain before theyêre 20.
Leonard,Iêll see what I can do.
Raj,"Hey, Sheldon, guess what I heard today?"
Sheldon,"Iêd imagine you heard any number of things today. When you arrived at work you undoubtedly heard, hello, Raj, how are you, Raj? Given that youêre wearing a new sweater-vest, you may have heard new sweater-vest? And possibly, though far less likely, nice sweater-vest."
Raj,Why donêt I just tell you what I heard today.
Sheldon,That would probably save us some time.
Raj,"Saturday night at the comic book store, theyêre having a Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is five hundred dollars. If we team up, weêd be unstoppable."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, Raj, but I have no interest in playing a game in which I find no challenge."
Raj,What about the money?
Sheldon,I have money.
Raj,But this is other money.
Sheldon,How does it different from the money I have?
Raj,Half of it will be mine.
Sheldon,Do you need it to buy a less disturbing sweater-vest?
Raj,"Leonard, help."
Leonard,Are you kidding? I couldnêt even talk him into giving me one of his freakinê napkins.
Penny,"Wow, you really are a genius."
Leonard,"Not really. I googled how to do that. So, listen, have you ever made a pact with someone?"
Penny,"You mean, like a pinky swear?"
Leonard,"Okay, fine, like a pinky swear."
Penny,"Well, in the first grade, my friend Rosie and I made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie. You know, from Sesame Street?"
Leonard,"Yeah, Iêm familiar with Bert and Ernie."
Penny,Then we found out we both wanted Ernie. We didnêt speak again until middle school.
Leonard,Over puppets?
Penny,"The heart wants what the heart wants, Leonard."
Leonard,"Okay. Speaking of what the heart wants, um, a long time ago, I made a pact with Wolowitz that kind of involves you."
Penny,"Okay, I donêt know where youêre going with this, but tread carefully because it may be the last conversation we ever have."
Leonard,"No, no, nothing like that. The deal was that if either of us ever got a girlfriend, weêd have her fix the other one up with one of her friends."
Penny,And you thought a good time to bring this up be right after sex.
Leonard,"Well, I sure as hell wasnêt going to bring it up before sex, and during, I was trying to remember what I read on google, soÑ"
Penny,Iêm not hooking Wolowitz up with one of my friends.
Leonard,"Come on, it doesnêt have to be a good friend. And you know that deep down inside, Howardês a really nice guy."
Penny,The problem isnêt whatês on the inside. Itês the creepy candy coating.
Leonard,Will you at least think about it? Just as a favour to me?
Penny,"Oh, great thing about Ernie, was he never asked me for anything. He just gave."
Sheldon,Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Betty and Veronica? Ugh.
Sheldon,Thank you. You just robbed me of the opportunity to stumble upon the figurine and make the oh-so-satisfying journey from discovery to desire to possession.
Sheldon,But I must have it.
Sheldon,"Thank you. You know, I can buy all these things online. I come here for the personal service."
Raj,"Hey, Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up for the mystic warlords tournament THE Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?"
Sheldon,Excuse me. Are you saying that Wil Wheaton aka Ensign Wesley Crusher on Star Trek:
Sheldon,"You donêt understand. Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton? Wesley Crusher had an eidetic memory just like me."
Raj,"Oh, what a coincidence. Maybe you can discuss that with him while youêre playing in the tournament. Sign here."
Sheldon,"I was such a fan that in 1995, I travelled ten hours by bus to a sci-fi convention in Jackson, Mississippi, wearing my Star Fleet Academy cadet uniform in order to meet Wil Wheaton and get him to autograph my mint in-package Wesley Crusher action figure."
Raj,"Ooh, itêll be like a reunion then. Sign here."
Sheldon,"My arduous journey, however, was for naught. Although advertised to appear, he did not show up. It was at that moment, I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton."
Raj,"Okay, great, you can tell him you hate him. Sign here."
Sheldon,"It might also interest you to know that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth on my all-time enemies list, right between director Joel Schumacher, who nearly destroyed the Batman movie franchise, and Billy Sparks, who lived down the street from me and put dog poop on the handles of my bicycle."
Raj,"Okay, I get it, heês a bad guy. Sign here."
Sheldon,"In the words of Khan Noonien Singh in the immortal wrath of Khan, he tasks me, he tasks me and I shall have him."
Raj,"No doubt, sign here."
Sheldon,"From hellês heart, I stab at thee."
Howard,"So, tell me more about the future mother of my children."
Penny,"Sheês adorable, Howard. I think youêll like her."
Howard,Great. So what did you tell her about me? Did you mention the body fat?
Penny,"No, I thought that would be a nice surprise for her."
Howard,"Good, good."
Penny,"I just told her youêre an aerospace engineer, you speak five languagesÑ"
Howard,Six if you count Klingon.
Leonard,"Girls donêt count Klingon, Howard. Right?"
Penny,"Right. Oh, and I told her you have an unhealthy attachment to your mother."
Penny,Iêm kidding.
Leonard,Another delightful surprise for her.
Raj,"Sheldon, itês your play. Sheldon."
Sheldon,My enchanted troll bludgeons your screaming harpy with a cursed mace. Game.
Raj,"Sorry, boys. Say hi to your mother when she picks you up. Or I could just tell her later tonight! We pwned them, dude! Up top!"
Sheldon,"Look at him. Wil Wheaton, my old friend, I have chased you round the moons of Nibia and round the Antares maelstrom and round perditionês flames!"
Raj,"You know you keep quoting Wrath of Khan, but he was in next generation. Itês a totally different set of characters."
Sheldon,Silence! How much longer must I wait for my revenge?
Raj,"Well, if Wil Wheaton and Stuart win their match and we beat lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants in the next round, weêll face off for the championship."
Sheldon,"So, my path to satisfaction is blocked by lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants. Very well. They must be destroyed."
Raj,"Dude, you have to stop talking like that. Itês really lame."
Howard,"So, Penny tells me youêre working as a waitress to put yourself through grad school. Thatês pretty great, what are you studying?"
Howard,"Oh, cool. So you could study me."
Bernadette,I donêt understand.
Howard,Microbiology is the study of tiny living things.
Bernadette,"I know, Iêm studying it."
Howard,And I said you could study me êcause Iêm a tiny living thing. Itês a joke.
Bernadette,Are you sure?
Howard,Do you like science-fiction?
Howard,Role-playing games?
Bernadette,Like in the bedroom or like Dungeons and Dragons?
Leonard,Gonna be a long night.
Penny,"Yeah, well, itês your fault."
Leonard,I had to ask. You didnêt have to say yes.
Howard,You like magic?
Bernadette,Not really.
Leonard,"Long, long night."
Sheldon,"I play my endless serpent. Raj will play ecstatic frenzy, which means Larry will have to play chaos overlord, then Captain Sweatpants, molten river. I play nightshade dryad, game, set and match. Now fetch me Wil Wheaton! bortaS bIr jabluêDIê reH QaQquê nayê"
Howard,How about computers? Do you like computers?
Bernadette,I use them. I donêt like them.
Howard,OkayÑ Puppies? Where do you stand on puppies?
Bernadette,A puppy once bit my face.
Howard,Of course it did.
Leonard,How about that? Einstein was wrong.
Leonard,Approaching the speed of light doesnêt slow down time. Approaching them does.
Howard,"Excuse me. Oh, damn. Itês my mother."
Bernadette,Are you going to answer it?
Howard,"Iêm torn. She might be dying, and, you know, I wouldnêt want to miss that. On the other hand, if I let it go to voicemail, I could play it over and over."
Bernadette,I know how you feel. My mother makes me crazy.
Howard,Not as crazy as my mother makes me.
Bernadette,"Oh, yeah? Does your mother call you every day at work to see if youêve had a healthy lunch?"
Howard,My mother calls me at work to see if I had a healthy bowel movement.
Bernadette,"Okay, well, does she lay out your clothes for you in the morning like youêre nine years old?"
Howard,You live with your mother?
Bernadette,Thatês the sad part.
Howard,"Ooh, rough. Okay, check this out. My mother made me wear rubber gloves to kindergarten so I wouldnêt pick up a disease from the other children."
Bernadette,Thatês nothing. I couldnêt ride a bicycle êcause my mother was afraid Iêd hit a bump and lose my virginity.
Howard,"Oh, wow. You didnêt, did you?"
Bernadette,Not on a bicycle. In a Camry.
Howard,More wine?
Bernadette,Iêd love some.
Howard,"Listen, you have to come to shabbat dinner at my house sometime."
Howard,A catholic girl like you wearing a big cross like that might just give my mother the big brain aneurysm Iêve been hoping for.
Bernadette,"Okay, but only if you come to Sunday dinner at my house wearing a yarmulke."
Howard,Itês a date.
Penny,Am I a matchmaker or what?
Raj,Lava serpent.
Sheldon,Underworld guardian. We skirmish to the death.
Sheldon,Luminescence spell.
Sheldon,Fire demon.
Sheldon,Three-headed lion.
Raj,"Problem, Wil Wheaton?"
Sheldon,"Youêre holding two moderate spell cards, a small rock and a potion of Zancor, which will be about as much help as an air conditioner on the ice planet Hoth. Your only move is to play the potion, lose the skirmish, and two moves later, the game."
Sheldon,"The year was 1995, the place, Jackson, Mississippi. Having spent ten hours on a bus, during which I had to twice violate my personal rule against relieving myself on board a moving vehicle, I finally arrived at the fourth annual Dixie-Trek convention only to find that my idol Wil Wheaton decided he had better things to do than to show up and sign my action figure."
Sheldon,"You betrayed me, Wil Wheaton. Now I have my revenge."
Sheldon,Your mee-maw died? Thatês terrible.
Sheldon,"No, no, I understand. Anything happened to my mee-maw, Iêd be one inconsolable moon pie. I should clarify that statement by explaining that she calls me moon pie."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes."
Raj,"Okay, great, everybody loves their grandmas! Now, come on, Sheldon, finish him off!"
Raj,"What are you waiting for? Kill Wil Wheaton! From hellês heart, stab at him!"
Sheldon,I canêt.
Raj,Sure you can. Do it! Do it!
Sheldon,"I came here to defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who destroyed my dreams. But I canêt defeat Wil Wheaton, the man who loved his mee-maw. Enchanted bunny."
Raj,No! Not enchanted bunny!
Sheldon,IÑ IÑ I donêt understand. Your grandmotherês alive?
Sheldon,Wheaton! Wheaton! Wheaton!
Leonard,"Kites, ho!"
Howard,Kites ho!
Raj,Kites ho!
Sheldon,"Excuse me. Youêre misusing the word ho. Itês an interjection used to call attention to a destination, not an object, as in, uh, Land, ho! Or, uh, Westward, ho!"
Penny,"Hey, guys. What you doing? Going out to discover electricity?"
Leonard,"If youêre referring to the work of Benjamin Franklin, he did not discover electricity, he merely used a kite to determine that lightning consists of electricity. He also invented the Franklin stove, bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter. Kites, ho."
Leonard,Weêre heading out for some kite fighting.
Penny,Kite fighting?
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. Itês an extremely competitive, cutthroat sport."
Sheldon,"Well, actually, the risk of throat cutting is very low. On the other hand, severe string burn is a real and ever-Present danger."
Leonard,You want to come watch?
Penny,"Oh, gee, sounds amazing, but, um, Iêve got some friends coming over. Not a big thing, weêre just gonna watch the Nebraska game."
Leonard,"Oh. Football, sure."
Howard,Good guess.
Penny,"I wouldêve invited you, but I know youêre not a football fan."
Leonard,"No, no, Iêm not, so, great. Youêve got plans doing something you like, Iêve got plans doing something I like, so itês good."
Penny,"Well, maybe weêll hang out later, you know, after everybodyês gone."
Leonard,"Yeah, great."
Penny,See ya.
Leonard,"Well, this sucks."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, I got bored and drifted off. Where exactly in the interaction did the sucking lie?"
Raj,"Leonard just realized that Pennyês been hiding him from her friends because heês a tiny, little man who flies kites."
Sheldon,"Oh, that certainly would suck."
Sheldon,"Wolowitz is trying to outflank us. Let out some string, add altitude and Iêll go under and cut his line."
Leonard,Why wouldnêt Penny want her friends to meet me?
Sheldon,"Focus, Leonard, focus! The heat of battle is upon us, the dogs of war are unleashed."
Leonard,"Maybe Koothrappaliês right, maybe I embarrass her."
Sheldon,"Youêre embarrassing me right now, a grown man worrying about such nonsense when in the middle of flying kites."
Sheldon,Sorry wonêt bring their kites down. Ow! String burn! String burn!
Raj,"Oh, they think weêre flanking, theyêre playing right into our hands. On the count of three, we execute the flying scissor. One, twoÑ"
Howard,Whoa! Did you see that?
Raj,See what?
Howard,"That chick, she smiled at me."
Raj,"No, she didnêt."
Howard,"Yes, she did."
Raj,"Come on, scissors, scissors!"
Howard,Hold my line.
Raj,"Wait, what are you doing? I canêt scissors by myself! Howard! Come back!"
Raj,Son of a bitch.
Raj,"Youêre a sucky friend, you know that? A sucky, sucky friend."
Howard,What was I supposed to do? She gave me that come-hither look.
Raj,If she gave you any look at l. It was a you suck look.
Howard,I wouldêve caught up to her if I hadnêt pulled a hammy.
Raj,"Oh, please, you weigh 80 pounds. You donêt have a hammy."
Leonard,"So, Penny doesnêt want me around her friends, I embarrass her. What else could it be?"
Sheldon,"Well, her actions could be out of concern for your feelings. Perhaps sheês excluded you from these gatherings because sheês scouting for a new mate and doesnêt want to do it in front of you."
Leonard,"Oh, how kind of her."
Sheldon,Agreed. Most primates donêt show that sort of discretion. A female bonobo will copulate with a new male in front of the old one without so much as a how do you do?
Raj,"You always do this, you know? You ditch me for a woman you donêt have a shot with."
Howard,I totally had a shot.
Raj,"With a woman you were chasing through a park? Thatês not a shot, thatês a felony. Whatês worse, it cost me my prized Patang fighting kite. Sheldon, I donêt suppose thereês any chance you could give me my kite back?"
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, Raj, but the rules of aerial warfare dictate at the fallen kite go to the victor. And without rules, the competition has no meaning. And without meaning, the following would be an empty gesture.  I have your kite. I have your kite."
Leonard,How was your football party?
Penny,It was pretty good. We won.
Leonard,"Oh, thatês excellent. Itês a weird figure of speech, isnêt it, we won when you werenêt"
Penny,Iêm glad to hear it.
Leonard,"Oh, hey, on a related subject, are you embarrassed to have me around your friends?"
Penny,"Oh, my god, no. Why would you ask that?"
Leonard,"Well, you know, I just noticed I havenêt really met any of them."
Penny,Sure you have.
Leonard,"Well, yeah, no, I met the huge ex-boyfriend and the smaller yet still larger than me ex-boyfriend. Were they here today?"
Penny,Of course not.
Leonard,Of course not. Why would they be? Why would I ask? Why am I rambling? Why donêt you stop me?
Penny,"Leonard, look, if you want to meet my friends, that would be great. I just, you know, I didnêt want you to be bored."
Leonard,I wouldnêt be bored. Why would I be bored?
Penny,"Well, êcause theyêre not genius scientists."
Leonard,"Penny, I like all sorts of people. In fact, some of my best friends arenêt geniuses."
Penny,Like who?
Leonard,"Okay, some of my Facebook friends arenêt geniuses. My point is, if weêre going to be a couple, I should be friends with your friends."
Penny,"Okay, great. Well, then why donêt you come over next Saturday and watch the game with us."
Leonard,Another football game?
Penny,They have them every week.
Leonard,Did not know that.
Penny,You wanted to meet my friends.
Leonard,"Sure, sure, just I donêt know much about football."
Penny,"Oh, thatês okay, a lot of the guysê girlfriends donêt know football. They just kind of drink and talk in the kitchen."
Leonard,"Okay, a complete pass. First down, New England. I think Iêm starting to get this."
Raj,"Really? The only thing Iêve learned in the last two hours is that American men love drinking beer, pee too often and have trouble getting erections."
Leonard,"Focus on the game, not the commercials, Raj."
Raj,"Iêm just saying, maybe if you people cut back on the beer, you could get out of the bathroom and satisfy your women without pharmaceutical help."
Howard,"Raj, what are you doing here? You were supposed to help me pimp out my Vespa."
Raj,"Iêm sorry, are you under the impression that weêre still friends?"
Howard,"Oh come on, youêre not still grinding on the kite thing, are you?"
Raj,"Itês not just the kite thing. Every time we go some place, you think you can just dump me whenever someone prettier comes along, even though you donêt have a shot with them."
Howard,But I had a shot with that jogger.
Raj,Fine. Paint green flames on your little scooter with her. 
Howard,Itês not a little scooter. Itês the second biggest Vespa they make! Are you watching football?
Leonard,"Thereês no fooling you. Now, what is this sacks statistic they put up there?"
Howard,"All I know about Saks is, my mother shops there."
Leonard,"Sacks, sacksÑ"
Sheldon,Itês football nomenclature for when a quarterback is tackled behind the line of scrimmage.
Leonard,HuhÑ ScrimmageÑ
Sheldon,The line of scrimmage is the imaginary transverse line separating the offence from the defence.
Howard,Sheldon knows football?
Howard,"I mean, Quidditch, sure. But football?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, how do you know this stuff?"
Sheldon,"I grew up in Texas. Football is ubiquitous in Texas. Pro football, college football, high school football, peewee football, in fact, every form of football except the original, European football, which most Texans believe to be a Commie plot."
Sheldon,"If youêre interested, I also know all about frying meat that isnêt chicken as if it were chicken."
Leonard,So you could teach me?
Sheldon,Football or chicken-fried meats?
Leonard,Football. Iêm going to Pennyês on Saturday to watch a game with her friends and I donêt want to look like an idiot. I want to blend in.
Sheldon,"If you want to blend in with Pennyês friends, Iêd think looking like an idiot would be the perfect camouflage."
Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon, please teach me about football. Itêll be fun."
Sheldon,"Thatês exactly what my father said. Come to the games, watch the games, week in and week out from the time I was five until I went off to college. Longest seven years of my life."
Leonard,"Please, Iêm asking you as a friend."
Sheldon,Are you making this a tier one friendship request?
Leonard,I really appreciate this.
Sheldon,"Yeah, yeah. All right, Poindexter, sit down, shut up and listen."
Leonard,Iêm sorry?
Sheldon,"Thatês how my father always began our football conversations. And if youêd like, after the game, Iêll take you outside and teach you how to shoot close enough to a racoon that it craps itself."
Leonard,When are you going to stop making Cylon toast?
Sheldon,When I have enough to destroy all the human toast on the battlestar known as Galactica. Is that what youêre wearing to watch football at Pennyês?
Leonard,Whatês wrong with a football jersey?
Sheldon,"Nothing. That, however, appears to be a football cocktail dress."
Leonard,"Iês the smallest size they had, except the one for dogs. I canêt believe they had one for dogs."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. Canine football fans are a common sight in Texas. Cats, however, refuse to wear sporting apparel. My sister found that out the hard way."
Leonard,"Anyway, wish me luck."
Sheldon,"Leonard, wait. Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Pennyês peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her?"
Leonard,"Well, I wouldnêt put it exactly that way."
Sheldon,How would you put it?
Leonard,"Yeah, okay, like you said."
Sheldon,"Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. Donêt you have access to women who will do it for money? By the way, another accepted usage for the term ho."
Leonard,"Good-Bye, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Hold on I believe that social convention dictate you not arrive empty-Handed. Would you like to bring some Cylon toast?
Leonard,"Yeah, no, Iêm trying to fit in, not get laughed at."
Sheldon,Whatês funny about Cylon toast?
Raj,Itês open.
Howard,"Hey, pal."
Raj,What do you want?
Howard,I brought you a little gift. New kite.
Raj,"The kite you made me lose was an authentic Patang, an Indian fighting kite that my brother sent to me from New Delhi. It took me a day to put together and two days to paint. This is Hello Kitty."
Howard,"Yeah, but it comes with a little coin purse. Does a Patang?"
Raj,"Wow, you just donêt get it, do you? Buying me something pretty isnêt going to make our problem just go away."
Howard,"Look, I admit I havenêt always been the best friend I could be."
Raj,"Youêve been a sucky friend, a sucky, sucky friend."
Raj,"And you do it all the time. Last week in the mall at Radio Shack, we were looking for a phone with giant numbers for your mother, and I suddenly realize youêre not even there."
Howard,"I know, I know."
Raj,And where were you?
Howard,"Getting shot down by the girl at Hot Dog on a Stick. But in my defence, she was gorgeous, and working that squeezer to make the lemonade, going up and down and up and down. It was like a free pole dance right in the middle of the food court."
Raj,Youêre impossible.
Howard,"Hey, at least I can talk to women without being drunk."
Raj,"Excuse me, I have selective mutism, a recognized medical disorder. Youêre just a douche."
Howard,"You know what? Maybe thatês what this whole thingês about. Youêre not mad at me, youêre mad at yourself."
Raj,"No, Iêm mad at you. I hate myself, but Iêm mad at you."
Howard,"Fine. Youêre mad at me. I get it. Now, how about we go spend the day together? Just the two of us. Weêll go anywhere you want."
Raj,I donêt know.
Howard,Come on. Let me take you someplace nice.
Raj,IÑ I do enjoy the La Brea Tar Pits.
Howard,"Really, now? With the traffic and the parking, itêsÑ okay, fine. The Tar Pits. Letês go."
Raj,"Oh, why canêt I stay mad at you?"
Leonard,Go! Go! Go! Go-Go-Go-Go! Yes! Are you people watching this? Is this amazing or what?
Penny,"Sweetie, thatês a highlight from the ê98 championship game."
Leonard,Oh. Did not know that.
Penny,How much beer have you had?
Leonard,"None, why?"
Penny,Oh. I was just kind of hoping you were drunk. Now weêre back live.
Leonard,"Okay, yeah. I can see the difference."
Leonard,"That completely was a forward pass, which they threw intentionally incomplete to avoid loss of yardage or to conserve time. I canêt believe theyêre not being penalized with the loss of a down and by having to move the line of scrimmage back to the spot of the foul."
Penny,"Here, have some pizza, sweetie."
Leonard,"Penny, you know Iêm lactose intolerant."
Penny,I know. I just need you stop talking.
Sheldon, Penny.
Penny,"Sheldon, come in."
Sheldon,"Thank you. Iêd like to make a sandwich, but Iêm out of bread."
Penny,Thereês some in the fridge.
Sheldon,"You shouldnêt keep your bread in the refrigerator. Staleness is caused by crystallization of the starch molecules, which occurs faster at cool temperatures."
Penny,"On Earth, we say thank you."
Sheldon,"So Leonard, how goes the mimesis?"
Sheldon,You know. Mimesis. An action in which the mimic takes on the properties of a specific object or organism. Mimesis.
Leonard,What the hell are you talking about?
Sheldon,"Iêm attempting to communicate with you without my meaning becoming apparent to those around you. Let me try again. Have the indigenous fauna accepted you as one of their own? Nudge, nudge, wink, wink."
Leonard,"Oh, I guess so."
Sheldon,"Good. Oh, FYI. After I eat my sandwich, Iêm taking Koothrappaliês Patang kite out for a test run. Would you like to get your delta-wing raptor and join me?"
Leonard,"I donêt want to fly kites, Sheldon. Weêre watching football here."
Sheldon,I can see that. I was providing you with an alternative. A courtesy I was never offered in similar circumstances.
Leonard,"Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach has thrown down a red flag indicating heês challenging the ruling on the field. I hope heês right, êcause if heês not, itêll cost him one of his three time-Outs."
Penny,"You know, Leonard, honey, I wouldnêt mind if you wanted to go fly kites with Sheldon."
Leonard,"No, Iêll watch the end of the game. Besides, thereês only three minutes left."
Penny,Until half time.
Leonard,This is just half? Weêve been here for hours.
Penny,And youêre gonna be here for a couple more.
Leonard,"Oh, youêre kidding me."
Leonard,Nice meeting all of you.
Penny,"So, yeah, anyway, thatês my boyfriend. He is really smart."
Raj,I really like my saber-toothed cat. Thank you.
Howard,"My pleasure. Maybe after lunch, we can go to Marie Callenderês and have some pie."
Raj,Iêd like that. This is turning out to be a perfect Saturday.
Howard,"Good. Iêm glad. Oh, man. Did you see the way she smiled at me?"
Raj,Fine. Go ahead.
Howard,This is our day.
Raj,"If you want to chase after her, chase after her."
Howard,"Ah, who am I kidding? I wouldnêt have a shot with a girl like that."
Raj,Donêt put yourself down. Youêre a very attractive man.
Howard,You think so?
Raj,"Yeah. Absolutely. It wouldnêt kill you to take a Pilates class with me now and then, but you have a certain wiry appeal."
Howard,"Yeah, well, it doesnêt matter ‚cause she wasnêt really smiling at me."
Raj,"Actually, in this case, I think she was."
Raj,What a douche.
Penny,"Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game."
Sheldon,"Oh, Research Lab is more than a game. Itês like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real."
Leonard,We must not be playing it right.
Penny,"All right, five. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, wow, look at that, my Department of Defence research grant is renewed."
Sheldon,Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider.
Sheldon,"Youêre a natural at this, Penny. And as the first beta testers, you twoêll have quite the edge when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday."
Leonard,"Oh, gee, Sheldon, I donêt think we can play on Sunday."
Sheldon,Why not?
Leonard,Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you. Penny?
Penny,"Actually, I have to pick up my friend Justin from the airport."
Leonard,"There you go, she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport, aAnd I canêt play êcause Iêm going with her, right?"
Penny,"Um, yeah, if you want. I mean, there may not be room. Heês got a lot of stuff, like guitars and amplifiers."
Leonard,Wait. What are you talking about?
Penny,"My friend, Justin."
Sheldon,"Pay attention, Leonard. Thatês why she canêt play on Sunday."
Leonard,Who is this Justin?
Sheldon,"Your turn, Leonard."
Penny,I told you about him.
Leonard,"No, you didnêt."
Sheldon,"Roll the dice, Leonard."
Penny,"Yeah, my friend from Omaha, plays the guitar. Anyway, heês coming to L.A. looking for some session work, so I told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks."
Sheldon,"Come on, Leonard, if you roll a six, Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?"
Leonard,Hang on. Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?
Penny,Heês not some guy. Heês my friend.
Leonard,"So by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who youêre now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friendî?"
Penny,"Well, heês definitely not gay."
Leonard,"Oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriendês couch. Yippee."
Penny,"Okay, we went out a little bit, a long time ago, but we were never like going out."
Leonard,"Okay, not to be pedantic, but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked."
Sheldon,Iêll just roll for you.
Penny,Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?
Leonard,What was your first clue?
Sheldon,Uh-oh! Industrial accident.
Penny,You know what? Donêt talk to me like Iêm an idiot.
Leonard,Iêm not talking to you like youêre an idiot! Iêm saying the whole idea is idiotic!
Sheldon,You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser. Lose one turn and a retina.
Penny,"How is that not talking to me like Iêm an idiot? Itês my friend, itês my couch, and itês my freakinê life!"
Sheldon,Itês also your roll.
Leonard,"You know what? It is your life. If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine. Why donêt you just rent some bunk beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas?"
Penny,"Hey, if I want to invite the entire line up of Lollapalooza to sleep in my apartment, I will, and itês none of your business!"
Leonard,Are you listening to yourself? Do you know how childish you sound right now?
Penny,"Oh, now Iêm a child? Well, at least Iêm not an idiot anymore!"
Leonard,The two arenêt mutually exclusive!
Penny,"Oh, you are such aÑ  What the hell is he doing?"
Leonard,Heês drowning us out. He doesnêt like fighting.
Penny,"Sheldon, just stop, look, the fight is over. Oh, and FYI, you never even heard of The Black Eyed Peas until you met me!"
Leonard,"I heard of êem. Didnêt know they were a band. Sheldon, sheês gone. You can turn off the blender."
Sheldon,Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?
Leonard,"No, we just had a little spat."
Sheldon,"Look on the bright side. As the result of Pennyês forfeit, you have become the worldês first winner of Research Lab. Would you like a commemorative snow cone?"
Leonard,I donêt get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.
Sheldon,"Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car."
Leonard,"I donêt want to play a game, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Itês called Scientists. Now, I will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay, ready to have some fun?"
Leonard,"An old boyfriend whoês definitely not gay. Thatês what a guy likes to hear, definitely."
Sheldon,"All right, Iêll start with an easy one, um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr."
Leonard,And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!
Sheldon,"Hint, Madame Curie had her husband to help her."
Leonard,"What am I supposed to say? Sure, Penny, Iêm cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. Well, Leonard, it doesnêt matter if youêre cool or not because Iêm Penny and Iêm pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want! Oh, I get it! You think youêre doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! No, no, Leonard! Iêm doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!"
Sheldon,Leonard! Stop the car!
Sheldon,I canêt listen to the two of you fight anymore.
Sheldon,"Come on, come on, weêre late."
Leonard,"Calm down, weêll make the movie."
Sheldon,"I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means weêll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination."
Raj,"Oh, dude, I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull."
Sheldon,"Go, go, Power Rangers, go!"
Leonard,"Hey. Weêre, uh, going to the movies."
Sheldon,"No, weêre not. Weêre standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter."
Leonard,"Hang on. Theyêre showing a new digital print of Time Bandits, you wouldnêt want to come, would you?"
Penny,"Not really, no."
Sheldon,"All right, invitation pointlessly offered, invitation declined as expected, everyoneês civil, nobodyês fighting. Have a nice evening."
Leonard,Just give us a minute.
Howard,"Oh, take all the time you need."
Leonard,"So, are we going to talk about last night?"
Penny,Are you ready to apologize?
Penny,"E-e-e-e-eh! Wrong answer, but thank you for playing."
Leonard,"Oh, come on. This is stupid."
Penny,"Oh, there it is again! You think Iêm stupid!"
Leonard,"No, thereês a difference between being stupid and acting stupid."
Penny,"Oh, yeah? well, thereês a difference between being a jerk and being an ass!"
Leonard,"No, there isnêt! Theyêre synonyms!"
Raj,"Well, that was rather unpleasant."
Howard,"Yeah, I donêt think I need my preshow urination anymore."
Sheldon,"Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her, and now look, weêre going to be late for the movies."
Howard,Hey! Look! Amazing Spider-Man 183.
Sheldon,Got it.
Howard,Remember this one? Spider-Man loses a big fight and then his girlfriend breaks up with him. Want me to get it for you? Itêll help take your mind off things.
Leonard,"Oh, we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits."
Leonard,"Thanks, Stuart. Let me ask you something. Do you think itês okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?"
Howard,"No, I mean, sheês obviously way out of line."
Leonard,Thank you!
Howard,"But if she dumps you, sheêll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and youêll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one. So the only question is, how long until you fold?"
Leonard,I am not going to fold.
Raj,"Well, excuse me, I donêt think Pennyês out of line at all. You donêt own her. Itês like my girl, Beyonce says, if you like it, you shoulda put a ring on it.î"
Howard,"Come on. At the very least, when she found out Leonard was upset about it, she shouldêve backed off."
Raj,You mean like when a guyês upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesnêt show up because heês doing a juice fast with his mother?
Howard,I didnêt know you were upset about that.
Raj,"Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, Howard, I am upset."
Howard,"Okay, sorry."
Raj,"Maybe it means something different in this country. Back in India, it means youêre upset with a guy named Howard!"
Howard,I said Iêm sorry.
Raj,Sorry doesnêt make up for the fact that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice!
Howard,"Yeah, well, you think I was having fun, sitting around all night listening to my mother say _Have you ever peed so much in your life?î"
Raj,"Oh, my God, you are such a mamaês boy."
Howard,"Hey, donêt bring my mother into this!"
Raj,You brought your mother into this!
Sheldon,"Stop it, both of you. All this fighting, I might as well be back with my parents! Damn it, George, I told you if you didnêt quit drinkinê Iêd leave you! Well, I guess that makes you a liar, êcause Iêm drunk as hell and youêre still here! Stop yelling! Youêre making Sheldon cry! Iêll tell you whatês making Sheldon cry! That I let you name him Sheldon."
Howard,"Boy, what got him so upset?"
Raj,"Oh, sure, you can tell when Sheldonês upset."
Penny,"Oh, thank you very much. Come back soon. With the other half of my tip. Hey, Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
Sheldon,"This is a restaurant. Itês lunchtime. I would think, as a waitress, youêd be familiar with the paradigm."
Penny,Is Leonard coming?
Sheldon,"No, I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize."
Penny,"Well, thatês not gonna happen."
Sheldon,"I assumed that would be your attitude. Hence, my true purpose in coming here."
Penny,Which is?
Sheldon,I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.
Penny,Iêm busy.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, miss. Iêd like to order lunch."
Penny,Fine. What do you want?
Sheldon,"I have a few questions. First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?"
Sheldon,"Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone elseês sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?"
Penny,"No, no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich."
Sheldon,"You canêt make a half-sandwich. If itês not half of a whole sandwich, itês just a small sandwich."
Penny,"Okay, fine, itês soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?"
Sheldon,Of course not. Iêll have my usual.
Sheldon,Arenêt you going to ask me if I want a beverage?
Penny,Donêt you usually get lemonade?
Penny,Do you want lemonade?
Penny,Anything else?
Sheldon,"Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard."
Penny,I am not going to apologize. Iêve done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting.
Sheldon,Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.
Penny,"Well, Iêm sorry, Sheldon, but this really isnêt about you."
Sheldon,I donêt follow.
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, Iêll be right there. Look, Sheldon, I have to go."
Sheldon,"All right, letês assume, ad argumentum, that in this case, Leonard is wrong."
Penny,Leonard is wrong.
Sheldon,"Considering the number of transgressions youêve committed that heês overlooked, donêt you think that, just this once, you could return the favour?"
Penny,"Iêm coming. Goodbye, Sheldon. What do you mean, transgressions Iêve committed?"
Sheldon,Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?
Penny,"Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you, youêre making a little cheque sign in the air, I got it, just hold your horses. What does Leonard complain about?"
Sheldon,"Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing."
Penny,My singing?
Sheldon,"Thatês actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didnêt agree with it."
Penny,"Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me, why hasnêt he just said so?"
Sheldon,"Because, according to him, youêre oversensitive and have a temper."
Penny,"Oh, really? Well, then, do me a favour and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!"
Sheldon,And she wonders why sheês constantly undertipped.
Sheldon,"Oh, good, youêre home. I need you to do me a favour."
Sheldon,Go apologize to Penny.
Sheldon,Right now would be good.
Sheldon,"Although, a few minutes ago would have been better."
Penny,"I hear you donêt like my stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality."
Leonard,Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?
Penny,"It doesnêt matter why he told me. Itês true, isnêt it?"
Leonard,"Okay, yeah, itês true, but I can live with that stuff. What I canêt live with is you casually informing me that some guyês going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!"
Penny,"That isnêt even your problem, the problem is you donêt trust me!"
Leonard,"Oh, come on. Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that I donêt trust Penny? Sheldon? Where did he go?"
Penny,"Oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again."
Leonard,Where are you going? You just walk away in the middle of an argument?!
Penny,"No, Iêm going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!"
Leonard,Why didnêt you say so?
Penny,"Oh, now I need your permission for that, too?!"
Leonard,"Well, I canêt read your mind, Penny!"
Penny,"Really? Why not? Youêre so smart, and Iêm so dumb!"
Sheldon, Raj.
Raj,"Stop knocking! Itês open! Please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture, and I canêt come home for my cousin Sanjayês wedding."
Raj,I didnêt ask you to set me up with Lakshmi.
Raj,I donêt care! And why donêt you think I can find a woman for myself?
Raj,"Oh, that is completely below the belt. Sheldon, tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends. Sheldon? Howard and I are just friends! Fine. Iêll come home for Sanjayês wedding."
Leonard,What are you doing? Heês not a lost dog.
Penny,"Hey, why donêt you just let me find him while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?"
Leonard,"The brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasnêt."
Penny,What stop sign?
Leonard,Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!
Howard,"Iêm busy too, you answer it."
Howard,"For Godês sake, I donêt need to hear that! Canêt you just say, Iêm busy?"
Howard,"You know what? I hope itês one of those home invasion deals, and they shoot me in the head."
Howard,"Thereês no one there. Youêre hearing things, you crazy old lady!"
Leonard,"Hey, Stuart, have you seen Sheldon?"
Leonard,Thank you.
Penny,What do you mean?
Penny,"Oh, yeah, kind of. Itês, itês no big thing."
Leonard,Iêm not leaving until you talk to me.
Penny,"All right, whatês going on?"
Leonard,"Itês a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends heês in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space weêre in, but he canêt perceive us."
Sheldon,Donêt flatter yourself. Iêm just ignoring you.
Penny,"Come on, Sheldon, letês go home. Look, weêre done fighting."
Sheldon,"Iêve heard that before, but then, the next thing you know Iêm hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dadês meatloaf, and my dadês on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates."
Penny,"Okay, thereês going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting."
Sheldon,Really? Whereês your friend Justin going to sleep?
Leonard,"Yeah, whereês he gonna sleep?"
Penny,"Oh, my God, would you let this go?!"
Leonard,Why should I let it go? Why donêt you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep? 
Penny,"Leonard, will you just let me handle this, please? Look, letês justÑ Sheldon, please,"
Leonard,Always is a long time. Sure. Always.
Penny,"You know, how about we buy you this robot, and then we all go home?"
Sheldon,I want that one.
Penny,"Okay, you can have that one."
Leonard,"Oh, come on, heês just going to play with it twice, and then itêll end up in his closet with all the other junk."
Penny,"Buy him the robot, Leonard."
Sheldon,"Can I get this comic book, too?"
Penny,"Yes, you can."
Leonard,So what did Justin say when you told him he couldnêt sleep on your couch?
Penny,"Heês a musician. Heêll sleep in his own vomit, if he has to."
Sheldon,I should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot.
Howard,How much time do we have?
Leonard,"Uh, t-minus five hours, 37 minutes to onset of meteor shower."
Raj,"Okay, our position is 34.48 degrees north, 118.31 west. That means the azimuth should be 168.22 degrees relative to magnetic north with an elevation of 49.93."
Howard,Anything yet?
Leonard,"Uh, we have a signal, but thereês no frame lock."
Howard,"Hang on, how about now?"
Raj,We did it. We have the west coast feed of HBO.
Howard,"Ooh, Real Sex."
Raj,Big deal. Every time I watch that show itês old women putting condoms on cucumbers.
Howard,"Alright, letês see whatês on the east coast feed."
Leonard,"Oh, hey. Dune."
Raj,"Not a great movie, but look at that beautiful desert."
Leonard,Too bad Sheldon couldnêt come with us.
Raj,"Yes, itês not the same without him. "
Howard,"Oh, this sucks, Iêm switching back to Real Sex."
Sheldon,"Sheldonês log, stardate 63345.3. While my colleagues are off observing the Leonid meteor shower, I have remained behind to complete my paper on the decays of highly excited massive string states. Although my research is going well I do miss the warmth of human companionship. "
Sheldon,"And good evening to you, Siam Palace. This is Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, Iêm going to be dining alone this evening, so Iêll be reducing my usual order. Iêd like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two. Oh, for heavenês sake, in the mid-18th century, King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his throne. Surely, you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings."
Penny,Sheldon help!
Sheldon,"I need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store.  Penny.."
Penny,Come in! Hurry!
Penny,Iêm back here.
Sheldon, Penny..
Penny,"Oh, for godês sakes, Iêm in the bathroom!"
Sheldon,Shall I come back at a better time?
Penny,Get in here! Hurry! Donêt you dare knock.
Penny,"I slipped in the shower, and I think I dislocated my shoulder."
Sheldon,Not surprising. You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.
Sheldon,Tubs are slippery.
Penny,I know. I slipped.
Sheldon,I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.
Penny,"Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?"
Sheldon,Theyêre holding umbrellas.
Sheldon,The ducks in my tub.
Sheldon,"Theyêre whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas."
Penny,"Oh, my god. I got to go to the emergency room."
Sheldon,"Well, assuming youêre correct that your right humerus is no longer seated in the glenoid socket, I would certainly think so."
Penny,"Okay, can you drive me?"
Sheldon,I donêt drive.
Penny,"Well, I canêt drive!"
Sheldon,"Well, it seems weêve reached an impasse."
Sheldon,But I could call you a cab or an ambulance.
Penny,"No, no, no, I canêt wait that long, you got to help me, please."
Sheldon,All right. Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.
Penny,No oneês saying that. Letês go.
Sheldon,"Well, it does seem rather ironic that for want of 99-cent adhesive ducks, we both might die in a fiery car crash."
Leonard,"I wish Penny didnêt have to work, she loves camping."
Raj,"Yeah, that would have been great. You and Penny having sex in the tent while I sit out here and watch Howard hump a cactus."
Howard,"Okay, the best I can tell, there are eight other campsites nearby. Mostly science nerds like us, but just over yon ridge are two not unattractive middle school teachers who reek of desperation."
Raj,Wow. Wonderful. How old are they?
Howard,"Oh I donêt know, 50, 55."
Raj,"Oh, menopause, natureês birth control."
Leonard,"Come on, you guys canêt be that hard up."
Howard,I am.
Raj,"Yeah, me, too."
Howard,"Look, they gave me homemade cookies."
Leonard,"Of course, they did. Thatês what grandmothers do."
Raj,"So, what are we waiting for?"
Howard,"Relax, I said weêd stop by a little later after they have their nap."
Raj,Good idea. Theyêll be refreshed.
Raj,"Yeah, thank you. Mmmm."
Leonard,"Mmmm, not bad."
Raj,"Yeah, very tasty. Well, so tell me more about these teachers."
Howard,Not much to tell. They had a VW Microbus and were wearing tie-dyed Grateful Dead shirts.
Raj,Huh. Mmm. Good cookies.
Sheldon,I see no organizational system in here whatsoever. Which panties do you wear on Mondays?
Penny,"I donêt need panties, I just need shorts and a shirt."
Sheldon,My mother always told me one should wear clean underpants in case one is in an accident.
Penny,One was already in an accident.
Sheldon,"That doesnêt mean one wonêt be in another, especially if Iêm driving."
Penny,"Clothes, Sheldon. I need clothes!"
Sheldon,"Okay, here."
Penny,Seriously? Those shorts with that top?
Sheldon,All right.
Penny,"NoÑ NoÑ Oh, thatês cute."
Sheldon,We should have you checked for a concussion.
Penny,"Okay, now, you got to help me put these on."
Sheldon,All right.
Penny,But donêt look.
Sheldon,Donêt look?
Penny,I donêt want you to see me naked.
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, thatês understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology. Uh, Lot and his wife, Perseus and Medusa, Orpheus and Eurydice."
Penny,"Yeah, great."
Sheldon,They always look. It never ends well.
Penny,"Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve."
Penny,Is that my arm?
Sheldon,It doesnêt feel like an arm.
Penny,"Then, maybe you should let it go."
Sheldon,All righty.
Leonard,"Stars are pretty, arenêt they?"
Howard,"Up above the world so high, like little diamonds in the sky."
Raj,"Thatês beautiful, dude. You shouldÑ You should write that down before someone steals it."
Howard,"So, when do the meteors get here?"
Raj,"The meteors donêt get here, the earth is moving into their path."
Leonard,"I can feel it. I can feel the earth moving. Itês moving too fast. Raj, slow it down."
Raj,"Okay, howês that?"
Leonard,Better. Thanks.
Howard,"Stars are pretty, arenêt they?"
Leonard,Whatês so funny?
Raj,"Itês your American accent. Everything you say sounds stupid.  Stars are pretty, arenêt they?"
Sheldon,"For the record, I should let you know this is my first time driving an actual motor vehicle."
Penny,"You have your learnerês permit, right?"
Sheldon,"Yes, and I have logged a considerable number of hours on a simulator."
Sheldon,Didnêt work out well.
Penny,"All right, can we please go?"
Sheldon,"One moment. According to my driverês ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driverês door handle is visible in the lower right corner. Thereês the handle. Oh, no, too far, bringing it back. Optimized. Now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror?"
Penny,Itês right there.
Sheldon,Where is the passenger side mirror?
Penny,"In a parking lot in Hollywood. Now, can we please go?"
Sheldon,"Yes. As soon as I adjust my seat. Whee! Oh, dear. Iêm going to have to start again."
Raj,"If I could speak the language of rabbits, they would be amazed, and I would be their king."
Leonard,I hate my name. It has nerd in it. Len nerd.
Howard,I lost my virginity to my cousin Jeanie.
Raj,I would be kind to my rabbit subjects. At first.
Leonard,You know whatês a cool name? Angelo. That has angel and jell-o in it.
Howard,It was my Uncle Murrayês funeral. We were all back at my Aunt Barbaraês house. Our eyes locked over the pickled herring. We never meant for it to happen.
Raj,"One day, I hold a great ball for the President of France, but the rabbits, they hate me and donêt come. I am embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce in the world and make them watch."
Leonard,"People could call me Angie. Yo, Angie, howês it goinê?"
Howard,"To this day, I canêt look at pickled herring without being aroused and ashamed. Oh, cousin Jeanie."
Penny,Could you please drive a little faster?
Sheldon,"Oh, I think weêre going sufficiently fast. Whatês that?"
Penny,Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.
Sheldon,"That canêt be nothing, the check engine light is on. We need to find a service station."
Penny,The light has been on since I bought the car.
Sheldon,All the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.
Penny,"Itês not going to explode, just keep driving. Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock."
Sheldon,"Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise. He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that if he ever saw the Enterpriseês check engine light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately."
Penny,"Oh, god, Iêm gonna lose the arm."
Sheldon,"Oh, oh, red light, release accelerator and slowly apply the brake. Nailed it. While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?"
Sheldon,Why do you have the Chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock?
Penny,"Itês not soup, itês courage."
Sheldon,"No, it isnêt. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup."
Penny,How did you see it? You said you wouldnêt look.
Sheldon,"Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks."
Leonard,That was the last pudding cup.
Howard,No! What about Slim Jims?
Leonard,"Thatês what he used to eat his pudding, remember?"
Raj,Right! That was so good! Sweety and meaty at the same time.
Howard,"Wait. Wait, wait. So youêre saying weêre out of food?"
Leonard,The only thing in here are blue ice packs.
Raj,"I know theyêre poison, but they look like big, yummy otter pops."
Leonard,"Oh, god, I am so hungry."
Howard,Me too. Check and see if we have any more pudding.
Sheldon,"All right, thereês no need to bark at me. According to the inexplicably irritable nurse behind the desk, youêll be seen after the man who claims to be having a heart attack, but appears to be well enough to play Doodle Jump on his iPhone. We have to fill these out. Describe illness or injury."
Penny,I dislocated my shoulder.
Sheldon,All right. And how did the accident occur?
Penny,You ready know that.
Sheldon,"Cause of accident, lack of adhesive ducks. Okay, medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?"
Sheldon,Kidney disease?
Penny,Getting one.
Sheldon,Are you currently pregnant?
Sheldon,Are you sure? You look a bit puffy.
Penny,Change migraine to yes.
Sheldon,When was your last menstrual period?
Penny,"Oh, next question."
Sheldon,"Iêll put, in progress. Okay, moving to psychiatric disorders, list all major behavioural diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera."
Penny,"Oh, my god, what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?"
Sheldon,Episodes of sub psychotic rage.
Sheldon,"Possible Touretteês. All right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. Soup tattoo on right buttock."
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon, Sheldon, look, I am scared and in a lot of pain. Could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, I donêt know, comforting?"
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry. There, there. Everythingês going to be fine. Sheldonês here."
Penny,Thanks. Thatês much better.
Raj,"Oh, Iêm so hungry!"
Leonard,Will you shut up? Weêre all hungry.
Howard,"Okay, our objective is the boy scout campsite to the east. Easy target. Big doughy scout master, couple of cubs, most webelos."
Leonard,What kind of score are we looking at?
Howard,"Hot dogs, buns, sêmores, I mean, itês a freaking 7-11."
Leonard,"All right, everyone grab flashlights."
Howard,"Oh, my god, could it be? Yes! My mother put an I love you brisket in my backpack."
Leonard,"Quick, get forks."
Howard,"You donêt need forks. Itês so tender, it falls apart in your hands."
Raj,Heês right.
Leonard,I feel like weêre forgetting something important.
Raj,"Me, too. But what? "
Howard,Maybe a tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots?
Sheldon,"Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so, uh, donêt operate heavy machinery. Try not to choke on your own drool."
Penny,Wait. You have to help me get into bed. Sheldon has to get me into bed. Bet you never thought Iêd say that.
Sheldon,Yes. The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds.
Penny,"You know, people think youêre this weird robot man whoês so annoying all the time, and you totally are, but then itês like that movie Wall-E at the end. Youêre so full of love, and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs."
Sheldon,"Thatês a fairly laboured metaphor, but I appreciate the sentiment behind it."
Penny,Sing _Soft Kittyî to me.
Sheldon,_Soft Kittyî is for when youêre sick. Youêre not sick.
Penny,Injured and drugged is a kind of sick.
Sheldon,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of furÑ"
Penny,"Wait, wait. Letês sing it as a round. Iêll start. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of furÑ See thatês where you come in. Iêll start over. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of furÑ Iêve got all night, Sheldon. Soft kitty, warm kittyÑ  little ball of fur, happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
Raj,"ÑAnd the next morning when he woke up, he rolled over and realizedÑ duh-duh-duh! Ñshe was his cousin."
Howard,Thatês still not funny.
Raj,Thatês still not funny.
Howard,And she was my second cousin.
Raj,And she was my second cousin.
Howard,Youêre a real douche.
Raj,Who cares? You slept with your cousin.
Howard,"So two years later, thereês a knock on the door, guy opens it, and there on his porch is the snail, who says, _What the heck was all that about?î"
Bernadette,I donêt really get it.
Howard,"Well, see, it took two years for the snail toÑ  not important."
Bernadette,Can I ask you a question?
Bernadette,Where do you think this is going?
Howard,"To be honest, I was hoping at least second base."
Bernadette,Youêre so funny. Youêre like a stand-up comedian.
Howard,"A Jewish stand-up comedian, thatêd be new."
Bernadette,"Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish."
Howard,"No, I was justÑ never mind."
Bernadette,"Look, Howard, this is our third date and we both know what that means."
Howard,We do?
Howard,Youêre kidding.
Bernadette,But I need to know whether youêre looking for a relationship or a one-night stand.
Howard,"Okay, just to be clear, thereês only one correct answer, right? Itês not like chicken or fish on an airplane?"
Bernadette,Maybe you need to think about it a little.
Howard,"You know, itês not unheard of for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship."
Bernadette,Call me when you figure it out.
Howard,Three dates means sex? Who knew?
Howard,"Greetings, homies, homette."
Penny,Why are you back from your date so early?
Howard,"In romance, as in show business, always leave them wanting more."
Penny,What exactly does that mean?
Leonard,He struck out.
Howard,"Hey, did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex?"
Raj,"Actually, Iêve never had three dates with the same woman."
Leonard,"With Penny and me, it took two years. Now that I think about it, that was three dates."
Howard,"Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up, did she ask for any kind of commitment?"
Leonard,"No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open."
Sheldon,"I have something to announce, but out of respect for convention, I will wait for you to finish your current conversation. What are you talking about?"
Leonard,The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.
Sheldon,"I see. Now, are we talking date, the social interaction, or date, the dried fruit?"
Leonard,"Never mind, whatês your announcement?"
Sheldon,"Oh, good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to knowÑ"
Sheldon,"Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends."
Sheldon,My thank you was not sincere.
Sheldon,Why are you such a stupid head? That is also rhetorical. Iêm sorry you had to hear that.
Leonard,Are you really going to be on NPR?
Sheldon,"Yes, theyêre interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices. Itês pledge week and theyêre trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy."
Leonard,"Very cool, congratulations."
Sheldon,"Thank you. My mother is very excited. Sheês convening her Bible study group to listen in, and then pray for my soul."
Raj,"I was on the radio once. I called in to Fever 104 FM New Delhi and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays, _Fever 104, __ __ ___ _____ _____ __ __.î That means: _Fever 104, home of the really good current music.î Itês much catchier in Hindi."
Sheldon,"All right. These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow. I need to make sure that theyêre simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. Howard, look this over and tell me whatês unclear to you."
Howard,"Excuse me, I have a masterês degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis."
Sheldon,Yes. Look this over and tell me whatês unclear to you.
Leonard,"You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you donêt have to do it."
Raj,"In fact, itês better if you donêt, otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad."
Penny,"Hi, guys."
Penny,"Yo, Raj, talk to me. Iêm sorry, just screwing with you. Hey, Howard, why havenêt you called Bernadette?"
Howard,Did she say something?
Penny,"Yeah, she said she hasnêt heard from you in a week. I thought you liked her?"
Howard,"I do, yeah, but she wants a commitment and Iêm not sure sheês my type."
Penny,She agreed to go out with you for free. What more do you need?
Howard,"Look, Bernadette is really nice. I just always thought when I finally settle down into a relationship, it would be with someone, you know, different."
Penny,Different how?
Howard,"Well, you know, more like Megan Fox from Transformers, or Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica."
Penny,Are you high?
Leonard,Youêd have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian hooker from Total Recall.
Howard,"Okay, now youêre just being unrealistic. Anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago, imagine how saggy those things would be."
Penny,"Howard, youêre going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette because youêre holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?"
Howard,"Hey, just because you settled doesnêt mean I have to."
Leonard,"Excuse me, Iêm sitting here."
Penny,"Hey, I did not settle for Leonard. I mean, obviously, he isnêt the kind of guy I usually go out with, you know, physically."
Leonard,"Again, Iêm right here."
Penny,"My point is, I do not judge a book by its cover. I am interested in the person underneath."
Leonard,"I am here, right? You see me."
Howard,"Hey, Iêm interested in whatês inside people, too, but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in, say, the delicious caramel that is Halle Berry?  Yes, youêre delicious caramel, too."
Penny,"All right, you know what, I will tell you why itês wrongÑ"
Sheldon,"Excuse me, may I interject?"
Sheldon,"Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line."
Howard,"Thank you, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Now, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question."
Sheldon,"My pleasure, Ira."
Sheldon,"Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has,  a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole."
Sheldon,"No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole."
Sheldon,"A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! Iêm going to kill you!"
Howard,So nice you could join me this evening. Youêre looking lovely as always.
Howard,"Come on, Katee, donêt make it sound so cheap."
Howard,"Thank you. So, shall we get started?"
Howard,You want to play Cylon and colonist?
Howard,"You mean, Bernadette?"
Howard,"I know, but sheês not you."
Howard,Really? Tall?
Howard,Iêm taking a bath!
Howard,"Donêt remind me!  Oh, man. All soaped up and no place to go."
Leonard,"How ya doinê, buddy?"
Sheldon,I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think Iêm doing?
Leonard,"Come on, it wasnêt that bad."
Sheldon,What do you want?
Raj,"We represent the Lollipop Guild, and we want you."
Leonard,"Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you."
Sheldon,It wasnêt funny.
Raj,I thought it was funny.
Raj,You laughed.
Sheldon,Did you laugh?
Leonard,"I fell on the floor. All right, he got you, you can get him back."
Sheldon,I refuse to sink to his level.
Raj,"You canêt sink. With all that helium in you, youêre lucky you donêt float away."
Leonard,Are you really admitting defeat?
Sheldon,I never admit defeat.
Sheldon,"However, on an unrelated topic, I am never getting out of this bed again."
Leonard,What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look?
Raj,"I donêt think thatês possible, dude."
Leonard,Youêre not helping.
Raj,"I didnêt come to help, I came to mock."
Leonard,"Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane."
Raj,"Thatês true. He didnêt just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. He, he broke out and poisoned Gothamês water supply."
Sheldon,"Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke."
Leonard,"No, no."
Sheldon,Itês a simple matter. There are several toxic chemicals thatêd be untraceable in an autopsy.
Leonard,"Okay, uh, thatês the spirit, but, um, letês dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance."
Sheldon,"Oh! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? Heêll sit down, itêll sound like heês flatulent, even though heês not."
Leonard,Letês keep thinking.
Penny,"Oh, gee, youêre too late. Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic, little weasels."
Howard,"Yeah, I came to talk to Bernadette. Sheês working today, right?"
Penny,"Yes, but I donêt think she wants to see you."
Howard,Why not?
Penny,"Come on, Howard. You hurt her feelings by not calling her all week. Plus, Iêve kind of been talkinê some smack about ya."
Bernadette,"Hello, Howard."
Howard,"Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you."
Bernadette,"I canêt now, Iêm working."
Howard,"This will only take a second. You asked me to think about where our relationship was going, and I did. Bernadette? Will you marry me?"
Bernadette,Is this more comedy that I donêt understand?
Howard,"Iêm serious. Iêm never going to find another girl like you who likes me and is, you know, real."
Bernadette,"So, this isnêt a joke?"
Bernadette,Then youêre insane.
Howard,I prefer to think of myself as quirky.
Bernadette,"Howard, weêve only been on three dates. We havenêt even had sex yet."
Howard,Fair enough. Whenês your break?
Bernadette,Wow. 
Howard,Donêt you just hate when this happens?
Sheldon,"All right, howês this for revenge? A solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide."
Raj,Whatês this?
Sheldon,"Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, weêre going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen."
Raj,Foamy vengeance.
Sheldon,"Yes, exactly."
Leonard,"This is brilliant, Sheldon. How are we going to deploy it in Kripkeês office?"
Sheldon,"Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripkeês lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitorês shirt pocket. At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling."
Raj,"Oh, Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor."
Sheldon,"You flatter me, sir."
Leonard,"Let me guess, motion sensors?"
Sheldon,"The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room. Mwah, ha, ha."
Leonard,"I gotta say, I am really impressed. This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even. "
Sheldon,"It may be low-tech, but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity."
Raj,Here comes Kripke!
Leonard,Who is that with him?
Raj,I believe thatês the president of the university.
Leonard,And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!
Sheldon,There is no abort.
Raj,"Well, how could you not put in an abort?"
Sheldon,"I made a boo-boo, all right?"
Raj,Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.
Leonard,At least they donêt know it was you.
Sheldon,"Hello, Kripke. This classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper. If youêd like to see the look on your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube. Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise."
Raj,"Well, Iêm going back to India. Whatês your plan?"
Penny,"Hey, hereês your tip from table seven."
Bernadette,"Oh, thanks."
Howard,Testing. Check. Check two.
Bernadette,"Oh, now what?"
Penny,You want me to throw him out?
Bernadette,"No, thatês okay."
Penny,"Are you sure? Heês small. I bet I can get a nice, tight spiral on him."
Howard,"I want to dedicate this number to a great gal who Iêve done wrong.   Bernadette, I am so sorry for trying to propose to you, Bernadette, you found it creepy but thatês just the kind of thing I do. I know now it was too soon to talk of love. It was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub. But, Bernadette, give me one more chance, sweet Bernadette, Iêll get the hang of this thing they call romance, sweet Bernadette, I dream to once again kiss your lips, sweet Bernadette. Sincerely yours, Howard Wolowitz, BernadetteÑ"
Penny,"Oh, I am so sorry."
Bernadette,Are you kidding? Thatês the most romantic thing anyoneês ever done for me.
Howard,"ÑBernadette! Thank you, Cheesecake Factory!"
Penny,"Hey, Leonard, check this out. "
Sheldon,"Leonard, sheês doing it again."
Leonard,I think it upsets Sheldon when you play with the food.
Sheldon,It upsets Sheldon when she willy-nilly takes it from the containers without regard for its equitable distribution. This is essentially why you have famine in India.
Penny,You want me to put it back?
Leonard,It upsets Sheldon when you play with the Sheldon.
Howard,"Whatês up, my nerdizzles? Raj, Sheldon, I want you to meet my girlfriend Bernadette."
Howard,"Leonard, Penny, you know my girlfriend Bernadette."
Leonard,Yeah. Hey.
Howard,"Bernadette, say foêshizzle to my nerdizzles."
Bernadette,I donêt think I can. I donêt have Howardês street cred.
Howard,"I hope itês all right, I told my girlfriend Bernadette she could join us for dinner."
Leonard,"Sure. The more, the merrier."
Sheldon,"Wait, no, thatês a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, weêd be suffocating."
Sheldon,"Donêt Sheldon me. We ordered for five people, not six."
Penny,"Oh, come on, itês fine. Weêll just put it all on the table, you know, family style."
Sheldon,"Oh, sure. And while weêre at it, why donêt we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?"
Leonard,"Relax, itêll be fine, sit down, you guys."
Penny,"Oh, yeah, you canêt sit there."
Bernadette,Why not?
Leonard,Thatês where Sheldon sits.
Bernadette,He canêt sit somewhere else?
Penny,"Oh no, no, you see, in the winter, that seat is close enough to the radiator so that heês warm, yet not so close that he sweats. In the summer, itês directly in the path of a cross-breeze created by opening windows there and there. It faces the television at an angle that isnêt direct, so he can still talk to everybody, yet not so wide that the picture looks distorted."
Sheldon,Perhaps thereês hope for you after all.
Bernadette,"Ooh, I love your shoes."
Penny,"Oh, thanks. They are cute, arenêt they?"
Bernadette,Whereêd you get them?
Penny,Shoes for Less.
Bernadette,Iêve been meaning to go over there.
Penny,"Oh, great selection, great prices."
Sheldon,My mother was right. Hell is real.
Howard,"Come on, Sheldon. let the womenfolk chat."
Howard,Gals? Chicks? Utero-Americans?
Penny,Just eat your dinner.
Bernadette,"Donêt take him too seriously, a lot of what he says is intended as humour."
Penny,"Yeah, well, I donêt think itês very funny."
Bernadette,"Me neither, but he just lights up when I laugh."
Penny,"Howard, never let her go."
Bernadette,"So, Leonard, Howard says youêre working on fundamental tests of quantum mechanics."
Leonard,I am. Are you interested in physics?
Bernadette,"Oh, I find it fascinating. If I hadnêt gone into microbiology, I probably would have gone into physics. Or ice dancing."
Leonard,"Actually, my tests of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum interference effect have reached an interesting point. Right now, weêre testing the phase shift due to an electric potential."
Bernadette,Thatês amazing.
Sheldon,"Yes. Leonardês work is nearly as amazing as third graders growing lima beans in wet paper towels.  While I appreciate the oh, snap, Iêm uncomfortable having your moist breath in my ear."
Bernadette,Are you going to try to set up the voltages using tunnel junctions?
Leonard,"Yes, I am. You want to see a simulation on my laptop?"
Bernadette,"Oh, yeah, show me. In microbiology, the most exciting thing I get to work with is yeast."
Sheldon,Your shoes are delightful. Where did you get them?
Sheldon,Bazinga. I donêt care.
Raj,"Ha! Eat my dust, racially stereotypical plumber."
Sheldon,Thatês not fair. I got stuck behind a tree.
Raj,"And a cow and a penguin. Face it dude, whether itês a real car or a virtual cartoon car, you canêt drive."
Sheldon,Just need a little more practice.
Raj,"What you need is cheat codes, motor skills and a magic genie who grants wishes to little boys who suck at Mario Kart."
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon, can I talk to you for a second?"
Sheldon,"Itês not about shoes, is it? I donêt think I could go through that again."
Penny,Itês not about shoes.
Sheldon,Then speak.
Penny,"Um, actually, can we do it in private?"
Sheldon,"All right.  Go away. I agree, itês rude, but she asked for privacy."
Penny,"Thanks, Raj. Okay, so hereês the thing, I was wondering if you could maybe teach me a little physics?"
Sheldon,"A little physics? Thereês no such thing. Physics encompasses the entire universe, from quantum particles to supernovas, from spinning electrons to spinning galaxies."
Penny,"Yeah, okay, cool. I donêt need the PBS special, I just want to know enough so I can talk to Leonard about his job. You know, like Bernadette does."
Sheldon,Why canêt Leonard teach you?
Penny,‚Cause I want to surprise him.
Sheldon,"Canêt you surprise him in some other way? For example, Iêm sure heêd be delightfully taken aback if you cleaned your apartment."
Penny,"Come on, Sheldon, this is important to me."
Sheldon,"Penny, this would be a massive undertaking, and my time is both limited and valuable."
Penny,Youêre sitting here playing video games all day.
Sheldon,"Okay, point. What sort of foundation do you have? Did you take any science classes in school?"
Penny,Sure. I did the one with the frogs.
Sheldon,The one with the frogs.
Penny,"Yeah, actually, it was pretty cool. A lot of the girls threw up, but I gutted that thing like a deer."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, Penny, I donêt think so."
Penny,"Oh, come on! A smart guy like you, itêll be a challenge. You can make it like an experiment."
Sheldon,"Interesting. I suppose if someone could teach sign language to KoKo the gorilla, I could teach you some rudimentary physics."
Penny,"Great! Itês a little insulting, but great. Iêll be KoKo."
Sheldon,"Not likely. KoKo learned to understand over 2,000 words, not one of which had anything to do with shoes."
Howard,"Hey, fellas. This is my girlfriend Bernadette. My girlfriend Bernadette."
Bernadette,Who are all those people?
Howard,"Have no idea. Hey, Leonard."
Leonard,"Hey, look, itês Howard and his girlfriend Bernadette."
Howard,Thought Iêd give the little woman a tour of the old salt mines.
Bernadette,He doesnêt mean salt mines. He means where he works.
Leonard,"Yeah, no, I got it."
Bernadette,"So, howês your experiment going?"
Leonard,"Ah, terrific. Weêre getting the electron accelerator set up. We should be ready to go day after tomorrow."
Bernadette,"Boy, Iêd love to see that."
Leonard,Youêre welcome to come.
Bernadette,"Really? Oh, thatêd be great. How exciting is that?"
Howard,Like Hanukkah in July.
Bernadette,Do they have that?
Bernadette,"Oh. You got me again. This isnêt non-fat yogurt, this is fatty fat fat. Excuse me."
Howard,"Could you grab me another napkin, sweetie?"
Howard,"Thanks, honey.  All right, what is your deal?"
Leonard,Excuse me?
Howard,Inviting my girlfriend to come see your electron accelerator?
Leonard,Yeah? So?
Howard,"Wow! You really are a piece of work. Itês not enough you get the prom queen, you have to get the head of the decorating committee, too?"
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Howard,Donêt play innocent with me. I practically invented using fancy lab equipment to seduce women.
Leonard,Has it ever worked?
Howard,"Not so far, but thatês not the point!"
Leonard,"Howard, relax, Iêm not interested in your girlfriend."
Howard,"I hope not, because you donêt want to mess with me. Iêm crazy."
Leonard,I believe you.
Sheldon,"Research journal, entry one. Iêm about to embark on one of the great challenges of my scientific career, teaching Penny physics. Iêm calling it Project Gorilla."
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Come in. Take a seat. Subject has arrived. Iêve extended a friendly casual greeting.
Penny,Ready to get started?
Sheldon,"One moment. Subject appears well-rested and enthusiastic. Apparently, ignorance is bliss. All right, let us begin. Whereês your notebook?"
Penny,"Um, I donêt have one."
Sheldon,How are you going to take notes without a notebook?
Penny,I have to take notes?
Sheldon,How else are you gonna study for the tests?
Penny,Thereês gonna be a test?
Sheldon,Tests. Here. Itês college-ruled. I hope thatês not too intimidating.
Penny,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Youêre welcome. Now, Introduction to Physics. What is physics? Physics comes from the ancient Greek word physika. Itês at this point that youêll want to start taking notes. Physika means the science of natural things. And it is there, in ancient Greece, that our story begins."
Penny,Ancient Greece?
Sheldon,"Hush. If you have questions, raise your hand. Itês a warm summer evening, circa 600 BC, youêve finished your shopping at the local market, or agora, and you look up at the night sky. There you notice some of the stars seem to move, so you name them planetes, or wanderer. Yes, Penny?"
Penny,"Um, does this have anything to do with Leonardês work?"
Sheldon,This is the beginning of a twenty six hundred year journey weêre going to take together from the ancient Greeks through Isaac Newton to Niels Bohr to Erwin Schrodinger to the Dutch researchers that Leonard is currently ripping off.
Penny,Twenty six hundred years?
Sheldon,"Yeah, give or take. As I was saying, itês a warm summer evening in ancient GreeceÑ Yes, Penny?"
Penny,I have to go to the bathroom.
Sheldon,Canêt you hold it?
Penny,Not for twenty six hundred years.
Sheldon,"Project Gorilla, entry two. I am exhausted."
Bernadette,It unhooks in the front.
Howard,"Oh, that explains a lot."
Howard,Of course.
Howard,"Thatês great, Ma!"
Bernadette,I guess I should go.
Howard,"No, no, donêt move. Hey, Ma, can I have lamb stew for dinner?"
Howard,Please? I got a real hankering.
Howard,"Thanks, Ma."
Howard,Always Le Seur peas with lamb stew!
Howard,Then get the regular!
Howard,Sorry about that.
Bernadette,Let me just put that on vibrate.
Howard,Iêm already on vibrate.
Bernadette,"You know, that one I got. Howard, did you say something to Leonard about me?"
Howard,"Uh, what do you mean?"
Bernadette,He says if I go see his experiment tomorrow it might weird you out.
Howard,Really? He said that?
Bernadette,"Youêre not jealous of Leonard, are you?"
Howard,Me? I may have mentioned that itês a little inappropriate to be asking another manês girlfriend to his experiment without first discussing it with said man.
Bernadette,Are you saying I need to ask your permission to hang out with Leonard?
Howard,"I didnêt say anything like that. I said Leonard has to ask my permission.  Come on, I donêt want to eat lamb stew with my mother. Damn, I was this close on the bra."
Sheldon,"Now, remember, Newton realized that Aristotle was wrong and force was not necessary to maintain motion. So letês plug in our 9.8 meters per second squared as A and we get force, Earth gravity, equals mass times 9.8 meters per second per second. So we can see that MA equals MG and what do we know from this?"
Penny,"Uh, we know thatÑ Newton was a really smart cookie. Oh! Is that where Fig Newtons come from?"
Sheldon,"No, Fig Newtons are named after a small town in Massachusetts. Donêt write that down!"
Sheldon,"Now, if MA equals MG what does that imply?"
Penny,I donêt know.
Sheldon,How can you not know? I just told you. Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
Penny,Hey! You donêt have to be so mean!
Sheldon,Iêm sorry.  Have you suffered a recent blow to the head?
Penny,"No, you just suck at teaching."
Sheldon,"Really? Of those two explanations, which one seems the most likely?"
Penny,"Oh, God, Sheldon, look Iêm trying to understand, but youêre going too fast. Can you just back up a little bit?"
Sheldon,All right. Itês a warm summer evening in ancient GreeceÑ
Penny,Not that far back!
Sheldon,Okay! At what point did you begin to feel lost?
Penny,I donêt know. Where were we looking up at the night sky?
Penny,Damn it!
Sheldon,"Thereês no need to get frustrated, people learn at different rates. Unlike objects falling in a vacuum, whichÑ? MA equals MG?"
Penny,Then I donêt know.
Sheldon,Why are you crying?
Penny,Because Iêm stupid!
Sheldon,"Thatês no reason to cry. One cries because one is sad. For example, I cry because others are stupid and it makes me sad."
Penny,"Okay, look, can we just please forget about all this extra stuff and can you just tell me what Leonard does?"
Sheldon,All right. Leonard is attempting to learn why sub-atomic particles move the way they do.
Penny,"Really? Thatês it? Well, that doesnêt sound so complicated."
Sheldon,Itês not. Thatês why Leonard does it.
Penny,"Okay, I just have one question. What exactly are sub-atomic particles?"
Sheldon,A good question.
Penny,Thank you.
Sheldon,"And to answer it, we first must ask ourselves, what is physics?"
Penny,"Oh, balls."
Sheldon,Itês a warm summer evening in ancient GreeceÑ
Howard,"Okay, I got a bone to pick with you."
Leonard,What did I do now?
Howard,"I was in bed with Bernadette, and you text-blocked me."
Howard,"We were completely naked, about to devour each other when, you text her that I have a problem with her hanging out with you."
Leonard,You do have a problem with her hanging out with me.
Howard,"Yeah, but thatês not what you tell her."
Leonard,What was I supposed to tell her?
Howard,"I donêt know, something that doesnêt make me come off as a petty, jealous douche."
Leonard,And what would that be?
Howard,"Come on, do I have to think of everything?"
Bernadette,"Hey, Leonard. Am I too late to see the experiment? Oh, hi."
Bernadette,What are you doing here?
Howard,Same thing youêre doing here. I came to see Leonardês experiment.
Bernadette,"No, you didnêt. You said Leonardês experiment was stupid."
Leonard,You told her my experiment was stupid?
Howard,"I was just repeating what Sheldon said. Letês not get off topic, Bernadette, I need to apologize. I was wrong to tell you who you should be friends with."
Leonard,"Should I, um, leave you two alone?"
Bernadette,"No, Leonard, you should hear this."
Leonard,"Okay, good, êcause I wasnêt really gonna go."
Howard,"Look, I know I come off as confident and worldly, but the truth is Iêm not."
Leonard,Weêre shocked.
Howard,Which is why I tend to feel threatened by other guys.
Leonard,"Or loud noises, clowns and nuns."
Howard,But I now realize how foolish that is.
Leonard,He had a panic attack once when he got his head stuck in a sweater.
Howard,It was a full turtleneck. Why arenêt you helping me?
Leonard,I donêt know. Maybe because Iêm crazy?
Howard,"Bernadette, please, Iêm asking you to give me another chance."
Bernadette,"What do you think, Leonard? Should I give him another chance?"
Leonard,Itês up to you. He didnêt call your experiment stupid.
Bernadette,"Come here, tushy face."
Leonard,"Tushy face, that is going on Twitter right now."
Bernadette,"Raj, you shouldêve seen Leonardês experiment. The interference pattern was so cool when the electron beam was on."
Leonard,Iêm glad you enjoyed it. Most people arenêt that interested in what I do.
Penny,"Actually, thatês not true, Leonard. In fact, recently Iêve been thinking that given the parameters of your experiment, the transport of electrons through the aperture the nano-fabricated metal rings is qualitatively no different than the experiment already conducted in the Netherlands. Their observed phase shift in the diffusing electrons inside the metal ring already conclusively demonstrated the electric analogue of the Aharonov-Bohm quantum-interference effect. Thatês it. Thatês all I know. Oh, wait! Fig Newtons were named after a town in Massachusetts, not the scientist."
Penny,"Oh, I always tear up when the Grinchês heart grows three sizes."
Sheldon,"Tears seem appropriate. Enlargement of the heart muscle, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a serious disease which could lead to congestive heart failure."
Leonard,"Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la."
Penny,"You really didnêt like it, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,"No, on the contrary. I found the Grinch to be a relatable, engaging character, and I was really with him right up to the point that he succumbed to social convention and returned the presents and saved Christmas. What a buzz kill that was."
Leonard,"When we watch Frosty the Snowman, he roots for the sun."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, but the sun is essential for all life on Earth. Frosty is merely a bit of frozen supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat. A crime, by the way, for which he is never brought to account."
Leonard,"Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la."
Penny,I just love decorating the Christmas tree. It makes me feel like a little girl again.
Leonard,We didnêt have a tree when I was growing up.
Penny,Really? Why not?
Leonard,"Mmm, in my family, holidays werenêt so much celebrated as studied for their anthropological and psychological implications on human society."
Penny,"Oh, sounds festive. Did you at least give presents?"
Leonard,"Mmm, in a way. We presented papers, and then broke off into focus groups and critiqued each other."
Penny,"Sheldon, what about you? Did you have a Christmas tree?"
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. We had a tree, we had a manger, we had an inflatable Santa Claus with plastic reindeer on the front lawn. And to make things even more jolly, there were so many blinking lights on the house they induced neighbourhood-wide seizures."
Penny,So I take it you donêt want to help us trim the tree.
Sheldon,I do not. But if you insist on decorating a spider-infested fire hazard in my home I would request that you add this.
Penny,What is it?
Sheldon,"Youêre kidding, right? Itês a bust of Sir Isaac Newton."
Penny,"Oh, sure, sure, yeah. Very Christmassy."
Sheldon,"Wait, excuse me, but itês much more Christmassy than anything youêve put on the tree."
Leonard,Here we go.
Sheldon,"December 25, 1642, Julian calendar, Sir Isaac Newton is born. Jesus, on the other hand, was actually born in the summer. His birthday was moved to coincide with a traditional pagan holiday that celebrated the winter solstice with lit fires and slaughtered goats. Which, frankly, sounds like more fun than 12 hours of church with my mother followed by a fruitcake."
Leonard,"Merry Newton-mas, everyone."
Sheldon,"I sense thatês not sincere, although I have no idea why."
Penny,"No, itês fine. Look, Sir Isaac can go right next to this little candy cane."
Sheldon,Isaac goes at the top of the tree.
Leonard,"No, he doesnêt."
Sheldon,I understand. You dispute Newtonês claim that he invented calculus and you want to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.
Leonard,"Yeah, you got me. Iêm a Leibniz man."
Sheldon,"Well, perhaps when your mother gets here, sheêll talk some sense into you."
Penny,YourÑ your motherês coming? When?
Penny,When were you going to tell me?
Leonard,"Um, tomorrow?"
Penny,Why were you keeping this a secret?
Leonard,"Well, I just, I thoughtÑ"
Sheldon,"If I can interject here, obviously Leonard is concerned that his mother wonêt approve of you as his mate."
Penny,Why wouldnêt she approve of me? Iêm adorable.
Leonard,"You are, itês justÑ"
Sheldon,"If I can interject again. Leonard comes from a remarkably high-achieving family, who have all chosen high-achieving partners. He probably feels that itês doubtful that his mother will be overly impressed with his dating a woman whose most significant achievement is memorizing the Cheesecake Factory menu."
Penny,"Hey, itês a big menu. Thereês two pages just for desserts."
Leonard,"I know. And those specials, they change every day."
Penny,"Okay, you know what? Itês lame when I say it, itês just ridiculous when you pile on."
Leonard,"Okay, sorry."
Penny,So what did she say when you told her we were going out?
Penny,"You didnêt tell her we were going out, did you?"
Penny,Why not?
Sheldon,"Leonard, Iêm no expert on meditation, but if youêre trying to calm yourself down, I believe the word is Om."
Sheldon,No trouble at all.
Leonard,"I drove, Mother. Iêm driving now."
Sheldon,"My pleasure. For a non-physicist, you have a remarkable grasp of how electric dipoles in the brainês water molecules could not possibly form a Bose condensate."
Leonard,"Wait, wait, wait. When did you send my mom notes on a paper?"
Sheldon,August 16th. Right after her carpal tunnel surgery.
Sheldon,You did.
Sheldon,"Neither do I, but itês the social convention."
Leonard,"Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?"
Leonard,"No, I heard that."
Leonard,I just donêt understand why he knows more about your life than I do.
Sheldon,Itês what we think caused your narcissistic personality disorder. We discussed it at length during our last video chat. Although how we got onto the subject of you is baffling.
Leonard,"Fine, Mom. How are you?"
Leonard,Now Iêm less fine.
Leonard,"Sheldon, why didnêt you tell me?"
Sheldon,My bad. I did send a gift from both of us.
Leonard,You must be very happy.
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm not sure about interesting, butÑ"
Leonard,"Not the time, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Very well. Shall we switch topics to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?
Sheldon,"Isnêt she brilliant, Leonard? How I envy you."
Howard,No.
Howard,Because we donêt have latent homosexual feelings toward one another.
Howard,"No, really. I have a girlfriend now."
Howard,She had to go out of town. Her grandmother died.
Howard,"Honest to God. Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend."
Leonard,I donêt know what youêre talking about.
Howard,What do you mean you donêt know what Iêm talking about? Tell her I have a girlfriend!
Leonard,All right. He _hasî a _girlfriend.î
Howard,"Her name is Bernadette, sheês working as a waitress, but sheês going to school to be a microbiologist."
Howard,Do you really think your lips in my ear is helping?
Penny,Hi. Sorry Iêm late.
Leonard,"Oh, glad youêre here, uh, sit down, Iêll get you a plate. Mom, you remember Penny."
Penny,"Well, he sent me a football and a catcherês mitt for Christmas, so Iêm going to say no."
Howard,"If it helps, weêre all good with your breasts."
Penny,"No, it sounded like a compliment."
Leonard,When did this happen?
Sheldon,September 22nd.
Leonard,Mitzyês dead?
Sheldon,"She was old and blind, Leonard. What choice did we have?"
Leonard,I donêt believe this. Why am I the last to know?
Leonard,"Youêre right. Iêm-Iêm-Iêm-Iêm sorry, Iêm way out of line!"
Penny,Nothing. Not a damn thing.
Penny,"Oh, itês not a problem."
Penny,"No, you do not."
Penny,"Yeah, I gotta put a sticker over that. So, uh, you must be devastated about your divorce."
Penny,"Come on, I mean, youêre not upset that your marriage is over?"
Penny,"Sure, sure."
Penny,Eight years?
Penny,Yikes. Whatês so funny?
Penny,You know what? I could use a drink. Do you want to stop for a drink?
Penny,"I do, Iêll teach you."
Sheldon, Leonard?
Leonard,What is it?
Sheldon,I made tea.
Leonard,I donêt want tea.
Sheldon,I didnêt make tea for you. This is my tea.
Leonard,Then why are you telling me?
Sheldon,Itês a conversation starter.
Leonard,Thatês a lousy conversation starter.
Sheldon,"Oh, is it? Weêre conversing. Checkmate."
Leonard,"What do you want, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,What I want is to be departing the Starship Enterprise in a one-man shuttle craft headed to the planetoid I rule known as Sheldon Alpha Five.
Leonard,I want that too. Why are you here?
Sheldon,"To comfort you, of course. No, thatês not going to work at all, Iêll comfort you from over here. Leonard, what youêre experiencing is a classic Jungian crisis in which the aging individual mourns the loss of the never-to-be realized ideal family unit."
Leonard,"Thank you, thatês very comforting."
Sheldon,Thatês not the comforting part.
Leonard,Itês not?
Sheldon,"No, no. The comforting part is that the Germans have a term for what youêre feeling. Weltschmerz. It means the depression that arises from comparing the world as it is to a hypothetical, idealized world."
Leonard,"Youêre right, I do feel better."
Sheldon,"Well, the Germans have always been a comforting people. Just remember, Leonard, where your biological family has failed you, you always have me, your surrogate family."
Leonard,Youêre my surrogate family?
Sheldon,"If itês any consolation, Iêm not happy about it either. Good night."
Penny,"Okay, now this time try drinking it all at once."
Penny,Iêve been responsible for my own buzz since 2003. Another round for me and my homegirl.
Penny,"As long as you donêt feel it running down your pants, youêre fine."
Penny,"Well, we are known for our cheesecake. Hit us again."
Penny,"Hey, Bev, guess what?"
Penny,Iêm sleeping with your son.
Penny,The one from whom I live across the hall from.
Penny,"Oh, Beverly, I canêt talk to my boyfriendês mother about his penis."
Penny,"Actually, Iêve only had the cheesecake. One more time. You know, Leonard did not want to tell you we were dating."
Penny,"Well, letês go find out who."
Penny,Get out here! Your mommy wants to talk to you!
Leonard,What the hell is going on?
Penny,Youêre in trouble.
Penny,"Yeah, not bad, not bad."
Leonard,Are you guys drunk?
Penny,"Oh, thank you."
Penny,What the hell happened to lovely and charming?
Leonard,How come you didnêt tell me that you and Father were getting a divorce? How come you didnêt tell me you had surgery? How come you didnêt tell me my dog died?
Leonard,I do.
Penny,Thatês the Del Taco.
Sheldon,Why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door?
Sheldon,Youêre very welcome.
Leonard,"Once again, Iêm driving. Iêm right here."
Sheldon,I donêt blame you. You were intoxicated.
Sheldon,I blame Penny.
Penny,"I blame Penny, too. Bad Penny."
Leonard,"Wait a minute, what are you talking about? What inappropriate behaviour?"
Leonard,"What the hell, agreed."
Penny,"Oh, thank you, Beverly."
Leonard,"Mother, remember when I was complaining that you donêt communicate with me enough?"
Leonard,Iêm over it.
Penny,"Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la la-la."
Leonard,Look at us. Getting ready for a double date with actual women who publicly acknowledge theyêre our girlfriends.
Howard,"Yes, actual women are the best."
Sheldon,I donêt understand. What other kind of women are there?
Leonard,"Howard, artificial women are your department. You want to take this?"
Howard,"No, it would just freak him out. Listen, before we leave, I should warn you, Iêm a passionate man and I tend towards public displays of affection."
Leonard,"What are you trying to tell me, Howard?"
Howard,"There might be some making out in the car or the restaurant, and I donêt want Bernadette to feel uncomfortable, so it would help if you and Penny made out, too."
Leonard,Donêt worry. Weêre planning to have sex right on the salad bar.
Raj,"Namaste, white people. Good news! I rented us the four-hour edition of Watchmen."
Leonard,Got it.
Howard,Seen it.
Sheldon,Detailed analysis posted online.
Raj,"Well, then what are we going to do tonight?"
Leonard,"Uh, sorry, Raj. Howard and I are going out to dinner with Penny and Bernadette."
Howard,"Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights for me and Leonard. These broncos have been saddled."
Leonard,How did we get actual women?
Raj,"Great. They get girlfriends, and they just abandon us?"
Sheldon,"It is great, isnêt it? We have a wonderful evening ahead of us."
Raj,We do?
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. I just discovered I donêt have enough room on my hard drive for a Linux partition, so you and I are going to perform a full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems."
Raj,I donêt want to do that.
Sheldon,"All right. Well, Iêm going to perform full backup, reinitialize and then reinstall all my operating systems."
Raj,What about me?
Sheldon,"Well, I understand there are several types of artificial women. Maybe you should look into that."
Raj,"Dude, thereês so many cool things we could be doing tonight. Look. At the Glendale Galleria, put on your best zoot suit, itês a salute to Swing music in the center court near Macyês. 5pm to 9pm, huh, huh? A salute to zoot. Sounds like a hoot."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, Raj, I have no desire to salute any article of clothing tonight. Much less one thatês linked to race riots in the 1940s."
Raj,Race riots?
Sheldon,The zoot suit riots.
Raj,"Oh. I always thought that was some sort of after-Christmas sale. Well, then why donêt we just go to the galleria and walk around?"
Sheldon,I donêt need anything at the Galleria. Do you need anything at the Galleria?
Raj,We would just walk around and see whatês what.
Sheldon,Thatês a semantically null sentence.
Raj,"Okay, well, how about this? From the university Web site, 7pm to 10pm, Norton Hall Multipurpose Room, mixer for grad students and faculty of the science and humanities departments. Whether you split atoms or infinitives, this is the place to be."
Sheldon,"Well, thatês certainly amusing, but I have no interest."
Raj,"Come on, Sheldon, the world is filled with people doing things outside. Letês go outside. Outside is good."
Sheldon,"If outside is so good, why has mankind spent thousands of years trying to perfect inside?"
Raj,"I donêt know, itês a marketing scheme. Please, Sheldon, Iêm a young, virile visitor from a foreign land and I need to strut my stuff."
Sheldon,"Let me offer you a compromise. Sometimes when I feel stifled and want a change of scenery, I use my imagination."
Raj,"Oh, boy."
Sheldon,"One of my favourite places to visit is the two-dimensional world described in Edwin Abbottês mathematical fantasy, Flatland."
Raj,I donêt want to go to Flatland.
Sheldon,Youêre only saying that because you havenêt been there. I am now a hexagon in two-dimensional space and can only perceive the edges of other objects.
Sheldon,"Is that you, Raj? I donêt recognize your edge."
Raj,"Sheldon, Iêm begging you. I want to go to this mixer, and I donêt want to go alone."
Sheldon,"Well, youêre in luck, thereês a mixer here in Flatland. Oh, look, thereês a sexually attractive line segment, you should chat her up."
Sheldon,"Tell her youêre a circle, Flatland gals are all hot for circles."
Leonard,"I hope youêre hungry, Bernadette, weêre going to a terrific restaurant."
Bernadette,"Oh, yeah, Iêm starved. When you spend all day in a bio-lab, watching flesh-eating bacteria skeletonize small rodents it really works up an appetite."
Howard,"Flesh-eating bacteria. And yet, I still want to kiss this woman, what does that tell you?"
Penny,That youêd be willing to die a horrible death on the off-chance youêd get to second base?
Bernadette,"Oh, weêre way past second base. Right, Howard?"
Howard,"Well, we kind of disagree about what the bases are."
Bernadette,"Howês your work going, Penny? Any acting jobs?"
Penny,"Well, the last big thing I did was this production of Diary of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. But I think things might be turning around pretty soon."
Leonard,Great. How come?
Penny,"Well, promise you wonêt make fun of me."
Leonard,"Of course, I would never make fun of you."
Penny,"Okay. Well, I went to this psychic who told me that if I cut my hair, Iêm going to get a national commercial."
Leonard,Seriously? Youêre getting career advice from a psychic?
Howard,Good job not making fun of her.
Penny,"Sheês not one of those phonies, okay. She wrote a book and has her own Web site."
Leonard,"Oh, gee, why didnêt you say so? They donêt let just anyone have a Web site."
Penny,Why are you being such a jerk?
Leonard,Youêre surprised? Your psychic didnêt tell you I was going to be a jerk?
Penny,"Ha-ha, bite me."
Leonard,"Come on, Penny."
Howard,Why donêt you kids go ahead and chat? Weêre gonna make out back here.
Bernadette,Iêm sliding into third.
Raj,Thanks for coming with me.
Sheldon,Thanks for giving me your limited edition Green Lantern lantern.
Raj,Did you really have to bring it in with you?
Sheldon,What if evil strikes and my power ring runs low?
Raj,"Come on, letês get a drink."
Sheldon,I donêt drink.
Raj,"Yeah, well I do. And when my wingman is carrying a Green Lantern lantern, I drink a lot. Iêll have a screwdriver, please. Donêt be chintzy with the screw."
Sheldon,I would like a root beer float.
Raj,"Sheldon, they donêt have ice cream."
Sheldon,"They donêt? Well, apparently, these people and I differ greatly on the definition of party."
Raj,Heêll have a Shirley Temple.
Sheldon,And donêt be chintzy with the Shirley.
Raj,"Okay, letês check out the females."
Sheldon,All right. Thereês a female.
Raj,"Thatês Professor Wilkinsonês wife, sheês like 80 years old."
Sheldon,But sheês female. Isnêt that the game?
Raj,Iêm looking for a hookup.
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. So, the point of this exercise is for you to find someone to copulate with?"
Raj,"Not so loud, but ideally, yes. Thanks."
Sheldon,Thank you. And what is my function as wingman?
Raj,You help me run my game.
Sheldon,Okay. What is your game?
Sheldon,"When I lie through my teeth to a woman, you nod and agree."
Sheldon,Itês a limited edition Green Lantern lantern. My friend is looking for someone to copulate with.
Sheldon,Iêm Sheldon. How do you do?
Raj,How do you do? Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali. Call me Raj.
Raj,The mysterious subcontinent of India.
Raj,You know India?
Raj,"Well, Iêm a slumdog astrophysicist."
Sheldon,I thought your father was a gynaecologist. Iêm sorry. 
Sheldon,"In brightest day, in darkest night, no evil shall escape my sight."
Sheldon,Thank you. Have you chosen one to copulate with?
Bernadette,"So, what should we talk about?"
Howard,"Well, we could always learn more about why people who believe in psychics are idiots. Leonard?"
Penny,"Oh, we donêt need to talk about that anymore. Leonard covered it pretty well in the car."
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, but facts are facts."
Penny,"Right, and if you canêt understand it, itês not a fact."
Leonard,"No, if itês not a fact, itês not a fact."
Penny,"Oh, got it. Thank you for educating me."
Leonard,Youêre welcome. Howês your fish?
Penny,Amazing. Would you like to try some?
Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
Penny,"Well, the fact is, you canêt."
Leonard,"Come on, Howard, Bernadette, youêre both scientists. Help me out here."
Howard,What do you think? Want to jump right into the middle of another coupleês argument?
Bernadette,"No, thank you."
Leonard,Maybe we should just stop talking about this.
Penny,Maybe some of us should stop talking altogether.
Bernadette,Really uncomfortable.
Leonard,"You know, the best thing about being in a committed, monogamous, mutually supportive relationship is that even if you have different ideas, you can have a spirited debate, yet still care for, even make love withÑ "
Leonard,Whatês going on?
Sheldon,We scored. Iêm the wingman.
Howard,"Had a great night last night. I donêt like to kiss and tell, but somebody made it to eighth base."
Leonard,What the hell is eighth base?
Howard,"Seventh base with shirt off. Well, my shirt. Howêd things go with Penny?"
Leonard,"Oh, couldnêt be better."
Howard,Are we taking our relationship frustrations out on innocent Cylons?
Leonard,Itês not just Cylons. Supermanês next.
Howard,"All right, I was going to try to squeeze in a little more mocking before lunch, but I can come back later when you donêt have a high-powered weapon."
Leonard,How can I go out with a woman who believes in psychics?
Howard,"Hey, I once dated a girl who believed she was abducted by aliens."
Leonard,And that didnêt bother you?
Howard,Au contraire. It meant she was gullible and open to a little probing.
Leonard,"What am I supposed to do, pretend I believe something I donêt whenever Iêm with Penny?"
Howard,"Hey, Iêm sure Penny fakes all kinds of things when sheês with you."
Leonard,"Do me a favour, lean over, put your head right here."
Howard,Let me show you another way to look at this. Here we have the universe of all women. These are the ones you want to sleep with. These are the women who believe exactly what you believe. These are the women who would be willing to sleep with you. And right there in the
Leonard,"Whatês your point? In order to keep having a sexual relationship with Penny, I have to give up everything I believe in, my intellectual integrity, the very nature of who I am? I canêt do that, Howard."
Howard,I respect that.  
Leonard,What is that?
Howard,Your new girlfriend. Have fun tonight.
Sheldon,The dogÑ koira. The roofÑ katto. GrapesÑ ryp leet.  One minute. Sis  n.
Raj,What was that?
Sheldon,"It means come in. Itês taking forever to load the new operating system on my computer. I disinfected the kitchen and the bathroom, and now I thought Iêd learn Finnish."
Raj,"__ __ ________ ___ _____. Thatês Hindi for whatever floats your boat. Uh, listen, I got a text from that girl Abby, and she and her friend Martha want to hang out with us again. What do you say?"
Sheldon,I donêt say anything. I merely offer you a facial expression that suggests youêve gone insane.
Raj,I donêt get it. You had a great time.
Sheldon,"Yes, exactly, I had a great time. Thatês done, Iêve moved on to other things. For example, after I learn Finnish, Iêm not going to learn Finnish again."
Raj,"Please, Sheldon, Iêm a lost Indian boy far from home, and I want a girlfriend and I want her to be Abby, and sheêll only come over if she can bring Martha."
Sheldon,"Raj, I highly doubt there is any argument you can make, threat you might levy, rhetorical strategy, plea, invocation, supplication, orÑ vetoomus that you can employ that would convince me to reconsider."
Raj,My Incredible Hulk hands signed by Stan Lee.
Sheldon,"Oh, my. Iêve admired these for years."
Raj,So does that mean we can go with the girls again?
Sheldon,Hulk agree to second date with puny humans!
Raj,You canêt wear the hands on the date.
Sheldon,Hulk sad.
Leonard,"Hey. Cleaning out the old dryer lint, huh? Not only is it courteous, itês safety smart. Every year, 15,000 fires are caused by accidental dryer lint ignition. Now youêre supposed to say, wow, what an interesting fact. Come here, you crazy, nerdy guy. I could never be mad at you."
Penny,"Wow, thatês all you got after you were the most obnoxious person on a double date that included Howard Wolowitz?"
Leonard,"No, Iêm sorry. I really am. Itês not right to mock what a person believes in."
Penny,Thank you. Would you be willing to go to my psychic and see what itês all about?
Leonard,Would you be willing to read a book that concisely explains how all psychics are frauds?
Penny,I would not.
Leonard,"Okay, letês go see your psychic."
Leonard,"Well, yeah, one of us has to keep an open mind."
Penny,You saying I donêt have an open mind?
Leonard,"No, not at all. Let me help you with this stuff."
Penny,"You know, I believe in ghosts, too."
Penny,And astrology.
Leonard,"I know, and pyramid power and healing crystals."
Penny,"Oh, no, no, no, crystals donêt work."
Leonard,"Really, thatês the line? Psychics are real, but crystals are voodoo?"
Penny,"Oh, voodooês real. You donêt want to mess with voodoo."
Sheldon,"You know, I had never considered that. Wow, thatês going to completely change my visits there. Well, itês late."
Sheldon,Time for bed.
Sheldon,"Good night, puny human! ."
Sheldon,"Well, I suppose. Come in. Iêll sleep in Leonardês room. Good night."
Howard,"Boy, seems like forever since the four of us have been out to eat, you know? Just the guys."
Raj,"Oh, God! Yes, we get it. You have a girlfriend now."
Howard,"A little jealous, are we?"
Raj,"No, Iêm not jealous. All right, Iêd kill a hobo if itêll get me laid. Now, can we order?"
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, they re-did the menu."
Leonard,So what? Itês the same food.
Sheldon,"Oh, is it? Look at this. General Tsoês Chicken is no longer listed under specialties. Itês now under chicken."
Sheldon,"Yes, General Tso."
Raj,"Not Tso the chicken, so the question. So?"
Sheldon,"So, why is it no longer a specialty? Did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself? And look over here, shrimp in mobster sauce. What is mobster sauce?"
Leonard,Itês obviously a typo.
Sheldon,"Perhaps. Perhaps this restaurantês now a front for organized crime. For all we know, the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased mobsters."
Raj,"No, no, no, no, I think it just means itês the kind of sauce that mobsters like."
Howard,It doesnêt mean any of that! Itês a typo.
Leonard,You know what? Letês just get a pizza.
Sheldon,Good idea. Weêll go to Corleoneês.
Howard,"Sure, no mobsters there."
Sheldon,"You know, the more I think about it, the mobster sauce couldnêt possibly contain chunks of mobster."
Leonard,And why is that?
Sheldon,It was listed under seafood.
Leonard,What if they were mobsters who slept with the fishes?
Sheldon,"Leonard, are we having a serious conversation or not?"
Leonard,What theÑ?
Sheldon,The TV is gone.
Leonard,So are our laptops.
Sheldon,"Oh God, oh God, oh, God! Itês all right. They didnêt take my comic books."
Sheldon,"They took our TV, two laptops, four external hard-drives, our PS2, our PS3, our X-Box, our X-Box 360, our classic Nintendo, our Super Nintendo, our Nintendo 64 and our Wii."
Leonard,We like games.
Sheldon,"Right, games. They took Halo 1, Halo 2, Halo 3, Call of Duty 1, Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3, Rock Band, Rock Band 2, Final Fantasy 1 thru 9, The Legend of Zelda, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Super Mario Brothers, Super Mario Galaxy, Mario and Sonic at the Winter Olympics and Ms. Pacman."
Sheldon,When does the CSI team get here?
Sheldon,"In anticipation of their arrival, Iêve bagged some evidence. One of the thieves had the audacity to quench his thirst while ransacking our home. You should be able to pull some good prints off this. And now, here are my prints so you can rule me out as a suspect."
Leonard,What about me?
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, Leonard. Itês too early to discount the possibility of this being an inside job."
Leonard,Would I be completely out of line to ask you to shoot him?
Sheldon,Iêm not crazy. My mother had me tested.
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, thatês the end of your inquiry?"
Sheldon,"Oh, my goodness. Where do I begin? For instance, my laptop contained four out of the five gedanken experiments necessary for a cogent restatement of the quantum measurement problem."
Leonard,How is that going to help them?
Sheldon,"Well, they could monitor scientific publications and see if anyone posts such a cogent restatement in the next couple of months. If so, the authors are most likely in possession of my stolen laptop."
Leonard,What are we supposed to do now?
Sheldon,The only thing we can do. Watch TV on our phones until the criminals return and bludgeon us to death in our sleep.
Leonard,Does that mean youêve ruled me out as a suspect?
Sheldon,"Oh, how I wish I could."
Sheldon,I do not have to urinate. I am the master of my own bladder. Drat.
Penny,"I canêt believe it. If I hadnêt been working the dinner shift, I wouldêve run"
Leonard,"Hey, thereês no reason for you to be scared."
Penny,Iêm not scared. I wouldêve gone all Nebraska on their asses.
Sheldon, Leonard and Penny.
Leonard,Hand me the bat.
Sheldon,"We just had a major crime in the building, and you open the door without asking who it is?"
Penny,"It wonêt happen again, whatês up?"
Sheldon,Nothing. Just wanted to see if you were both okay.
Leonard,"Weêre fine, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"All right, then. Good night."
Penny,"Good night. That was weird, even for him."
Sheldon, Leonard and Penny.
Penny,Who is it?
Sheldon,Sheldon. Sheldon Cooper.
Sheldon,May I come in?
Sheldon,I see youêre drinking wine.
Leonard,"Yes, we are. And weêre about to go to bed."
Penny,"Sheldon, do you want to sleep here tonight?"
Sheldon,"Oh, as small as Leonard is, I donêt think the two of youêd be comfortable on the couch."
Leonard,What do you want?
Sheldon,"Itês not what I want, itês what evolution wants. Human beings are primates. Primates have evolved to live in groups, both for protection and support."
Leonard,But you donêt like other people.
Sheldon,I do tonight. Itês scary over there.
Leonard,"Itês getting scary here, too."
Penny,"UmÑ three little kittens? Three little pigs? God, I donêt know. Star Wars?"
Leonard,Did we win? Can we go to bed?
Sheldon,"Good Lord, I could not have made this easier. Hydrogen atom, H, plus pigs minus pea, Higgs. Bow, General Zod trapped in the Phantom Zone. Bow-zone. Pear. Tickle. Pear-tickle. Higgs Boson Particle. How could you not get that?"
Leonard,"Heês right, Penny. Itês all there."
Penny,"Look, Sheldon, sweetie, I know youêre feeling insecure, but weêve really got to go to sleep."
Sheldon,All right. Iêll take the first watch and wake you at 0400.
Leonard,Great. Good night.
Penny,"Wait, wait, whatês 0400?"
Penny,"Thatês, like, in 45 minutes."
Leonard,Just keep walking. 
Sheldon,Bad idea.
Sheldon,"Listen to her, Jim."
Sheldon, Leonard and Penny!
Leonard,Who is it?
Howard,"All right, weêve got a titanium dead bolt and a reinforced jamb controlled by a state-of-the-art electronic access system."
Sheldon,What if they cut the power?
Raj,Thereês a 200-watt uninterruptible backup power supply.
Sheldon,What if someone steals my keys?
Raj,There are independent voice and fingerprint scanners.
Sheldon,"What if someone kidnaps me, forces me to record my voice, and then cuts off my thumb?"
Leonard,Iêll send them a basket of muffins.
Howard,"Now, inside, weêve got motion detectors, infrared sensors, and cameras connected to a server running state-of-the-art facial recognition software."
Leonard,Where did you get all this stuff?
Howard,I got a buddy over at the Department of Defence.
Leonard,He just gave it to you?
Howard,"Iêm sure he would have if I had asked. Ironically, their security isnêt all that good."
Leonard,"Sorry, let me help you."
Sheldon,Wonderful security system if weêre attacked by a school of tuna.
Howard,"Donêt worry, the netês going to be electrified. Picture her on the floor, spasming uncontrollably."
Sheldon,"Sheldonês journal. Security system in place. However, sleep continues to elude me. Iêve seen the underbelly of Pasadena, this so-called City of Roses, and it haunts me. Ah, the injustice, I lie here awake, tormented, while out there evil lurks, probably playing Donkey Kong on my classic Nintendo.  Leonard and Penny."
Penny,"Oh, myÑ"
Leonard,"God, Sheldon. What the hell are you doing out there?"
Sheldon,I heard a noise.
Leonard,It was us. We knocked over a lamp.
Sheldon,Why would you knock over a lamp?
Leonard,We were going to haveÑ
Penny,"He doesnêt need to know what we were doing, Leonard."
Sheldon,"Oh! No, sheês right, I donêt need to know what you were doing. Carry on. "
Leonard,What are you doing? Use the door.
Sheldon,Good thinking. Perhaps Iêll check the perimeter and make some warm milk.
Leonard,"Great, you do that."
Sheldon,Would you like me to bring you some warm milk?
Leonard,Iêm lactose intolerant.
Sheldon,"And you donêt wish to alarm me with any more loud noises, very thoughtful. Warm milk, Penny?"
Penny,"No, thanks."
Sheldon,"Fine. Good night to you, sir. Miss."
Leonard,Sorry about that.
Penny,"Ugh, what can you do? Here. "
Leonard,Looks like Wolowitz got the net electrified.
Penny,"Sheldon, are you okay?"
Sheldon,Iêm fine. Although Iêm no longer the master of my own bladder.
Sheldon,My new computer came with Windows 7. Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista. I donêt like that.
Leonard,Donêt you think looking for a new city to live in is a bit of an overreaction?
Sheldon,"Our apartment was broken into, our security system tried to kill me, and as a result, Iêm leaving Pasadena forever. Tell me how thatês overreacting."
Penny,"Come on, Sheldon, you canêt move. Donêt you need to stay in one place so the mother ship can find you when it returns?"
Sheldon,"Oh, if that were only true. Unfortunately, as Iêm earthbound for the foreseeable future, I need to find a location thatês more hospitable than the mean streets of Pasadena. Like Enid, Oklahoma. Low crime rate and high-speed Internet connectivity, but no model train shops. Sorry, Enid."
Penny,Is he quitting his job at the university?
Leonard,"Oh, no, heês going to telecommute. Everybodyês really excited about it."
Sheldon,"All right. Boone, North Carolina. Every summer since 1952, Boone has hosted an outdoor amphitheater portrayal of the life and times of its namesake, Danêl Boone. Sounds like something that would attract the wrong crowd. Penny, youêre from Nebraska, correct?"
Penny,Born and raised. 
Sheldon,"It will take me a few days to get settled. After I do, I will e-mail you detailed PDFs containing diagrams and instructions that will guide you through packing and shipping the rest of my possessions to Bozeman, Montana. In the meantime, please forward my mail."
Leonard,"Any place specific or just the Bozeman, Montana Loony Bin?"
Sheldon,"I sense youêre making a joke, but Bozeman does have a comedy club called The Loony Bin, so do not forward my mail there."
Howard,"Oh, come on. So you were the victim of a crime. Thatês part of life. When my great-grandfather first came to this country, he put all his hopes and dreams into this little butcher shop he ran on the Lower East Side of New York. You know what happened? Every customer who walked into that butcher shop and asked for a pound of liver, got ripped off. But, those people moved on, and so should you."
Sheldon,I am moving on. Iêm going to be a Bozite.
Leonard,They call themselves Bozites?
Sheldon,They should. Itês one of the first things I plan to bring up upon arrival.
Penny,"Sheldon, I canêt believe Iêm saying this, but Iêm going to miss you."
Sheldon,"Please, Penny, as you know, Iêm not comfortable with prolonged good-byes and maudlin displays of emotion, so I prepared a short video."
Penny,"Sheldon, thatês soÑ "
Sheldon,You might want to lock the door behind me. This isnêt Bozeman.
Howard,How the hell do I know whoês the friend and whoês the acquaintance?
Sheldon,"That is a bracing cold, an invigorating cold. Lord, is it cold!"
Sheldon,"Thank you, fellow Bozite. And may I say, you are the living embodiment of all the promises made by our lovely townês Chamber of Commerce.  One ticket to Pasadena, California, please."
Howard,"Hey, look whoês back!"
Sheldon,Interesting. The acquaintance is the first to greet me.
Penny,Whatcha doing?
Sheldon,Iêm attempting to view my work as a fleeting peripheral image so as to engage the superior colliculus of my brain.
Penny,Interesting. I usually just have coffee. Youêve been up all night?
Sheldon,Is it morning?
Sheldon,Then Iêve been up all night.
Penny,And youêre stuck?
Sheldon,Why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus?
Penny,"Oh, sorry, sweetie, I canêt help you till Iêve had my coffee."
Leonard,"Penny, I told you if you donêt put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment."
Penny,What is he doing now?
Leonard,"Mmm, heês either isolating the terms of his formula and examining them individually, or looking for the alligator that swallowed his hand after Peter Pan cut it off."
Sheldon,"Captain Hookês hand was eaten by a crocodile, not an alligator. If youêre going to mock me, at least get your facts straight."
Leonard,"Aye, aye, Captain."
Sheldon,I canêt see it! It just wonêt coalesce.
Leonard,Maybe you need a fresh start.
Sheldon,"Youêre right.  Itês a great idea, Leonard. Thank you."
Sheldon,"Electrons move through graphene, act as if they have no massÑ"
Howard,How long has he been stuck?
Leonard,Intellectually about 30 hours. Emotionally about 29 years.
Sheldon,Unit cell contains two carbon atoms. Interior angle of a hexagon is 120 degrees.
Howard,Have you tried rebooting him?
Leonard,"No, I think itês a firmware problem."
Raj,"Hey, itês Disco Night at the Moonlight Roller Rink in Glendale tonight. Whoês up for getting down?"
Howard,"Oh, thatês perfect. Bernadetteês been hocking me to take her roller skating."
Leonard,I think Penny likes to skate. The four of us could double.
Howard,What could be better? Weêre in.
Raj,Great. Itês not like I brought it up because I wanted to go.
Howard,You can come with us.
Raj,"No, itês okay. I donêt have to go. Iêm happy just to guide you and your ladies to suitable entertainment choices. Iêm a walking brown Yelp.com."
Sheldon,"Structure, constant structure. One atomÑ"
Howard,"Boy, heês really gone, isnêt he?"
Leonard,"Yeah, this morning he used a stick of butter as deodorant."
Howard,I thought I smelled popcorn.
Sheldon,"Pattern is the same as fermions, travels on the pathways, hexagonal, itês always hexagonalÑ"
Leonard,I havenêt seen him this stuck since he tried to figure out the third Matrix movie.
Raj,"Hey, those are my lima beans!"
Sheldon,"Not lima beans, carbon atoms."
Raj,"But if I donêt eat my lima beans, I canêt have my cookie."
Leonard,"Here, you want my peas?"
Sheldon,"Peas! Perfect, they can be electrons."
Howard,Want my corn?
Sheldon,Donêt be ridiculous. What would I do with corn?
Leonard,"So roller skating, should we all grab a bite to eat first?"
Howard,Good. P.F. Changês? My mom has coupons.
Leonard,"Great. Your momês not coming, right?"
Howard,"Not this time, I promise."
Raj,"Okay, just to be clear, roller skating was my idea, and Iêm very unhappy that you turned it into a double date, and I hope you both fall on your asses and break your coccyxes."
Sheldon,The plural of coccyx is coccyges.
Raj,Screw you. Give me back my lima beans.
Bernadette,"Oh, my God, have you ever been so embarrassed?"
Penny,Not recently.
Bernadette,"I donêt know which was lamer, their roller-skating or their disco dancing."
Penny,"For me, the worst part was when people saw us leave with them."
Leonard,"You had some nice moves out there, Howard."
Howard,"Thanks. You, too."
Leonard,Yeah. Did you notice all the people looking at us?
Howard,Not really. I was in my boogie zone.
Bernadette,When Howard tried to do the splitsÑ
Leonard,Sorry. Iêm moving a little slow. I think I bruised my coccyx.
Penny,"Oh, poor baby."
Leonard,Donêt tell Koothrappali. After you.
Penny,"Oh, what a gentleman. Hey, Sheldon. "
Leonard,"Oh, my God! Are youÑ "
Sheldon,Good Lord! Youêre ruining everything!
Penny,"Oh, damn."
Leonard,Are you okay?
Penny,Do I look okay?
Leonard,"Donêt bark at me. I fell, too."
Penny,"Oh, youêve been falling all night. Youêre used to it."
Howard,"Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?"
Sheldon,The same thing Iêve been doing for three days. Trying to figure out why electrons behave as if they have no mass when travelling through a graphene sheet.
Bernadette,With marbles?
Sheldon,"Well, I needed something bigger than peas, now, didnêt I?"
Bernadette,"Sheldon, when was the last time you got any sleep?"
Sheldon,"I donêt know, two, three days. Not important. I donêt need sleep, I need answers. I need to determine where in this swamp of unbalanced formulas squatteth the toad of truth."
Penny,Toad of truth? Is that a physics thing?
Leonard,"No, thatês a crazy thing."
Bernadette,"Okay, Sheldon. What happens to our neuroreceptors when we donêt get enough REM sleep?"
Sheldon,They lose their sensitivity to serotonin and norepinephrine.
Bernadette,Which leads toÑ?
Sheldon,Impaired cognitive function.
Bernadette,"Right, so march in there, brush your teeth and go to bed."
Sheldon,But I donêt want to go to bed.
Bernadette,Iêm going to count to three. OneÑ
Sheldon,"Oh, all right."
Leonard,That was amazing how you handled him.
Bernadette,I know how to deal with stubborn children. My mother used to run an illegal day care centre in our basement.
Penny,"Leonard, youêreÑ youêre giggling in your sleep."
Leonard,"Itês not me, itês my new ringtone. The Joker from Batman."
Penny,"Well, it creeps me out."
Leonard,"Me, too, but I paid three bucks for it."
Penny,Just answer the phone.
Leonard,"Hello. Yeah, Iêm Leonard Hofstadter. Yeah, yeah, heês my roommate. Oh, God, is he okay? Yeah, alright, alright, Iêll be right there."
Penny,What happened?
Leonard,Sheldonês escaped and is terrorizing the village.
Penny,Okay. Have fun.
Leonard,Hi. Iêm Dr. Hofstadter. Where is he?
Leonard,Thanks for not calling the cops.
Leonard,"Yeah, well, heês extra special. Hey, Shelly. What you doing?"
Sheldon,Size ratio was all wrong. Couldnêt visualize it. Needed bigger carbon atoms.
Leonard,"Sure, sure. How did you get into this place?"
Sheldon,"Back door has a five-pin tumbler system, single-circuit alarm. Childês play. You can start sorting protons and neutrons while I build carbon atoms."
Leonard,"No, I donêt think so. We need to go home now."
Sheldon,But Iêm still working.
Leonard,"If you donêt come out of there, Iêm going to have to drag you out."
Sheldon,"You can try, but youêll never catch me. "
Leonard,"For Godês sakes. Sheldon, come here!"
Sheldon, Leonard and Penny.
Leonard,"what, what?"
Sheldon, Leonard and Penny.
Sheldon,I have good news.
Leonard,And you had to barge in here and wake us up in the middle of the night?
Sheldon,Your cell phone was off.
Leonard,Because we didnêt want to be disturbed.
Sheldon,"And that didnêt work out, did it?"
Penny,"Sheldon, what do you want?"
Sheldon,I came to tell you Iêve got the answer.
Leonard,Really? You figured out the graphene problem?
Sheldon,"No, no, Iêm still hopelessly stuck on that, but I figured out how to figure it out."
Penny,"Hey, you know what, Leonard, I know I said I could handle your roommate, but I was wrong. Weêre going to have to break up."
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Leonard,"Yeah, Iêm going to need a little more."
Sheldon,Albert Einstein.
Leonard,Keep going.
Sheldon,"When Albert Einstein came up with special relativity, he was working at the patent office."
Leonard,"So, youêre going to go work at the patent office?"
Sheldon,"Donêt be absurd. Thatês in Washington. You know I could never live in a city whose streets are laid out in a wheel-and-spoke pattern. Iêm going to find a similarly menial job where my basal ganglia are occupied with a routine task, freeing my prefrontal cortex to work quietly in the background on my problem."
Leonard,Sounds like a great plan.
Sheldon,Of course it is. Even talking to you is sufficiently menial that I can feel the proverbial juices starting to flow.
Leonard,"Okay, well, thanks for sharing with us. Good night."
Sheldon,"Youêre welcome. Good night to you, too. Oh, by the way, I was watching you sleep for a moment, and I noticed that your snoring seems to be worse when youêre on your back."
Penny,Leonard doesnêt snore.
Sheldon,"No, I wasnêt talking to Leonard."
Leonard,Told you.
Sheldon,A menial job. Like yours.
Sheldon,"I do. For thousands of years, the lowest classes of the human race have spent their lives labouring to erect monuments under the lash of their betters, until finally they dropped down and became one with the dust through which they trudged. Do you have anything like that?"
Sheldon,Shouldnêt you check your database?
Sheldon,You didnêt really type.
Sheldon,"Oh, that would be good! Sawing, hammering, eating out of a lunch pail as my working-class fellows and I sit perched precariously on a girder high above the metropolis."
Sheldon,I could do that.
Sheldon,One question.
Sheldon,Whatês sheetrock?
Sheldon,That seems acceptable.
Sheldon,I donêt drive.
Sheldon,"Senior theoretical particle physicist at CalTech, focusing on M theory, or, in laymanês terms, string theory."
Penny,"Okay, Iêll get those drinks started for you."
Sheldon,Behind you.
Penny,"Sheldon, what the hell are you doing?"
Sheldon,Iêm trying to get these tables cleared. Weêre slammed.
Penny,"No, wait, wait, no, wait. Wh.. what are you doing here?"
Sheldon,"A reasonable question. I asked myself, what is the most mind-numbing, pedestrian job conceivable, and three answers came to mind, uh, toll booth attendant, an Apple Store genius, and what Penny does. Now, since I donêt like touching other peopleês coins, and I refuse to contribute to the devaluation of the word genius, here I am."
Penny,"You just, you just walked in and they hired you, just like that?"
Sheldon,"Oh, heavens, no. Since I donêt need to be paid, I didnêt need to be hired. I simply came in, picked up a tray, and started working for the man. Let me get that plate out of your way."
Penny,"Sheldon, this is ridiculous."
Sheldon,"Is it? Just a moment ago I had a minor epiphany regarding the polymer degradation phenomenon while scraping congealed nachos off a plate. Bernadette, table 10 wants their check."
Bernadette,"Thanks, Sheldon."
Penny,"Sheldon, wait, this isnêt even what I do. Iêm a waitress, not a busboy."
Sheldon,"Youêre right. That is more menial. Hello, Iêm Sheldon. Iêll be your server today. I donêt recommend the salmon. I saw it in the kitchen."
Sheldon,"All right, one bacon cheeseburger, breaking two Jewish dietary restrictions simultaneously, kudos. Beer-battered fish and chips. Now, hereês your tartar sauce. I also brought you salsa. Itês a little unconventional, but I think youêll like it. Itês zingy. And for you, Factory Burrito Grande, no cheese, no sour cream, no ugly consequences from your lactose intolerance. Bon app_tit."
Leonard,"Hang on. Black beans, not pinto beans?"
Leonard,Double guacamole?
Sheldon,Of course.
Leonard,No cilantro?
Leonard,"Lettuce shredded, not chopped?"
Leonard,You understand why Iêm doing this to you?
Sheldon,I do.
Leonard,Thatêll be all. That was fun.
Raj,How long can he keep this up?
Leonard,"I heard about this professor at MIT who melted down, bought a van, and spent the rest of his life as a mobile dog groomer."
Raj,He never went back to the university?
Leonard,Only to shampoo Professor Chambourgês shih tzu.
Howard,"I bet if we all chipped in, we could buy Sheldon a van."
Raj,But heês afraid of dogs.
Leonard,"Yeah, thatês the only thing wrong with that plan."
Penny,"Hey, guys, sorry you had to wait, but we are swamped. Whatês this?"
Leonard,Sheldon took our order.
Penny,Sheldon doesnêt work here.
Leonard,"Well, honey, not to complain, but we were starting to think you didnêt either."
Sheldon,Is that really necessary? Good Lord. The interference pattern in the fracture. The motion of the wave through the molecular structure. Iêve been looking at it all wrong. I canêt consider the electrons as particles. They move through the graphene as a wave. Itês a wave! The moment to applaud would be now. Troglodytes.
Penny,"Sheldon, where are you going? Arenêt you going to clean this up?"
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. I donêt work here.
Howard,Happy now?
Raj,Iêm on a cloud. Swing me. 
Leonard,"Sheldon, come here."
Howard,"Yeah, I miss you, too, sweetie. Listen, I got to go, but Iêll see you tonight? Okay. Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye. No, you hang up first. Hello?"
Raj,"Dude, Iêm glad you finally got a girlfriend, but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff in front of those of us who donêt?"
Sheldon,"Actually, he might have to. Thereês an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because itês not possessed by others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener."
Howard,Thatês not true. My happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone.
Raj,Thank you.
Howard,"Although, Iêd be lying if I said it wasnêt a little bit of a perk."
Leonard,Whoês miserable and alone?
Leonard,Oh. I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.
Sheldon,"In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener."
Leonard,"Hey, what are you and Bernadette doing for your first Valentineês Day?"
Howard,"Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops. Thereês a $39.95 loverês special at P.F. Changês. Egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front."
Sheldon,"Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldnêt a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking oneês steady gal to witness a brutal murder?"
Howard,"I understand your point, but given a choice, Jews always go with Chinese food."
Raj,"Well, if anyoneês interested, Iêll be spending this Valentineês Day the same way I spend every Valentineês Day. Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal."
Leonard,"Okay, so to sum up: one giant marble horse, one asinine comment, one lonely man and his chicken. And letês see, whoês left? Oh, thatês right. My plans. Isnêt anyone going to ask?"
Raj,"Fine, tell us youêre going to have sex with Penny."
Leonard,Thatês not what I was going to tell you.
Raj,Itês okay. I donêt mind hearing about your sex life. Itês his that bugs me.
Leonard,Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider on February 14?
Sheldon,"Professor Norton, although, God knows why. He hasnêt published anything of note since he won that Nobel Prize."
Leonard,"Actually, Professor Norton canêt make it. He threw his back out rock climbing."
Howard,I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.
Raj,The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?
Howard,Thatês the one.
Leonard,"In any case, theyêre asking me to fill in for him."
Sheldon,In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?
Leonard,Switzerland. And I get to bring a guest!
Howard,"Oh, man!"
Raj,"No way, dude!"
Sheldon,"This is incredible! Iêm so happy, Iêm not even going to question their judgment in picking you. Iêm just going to run home and start packing."
Raj,Why wouldnêt you take Penny?
Leonard,I am taking Penny.
Raj,"Oh. Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home."
Leonard,"Sheldon, you got a minute?"
Sheldon,"Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says après supercollider?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, Iêm not taking you to Switzerland."
Sheldon,"Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?"
Sheldon,Thatês absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
Leonard,"Yes, but itêll be Valentineês Day. We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps."
Sheldon,But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Sorry? Iêve been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old.
Leonard,"Yeah, well, Iêve been dreaming about spending Valentineês Day with a girl since I was six."
Sheldon,Shame on you! Thatês no dream for a scientist!
Penny,"Okay, whatês the big surprise?"
Leonard,Just a minute. This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentineês Day.
Penny,"Oh. Wow. Okay. Letês see. Weêve got, uh, milk chocolate, Swiss cheese, fondue. My lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this, then Iêm going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?"
Leonard,"But it does involve air travel. Okay, um, let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife, and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa."
Penny,"Okay, Iêm starting to think Swiss is key here."
Penny,Weêre going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn?
Leonard,How does that involve air travel?
Penny,Weêre going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn?
Penny,"Okay, sweetie, this started out fun, but Iêm over it."
Leonard,Weêre going to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider! And ski. Weêll also go skiing.
Penny,Weêre going skiing in Switzerland?!
Leonard,"Well, youêll ski, Iêll fall, but, yeah, we will be in Switzerland for Valentineês Day."
Penny,"Oh, my God, Leonard! Thatês incredible!"
Sheldon,"Not so fast. You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny."
Penny,My Rabe-what-ly?
Sheldon,"Rabeliechtli. It means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain Swiss festivals. Which you will not be celebrating because, A, these festivals occur in the fall, and B, you will not be going to Switzerland."
Leonard,"Sheldon, weêve been through this. Iêm taking Penny."
Sheldon,Afraid not. Do you recognize this?
Leonard,Not the roommate agreement.
Sheldon,"Indeed, the roommate agreement. I call your attention to the Friendship Rider in Appendix C, Future Commitments. Number 37, in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the Large Hadron Collider, now under construction in Switzerland, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him."
Leonard,"Oh, for Godês sakes."
Penny,You actually put that in an agreement?
Leonard,"Yeah. We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie."
Sheldon,"He canêt kill me, even if I turn."
Penny,Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?
Sheldon,"No, that seemed a little farfetched."
Leonard,"Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?"
Sheldon,"Iêve lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply donêt care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing."
Penny,"Okay, I know I shouldnêt ask, but what isÑ?"
Sheldon,Iêd be much further along if Iêd been allowed to practice.
Leonard,"Look, Sheldon, I know itês in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you. In fact, Iêll even let you eat my brains. But I am taking Penny to Switzerland."
Sheldon,Is that your final decision?
Leonard,It is.
Sheldon,Very well.
Penny,"Itês not over, is it?"
Leonard,What do you think? 
Leonard,"Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh? Think itês gonna rain? Instead of underpants, I covered my crotch with potato salad this morning. Thoughts? Okay, I know whatêll cheer you up, letês play one of your driving games."
Sheldon,"All right. This game is called Traitors. I will name three historical figures, you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal. Benedict Arnold, Judas, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter."
Leonard,You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?
Sheldon,Youêre right. Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.
Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon. Canêt you at least try to understand how much this means to me?"
Sheldon,"Round two, Leonard Hofstadter, Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch."
Leonard,Rupert Murdoch?
Sheldon,"He owns Fox, and they cancelled Firefly. Hint, he and Darth Vader are tied for number 2."
Howard,Iêm sorry I couldnêt hang with you last night. I had a date with Bernadette.
Raj,I know. I saw the Tweet.
Howard,"So, what did you end up doing?"
Raj,Not much. Nuked a burrito. Prayed to the Hindu god Urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.
Leonard,You seen Sheldon?
Raj,Is he still mad about the supercollider?
Leonard,"Yeah. He thinks I betrayed him. I mean, come on, what would you guys do if you were me?"
Howard,Iêd take Sheldon to Switzerland.
Howard,Absolutely. And Iêd leave him there. 
Raj,What the hell is that?
Leonard,"Uh, letês see. Yup, 30 pieces of silverware."
Sheldon,"Morning, old chum."
Leonard,Whatês going on?
Sheldon,"Iêve made you breakfast. Juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See, hereês Frodo."
Leonard,You made Frodo pancakes?
Sheldon,"Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy."
Leonard,Why are you doing this?
Sheldon,Itês by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. Iêve had some time to reflect and Iêve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. Itês a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. Butterscotch scone?
Leonard,Thanks. Itês good.
Sheldon,"What youêre tasting is respect and affection. And about a pound of Crisco. After youêve finished breakfast, I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary."
Leonard,You hate Babylon 5.
Sheldon,"I do. It fails as drama, science fiction, and itês hopelessly derivative. But you like it, and youêre my friend."
Leonard,"Okay, great. Still not taking you to Switzerland."
Sheldon,Drat. No Frodo for you.
Sheldon,"Alright, letês dispense with the friendly banter, I believe you know why Iêm here."
Penny,"Well, I always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords."
Sheldon,"Yes, amusing. Extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you, but let me be more specific. I believe you know why Iêm here in the laundry room."
Penny,Better acoustics for your throat singing?
Sheldon,"Itês actually not bad. But my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief PowerPoint presentation. Lights. Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD, should go to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider. A PowerPoint presentation by Sheldon Cooper, PhD."
Penny,"Oh, for Godês sakes."
Sheldon,Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankindês understanding of the universe. AKA me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. AKA you.
Penny,Iêm sorry. Is this supposed to be buttering me up?
Sheldon,"Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. It is a Mecca for physicists the world over. This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard. They sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. Now, letês see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination."
Penny,"Okay, showês over."
Sheldon,"No, itês not. Iêve got five more slides."
Penny,"Sheldon, this is Leonardês decision. He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go."
Sheldon,Very well. Enjoy yourself. Youêre going to be in the presence of something that Iêve dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope youêll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.
Penny,Iêll talk to Leonard.
Sheldon,You will?
Penny,"Yes. If it means that much to you, you should go."
Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, thank you!"
Penny,Youêre welcome.
Sheldon,"Since I rarely hug, Iêm relying on your expertise regarding duration."
Penny,I think weêre there.
Sheldon,"Oh, good. Bye-bye."
Raj,"You know what? Even though I donêt have a girlfriend, I can still have a good time on Valentineês Day."
Howard,"Trust me, you canêt. Iêve tried."
Raj,"No, no, no, Iêm going to have a me day. First Iêm going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown, take a steam and get a massage. Then Iêm going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I need to talk to you."
Sheldon,"All right, my friend. Would you like some cholermus?"
Leonard,Some what?
Sheldon,Cholermus. Itês a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. Iêm preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.
Leonard,Youêre not going to Switzerland!
Sheldon,"Oh, but I am. Didnêt Penny tell you the good news?"
Leonard,She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.
Sheldon,"Yes, that good news."
Leonard,"Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and itês Penny, not you!"
Sheldon,"Howard, could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation."
Leonard,I donêt need to see your presentation. This discussion is over!
Sheldon,Thatês a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?
Leonard,"Sheldon, at this point, I would go by myself before I would take you."
Leonard,"Yeah, really."
Sheldon,"Well then, you leave me no alternative. From this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends."
Leonard,Iêm sorry you feel that way.
Sheldon,"I donêt think youêre fully aware of the ramifications here, Leonard."
Leonard,Why donêt you enlighten me?
Sheldon,With the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gatesê house should I be invited.
Howard,"Ooh, thatês gotta sting."
Leonard,"Just think, this time tomorrow weêll be in Geneva, Switzerland for our first Valentineês Day."
Penny,I know! I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.
Leonard,Thermal? ‚Cause itês gonna be cold.
Penny,"Think it through, Leonard."
Leonard,"Gesundheit. Or as they say in Switzerland, gesundheit. You getting a cold?"
Penny,"No, no, itês probably just allergies."
Leonard,"Do you want an allergy pill? ‚Cause I have êem all. Prescription, nonprescription, foreign, domestic, experimental."
Penny,Do any of them work?
Leonard,"Not really, Iêm just an enthusiast."
Leonard,Penny? You okay?
Penny,Did that sound okay to you? Do not come in here!
Leonard,Whatês going on?
Penny,Iêm having a tea party. What do you thinkês going on? I think I might have the flu. Or the plague.
Leonard,"Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m. Do you think youêll feel better by then?"
Penny,Yep. ‚Cause Iêm gonna be dead.
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon? Listen, Penny is pretty sick and sheês not going to be able to go to Switzerland. So if youêre still interested, youêre welcome to come. "
Sheldon,"Great. Iêll start packing. In a minute.  Oh, look, itês the cholermus."
Penny,Hereês your soup.
Sheldon,With the little stars?
Sheldon,Heated to 180 degrees?
Penny,"Why donêt I pour it in your lap, and you can tell me."
Sheldon,You donêt have to be mean. Iêm sick.
Penny,"Yeah, well, Iêm sick, too."
Sheldon,"Not my problem. I just donêt understand how this happened to me. Iêm scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands, and I avoid contact with other people on general principle."
Penny,"I donêt know what to tell you, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Itês you! I touched you!
Penny,Happy Valentineês Day.
Raj,"Oh, my goodness, look at this room! Champagne! Roses! Oh, and little chocolates! This is going to be the best Valentineês Day ever."
Leonard,"Yeah, I forgot about all this."
Raj,But I never will.
Leonard,Will you please turn your shirt off?
Raj,Iêm giving myself dramatic entrance music. People will know Iêm awesome and to be feared.
Howard,"Yeah, right, thereês nothing more awesome and frightening than a man whoês got music blasting from between his nipples."
Leonard,"Hey, Stuart, whatês going on?"
Sheldon,Did he finally write a sequel to his autobiography? Iêm sure ages 79 through 87 were just action-packed.
Sheldon,"Oh, I donêt want to know that! How can I possibly discuss with Stan Lee the scientific foundations for interstellar flight on a silver surfboard when part of my brain will be scanning his face for signs of contagious skin disease?"
Leonard,Stan Lee does not have a contagious skin disease.
Sheldon,"Well, look who thinks heês Stuartês uncle now."
Raj,Canêt believe it. Weêre going to meet Stan Lee! 
Howard,Iêm sad to say I taught him those moves.
Leonard,"I canêt decide whether I want Stan Lee to autograph my Journey into Mystery 83, first appearance of Thor or my Fantastic Four number five, first appearance of Dr. Doom. "
Sheldon,Iêve decided Iêm going to have Mr. Lee sign my copy of this monthês Batman.
Howard,Thatês crazy. Stan Lee had nothing to do with Batman.
Sheldon,"Yes, which is why no one else will ask him to sign one, and I will be the possessor of a unique, albeit confusing, artifact, which will set me apart from the hoi polloi of comic book fandom."
Raj,"Thatês a great idea, Iêm going to get him to sign a Batman as well."
Sheldon,What is it about the word unique you donêt understand?
Howard,"Ow! Damn, paper cut. Nothing worse than a paper cut."
Raj,"Well, obviously you donêt remember your circumcision."
Sheldon,Thereês Neosporin and Band-Aids in my top desk drawer.
Howard,Why donêt you keep that stuff in the bathroom?
Leonard,He does. And in the kitchen. And in the car. And in his pocket.
Sheldon,"Yeah, but the ones in my pocket are mine."
Leonard,Hey. Guess whoês going to be at the comic bookstore on Thursday?
Penny,"Um, can you give me a hint?"
Leonard,Stan Lee.
Penny,"Um, Stanley, Stanley, Stanley Tucci?"
Leonard,"No, no, Stan Lee."
Penny,"Oh, oh, Stan Lee! Cool!"
Leonard,"You have no idea who he is, do you?"
Penny,Of course I do. Youêre an important part of my life and I pay attention to the things you are interested in.
Leonard,"Good, good, so, whoês Stan Lee?"
Penny,"Um, he was on Star Trek."
Penny,Star Wars?
Penny,"Um, uh, Stan Lee, oh, he was in those goofy kung fu movies you love so much?"
Leonard,Thatês Bruce Lee.
Penny,"Oh. So, is this Bruce Leeês nerdy brother, Stan?"
Howard,"Sheldon, why do you have all these unopened paychecks in your desk?"
Sheldon,Because most of the things Iêm planning to buy havenêt been invented yet.
Howard,But there must be thousands of dollars here. Why donêt you put it in the bank?
Sheldon,"I donêt trust banks. I believe that when the robots rise up, ATMs will lead the charge."
Howard,Youêve also got something from the Pasadena Municipal Court.
Sheldon,"Undoubtedly yet another snide response to my repeated letters complaining that the flags in front of the courthouse are flying in the wrong order. From left to right, itês supposed to be federal, state, and then city of Pasadena."
Penny,Iêm sorry. You sent more than one letter about that?
Sheldon,It bothers me.
Howard,"Sheldon, this is a summons."
Sheldon,A summons for what?
Howard,Looks like you ran a red light on Marengo Avenue at 9:30 p.m. on November 16. They got you on a traffic camera. Nice picture.
Sheldon,"November 16? Penny, thatês the evening you fell in your bathtub and I had to drive you to the emergency room."
Penny,"No, it isnêt."
Sheldon,"Yes, it is."
Penny,"No, it isnêt."
Sheldon,"Penny, I have an eidetic memory. Also, thatês a picture of you in the passenger seat holding your dislocated shoulder."
Penny,"Mmm, no, it isnêt."
Sheldon,"Okay, then why is a summons for a traffic violation committed in your car, bearing your license plates, coming to me?"
Penny,"Okay, look, they sent me the ticket. I told them I wasnêt driving and they were all, if it wasnêt you, who was it?"
Sheldon,So you betrayed me?
Penny,No! It wasnêt a betrayal. It was more of a canêt afford any more points on my license. I already have to buy my insurance from this place in the Cayman Islands.
Sheldon,But the only reason I was driving your car was because you were in distress and I was rescuing you.
Penny,"Yes, yes, look, and now you have a photo to remember that heroic day."
Leonard,Itês not that big a deal. You just go down to the court on Thursday and you pay the fine.
Sheldon,Iêm not going to pay a fine. That would imply Iêm guilty.
Howard,You are guilty.  That one I liked.
Sheldon,"I am not guilty. I only have a learnerês permit, Penny was the teacher. When the light turned yellow she said go, go, go, so I went, went, went."
Penny,"Sheldon, Iêm sorry. Iêll be happy to reimburse you for the fine. You know, as soon as I get a part in a movie or my own TV series."
Sheldon,"You donêt need to reimburse me because Iêm not paying. On Thursday, I will have my day in court and justice will be done. In fact, Iêm going to begin preparing my defence right now."
Howard,"Okay, heês going to jail."
Leonard,"Oh, thatês right. Thursday is Stan Lee Day."
Sheldon,"Now you see what youêve done? Because of you, weêre all going to miss Stan Lee."
Leonard,Whoa! What do you mean all?
Sheldon,"Well, youêre my friends. Youêll be standing by my side, supporting me, feeding me legal precedents, and if you had the upper body strength, carrying me out on your shoulders when Iêm victorious."
Leonard,"Yeah, okay. No."
Sheldon,Are you saying that you will not stand beside me as I plead my case?
Leonard,Thatês what Iêm saying.
Howard,"Wow. Uh, Stan Lee, or you in court? Uh, if this was Sophieês Choice it wouldêve been a much shorter movie. No."
Sheldon,"Raj? Youêll be there, wonêt you?  All right, then, my so-called friends have forsaken me. So, I guess itêll just be me and my eyewitness."
Penny,"Oh, balls."
Sheldon,Please try to wear something appropriate. It wonêt help my case if the judge is busy trying to read the word Juicy scrawled across your buttocks.
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon,Thatês just wrong.
Penny,"All right, letês go."
Sheldon,"Wait, hold on. Before we get to the courthouse, Iêd like to call on your skills as an actress."
Penny,What is this?
Sheldon,"Iêve taken the liberty of scripting your appearance on the witness stand because, letês face it, youêre somewhat of a loose cannon. Now, donêt worry, itês written in your vernacular. So shall we rehearse?"
Penny,Do I have a choice?
Sheldon,"Well, of course you have a choice. Although we live in a deterministic universe, each individual has free will. Now, sit down. I call your attention to the events of November 16. Do you remember that date?"
Penny,"Darn tootinê, I do, if the court will excuse my homespun, corn-fed Nebraskan turn of phrase."
Sheldon,Excellent. Go on.
Penny,"The reason that date is, like, so totally fixed in my memory is that I had the privilege to be witness to one of the most heroic acts Iêve ever seen in, like, ever."
Sheldon,And who performed that heroic act?
Penny,"Why, you did, sir. You. Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and may I add, it is a privilege to know you."
Sheldon,"Thereês no need for compliments, this court is only interested in the facts."
Penny,But it is a fact that itês a privilege to know you. Totally. A teardrop rolls down my cheek?
Sheldon,Only a suggestion. A catch in your throat would work just as well.
Penny,But it is a fact that itês a privilege to know you. Totally.
Sheldon,Maybe you should put on your Juicy pants again.
Sheldon,"Good morning, Your Honour. Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se. That is to say, representing himself."
Sheldon,"And yet you wound up in traffic court. Anyway, if it would please the court, Iêd like to begin with an opening statement."
Sheldon,"Very well, a quick opening statement. Like a milking stool, my case rests on three legs. I will demonstrate that I was improperly instructed in driving by a woman whose lack of respect for society borders on the sociopathic. I will argue that the emergency met the legal doctrine of quod est necessarium est licitum, that which is necessary is legal. But first, I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue. Iêm unable to confront my accuser, a non-human entity, to wit, a camera. So, to sum up, improper instruction, quod est necessarium est licitum, Sixth Amendment. My milk stool is complete."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,I object. Youêre completely ignoring the law.
Sheldon,"Really? I would point out that I am at the top of my profession, while you preside over the kiddy table of yours."
Sheldon,I am a scientist. I never apologize for the truth.
Sheldon,Thatês my spot.
Raj,I canêt wait to ask Stan Lee why he insists on giving all his characters first and last names that start with the same letter.
Leonard,"Oh, come on, why would you do that?"
Raj,"Bruce Banner, Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Stephen Strange, Otto Octavius, Silver Surfer, Peter Parker, oh, and worst of all, J. Jonah Jameson, Jr."
Howard,"Okay, Iêm cutting. Iêm not gonna talk to Stan Lee after you cheese him off."
Penny,Sheldonês in jail.
Leonard,Sheldonês in jail?
Raj,You called it.
Leonard,For what?
Penny,"What do you think? For doing the same crap he always does, except to a judge. He has to stay in there until he apologizes."
Leonard,So tell him to apologize.
Penny,"Oh, gee, thanks, Leonard. That didnêt occur to me. If he doesnêt apologize by 5 oêclock he is going to spend the night in jail."
Leonard,"Oh, no, thatês terrible. Ooh, the lineês moving. Got to go. Bye."
Sheldon,"Excuse me? Excuse me, jailor?"
Sheldon,I need to use the restroom.
Sheldon,Thatês the toilet?
Sheldon,Please tell the judge Iêm ready to apologize.
Leonard,"Look at that. To my friend, Leonard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!"
Howard,"Awesome. Mine says, To my friend, Howard, from Stan Lee, Excelsior!"
Raj,"Mine says, To Raj, from Stan Lee."
Howard,Thatês êcause you pissed him off about his character names.
Raj,"Hey, I didnêt even mention Dum Dum Dugan or Green Goblin, Matt Murdock, Pepper Potts, Victor Von Doom, oh, and worst of all, Millie the Model."
Penny,Weêre home.
Leonard,"Oh, hey, buddy. Howêd it go?"
Sheldon,You know very well how it went.
Leonard,"Yeah, but we all want to hear it from you."
Sheldon,I was found guilty and fined $533.
Penny,"Iêm going to write you a cheque for that. As long as you promise to put it in your drawer and never cash it, like the others."
Sheldon,"I also now have three points on a driverês licence I do not yet possess, and I was forced to issue an undeserved apology, simply because I refuse to urinate in a stainless steel bowl in front of criminals."
Howard,"Plus, you didnêt get to meet Stan Lee."
Leonard,"Okay, thatês enough, Howard. The poor guyês had a tough time. He had to spend the entire afternoon in jail wearing that suit."
Howard,"Youêre right, so it would be cruel to mention that after he finished signing autographs, Stan Lee took Stuart and us out for gelato."
Sheldon,You had gelato with Stan Lee?
Howard,He said we could call him Stan.
Leonard,Except for Raj.
Sheldon,"Well, I hope youêre satisfied, Penny. You are responsible for all the evil that has befallen me today."
Penny,"Okay, I realize thatÑ"
Sheldon,"Not finished. It is because of you that I now have a criminal record, and it is because of you that I missed out on having gelato with Stan Lee."
Penny,"Okay, maybe youêll have another chance to haveÑ"
Sheldon,"No, no. I will never have another chance to have gelato with Stan Lee because opportunities to have gelato with Stan Lee come but once in a lifetime. The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on!"
Penny,Did he just somehow give me the finger?
Howard,Not just the finger. The moving finger.
Penny,"Hey, Stuart."
Penny,Whatês going on?
Penny,Ah. Cool. Got any fun plans?
Penny,"Oh, nice."
Penny,"Oh, okay. Well, I was hoping, um, you could do me a favour."
Penny,"Well, Iêm kind of responsible for Sheldon missing Stan Lee, and I really want to make it up to him. So I was hoping you could give me his phone number so maybe I can arrange for them to meet."
Penny,Hmm. Damn. All right. Thank you.
Penny,Really? Great!
Penny,Then why did you tell me you had it?
Penny,"Iêm sorry, Stuart. Thanks anyway."
Penny,What kind of deal?
Penny,Youêre extorting a date out of me?
Penny,Can I bring Leonard?
Sheldon,"This is Stan Leeês front door. We were on Stan Leeês curb, then we were on Stan Leeês walk, and now weêre at Stan Leeês front door."
Sheldon,"Oh, Lord, you just rang Stan Leeês doorbell. At Stan Leeês house. Weêre about to go in and have milk and cookies with Stan Lee."
Penny,"Okay, sweetie, I donêt know if weêre gonna have cookies, or heês just gonna say hi, or really whatês gonna happen, so just let me talk, and weêllÑ"
Penny,Are you Stan Lee?
Penny,"Hi. Iêm Penny. This is my friend, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Weêre not friends at the moment. Depends on how this goes.
Penny,"Right, right. Anyway, Sheldon here is a huge fan of yours, and he was supposed to meet you the other day at the comic book store, but he kind of ended up in jail."
Sheldon,You said we were invited.
Penny,"Oh, no, no, I said Iêm inviting you to come with me to Stan Leeês house."
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm not much of a sports fan, but thank you."
Penny,Iêm sorry. He doesnêt really understand sarcasm.
Penny,Nice to meet you.
Raj,"Fantastic Four, Daredevil, Invincible Iron Man, Happy Hogan, Curt ConnorsÑ"
Howard,Would you just let it go?
Raj,"And worst of all, Fin Fang Foom."
Leonard,"Hey, whereêve you been?"
Sheldon,"Iêll tell you where Iêve been. You boys may have had gelato with Stan Lee and gotten autographed comics, but I saw the inside of his house and got an autographed application for a restraining order."
Sheldon,"Plus, I get to hang out with him again at the hearing. This is going to look great hanging next to my restraining order from Leonard Nimoy."
Leonard,Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?
Sheldon,"Well, itês very simple. In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, Iêm the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. That leaves you, by default, as the muscle."
Leonard,"One more floor, and Iêd be the pulled muscle."
Penny,"Oh, itês about time, Iêm starving."
Leonard,"Uh, well, we didnêt actually get Chinese food."
Penny,Why not?
Leonard,"Donêt panic, this is better."
Penny,"Oh, no, you didnêt trade the food for magic beans, did you?"
Sheldon,"Of course not. And, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city."
Penny,"Yeah, sometimes I donêt listen, sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down."
Leonard,"We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West, so we followed him."
Penny,Whoês Adam West?
Sheldon,"Whoês Adam West? Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?"
Howard,"My guess is, _Hey, four minutes! New record!î Thatês why Iêm the funny one."
Leonard,"Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff."
Howard,They were closing up. We got this whole box for sixty bucks.
Leonard,We didnêt even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.
Penny,There a new girlfriend in there? ‚Cause you might need one.
Leonard,"But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains!  Oh, youêre right, itês Ghostbusters 2. Never mind."
Howard,"Oh, my God. An Alf doll. When I was 11 my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left. I used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet Melmac, and Alf was going to bring him back to me. But he never did. Whereês my daddy, puppet? Where is he?"
Penny,That is so sad.
Sheldon,"No, whatês sad is that you donêt know Adam West was TVês Batman."
Leonard,"Hereês Spockês head with no body. Hereês Mr. Tês body with no head. Oh, yeah, hereês Spockês body with Mr. Tês head. I pity the fool whoês illogical."
Penny,"Okay, Iêm just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony."
Leonard,"Okay, bye."
Leonard,"Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots."
Raj,And an Aquaman action figure.
Howard,Looks like someone drew a penis on him.
Raj,Huh? Thatêll come off.
Howard,You see what youêre doing? Stop that.
Sheldon,It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.
Raj,Itês even got the Elvish engraving on it.
Sheldon,Itês not Elvish. Itês the language of Mordor written in Elvish script. One Ring to
Raj,One Ring to find them.
Howard,One Ring to bring them all.
Leonard,And in the darkness bind them.
Raj,"Holy crap, are we nerdy."
Howard,"So, I was doing some checking on the ring."
Raj,"Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?"
Sheldon,"Yes, there is. Oh, hereês a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape."
Raj,"No, thatês okay. Iêll get it."
Howard,"Listen, I was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird. No copyright notice on it. So, I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with, shall we say, the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world."
Leonard,Seedy underbelly?
Howard,"You know, your black market phasers, your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura panties, that kind of stuff."
Raj,Whoês this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?
Howard,Just a guy. I know a guy.
Raj,Is it Eddie Crispo?
Howard,"No, I canêt tell you who it is. Stop asking."
Raj,Who else could it be? It has to be Eddie Crispo.
Howard,"I know lots of dangerous people, okay?"
Raj,Name one.
Howard,"Eddie Crispo. Anyway, he said this isnêt a replica. Itês the real deal."
Sheldon,"If youêre suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom, I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement."
Leonard,"Heês not saying itês a magic ring. Youêre not, are you?"
Howard,"No, but itês close. Look at the markings inside. Those are production markings. Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies. Three were given to members of the cast. The rest were destroyed. Except one. One was stolen. Gentlemen, this is the one ring."
Leonard,"No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together."
Sheldon,"Well, yes, but I found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure."
Leonard,How is this maritime salvage?
Sheldon,"Other than the lack of water, how is it not?"
Raj,"Wait, wait. Sheldon, stop being crazy for a second. How much is something like this worth?"
Howard,"Well, itês tough to say since itês hot, but on the underground market, my guy figuresÑ"
Raj,Your guy Eddie Crispo?
Howard,"Yes. He figures ten, maybe 15 thousand."
Raj,"Okay, thatês a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski."
Howard,Why do you want a jet ski?
Raj,All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That canêt just be a coincidence.
Sheldon,"We canêt sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies."
Howard,Itês sad how great that sounds.
Leonard,"Guys, itês stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him."
Howard,Fine. He can have it back as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie.
Raj,There are no Jewish hobbits.
Howard,"Clearly, youêve never been to my house for dinner on Rosh Hashanah."
Leonard,"We are not blackmailing Peter JÑ All right, whereês the ring?"
Sheldon,You mean my ring?
Leonard,What are you doing?
Sheldon,"The ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did."
Leonard,Give me that.
Raj,"Look, letês be reasonable. We all want to do different things with the ring, but your ideas are stupid, and I want a jet ski."
Sheldon,I found it. The ring is mine. I donêt understand why in this group I never get my way.
Leonard,You always get your way.
Sheldon,Iêll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.
Penny,"Hey, guys. Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap?"
Leonard,"Yeah, itês delicious, the sarcasmês a little stale, though. Hey, how about this? Until we figure out what to do with the ring, Penny holds on to it."
Penny,What ring?
Leonard,This ring.
Sheldon,Looking for something?
Leonard,Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?
Leonard,"Itês a prop from a movie, and weêre kind of fighting over it."
Penny,"Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and I donêt even get to keep it?"
Howard,"If you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, youêd have my great Aunt Idaês brooch that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat."
Leonard,How am I looking now?
Sheldon,Ow! You hit me! Iêm bleeding!
Leonard,What was that?
Penny,Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him.
Leonard,Thatês my girl.
Howard,"So, Sheldon, howês it feel to get beaten up by a girl?"
Sheldon," Itês not the first time. I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero. If only Iêd had the presence of mind to reabsorb her, then Iêd have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter."
Raj,"Gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?"
Raj,I was afraid of that.  Go ahead.
Raj,Also my cousin.
Howard,You brought a lawyer?
Leonard,Weêre not giving him two Jet Skis.
Leonard,No Jet Skis.
Raj,Forget the Jet Skis? That was our line in the sand! What happened to _tear them a new one?î
Raj,Youêre useless.
Raj,Iêm signing off now.
Howard,"Okay, just so you know, if weêre bringing in cousins who are lawyers, prepare for shock and awe."
Leonard,"You know what? I am ending this. Penny didnêt want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. Iêm sending it back. Whereês the ring?"
Sheldon,You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public menês room.
Leonard,Give me that.
Sheldon,"No, itês mine."
Raj,Itês all of ours. 
Leonard,"Okay, now, this is ridiculous!"
Howard,Then let go!
Leonard,"Iêm not letting go, you let go."
Howard,I say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on.
Leonard,Fine. But canêt we go home and start this?
Raj,Sure. Let go of the ring.
Leonard,"All right, it starts now."
Howard,You do realize thereês a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the Syfy Channel. 
Raj,"Wait, my laptop. "
Howard,"You know, thereês a point when this becomes idiotic."
Leonard,And it wasnêt when we were driving like this?
Sheldon,I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.
Leonard,You want to talk about endless patience? Penny made me watch all five seasons of Sex and the City.
Raj,"There are six seasons, dude."
Leonard,"Oh, crap!"
Raj,"No, no, no, the sixth season is great. We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken, and then Mr. Big shows up, we donêt know if we can trust him again. Itês a wild ride."
Leonard,Door. 
Raj,"Okay, everybody, and plie. And relevae."
Penny,Whatcha doinê?
Leonard,"Last one holding the ring decides its fate. I know, it sounds silly."
Penny,"No, no, no, no, no, no, you are my boyfriend. Nothing you do is silly to me."
Leonard,Thank you.
Penny,"FYI, this is a bag from Victoriaês Secret."
Leonard,Iêm out.
Howard,"Iêm sorry, Ma, I have to stay late at the office."
Raj,"No, heês doesnêt! Heês lying to you!"
Howard,Will you be quiet?
Raj,"Well, if you want privacy let go of the ring. Iêm so glad we came to this gentile strip club! Howard, hereês more bacon to tuck into the shiksaês G-string!"
Howard,Iêll call you back.
Raj,"I think itês lovely you call your mommy and let her know youêre going to be late for dinner. From what I know about these things, if a woman doesnêt breast-feed on time, itês very uncomfortable for her boobies."
Howard,Donêt you talk about my motherês boobies!
Raj,"If youêre offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your motherês boobies."
Sheldon,"Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why donêt you go after Rajês mother?"
Raj,Why donêt we go after your mother?
Sheldon,"Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything youêd like to add?"
Howard,Thatês not gonna Better pull out the big gun.
Raj,Youêre right. Letês talk about your grandmother.
Sheldon,No! I call no Meemaws.
Raj,Think about this. The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex.
Sheldon,I donêt want to hear this.
Howard,Then let go of the ring and walk away.
Howard,All right. Iêll bet your Meemaw didnêt just have sex to have your mother. I bet she had sex because she liked it.
Sheldon,Stop it!
Raj,"Yeah, Meemaw did the nasty."
Sheldon,I said stop it!
Howard,Weêre getting to him.
Sheldon,Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks.
Howard,What are you doing?
Sheldon,Subliminal messaging. Iêm going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.
Raj,"Itês, itês not working, dude."
Sheldon,"Oh-ho-ho, itês working all right. I have to pee."
Raj,Then let go of the ring and go.
Howard,"No, actually, I wouldnêt mind going, too."
Raj,"Fine. Um, on the count of three. One, twoÑ"
Sheldon,"Wait, just to clarify. When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?"
Howard,We stand up.
Sheldon,Excellent choice.
Howard,Something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.
Sheldon,Iêve done it! Iêve won! The ring is mine! Itês mine!  Whereês the ring?
Leonard,Itês in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.
Raj,The fires of Mount Doom?
Leonard,Peter Jacksonês office in New Zealand. It wasnêt ours.
Howard,You quit the game! You had no right to take it.
Leonard,"I came in here, you guys were all sleeping. The ring was on the floor. No one was touching it."
Raj,"Well, so then we start the game over until thereês a winner."
Leonard,"There wasnêt ever going to be a winner. There was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. Is that really what you guys want? ‚Cause if it is, fine, I donêt want anything to do with you. And I donêt know what happened in that bathroom, but I am not cleaning it up!  My precious."
Sheldon,I knew it. Give us the precious!
Penny,"Ugh, gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym."
Raj,"Okay in Avatar when they have sex in Pandora they hook up their ponytails, so we know their ponytails are like their junk."
Howard,"Yeah, so?"
Raj,"So, when they ride horses and fly on the birds, they also use their ponytails."
Howard,Whatês your point?
Raj,"My point is, if I were a horse or a bird, Iêd be very nervous around James Cameron."
Sheldon,"It amazes me how you constantly obsess over fictional details when there are more important things in the real world to worry about. For example, why wasnêt William Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?"
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, I was up in the administration office, and I happened to overhear the name of the winner of this yearês Chancellorês Award for Science."
Sheldon,"And you want to rub my nose in the fact that my contributions are being overlooked again? I am the William Shatner of theoretical physics. All right, Iêll play. What self-important, preening fraud are they honouring this year?"
Leonard,"Oh, Iêm so glad you asked it like that. You."
Sheldon,I won?
Leonard,You won.
Sheldon,"I won! This is astonishing. Not that I won the award, no one deserves it more. Actually, I guess I misspoke. Itês not astonishing, more like inevitable. Iêm not sure what to do first. Maybe I should call my mother. Wait! I know, Iêm going to conduct an interview with myself and post it online."
Raj,"Well, good for him."
Howard,"Yeah, the one thing the William Shatner of theoretical physics needed was an ego boost."
Howard,Didnêt it look like that spear was going to go right through your skull?
Leonard,"Hey, you didnêt want a Slurpee at 7-Eleven, you donêt get glasses."
Sheldon,"Oh, that will be another congratulatory call for me. Uh, mute, please."
Howard,"Uh, hang on, flaming arrow."
Sheldon,"Hello? Oh, Chancellor Morton, how are you, sir? Yes, I was expecting your call  Problem."
Sheldon,They expect me to give a speech at the banquet. I canêt give a speech.
Howard,"Well, no, youêre mistaken. You give speeches all the time. What you canêt do is shut up."
Raj,"Yeah, before the movie, you did 20 minutes on why guacamole turns brown. It turned brown while you were talking."
Sheldon,I am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups. I cannot speak to large crowds.
Leonard,"to you, is a large crowd?"
Sheldon,Any group big enough to trample me to death. General rule of thumb is 36 adults or 70 children.
Penny,"Sheldon, congratulations. Brought you cheesecake from work. You know, êcause of your award, not because a busboy sneezed on it."
Sheldon,Iêm not accepting the award.
Penny,Why not?
Howard,Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper has stage fright.
Penny,"Thatês no reason to back out. You know, I once got a pretty big honour in high school, and I was terrified about appearing in front of a big crowd, but I went through with it, and you know what? The world looked pretty darn good sitting on a haystack in the back of a Ford F-150 as a member of the Corn Queenês court."
Sheldon,"Thank you. Yeah, Iêll bear that in mind if Iêm ever nominated for the Hillbilly Peace Prize."
Leonard,"Sheldon, youêre being ridiculous."
Sheldon,Am I? Let me tell you a story.
Howard,Whereês 70 children when you need ‚em?
Sheldon,I was 14 and graduating summa cum laude from college. Summa cum laude is Latin for with highest honours.
Penny,I just love how you always skip over the part where no one asks.
Sheldon,"I was valedictorian and expected to give an address. Even now, I can remember that moment when I walked up to the podium and looked out at the crowd. There must have been thousands of people. My heart started pounding in my chest. I began to hyperventilate. My vision became blurry, and before I knew itÑ oh, dear. "
Penny,"Oh, my God."
Leonard,"Sheldon? Sheldon, are you okay?"
Sheldon,Donêt trample me.
Sheldon,"Come on, Mother, you know why I canêt accept the award. With all due respect, I donêt think praying will help. No, I have not heard the song, Jesus, Take the Wheel. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you donêt need to start singing it. Yes, Iêll buy it on the iTunes, Mother. Good-bye, Mother.  Hello."
Leonard,"Sit down, we want to talk to you."
Sheldon,Am I in trouble? Did my mother call you?
Penny,Just sit.
Leonard,We think we can help you with your stage fright.
Sheldon,"Oh, I doubt that. I havenêt figured out a way, and Iêm much smarter than all of you."
Penny,"Yes, but youêre not smarter than all of us put together."
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm sorry, that is what I meant."
Penny,"Okay, your problem is, youêre trying to do this all by yourself."
Leonard,"We can help you. We can be your team. Like, uh, Professor Xavier and his X-Men."
Sheldon,I do like the X-Men.
Penny,Did I see X-Men?
Leonard,"Yeah, we watched it last week. You said you liked it."
Penny,"Oh. I say a lot of things, sweetie. So, how about it, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,"I donêt know. If youêre my X-Men, what are your powers?"
Penny,"Okay. Well, I am going to take you shopping, get you a nice suit. Might give you more confidence."
Sheldon,"Thatês not exactly a mutation that would get you into Xavierês School for Gifted Youngsters, but go on. Leonard?"
Leonard,I thought I could try to analyze you and get to the root of your anxiety.
Sheldon,What qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind?
Leonard,"My mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist, and Iêve been in therapy ever since she accused me of breast-feeding co-dependently."
Howard,"Raj says he can teach you, what did you call it? I donêt know, some Indian meditation crap."
Sheldon,"I see. Well, I assume, since the rest of you have set the bar so low, youêre saving the most impressive contribution for last. Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me."
Howard,"My power is the ability to pretend like I give a damn about your piddly-ass problems. And thatês 24-7, buddy."
Sheldon,And I appreciate the pretence.
Penny,"So, what do you say, Sheldon? Are we your X-Men?"
Sheldon,"The X-Men were named for the X in Charles Xavier. Since I am Sheldon Cooper, you will be my C-Men."
Howard,"Oh, thatês not a good name."
Raj,"Okay, Sheldon. Iêm going to be leading you through a series of meditation exercises. These methods come from the ancient gurus of India and have helped me overcome my own fears."
Sheldon,"And yet, you canêt speak to women."
Raj,"True, but thanks to meditation, I am able to stay in the same room with them without urinating. Now, close your eyes."
Sheldon,"Okay, but donêt punch me."
Sheldon,"When I was little, my sister would say to me, close your eyes, youêll get a surprise, and then sheêd punch me."
Raj,Iêm not going to punch you.
Sheldon,Thatês what my sister used to say.
Raj,Do you want to do this or not?
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. Proceed.
Raj,All right. Imagine yourself in the one place you feel most at home. Where is that?
Sheldon,"Sim City. More specifically, the Sim City I designed, Sheldonopolis."
Raj,"Okay, youêre in Sheldonopolis."
Sheldon,"Where exactly? Sheldon Square? Sheldon Towers? Sheldon Stadium, home of the Fighting Sheldons?"
Raj,Whatever you like.
Sheldon,I thought this was supposed to be a guided meditation.
Raj,Fine. Youêre in Sheldon Square.
Sheldon,Really? This time of year? Itês a bit nippy.
Raj,"Then, put on a sweater."
Sheldon,Suppose I could run downtown and pick up something at Shel-Mart.
Raj,"Yeah, whatever. Just go buy a sweater."
Sheldon,"You know, the nice thing about Shel-Mart is I own it, so I get a 15% discount."
Raj,You own the damn thing. Just take a freaking sweater!
Sheldon,"Look, I didnêt turn a profit last quarter by taking product off the shelves willy-nilly."
Raj,"All right. Youêve paid for a sweater, and youêre in Sheldon Square."
Sheldon,"Hang on. Itês a cardigan. I have to button it. Oh, no."
Raj,What now?
Sheldon,"A Godzilla-like monster is approaching the city. I have to get my people to safety. People of Sheldonopolis, this is your mayor. Follow me. If the children canêt run, leave them behind. Oh, the simulated horror!  Raj? Just as I suspected. Meditation is nothing but hokum."
Sheldon,I question your premise. How is a new suit going to prevent me from passing out in front of a ballroom full of people?
Penny,"Itêll give you confidence. You know, sometimes when Iêm feeling all stressed out about something, I go out and buy a cute top or a fun skirt and I have a whole new outlook on life."
Sheldon,Donêt you eventually realize youêre just the same stressed out person in a cute top or a fun skirt?
Penny,"Yeah, thatês when I buy shoes. Now, letês see what weêve got. Ooh! This is nice."
Sheldon,Itês only one colour.
Penny,"Yeah, so?"
Sheldon,Thatês a lot of money for only one colour.
Penny,Fine. Why donêt you pick out what you like.
Sheldon,Hmm. . This is pretty sharp.
Penny,"No, youêre wrong."
Penny,Where the hell dêyou find that?
Sheldon,In the prom department.
Penny,Itês ridiculous.
Sheldon,Says the former member of the Corn Queenês Court.
Penny,Please just try this one on.
Sheldon,Okay. But anything I put on now is only going to suffer in comparison.  This is absurd. I look like a clown.
Leonard,"So, Sheldon, how you doing?"
Sheldon,"Thatês how you start a psychotherapy session? How am I doing? I was promised a riverboat journey into the jungles of my subconscious. Instead, I get the same question I hear from the lady who slices my bologna at Ralphês."
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, Iêll start again."
Sheldon,Would it be helpful to you if I told you about my dreams?
Leonard,"Um, I donêt know, maybe."
Sheldon,"I recently had a dream that I was a giant. But everything around me was to scale, so it all looked normal."
Leonard,How did you know you were a giant if everything was to scale?
Sheldon,I was wearing size a million pants.
Leonard,Why donêt we just talk?
Sheldon,"Ah, the talking cure. Classical Freudian, good choice. If it will help speed things along, uh, my answers to the standard Rorschach ink blot test are A, a bat, B, a bat, C, a bat, and D, my father killing my mother with a hypodermic needle."
Leonard,"Why donêt I just start? Sometimes people have trouble accepting accolades if, on a subconscious level, they donêt feel they deserve them. Do you think maybe thatês whatês happening here?"
Sheldon,"Really, Leonard? Youêre just going to try to recycle Adlerês doctrine of the inferiority complex? I could probably get that from the woman at Ralphês. And sheêd let me taste some pieces of cheese for free."
Leonard,"But it could be part of your problem. Let me give you an example. When I was eight, I won a ribbon at the science fair for my project, _Do Lima Beans Grow Better to Classical Music.î But my mother pointed out that it was just a rehash of my brotherês earlier _Do Lima Beans Grow Worse to Rock ‚nê Roll.î I felt so guilty, I gave the ribbon back."
Sheldon,And how did that make you feel?
Leonard,Terrible. I worked really hard on that project. I stayed up all night singing the clownês aria from Pagliacci to a lima bean sprout.
Sheldon,Go on.
Leonard,It wasnêt my fault. I had never seen my brotherês project. And my mother couldêve told me before instead of at the ceremony in front of everyone.
Sheldon,"So, I hear you saying youêre angry with your mother."
Leonard,"Damn right, Iêm angry with my mother. For Godês sake, I was eight years old. She humiliated me. Thatês when the bed-wetting started again."
Sheldon,"Thank you, Leonard."
Leonard,For what?
Sheldon,"If someone as damaged as you can find his way to crawl out of bed each morning, I think I can face a simple award ceremony."
Leonard,"Wait, thatês it? I thought we had a whole hour!"
Leonard,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, and it is my very great honour to introduce the winner of this yearês Chancellorês award for Science and my good friend, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. But before I do, Iêd like to share with you a letter from Sheldonês mother, who couldnêt be here tonight. Isnêt that nice? His mother sent him a letter. Sheês proud of him. I wonder what that feels like. Dear Shelly. Thatês what she calls him. Shelly, itês a pet name. You know what my motherês pet name for me is? Leonard. But I digress. Dear Shelly. I am so proud ofÑ "
Sheldon,"Oh, dear."
Penny,Whatês the matter?
Sheldon,Iêm getting dizzy.
Raj,Donêt worry. Youêre surrounded by your C-Men.
Sheldon,I canêt do this. Iêm going to faint.
Penny,"Here, drink this. Itêll relax you."
Sheldon,Alcohol? I donêt drink alcohol.
Penny,"Fine, faint."
Sheldon,"I donêt feel different, this alcoholês defective."
Penny,"Here, see if this one works."
Leonard,"First of all, the projects were totally different. I was showing that classical music nurtures lima beans and makes them grow, but my mother didnêt hear me. If youêd like to look at the relationship between nurturing and growth, Iêd like to point out that my brother is eight inches taller than me."
Sheldon,Iêm ready.
Leonard,"Oh, right. Ladies and gentlemen, our guest of honour, Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
Sheldon,"Thanks, shorty,Iêll take it from here. All right, you people ready to have some fun? You have a basic understanding of differential calculus and at least one year of algebraic topology? Well, then here come the jokes. Why did the chicken cross the Mobius strip? To get to the same side, bazinga! All right, a neutron walks into a bar and asks, how much for a drink? The bartender says, for you, no charge. Hello? I know youêre out there. I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. Looks like we have some academic dignitaries in the audience. Dr. Randall from the geology department, only man whoês happy when they take his work for granite. Ba-da cha! I kid the geologists, of course, but itês only êcause I have no respect for the field. Letês get serious for a moment. Why are we all here? ‚Cause weêre scientists. And what do scientists study? The universe. And whatês the universe made of? I am so glad you asked.  Thereês antimony, arsenic, aluminium, selenium, and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and rhenium, and nickel, neodymium,"
Sheldon,"Penny, Leonard. Would you be able to answer some questions Iêm having about the events of last night?"
Sheldon,"Question one, where are my pants?"
Leonard,You might want to check YouTube.
Sheldon,What do I search?
Leonard,Itês already loaded. Just hit play.
Sheldon,"Oh, Lord, this couldnêt be any more humiliating."
Leonard,"Uh-uh, give it a minute."
Penny,Having a little trouble catching your breath there?
Leonard,"No, no, Iêm good. If my P.E. teachers had told me this is what I was training for, I would have tried a lot harder."
Penny,Do or do not. There is no try.
Leonard,Did you just quote Star Wars?
Penny,I believe I quoted Empire Strikes Back.
Leonard,"Oh, my God. Iêm lying in bed with a beautiful woman who can quote Yoda. I love you, Penny."
Penny,Oh. Oh. Thank you.
Leonard,Youêre welcome. I just wanted to put that out there.
Penny,"Oh, yeah, no, I, Iêm, Iêm glad."
Leonard,Good. Glad is good.
Penny,"Yeah. Yeah. No, no. Um. So, itês getting pretty late. We should probably go to sleep."
Leonard,"Yeah, probably."
Penny,"Okay, good night, sweetie."
Leonard,Good night.
Howard,"Hey, Leonard, where do you come down on giant ants?"
Raj,"Sheldon says impossible. Howard and I say not only possible, but as a mode of transportation, way cooler than a Batmobile."
Sheldon,"You are ignoring the square-cube law. The giant ant would be crushed under the weight of its own exoskeleton. And for the record, the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is jet pack, hoverboard, transporter, Batmobile, and then giant ant."
Leonard,Seriously? You have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants?
Howard,Whatês with him?
Sheldon,Perhaps heês at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle.
Howard,Are you saying heês man-struating?
Sheldon,"Not literally. But as far back as the 17th century, scientists observed a 33-day fluctuation in menês hormone levels."
Raj,Interesting. That might explain my weepy days in the middle of the month. You know what Iêm talking about.
Howard,"Okay, forget giant ants. How about giant rabbits?"
Raj,"Big or small, I donêt like rabbits. They always look like theyêre about to say something, but they never do."
Sheldon,"Rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size. And on a side note, they are one of the few mammals whose scrotum is in front of the penis."
Raj,Maybe thatês what they want to talk about.
Howard,"Leonard, where do you stand on giant rabbits and scrotal position?"
Leonard,I honestly donêt care.
Raj,"Really? Because every time weêve talked about unusual animal genitals, youêve always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions."
Leonard,What do you want from me? I just donêt give a ratês ass.
Howard,Would that be a giant ratês ass?
Sheldon,"For the record, giant rats are possible."
Leonard,Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?
Howard,"Okay, how about this for a topic, why is Leonard being a giant douche? Assuming giant douches are possible."
Sheldon,Of course they are. Leonardês being one.
Raj,Maybe heês having a loverês spat with Penny.
Leonard,"No, there was no spat."
Howard,"Oh, but something happened."
Leonard,I donêt want to talk about it.
Sheldon,But I sense youêre going to and I donêt want to hear about it. Excuse me.
Howard,"Whatêd you do, Romeo? You pour maple syrup all over your body and ask her if she was in the mood for a short stack?"
Raj,"Did you think it would be funny to put on a pair of her panties and jump around, but it wound up just creeping her out?"
Leonard,No.
Raj,"Iêm just asking, dude. It happens."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. In fact, Iêve prepared some trash talk for the occasion. You bowl like your mama. Unless, of course, she bowls well. In which case, you bowl nothing like her."
Sheldon,That is what is referred to as a burn on you.
Howard,Did you ask her to start waxing?
Raj,Did you start waxing?
Howard,"While making love, did you accidentally spank your own ass and cry out Mommy?"
Leonard,Iêm walking away from you now.
Howard,That wasnêt a no.
Raj,"Yeah, I think weêre getting close."
Howard,Did you take a Benadryl and fall asleep while pleasuring her? Because you can die that way.
Raj,"Oh, that would be a good way to go."
Leonard,"Oh, hey."
Sheldon,"Good, Penny, reminder, bowling tonight at seven oêclock."
Penny,"Oh, right, bowling."
Leonard,You donêt have to come if you donêt want to.
Penny,"No, no, itês okay. I mean, letês face it, you guys would get creamed without me."
Sheldon,"We would indeed. In this particular case, your lack of femininity works to our advantage."
Penny,"Itês always nice chatting with you, Sheldon."
Penny,Thinly veiled contempt.
Sheldon,"Remember, seven oêclock."
Penny,Got it.
Sheldon,Pacific Daylight time!
Penny,Bite me!
Sheldon,Please reserve that butch spirit for the lanes.
Howard,I thought you were bringing your own bowling shoes.
Sheldon,These are my own bowling shoes.
Howard,Then whatês with the disinfectant?
Sheldon,I know where my feet have been.
Sheldon,"Well, well, well. If it isnêt Wil Wheaton, the Green Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul the fifth to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my Firefox."
Sheldon,"Iêm the proud owner of Wil Wheaton stinks dot com, dot net, and dot org. What does that tell you?"
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm ready. I donêt know if Stuart told you what youêre up against tonight, but before you stands the co-captain of the East Texas Christian Youth Holy Roller Bowling League championship team. Seven to twelve year-old division. Also, Pennyês pretty good."
Sheldon,"Oh, foolish Wil Wheaton, it was never off."
Sheldon,"A common spare. The Miss Congeniality of the bowling pageant. Before you jump on Twitter to tout your modest accomplishment, watch how itês really done. I am the ball. My thoughts are its thoughts. Its holes are my holes.  Yes. Tweet that, Tweety Bird."
Howard,"Hey, I just wanted to tell you Iêm a big fan."
Howard,"Iêm sure youêre probably sick of Star Trek questions, but, Whoopi Goldberg, you ever hit that?"
Raj,"Ah, beer. The magic elixir that can turn this poor, shy Indian boy into the life of the party. Oh, yeah."
Leonard,Chilli cheese fry?
Penny,Yes. I love chilli cheese fries.
Leonard,Really? You love them?
Penny,"Yeah, why?"
Leonard,No reason. Iêm just glad to hear youêre comfortable saying you love something.
Penny,Do you really want to get into this right now?
Leonard,Get into what? Why wouldnêt you love the chilli cheese fries? Theyêve been in your life a long time. They make you happy. They deserve to know.
Penny,"Okay, look, you just caught me by surprise last night. I didnêt know what to say."
Leonard,"Okay, well, now youêve had some time to think about it. So, what do you want to say?"
Penny,Iêm not sure.
Leonard,How can you not be sure?
Penny,"Okay, this isnêt the place to have this conversation."
Leonard,"No, the place to have the conversation was in bed after I said, I love you, and you said, Thank you, good night."
Penny,"Donêt push it, Leonard."
Leonard,I am not pushing anything.
Penny,You are. You donêt get to decide when Iêm ready to say I love you!
Raj,"Ah, the premature I love you."
Howard,I guessed premature. Does that count?
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon,This is for you.
Penny,Ice cream?
Sheldon,"Iêve been familiarizing myself with female emotional crises by studying the comic strip Cathy. When sheês upset, she says Ach and eats ice cream."
Penny,"Um, Ach."
Sheldon,"If you were a cat, I would have brought you a lasagna."
Penny,Did Leonard send you over here?
Sheldon,"No, we havenêt spoken since your abrupt departure last night caused us to forfeit to Stuart and his dastardly ringer Wil Wheaton."
Penny,"Yeah, Iêm sorry about that."
Sheldon,Iêm not too proud to admit that I cried myself to sleep.
Penny,"Again, Iêm sorry."
Sheldon,And let me tell you sleep did not come easily with Leonard in the next room singing along with Alanis Morrisette.
Penny,Youêre kidding.
Sheldon,Clearly another woman in dire need of ice cream.
Penny,"All right, Sheldon, what part of this is supposed to make me feel better?"
Sheldon,The part where I tell you Iêve engineered a rematch with Stuartês team for tonight.
Penny,"Oh, honey, I donêt know. Things are a little weird with Leonard right now."
Sheldon,"You want me to remove him from the team? Iêm the captain, I can do that."
Penny,"No, no, thatês okay. Just let me talk to him, and Iêll get back to you."
Sheldon,When are you going to talk to him?
Penny,I donêt know.
Sheldon,Heês in the laundry room now. Now would be a good time.
Penny,"Youêre not gonna leave me alone until I do it, are you?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I think we both know the answer to that question."
Penny,I think we should talk now.
Leonard,"No, itês okay. We donêt have to talk êcause thereês nothing to talk about. Everythingês good."
Penny,"Really? So, you didnêt get all snarky êcause I said something nice to a bowl of chilli fries?"
Leonard,"All right, maybe I overreacted. So weêre in two different places emotionally. So what? And maybe Iêm a little ahead of you. Thatês fine. You know. In fact, it makes sense, êcause letês face it, Iêve been in this relationship two years longer than you."
Penny,"Look, Leonard, you have to know how much I care about you. Itês just that Iêve said the L word too soon before, and it didnêt work out very well."
Leonard,Really? I wouldnêt know what thatês like.
Penny,"Iêm sorry. You know what Iêm talking about, though."
Leonard,"Yeah, I do."
Penny,"So, weêre good?"
Leonard,"Yes, thatês what Iêm telling you. We are good. We are great."
Sheldon,"All right! Fence mended, problem swept under the rug. Time to bowl! Yes, I was eavesdropping, thereês a lot at stake here."
Sheldon,"Attention, all bowlers. Iêve taken the liberty of having these made for our rematch."
Penny,The Wesley Crushers?
Sheldon,"No, not the Wesley Crushers. The Wesley _Crushers.î"
Penny,I donêt get it.
Leonard,Wesley Crusher was Wil Wheatonês character on Star Trek.
Penny,Still donêt get it.
Sheldon,"Itês a blindingly clever play on words. By appropriating his characterês name and adding the S, we imply that we weêll be the crushers of Wesley."
Penny,"Okay, Iêm sorry, honey, but the Wesley Crushers sounds like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher."
Sheldon,"No! Again, itês not the Wesley Crushers. Itês the Wesley _Crushers.î"
Howard,"You know, if you want it to mean youêre crushing Wesley, itêd be the _Wesleyî Crushers."
Sheldon,Do you people even hear yourselves? Itês not the Wesley Crushers. Itês not the _Wesleyî Crushers. Itês the Wesley _Crushers.î
Sheldon,"No, itês not theÑ Never mind."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. The losers will be publicly humiliated in a fashion to be chosen by the victor. FYI, I plan on having you publish a scientific paper expounding the discredited Velikovsky hypothesis."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes? Well, before I respond, let me ask you a question. Is your mother a good or poor bowler?"
Sheldon,"No, after you, as we are currently crushing you, Wesley."
Sheldon,All right.
Sheldon,I so loathe you.
Sheldon,Thatês not even from your franchise!
Penny,"Thank you, Stuart. Itês nice to know."
Sheldon,"Be the ball, Howard."
Howard,"Leave me alone, Sheldon."
Sheldon,You werenêt the ball.
Penny,"Hey, thanks."
Leonard,"This is fun, huh?"
Leonard,Itês good that we got out and did something physical.
Leonard,"Gets us out of our heads. You get in your head, you start to overthink, overanalyze, obsess, you worry. Thatês not what weêre doing tonight. Tonight weêre just throwing a ball at some pins."
Penny,"Yeah, thatês right."
Leonard,"Mm-hmm, and someday, we donêt know when, maybe youêll love me back. Ooh, Iêm up."
Sheldon,Excuse me. I donêt know who youêre chanting for as I am currently the ball.
Sheldon,"Thank you, Jesus! As my mother would say."
Penny,"Oh, yeah, me, too."
Penny,Tell me about it.
Penny,"Oh, Iêm sorry."
Sheldon,Did you let Wil Wheaton get in your head?
Penny,What are you talking about?
Sheldon,Heês evil. He plays evil mind games. Did he tell you his grandmother died?
Sheldon,"Well, if he does, donêt believe it. Heês not above playing the dead meemaw card."
Sheldon,"Enjoy the accolades now, Wil Wheaton, but like your time on Star Trek: Next Generation, your smug self-satisfaction will be short-lived."
Leonard,"Penny, youêre up."
Sheldon,"All right, remember, his meemawês alive and be the ball."
Penny,"Yeah, I got it."
Leonard,We really need a strike here.
Penny,I know.
Leonard,So just take your time and concentrate.
Penny,"Leonard, stop pressuring me."
Leonard,Iêm not pressuring you.
Penny,"Yeah, you are! Just back off!"
Leonard,"Okay, Iêm sorry. Iêll shut up."
Penny,I didnêt mean shut up.
Leonard,"Fine. Just tell me what to do, and Iêll do it."
Penny,"No, this isnêt fair to you, Leonard. Iêm sorry."
Sheldon,"Wait! Where are you going? Penny, come back! Iêll get you ice cream!"
Leonard,"No, let her go."
Sheldon,"Are you insane? If she leaves, itês over!"
Leonard,Iêm pretty sure itês already over.
Sheldon,"You did this, didnêt you?"
Sheldon,"No, I suppose not."
Raj,"I donêt know about you, but I feel empowered."
Penny,"Oh, damn, they cancelled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!"
Sheldon,I was going to get my mail.
Penny,"Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?"
Sheldon,"I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasnêt sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus."
Penny,"God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?"
Sheldon,"Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus."
Penny,"Okay, hereês the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus."
Sheldon,"Good, good. Iêm glad weêre still friends."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. Iêd hate for that effort to have been in vain."
Sheldon,Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?
Sheldon,"Harsh terms. But all right, Iêll just substitute intercourse."
Sheldon,"Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so Iêll hold that in reserve."
Penny,"So, how you been?"
Sheldon,"Well, my existence is a continuum, so Iêve been what I am at each point in the implied time period."
Penny,"Youêre just coitusing with me, arenêt you?"
Penny,Mmm. Howês Leonard doing?
Sheldon,"He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that."
Penny,Iêll pretend I didnêt hear it.
Sheldon,Iêd rather you pretend I didnêt say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.
Sheldon,"Thatês the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, thatês what the Romans made Jesus eat."
Penny,Interesting. Iêll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.
Sheldon,Iêm hungry now.
Penny,"Oh. Um, okay. Why donêt you give me an hour and come over?"
Sheldon,Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?
Penny,I donêt have hot dogs.
Sheldon,"Oh, itês all right, I do. Oh! Youêre in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. ."
Leonard,"Hey, where you been?"
Sheldon,I was talking with Penny.
Howard,Whatês wrong with you? You canêt hang out with your roommateês ex. Thatês totally uncool.
Leonard,"No, no, itês fine. I donêt care. Iêm over it."
Raj,"Yeah, heês over it, thatês why heês been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black."
Sheldon,Is he making any progress? Because Iêd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.
Howard,"So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. Youêre either on Team Leonard or Team Penny."
Sheldon,Which one picks last?
Sheldon,"Well, usually Iêm on the team that picks last. Unless thereês a kid in a wheelchair."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope youêre hungry."
Sheldon,"Well, of course Iêm hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!"
Sheldon,"Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?"
Leonard,I donêt know. Why?
Sheldon,"Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard!"
Howard,"Oh, God, this is good."
Raj,Let me ask you a question. Do you believe youêre going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?
Howard,Jews donêt have hell. We have acid reflux.
Leonard,"Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,"Certainly. Itês not like I have to moderate my food intake because Iêm planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!"
Leonard,"So, you guys want to do something tonight?"
Howard,"Nah, I canêt. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World."
Leonard,"What about you, Raj?"
Raj,"Oh, there it is, now that you donêt have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again."
Leonard,I never stopped hanging out with you.
Raj,"Oh, please, we all know Iêm the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, Iêd be Aquaman."
Howard,I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, Iêm thirsty, so Iêm going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage."
Leonard,You know what? Iêll just spend the evening alone.
Raj,suddenly Iêm not good enough for you?
Sheldon,"Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think Iêll take my after-dinner walk."
Leonard,Since when do you take after-dinner walks?
Howard,"Yeah, since when do you take walks?"
Sheldon,"I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if thereês one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, itês serotonin. Bye-bye."
Howard,Hold on. Iêll walk down with you.
Sheldon,"Oh, thatês not necessary. You can go first."
Howard,Or we could go together.
Sheldon,I canêt think of a reason why not.
Howard,Letês go.
Sheldon,"Hold on. Nope, no reason."
Raj,Iêve missed you.
Sheldon,"All right, say hello to your mother for me."
Howard,You said you were going for a walk.
Sheldon,I didnêt say outside.
Howard,"So what, youêre just gonna walk up and down the stairs?"
Sheldon,"No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior."
Howard,Which way are you going?
Sheldon,Which way are you going?
Howard,I parked my scooter down the block.
Sheldon,Iêm going the other way. Bye.
Howard,"Bye. Actually, Iêm this way. Do I smell hot dogs?"
Sheldon,"I mean, I have no idea what you smell."
Howard,I definitely smell raw hot dog.
Sheldon,Perhaps youêre getting a brain tumour.
Howard,"All right, have a nice walk."
Sheldon,I shall. Have a nice scoot.
Howard,You might want to stand back. Iêm sitting on top of 13 horses here.
Sheldon,"Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!"
Sheldon, Here. I had to trade the others for my life.
Raj,"Hey, Leonard?"
Raj,I havenêt had sex in a year.
Leonard,"Where you going with this, Raj?"
Raj,"Donêt flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman."
Leonard,"So, go."
Raj,"Well, I need a wingman. I donêt want to come off like a lonely loser."
Leonard,And you think my presence will help with that?
Raj,"Well, I do. Next to you, Iêll look like a catch."
Leonard,"Iêm not going out tonight, Raj."
Raj,All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?
Leonard,Very much.
Raj,Doesnêt have to be Asian.
Leonard,Donêt worry. Youêll meet a girl someday.
Raj,"No, I wonêt."
Leonard,"Yes, you will, and sheêll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman."
Raj,You really think so?
Leonard,"I do, and youêll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And sheêll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces."
Raj,"But weêll have sex first, right?"
Sheldon,"Mmm, mmm, mmm. Thatês Eye-talian."
Penny,"So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?"
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. In fact, he said, Iêm fine, I donêt care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal."
Penny,"Well, good."
Sheldon,Iêm also pleased to report that heês all cried out over you.
Penny,Heês been crying?
Sheldon,"Oh, I believe that was something else I wasnêt supposed to mention."
Penny,"Oh, God, I feel terrible."
Sheldon,"Do you have a stomach ache, too?"
Penny,"Why, do you?"
Penny,"Why did you ask if I had one, too?"
Sheldon,Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.
Penny,"All right. So, whatês new in your life?"
Sheldon,"Well, my new shoes are not made for running."
Penny,Have you been running?
Sheldon,"Itês just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm."
Penny,Iêm so glad you like it.
Sheldon,I do. Leonard never cooks for me.
Penny,"Well, maybe thatês êcause Leonard canêt cook."
Sheldon,You canêt cook and you made me this.
Penny,"Whatever. Ooh, Iêm gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge."
Sheldon,"Oh, Lord, Iêm in Jewish hell."
Raj,Look at this. Do you think sheês really doing that or is it PhotoShop?
Leonard,"Iêm pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys."
Raj,You donêt know that. Prison changes people.
Leonard,"Hey, where you been?"
Sheldon,"I told you, walking."
Leonard,For an hour and a half?
Sheldon,I got lost.
Leonard,How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.
Sheldon,Satellites are down. Solar flares.
Raj,There are no solar flares right now.
Sheldon,"Yes, there are."
Raj,"Dude, Iêm an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, Iêd be all up in it."
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died.
Leonard,What the hell was that about?
Raj,I donêt know. Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?
Leonard,"Oh, we really need to get you a girl."
Sheldon, Leonard.
Leonard,"Oh, just come in!"
Sheldon,Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.
Leonard,"What do you want, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,Maybe this isnêt a good time.
Leonard,Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.
Sheldon,Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.
Leonard,What do you want?
Sheldon,You may want to sit down.
Leonard,Iêm in bed!
Sheldon,Point taken. You may want to sit up.
Sheldon,Iêve been seeing Penny behind your back.
Leonard,"Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?"
Sheldon,"We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?"
Leonard,Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?
Sheldon,"I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs."
Leonard,Then why did you have Chinese food with us?
Sheldon,I didnêt want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.
Leonard,Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?
Sheldon,"Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I donêt care if you want to be friends with Penny."
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil thatês been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?"
Sheldon,"Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon."
Leonard,I guess not.
Sheldon,"And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs."
Penny,"Oh, um, I, I can come back."
Leonard,"D-donêt be silly. Weêre neighbours, weêre going to run into each other, may as well get used to it."
Penny,"Yeah, I guess youêre right."
Leonard,You used to it yet?
Leonard,"Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know itês fine."
Penny,"Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me."
Leonard,His mother?
Penny,"Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels."
Leonard,I was going to do that.
Penny,"Oh, well, then you, you do it."
Leonard,"No, I donêt want to do it. You can do it."
Penny,"Okay, you can take him for shoes."
Leonard,I just took him for shoes.
Penny,"Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet."
Leonard,Fine. Iêll take him for shoes next Saturday.
Penny,"Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come."
Leonard,Youêre taking him to Disneyland?
Penny,"Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?"
Leonard,All right. But let me know if youêre going to stuff him with junk food. I donêt want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.
Penny,Weêre going to Disneyland. Heês going to eat junk food.
Leonard,All Iêm saying is give me a heads-up.
Penny,"Okay, whatever."
Leonard,"And donêt let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. Heêll say he can handle it, but I promise youêll end up with churro puke on your shoes."
Penny,"All right, got it. Is there anything else?"
Leonard,"Yeah, donêt let Goofy near him. Heêll have nightmares and Iêll have to deal with it."
Penny,Whatês the problem with Goofy?
Leonard,Wish I knew. Heês fine with Pluto.
Raj,"Hey, do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?"
Howard,"Well, thatês it. Weêre officially out of things to talk about."
Penny,Weêre home.
Leonard,"Itês ten oêclock, where have you been?"
Sheldon,We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic.
Leonard,I was going to see that with him.
Penny,How was I supposed to know that?
Sheldon,Itês all right. Iêll see it again with you.
Leonard,And I have food here. You said you were going to call.
Penny,"I know, I know."
Sheldon,I can still eat.
Penny,"No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth."
Sheldon,"Okay, but just donêt fight"
Leonard,Weêre not fighting.
Penny,Just go.
Leonard,Arenêt you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?
Sheldon,"Thank you, Penny."
Penny,"Youêre welcome, sweetie."
Leonard,Want a cup of coffee?
Penny,"Oh, um, I should probably get going."
Leonard,Come on. Itês just a cup of coffee.
Penny,"Yep, okay."
Howard,"Oh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too."
Leonard,What am I smelling?
Penny,Sheldonês churro on my shoes.
Penny,Heês such an angel when heês asleep.
Leonard,Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.
Penny,I think we can do it.
Leonard,Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldnêt that be wrong?
Penny,"No, be friends. You and me."
Leonard,Oh. Sure. Absolutely.
Penny,Good. Iêm glad.
Leonard,"Hereês an idea. Iêm just throwing it out there, friends who have sex."
Penny,"Good night, Leonard."
Leonard,Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofinê around.
Sheldon,"No, Goofy, no."
Sheldon,Explain your sneeze.
Raj,Iêm sorry?
Sheldon,Do you have allergies?
Sheldon,Is there too much pepper on your salad?
Raj,I donêt put pepper on salads.
Sheldon,Iêve heard enough. Sit over there.
Raj,"Oh, come on. I donêt want to sit by myself."
Sheldon,"Thatês what Typhoid Mary said, and clearly, her friends buckled."
Raj,"Guys, help me."
Howard,"Sheldon, come on."
Leonard,"Yeah, itês just one sneeze.  Youêre on your own."
Howard,"See you, buddy."
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, I have something for you. Per our roommate agreement, this is your 24-hour notice that I will be having a non-related female spending two nights in our apartment."
Leonard,"When you say non-related female, you still mean human, right?"
Sheldon,"Of course. Pets are banned under the roommate agreement, with the exception of service animals, such as seeing eye dogs and, one day, cybernetically-enhanced helper monkeys."
Howard,Are you planning on kidnapping a woman?
Howard,"Yes, but mixed with genuine concern."
Sheldon,"For your information, Iêll be playing host to Dr. Elizabeth Plimpton."
Raj,The cosmological physicist from Princeton?
Sheldon,"Yes. And until you acquire a surgical mask, please address your comments to me through a napkin. Weêve been corresponding for years about our mutual interest in gravitational wave signatures of inflatons in the early universe. And now sheês under consideration for a position at our university."
Leonard,Why didnêt you tell me you knew Elizabeth Plimpton? I am a huge fan of hers!
Sheldon,"I didnêt realize I was obligated to share my connection with things youêre a fan of, but very well. You enjoy Canadian bacon. Iêve been to Toronto."
Leonard,"Okay, fine. Where is she going to sleep?"
Sheldon,"My room, of course."
Raj,Holy crap!  Holy crap!
Howard,"Yeah, um, I have a two-part question."
Sheldon,Go ahead.
Howard,"A, are you kidding me? And B, seriously, are you freaking kidding me?"
Sheldon,"A, I rarely kid. And B, when I do kid, you will know it by my use of the word bazinga."
Howard,So youêre saying the two of you are going to be sleeping in the same bed?
Sheldon,Yes. Bazinga. Leonard?
Leonard,Thank you. Why is a world-renowned scientist staying in our apartment instead of a hotel?
Sheldon,"Well, she doesnêt care for hotels. And who can blame her? Windows that donêt open, multi-user linens, keys shaped like credit cards, as if one walks around with unassigned slots in oneês wallet. All right, I believe I have time for one more question. Yes, Raj?"
Raj,When can I sit with you again?
Sheldon,"When Iêve seen two consecutive negative throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart. You know the drill. All right, if youêll excuse me, I am off to start a prophylactic course of antibiotics."
Leonard,I canêt believe heês friends with Elizabeth Plimpton.
Raj,I canêt believe they let him into Canada.
Howard,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You heard the man. Whereês your throat cultures? Kidding. Sit down."
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, excellent. I have a question about these maxi pads. Are the wings truly functional or have I fallen victim to marketing hype?"
Penny,"What are you doing with, what?"
Sheldon,The stock boy at Walgreens was frustratingly uninformed on the subject.
Penny,"Sheldon, what are you doing with maxi pads?"
Sheldon,I have a lady friend who will be staying with me for a few days.
Penny,Oh. What?
Sheldon,"I want her to feel at home. I also bought scented soaps, pantyhose, Midol, calcium chews and what is apparently a yogurt specifically designed to regulate the female bowel."
Penny,"Wait, wait, hold on, back up. Youêre having a woman stay with you?"
Sheldon,Yes. Why does that seem to flabbergast everybody?
Penny,"Oh, no, no, no, no. Iêm not flabbergasted. Iêm puzzled. Yeah, letês go with puzzled."
Sheldon,"A word of warning. My guest is a noted physicist and the leading expert on quantum cosmology, so please try to avoid wasting her time with female jibber jabber."
Penny,Female jibber jabber?
Sheldon,"Shoe sales, hair styles, mud masks, gossip about your friends Brad and Angelina."
Penny,"Oh, theyêre not my friends."
Sheldon,"Iêm not surprised, considering the way you talk about them behind their backs."
Leonard,"Sheês here, sheês here. How do I look? Do I look smart?"
Sheldon,"Oh, good grief. This isnêt about you. Coming! Now listen, one of the great minds of the 21st century is about to play host to one of the other great minds of the 21st century. So pay attention. Years from now, my biographer might ask you about this event."
Leonard,"Oh, I have so many things to tell your biographer."
Sheldon,"I would imagine it is. This is my friend and roommate, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter."
Leonard,"Hi-lo. Oops. I started to say hi, and then I switched to hello in the middle. It came out hi-lo. Duh. Uh, itês nice to meet you. Iêve read both your books and most of your papers. Iêm Leonard, I live"
Sheldon,I apologize. Heês only an experimental physicist.
Leonard,"Are you hungry, thirsty? Can I offer you anything?"
Sheldon,"No, sheês my guest. If anyone should offer her anything, it should be me. Elizabeth, can I get you something? Perhaps a feminine hygiene product or a bowel-regulating yogurt?"
Sheldon,"Excellent. If the yogurt works, I bought some delightful scented candles."
Leonard,"Look, itês you."
Leonard,"Well, who wants to stay in a hotel? With windows that donêt open, those crazy card-shaped keys."
Sheldon,"No, he doesnêt understand. I understand."
Leonard,"Well, I understand, too."
Sheldon,Youêre just misappropriating my understanding.
Leonard,"Oh, . I think any university would want you. Except, of course, any university that had already had you. Because they wouldêve already wanted you before they, you know, got you."
Sheldon,From the mind that brought you hi-lo. Let me show you to your room.
Leonard,"Uh, sleep night. I mean, obviously, good night. I started to say sleep tight, then I changed my mind in the middle. I swear to God, Iêm smart."
Sheldon,"Get it together, man."
Sheldon,"All right, let me show you some of the features of the room. First, windows. Conventional. Open, closed, open, closed, halfway open, or halfway closed, depending on your philosophical bent. Over here is my comic book collection. Feel free to browse. Thereês a box of disposable reading gloves on the night stand."
Sheldon,"In here, youêll find emergency provisions. An eight-day supply of food and water, a crossbow, season two of Star Trek: The Original Series on a high-density flash drive."
Sheldon,"Then thereês really no reason to live, is there?"
Sheldon,"Heês an odd duck, isnêt he?"
Sheldon,"Well, there was a misbegotten adventure with a waitress who lives across the hall. It ended as inexplicably as it began. They had very little in common, except for carnal activity. Thatês why I acquired these noise-cancelling headphones. If you decide to use them, please clean the ear pieces afterwards with the Wet Wipes youêll find in the bathroom. Theyêre in the drawer labelled Wet Wipes."
Sheldon,Good. Iêll leave you to your night time ablutions. Iêve e-mailed you the morning bathroom schedule. Youêll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet. Itês on the back of the emergency escape route diagram.
Sheldon,"Sleep well, my friend."
Sheldon,"Oh, let me just get one thing. Itês my backup emergency supply kit. The living room escape route doesnêt pass through here. Now, good night. And if thereês an apocalypse, good luck."
Leonard,Is everything all right?
Leonard,"Me neither. Oh, look what Iêm reading. Itês you."
Leonard,"I did, but itês been a while, and I wanted to sound smart over breakfast."
Leonard,"Oh, good. Wasnêt sure it was coming across."
Leonard,"Uh, six."
Leonard,"Really? Uh, sure doesnêt read that way."
Leonard,Wow. You really make science come alive.
Sheldon,Vocal test. Morning vocal test. Second vocal test. Second morning vocal test.
Leonard,"Morning, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Morning. I trust you had a pleasant night.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, Iêm going to relieve myself."
Leonard,How do you take your coffee?
Sheldon,"Pee for Houston, pee for Austin, pee for the state my heart got lost in. And shake twice for Texas."
Leonard,Something his mother taught him.
Sheldon,"All right, Elizabeth, the bathroom is yours. The seat is down, and has been sanitized for your protection."
Sheldon,"Ah, so the yogurt didnêt work. Iêll fire off a critical e-mail to the manufacturer."
Penny,"Oh, good, youêre up. Look, my car wonêt start. I need a ride to work."
Sheldon,Did you once again ignore your check engine light?
Penny,"No, Mr. smarty-pants. I ignored the fill gas tank light."
Sheldon,"Leonard, Penny wants to exploit any residual feelings you have for her in order to get a ride to work."
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, sure, let me just put this in a travel mug."
Penny,"Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton, a leading expert on quantum cosmology. Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress who doesnêt understand the role gasoline plays in the internal combustion engine."
Penny,"Nice to meet you, too. Are you enjoying your stay?"
Sheldon,"Wonderful. Meaningless pleasantries accomplished. Elizabeth, Leonardês bathroom time is coming up, and believe me, you do not want to follow him."
Leonard,"Okay, well, I guess I should get dressed so I can take everyone to work. You and Sheldon and Sheldonês friend, Dr. Plimpton, who you just met. Itêll be fun. Like a clown car."
Penny,Hang on.
Leonard,Hmm? Yeah? Huh?
Penny,We just broke up.
Leonard,"uh, you and me? Yeah, we did. Not too long ago. How are you doing with it?"
Penny,Not as good as you apparently.
Leonard,"I, um, I donêt follow."
Penny,"You know what? Itês, itês none of my business. If you want to sleep with Sheldonês doctor buddy right after we stopped seeing each other, go for it."
Leonard,"Well, nowÑ"
Sheldon,"Excuse me. Iêm uncomfortable with you recommending that Leonard pursue having intercourse with Dr. Plimpton, who I assure you has better things to do."
Penny,Iêm not recommending it. Iêm saying it already happened.
Sheldon,"Thatês preposterous. Tell her, Leonard."
Leonard,Come on. It wasnêt my fault.
Sheldon,The implication being that you somehow tripped and fell into her lady parts?
Penny,You know what? Iêm just gonna take the bus to work.
Leonard,"Penny, I can still drive you."
Penny,"Oh, no, no, itês okay. You might slip on a banana peel and get me pregnant."
Sheldon,"I must say, Iêm shocked by this betrayal."
Leonard,I didnêt betray Penny.
Sheldon,"Not Penny, me!"
Leonard,How am I betraying you?
Sheldon,"Elizabethês my friend, and youêre playing with her!"
Leonard,"Yeah, I guess I did."
Howard,What the hell are you doing?
Raj,"Relax, itês Nyquil."
Leonard,You still have a cold?
Raj,"Maybe, but I donêt care. Thatês the great thing about Nyquil, itês like ten-percent booze. I call it the nighttime sniffling, sneezing, coughing, so you can talk to girls medicine."
Leonard,"Are you having trouble sleeping? ‚Cause, boy, I was up all night."
Raj,"Did you get a cold, too?"
Leonard,"No, but I was awake all night."
Howard,"If you want, I can give you some of my momês sleeping pills."
Raj,She wonêt notice theyêre missing?
Howard,She doesnêt know she takes them.
Leonard,"No, thatês okay. It was something else keeping me up last night. And again this morning. And, I didnêt mind. I was up last night. I was up this morning. I didnêt mind. Those are your clues."
Raj,"Ooh, ooh. Did the pigeon on your windowsill have more babies?"
Howard,Were you up making another stop-motion Lego movie?
Howard,"‚Cause let me tell you, itês not enough to make the Legos move, they also have to capture your heart."
Leonard,"Okay, Iêll give you one more clue. It involved another person."
Raj,Did you get a Japanese love pillow?
Howard,How is a Japanese love pillow another person?
Raj,It is if you love her and give her a name.
Sheldon,"Dr. Plimpton, Iêd like you to meet my colleagues, Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali"
Sheldon,And not-a-doctor Howard Wolowitz.
Raj,Iêm a big fan of your work.
Sheldon,"And of course, youêve already introduced yourself to Dr. Hofstadter."
Leonard,"Hey, you."
Leonard,"Boy, Iêm kind of tuckered out. How are you feeling, Elizabeth?"
Leonard,"Sure. Black, right?"
Leonard,Coming right up.
Howard,What do you mean what? Itês Halo night.
Raj,I canêt. Iêm too sick. Go away.
Howard,"Thatês why we moved Halo night here. Look, I brought my momês chicken soup."
Raj,Iêm not hungry.
Howard,Whoês that
Raj,I bought a parrot.
Howard,"Yeah, right. Dr. Plimpton?"
Howard,"Uh, yeah."
Howard,"Yeah, sure. In fact, Iêm a dungeon master."
Howard,Beg pardon?
Howard,What the frak?
Raj,"Go away. She wants New Delhi, not Kosher deli. Besides, you have a girlfriend."
Howard,We broke up weeks ago.
Raj,Why didnêt you say anything?
Howard,I was waiting for the right time. This is the right time.
Leonard,"Hey, whoês ready for Halo?"
Raj,"Oh, this is like a nightmare. Get lost!"
Howard,Heês right. The numbers are shaky enough as it is.
Leonard,I donêt understand.
Leonard,Elizabeth? Whatês going on?
Leonard,Is she suggesting what I think sheês suggesting?
Howard,Yep. Welcome to the Penthouse Forum.
Raj,"Okay, show of hands. Whoês up for this? "
Leonard,Weêll all be naked in front of each other.
Howard,Iêm out.
Raj,"Follow my lead. Almost. Weêre, weêre going to go out into the hallway and, uh, make a dramatic entrance."
Raj,"Run. Run, run, run. Donêt look back."
Leonard,I thought we had something special.
Raj,"So, you say you canêt pay your rent?"
Penny,"Oh, Leonard?"
Penny,I found these in the dryer. Iêm assuming they belong to Sheldon.
Leonard,"Thanks. Itês really hard to find these in his size. So, listen. Iêve been meaning to talk to you about the other morning."
Penny,You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?
Leonard,"Yeah, I wanted to explain."
Penny,"Well, you donêt owe me an explanation."
Leonard,I donêt?
Penny,"No, you donêt."
Leonard,So youêre not judging me?
Penny,"Oh, Iêm judging you nine ways to Sunday, but you donêt owe me an explanation."
Leonard,"Nevertheless, Iêd like to get one on the record so you can understand why I did what I did."
Penny,Iêm listening.
Leonard,She let me.
Penny,"Okay, Babydoll Pink, letês see if you can cover up the fact that I got my dadês feet."
Leonard,"Itês just two degrees, Sheldon. I just want to turn up the thermostat two degrees!"
Sheldon,Let me point out that two degrees can be the difference between water and steam.
Leonard,"Yes, if we lived in a teakettle."
Sheldon,This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement.
Leonard,"Aw, screw the roommate agreement!"
Sheldon,"No, you donêt screw the roommate agreement. The roommate agreement screws you."
Leonard,"You know what, go to Hell and set their thermostat."
Sheldon,"I donêt have to go to Hell. At 73 degrees, Iêm there already!"
Penny,Who is it?
Penny,Hang on.
Leonard,Can I sleep on your couch tonight?
Penny,"Uh, well, you can try, but the people across the hall are being very noisy."
Leonard,"You heard that, huh?"
Penny,"Apparently, the one fella tried to adjust the thermostat, then the other fella went bat-crap crazy."
Leonard,"So you agree, heês nuts."
Penny,"Well, not as nuts as the guy who chooses to live with him."
Leonard,"Believe it or not, he was worse when I met him."
Penny,"Oh, I do not believe that."
Leonard,You are so naive. Just like I was seven years ago.  Iêd just started at the university.
Leonard,"Excuse me, Iêm looking for Sheldon Cooperês apartment."
Leonard,That should have been my first clue.
Penny,So Sheldonês last roommate tried to warn you off?
Leonard,"For all I knew, he was the crazy one. He had this really deranged look."
Penny,"Well, yeah, heêd been living with Sheldon."
Leonard,"Sure, it makes sense now. . Anyway, I went upstairs and knocked on the door."
Leonard,Dr. Cooper?
Leonard,"In retrospect, that was clue number two."
Leonard,Iêm Leonard Hofstadter. I called you about the apartment. You saidÑ
Sheldon,"I know what I said. I know what you said. I know what my mother said on March 5, 1992. What is the sixth noble gas?"
Sheldon,You said youêre a scientist. What is the sixth noble gas?
Leonard,"Uh, radon?"
Sheldon,Are you asking me or telling me?
Leonard,Telling you? Telling you.
Sheldon,"All right, next question. Kirk or Picard?"
Leonard,"Oh, uh, well, thatês tricky. Um, well, uh, Original Series over Next Generation, but Picard over Kirk."
Sheldon,Correct. Youêve passed the first barrier to roommate-hood. You may enter.
Leonard,"Oh, this is pretty nice. Uh, the bedrooms are back there?"
Sheldon,That depends.
Leonard,"I donêt understand, their, their existence is conditional?"
Sheldon,"No, but your ability to perceive their existence is conditional on you passing the second and third barriers."
Leonard,Thereês three?
Sheldon,Each more daunting than the last. Have a seat.
Sheldon,No! Thatês where I sit!
Leonard,Whatês the difference?
Sheldon,"This seat is ideally located both in relation to the heat source in the winter and a cross breeze in the summer. It also faces the television at a direct angle allowing me to immerse myself in entertainment or game play without being subjected to conversation. As a result, Iêve placed it in a state of eternal dibs."
Leonard,Can you do that?
Sheldon,"Cathedra mea, regulae meae. Thatês Latin for my chair, my rules. Now, you said on the phone that your area of study is physics."
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, experimental physics."
Leonard,What is that?
Sheldon,Doesnêt concern you. Youêll be going to the university every day?
Sheldon,And you have a vehicle?
Leonard,"A car, yeah."
Sheldon,And youêll be willing to drive me?
Leonard,"Well, canêt you drive?"
Sheldon,I can. I choose not to.
Leonard,"Okay, I suppose I could drive you. Well thatês a point in my favour, right?"
Sheldon,Why donêt you let me do this.
Leonard,"Come on, I just asked."
Sheldon,"Last question. In a post-apocalyptic world, which task would you assign the highest priority? Locating a sustainable food source, re-establishing a functioning government, procreating, or preserving the knowledge of mankind?"
Leonard,"Uh, Iêm gonna go with preserving the knowledge."
Sheldon,"Thatês correct. FYI, I would have accepted any answer other than procreating. Come, Iêll show you the rest of the apartment."
Leonard,"Oh, good. I passed the barriers."
Sheldon,The second barrier. Donêt get cocky. This is the bathroom. Are you fairly regular?
Leonard,"Uh, I guess."
Sheldon,This isnêt going to work if youêre guessing. When do you evacuate your bowels?
Leonard,When I have to.
Sheldon,"When you have to? Iêm sorry, I donêt rent to hippies."
Leonard,"I, Iêm sorry, uh, in the morning. Around eight."
Sheldon,I canêt give you eight. I can give you seven thirty.
Leonard,Fine. Iêll take it.
Sheldon,Third barrier passed. You have won the right to see your room. Huzzah!
Leonard,Is this it?
Sheldon,"No, this is my room. People donêt go in my room."
Leonard,So where do you sleep?
Sheldon,I donêt understand.
Leonard,"If people donêt go in there, and youêre people, andÑ You are people, arenêt you? Making a joke."
Sheldon,Do you do this often?
Leonard,On occasion.
Sheldon,Your room. You may want to repaint. 
Penny,"Okay, and after all that, you just moved in?"
Leonard,"No, I didnêt just move in. First we had to iron out a few details. "
Sheldon,Roommates agree that Friday nights shall be reserved for watching Joss Whedonês brilliant new series Firefly.
Leonard,Does that really need to be in the agreement?
Sheldon,"We might as well settle it now, itês going to be on for years. Initial here. All right, thatês television and movies. Section nine, miscellany. The apartmentês flag is a gold lion rampant on a field of azure."
Leonard,We have a flag?
Sheldon,"Never fly it upside down unless the apartmentês in distress. And next, if either of us ever invents time travel, we agree our first stop will be this meeting today in precisely five seconds."
Sheldon,Well thatês disappointing. 
Penny,Why on earth did you agree to all that?
Leonard,"It was the best apartment Iêd seen, the rent was very reasonable and after youêve passed the first three barriers you kind of want to take it all the way."
Penny,"Well, Iêm sorry, Leonard, itês very hard to feel sympathy for you."
Leonard,"Okay, how about this? Let me tell you about the first time I brought a girl over. "
Sheldon, Leonard?
Leonard,Shh. Just pretend weêre not here.
Sheldon, Leonard?Leonard?
Leonard,Iêm sure heêll go away.
Sheldon,Iêm just going to keep knocking till you answer.  Leonard?
Leonard,What do you want? I didnêt say come in!
Sheldon,"You asked what I wanted. I wanted to come in. Iêm here because you violated our roommate agreement. Specifically, section eight, visitors, subsection C, females, paragraph four, coitus. Roommates shall give each other 12 hours notice of impending coitus.î"
Leonard,I didnêt even know her 12 hours ago.
Leonard,"But, Joyce, come on."
Sheldon,12 hours? 
Penny,"Oh, my God."
Leonard,Do I get some sympathy now?
Penny,"A little bit. Okay. Let me get this straight. You move in with this guy, he makes you sign a ridiculous roommate agreement, then he walks into your bedroom while youêre doing this Joyce Kim, and you still stay?"
Leonard,"Actually, I couldnêt get too mad at him about Joyce Kim."
Penny,Why not?
Leonard,"Well, I was doing some government research at the time, you know, military, rocket fuel. Itês kind of secret."
Penny,What does that have to do with Joyce Kim?
Leonard,"As it turns out, she was a North Korean spy. Luckily, Sheldon drove her out before I revealed anything important. Which Iêm not saying I would have."
Penny,"So, what, thatês it? Youêve stayed with Sheldon all this time because he kept you from going to federal prison?"
Leonard,That was part of it. The other part is what happened with the elevator.
Penny,"Oh, yeah, Iêm wondering about that. You said it was working when you moved in."
Leonard,"It was, but one night, Sheldon came home from workÑ "
Sheldon,What is going on here?
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon. This is Howard and Raj. They work at the university, too."
Sheldon,Iêll get to you later. What are you sitting on?
Howard,"I canêt speak for these guys, but Iêm sitting on my tushie. Itês a joke."
Leonard,"Yeah, not a good idea."
Raj,"Tushie is buttocks, right?"
Sheldon,Explain the couch.
Leonard,"Oh, well, there were some people on the first floor moving out, and they sold it to me for a hundred dollars. Howard and Raj helped me bring it up."
Sheldon,But whatês wrong with the furniture we have?
Leonard,Theyêre lawn chairs. And there was no place for company.
Sheldon,Did it occur to you that was by design?
Leonard,"According to the roommate agreement, Iêm entitled to allocate 50% of the cubic footage of the common areas."
Sheldon,"But you didnêt notify me by e-mail, so this is still a breach."
Leonard,I did notify you.
Sheldon,"Oh, you did, did you? Oh, drat! Hoisted by my own spam filter."
Leonard,What am I doing in your spam folder?
Sheldon,"I put you there after you forwarded me a picture of a cat playing the piano, entitled this is funny."
Raj,"Oh, yeah, I saw that. That was hilarious. "
Penny,"Okay, what does all this have to do with the elevator?"
Leonard,Iêm getting to it. 
Sheldon,"I assure you, youêll be sorry you wasted your money on an iPod when Microsoft comes out with theirs."
Raj,"Okay, do you have an opinion about everything?"
Howard,And you just assume youêre always right?
Sheldon,Itês not an assumption. Change seats with me.
Sheldon,I donêt like this spot. I have to keep turning my head.
Leonard,"Ooh, itês time for Babylon 5!"
Sheldon,We donêt watch Babylon 5 in this apartment.
Leonard,Why not?
Sheldon,Because no one likes Babylon 5.
Leonard,I like it.
Raj,"Me, too."
Howard,So do I.
Leonard,There you go_ three against one.
Sheldon,"They donêt get a vote. Itês one against one. And according to the roommate agreement, all ties will be settled by me."
Leonard,But I said no to that.
Sheldon,And I said yes. And I settle all ties. Change seats with me.
Sheldon,Thereês a draft on my neck over here.
Howard,"So, I get the draft?"
Sheldon,Youêre protected by your turtleneck.
Howard,Fine. And itês a dickey.
Sheldon,"Hmm, Iêm still not comfortable. Of course. Thereês too many people here."
Leonard,We can fix that. Letês leave.
Howard,"Yeah, we can go over to my place."
Sheldon,Wait. Let me get my jacket.
Howard,Youêre not going with us.
Sheldon,Why not?
Raj,Youêre the guy weêre trying to get away from.
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, in that case, I donêt need my jacket. And for the record, the correct syntax is Iêm the guy from whom youêre trying to get away. Oh, yes, this is definitely going to be my spot. "
Penny,"Okay, how do you know he said that? You left the room."
Leonard,"Hey, do you want me to finish working on your man feet or not?"
Penny,Fine. Go ahead. 
Howard,I donêt have playdates! I have colleagues!
Howard,"No, but if you keep screaming, maybe theyêll hear you!"
Leonard,That your dad?
Howard,"She grows any more hair on her face, yes."
Leonard,"Oh, man. Is that a two-stage rocket?"
Howard,Three. I designed the engine myself.
Raj,Cool. Can it break Mach 1?
Howard,"Oh, probably, if I could get my hands on that new fuel the governmentês been working on."
Leonard,"Oh, this just might be your lucky day."
Howard,I havenêt seen your Oreos! Just take your bath without them! 
Penny,"So, why was it his lucky day?"
Leonard,"Well, it turns out I had a little rocket fuel in the apartment."
Penny,What were you doing with rocket fuel in your apartment?
Leonard,"Mm, Joyce Kim was kind of curious about what I did for a living, and I was going to kind of show it to her. Itês not important. The point is, the guys and I went back to the apartment."
Penny,Are we ever going to get to the elevator?
Leonard,"Yeah, weêre really close. Uh, uh, weêre at the apartment. "
Leonard,"The trick is to mix it into Tovex in order to create a combustible gel that will generate over 8,000 kilonewtons of thrust."
Sheldon,Wonêt work.
Leonard,"Excuse me, but Iêve been working on this a long time. Trust me, itêll work."
Sheldon,"You donêt see your mistake, do you?"
Leonard,Thereês no mistake.
Sheldon,"This is for a full-scale rocket, not a model."
Leonard,"Well, Iêve adjusted the formula."
Sheldon,Not correctly.
Leonard,"Okay, Iêve had it with you. You might be an expert on theoretical physics and science-fiction programs and where to sit on a freaking couch, but this is applied physics. And when it comes to applied physicÑ uh-oh."
Howard,Whatês happening?
Leonard,A bad thing. A very bad thing. Get the door. Get the door! Get the door! Get the door! Get the door!
Howard,Youêre waiting for the elevator?
Leonard,Oh. Right.
Raj,Wait. Itês here.
Sheldon,Give me that. 
Leonard,Whatêd you do that for? I had plenty of time. 
Sheldon,Youêre welcome. 
Leonard,"Not only did Sheldon save my life, he didnêt rat me out to the landlord. Or the police. Or Homeland Security."
Penny,"Okay, so, basically, youêre the reason I have to walk up and down three flights of stairs every day?"
Leonard,So I did something stupid. Iêm sure you did stupid things when you were younger. What were you doing seven years ago?
Penny,"Excuse me, I was in high school. Studying, keeping my nose clean, doing volunteer work for the community. "
Penny,Not pregnant. Yes!
Sheldon,"Oh, Ubuntu, you are my favourite Linux-based operating system."
Sheldon,Hello. Why do I smell methacrylate?
Leonard,"Oh, uh, clear nail polish. I had a mani-pedi. Men can get those. Anyway, I may owe you an apology."
Sheldon,Thereês doubt?
Leonard,"I did agree to the thermostat setting, and I shouldnêt have tried to change it."
Sheldon,"Thatês not an apology, simply an acknowledgement that I was right."
Leonard,"Okay, Iêm sorry."
Sheldon,There you go.
Leonard,"So, weêre good?"
Sheldon,Good what?
Leonard,Never mind. Okay if I watch some TV?
Sheldon,Go ahead.
Leonard,Youêre not even watching!
Sheldon,I can hear it!
Leonard,"Oh, so the dialogue offends you?"
Sheldon,I would hardly call that dialogue!
Leonard,"Youêre insane, you know that?!"
Sheldon,"Donêt make me turn that flag upside down, êcause you know Iêll do it!"
Leonard,"Okay, weêve got power to the laser."
Sheldon,I shouldêve brought an umbrella.
Leonard,What for? Itês not going to rain.
Sheldon,"I know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility."
Howard,"Thatês a bazinga, right?"
Sheldon,"One of my best, donêt you think?"
Leonard,"Howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility."
Howard,"You got it. Oh, Raj, no. Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we donêt have to peep through windows."
Raj,"Itês not like that, Iêm watching someoneês TV. The Good Wife is on. I tell you, this is my new Greyês Anatomy."
Sheldon,"Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?"
Leonard,"Relax, itês just a dirty sock."
Sheldon,How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?
Leonard,"Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks."
Sheldon,Not my world.
Leonard,"Hey, you know whoêd really dig seeing this experiment? Penny."
Sheldon,"I wasnêt aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object."
Raj,Why donêt you ask her to come up?
Leonard,"I donêt know, itês still a little weird since, you knowÑ"
Howard,She dumped you?
Leonard,She didnêt dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
Sheldon,I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.
Howard,"Oh, itês very simple. Leonard was living in a little town called please donêt leave me, while Penny had just moved to the island of bye-bye."
Leonard,Screw you guys. Iêm gonna go see if sheês home.
Howard,"If itês not too much trouble, Iêd like to point this at the moon now."
Raj,"Wait a second, the good wife is crying. Somethingês very wrong."
Penny,"Oh, hi. Whatês going on?"
Leonard,Weêre up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.
Penny,"Iêm sorry, what?"
Leonard,Itês pretty cool. Weêve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. I thought you might want to see it.
Penny,"Uh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard."
Leonard,"Oh, sorry, I didnêt know you were busy. Maybe another time."
Penny,"Yeah, maybe."
Penny,"Oh, but what about the party?"
Penny,"Oh, right."
Leonard,"Okay, well, yeah, come on up. So, howêd you two guys meet?"
Leonard,Your company?
Leonard,"So, menus."
Howard,Happy now? Iêm moving the dirty sock.
Sheldon,"Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one."
Penny,"Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack."
Sheldon,"Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchinê."
Leonard,"Let me explain what weêre doing here. Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and weêre going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier."
Penny,Oh! Thatês very cool.
Leonard,The laser?
Sheldon,"See, now this is a man for Penny."
Leonard,"Uh, thatês a great question, Zack."
Sheldon,"No, itês not."
Penny,Sheldon! Play nice.
Sheldon,Well itês not a great question. How could somebody possibly think weêre going to blow up the moon? Thatês a great question.
Leonard,"Donêt worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun."
Leonard,"Now, weêll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it wonêt be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye."
Leonard,"Right. Uh yeah, funny. Uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. Raj, get them some glasses."
Howard,Preparing to fire laser at the moon.
Sheldon,Make it so.
Howard,There it is. Thereês the spike!
Leonard,2.5 seconds for the light to return. Thatês the moon! We hit the moon!
Leonard,"Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane."
Sheldon,I was wrong. Penny can do better.
Penny,"Okay, guys, thank you, itês been fun."
Penny,"No, just keep walking."
Sheldon,He must be very skilled at coitus.
Raj,"Iêm telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores."
Howard,"The phrase is get back on the horse, not whores."
Raj,"Thatês disgusting, dude."
Howard,"No, itês notÑ Never mind. He is right, though. If you want, I can turn you on to this great new dating site I found."
Leonard,"No, thanks."
Howard,You sure? They say they can find a match for anybody.
Leonard,Have they found a match for you?
Howard,"Tons. Iêve had, like, eight dates in the last month. And twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left."
Sheldon,I canêt bring the nitrogen tank down.
Leonard,Why not?
Sheldon,"All right, let me restate that. Itês very heavy, and I donêt want to."
Leonard,Iêll help you.
Sheldon,"Thank you. Lift with your knees, not your back. Good night."
Raj,You know what would be fun? Signing Sheldon up for online dating.
Howard,"Yeah, right."
Raj,"No, think about it. We make it an experiment. Like when Frankensteinês monster was lonely and he found a wife."
Howard,He didnêt find a wife. They built him a wife out of dead body parts.
Raj,"Okay, weêll call that plan B."
Penny,"Damn you, you rat bastard."
Leonard,Are you drunk?
Penny,"Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!"
Leonard,How did I ruin him?
Penny,"‚Cause in the olden days, I never wouldêve known he was so stupid."
Leonard,"Come on, he wasnêt that stupid."
Penny,"Yes, he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!"
Leonard,"Okay, yeah, heês stupid."
Penny,He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appe-teasers.
Leonard,How is that my fault?
Penny,"You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. Now, come with me."
Leonard,Where are we going?
Penny,Weêre gonna have sex.
Leonard,"Why? I mean, okay."
Sheldon,Whatês going on?
Penny,"Put on your noise-cancelling headphones, êcause itês gonna get loud."
Sheldon,Oh! Not this again.
Sheldon,"In what universe is this low-pulp? Good morning, Penny."
Penny,do you have eyes in the back of your head?
Sheldon,"When one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. Iêm making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?"
Penny,"Oh, thanks, Iêm not hungry."
Sheldon,"FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night."
Penny,"Yeah, sorry about that."
Sheldon,"As a native Texan, I must say Iêve never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context."
Penny,"Oh, God."
Sheldon,"Oh, God. That Iêve heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning, Leonard."
Leonard,How many times have I asked you not to do that?
Sheldon,Counting this instance? 317.
Leonard,Whereês Penny?
Sheldon,She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.
Leonard,I wonder why she didnêt say good-bye.
Sheldon,Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?
Leonard,"I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective."
Sheldon,I have no difficulty believing youêre not butter.
Leonard,"Oh, hey."
Penny,"Oh, hi. Um, I gotta run. Early shift."
Leonard,"Okay, Iêll walk down with you. So, last night was fun, huh?"
Penny,"Yeah, it must have been. I just threw up in my closet."
Leonard,"Bummer. Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie."
Penny,"Oh, yeah, tonightês not great for me."
Leonard,Doesnêt have to be tonight. Iêm free pretty much always.
Penny,"Leonard, last night was a mistake."
Leonard,"When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?"
Penny,"Look, Iêm sorry. I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack. Can we just forget it ever happened?"
Leonard,"No, itês pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing."
Penny,"Oh, God!"
Leonard,"So, thatês it? Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?"
Penny,"Look, I said Iêm sorry. Canêt u please let it go?"
Leonard,"How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson."
Raj,Holy crap.
Raj,We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.
Howard,Excuse me?
Raj,The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.
Howard,Youêre kidding. An actual woman?
Raj,"Yeah, look. Breasts and everything."
Howard,"Trust me, breasts doesnêt necessarily mean woman."
Raj,Since when?
Howard,"Iêll show you a picture of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime. Leonard, you gotta see this, we found a match for Sheldon."
Leonard,"Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?"
Raj,Do you know what heês talking about?
Howard,Nope. Why donêt you ask him?
Raj,"Leonard, what are you talking about?"
Leonard,I donêt want to talk about it.
Raj,That was a lousy suggestion.
Howard,"Whatever. Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. Greetings, fellow life-formÑ"
Leonard,"If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it.  I canêt do it."
Leonard,"Oh, hi. Hey. Hi, Leslie."
Leonard,"Uh, I know! Itês been a while!"
Leonard,Right. Right. So how you doing?
Leonard,"Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didnêt mean anything, it was just for fun?"
Leonard,"Uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?"
Leonard,She didnêt dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.
Leonard,"Um, anyway, apparently, itês okay to go back to people youêre no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them."
Leonard,"So, what do you say?"
Leonard,Sheês not coming back.
Raj,Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.
Howard,Not us. Him.
Raj,"Yes, but him doesnêt even know about her."
Howard,"Well, him about to find out about her."
Raj,Really? Us gonna tell him?
Sheldon,Whoês going to tell whom about what?
Howard,Sheldon. Hey.
Sheldon,Your surprise confuses me. I live here.
Howard,"Right. So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?"
Sheldon,Be more specific.
Howard,Four thirty.
Sheldon,Thatês not afternoon. Thatês preevning.
Sheldon,Itês a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. Iêm fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.
Raj,"Right, okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?"
Sheldon,"Well, tomorrowês Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night, so Iêll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking."
Howard,"Okay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30 you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?"
Sheldon,"I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery."
Raj,"But itês true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler."
Sheldon,"Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum."
Howard,"And thatês exactly the answer we gave to the question, what is your attitude towards online datingî"
Raj,"Howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo, but I said no, our Sheldon would say hokum."
Howard,"Well, come on, whereês your scientific curiosity?"
Sheldon,"Well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of itês wondering why Iêm having this conversation with you."
Raj,"Okay, how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years."
Sheldon,He didnêt date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust.
Howard,"Okay, well, why donêt you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later."
Sheldon,I donêt drink coffee.
Howard,"All right, you can have a hot chocolate."
Sheldon,"As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them."
Sheldon,Whatês life without whimsy?
Howard,"Okay, Iêm out."
Raj,"Sheldon, Iêve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever."
Sheldon,Youêre bluffing.
Raj,Are you willing to risk it?
Sheldon,Curse you.
Leonard,Thirty feet.
Penny,"Oh. Hey, Leonard."
Leonard,"I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!"
Penny,Are you drunk?
Leonard,"Come on. Weêre gonna have sex, and itês not gonna mean a thing!"
Penny,Are you out of your mind?!
Leonard,Iêm really starting to think thereês a double standard here.
Sheldon,"In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?"
Raj,You donêt know weêre wrong yet.
Sheldon,Haughty derision it is.
Amy,Excuse me. Iêm Amy Farrah Fowler. Youêre Sheldon Cooper.
Sheldon,"Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. Iêm sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. Additionally, Iêm being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock."
Amy,"If that was slang, Iêm unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery. In any case, Iêm here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year."
Sheldon,Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.
Amy,"I donêt object to the concept of a deity, but Iêm baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance."
Sheldon,"Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas."
Amy,"Noted. Now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table."
Sheldon,May I buy you a beverage?
Amy,"Tepid water, please."
Howard,"Good God, what have we done?"
Howard,And now the kung pao chicken.
Howard,"And finally, my moo shu pork."
Howard,"Ah, there you have it, gentlemen. Our entire dinner unpacked by robot."
Raj,And it only took 28 minutes.
Sheldon,"Impressive, but we must be cautious."
Sheldon,"Today, itês a Chinese food retrieval robot. Tomorrow, it travels back in time and tries to kill Sarah Connor."
Leonard,"I donêt think thatês going to happen, Sheldon."
Sheldon,No one ever does. Thatês why it happens.
Penny,Hey. Is the food here? Ooh. Whatês that?
Howard,"That, dear lady, is the Wolowitz Programmable Hand, designed for extravehicular repairs on the International Space Station."
Penny,"Ah, cool."
Howard,Ask me to pass the soy sauce.
Penny,"Oh, does that come up much on the space station?"
Howard,Mostly with Asian and Jewish astronauts.
Penny,All right. Pass the soy sauce.
Howard,Coming up. 
Leonard,So howês work?
Penny,"Oh, itês not bad. Kind of hungry."
Leonard,"Yeah, we all are."
Howard,Just wait.
Sheldon,"You realize, Penny, that the technology that went into this arm will one day make unskilled food servers such as yourself obsolete."
Penny,Really? Theyêre going to make a robot that spits on your hamburger?
Sheldon,I thought you broke up with her. Why is she here?
Howard,"Okay, here we go. Passing the soy sauce. Put out your hand."
Penny,"Oh ha-ha, oh. Thatês amazing."
Sheldon,"I wouldnêt say amazing. At best, itês a modest leap forward from the basic technology that gave us Country Bear Jamboree."
Howard,"Hey, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,Yes?  Peace?
Howard,"No, not peace. Hang on."
Penny,Does NASA know youêre using that thing as a napkin holder?
Howard,You kidding? They still think itês in a secure locker at JPL.
Penny,You stole it?
Howard,Borrowed. The trick is to carry it out to your car like you own it.
Penny,Whoês Amy?
Leonard,His girlfriend.
Penny,Sheldon has a girlfriend?
Sheldon,Sheês not my girlfriend.
Penny,How long has this been going on?
Leonard,Four months.
Sheldon,Sheês not my girlfriend.
Penny,"Are you telling me, for the past four months I have been asking you whatês new and you never thought to go with Sheldon has a girlfriend?"
Sheldon,Sheês not my girlfriend.
Penny,"Ah, du-du-du-du-du. How did they meet?"
Howard,"Raj and I entered Sheldonês information on a dating site, and it spit out Amy Farrah Fowler."
Penny,"Oh, my God! Sheldon and Amy."
Howard,"Or, as we call them, Shamy."
Penny,Shamy. I am so digging the Shamy.
Sheldon,"All right, everyone pay attention. Yes, I have a friend named Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, she is female. Yes, we communicate on a daily basis, but no, she is not my girlfriend."
Penny,"Okay, well, what do you communicate about?"
Sheldon,"Well, my work in physics, her work in neurobiology, and most recently, the possibility of our having a child together."
Penny,Thank you.
Leonard,Wait a minute_ a child? You never see this girl. You just e-mail and text and Twitter. Now youêre considering having a baby?
Sheldon,"Amy pointed out that between the two of us, our genetic material has the potential of producing the first in a line of intellectually superior, benign overlords to guide humanity to a brighter tomorrow."
Howard,Iêm guessing that future historians will condemn us for not taking this opportunity to kill Sheldon.
Penny,"Okay, I have a question."
Sheldon,"Yes, Penny."
Penny,You donêt even like people touching you. How are you going to have sex?
Sheldon,Why on Earth would we have sex?
Penny,"Oh, honey, did your mom not have the talk with you? You know, when your private parts started growing?"
Sheldon,"Iêm quite aware of the way humans usually reproduce, which is messy, unsanitary, and based on living next to you for three years, involves loud and unnecessary appeals to a deity."
Penny,"Oh, God."
Sheldon,"Yes, exactly. Consequently, if Amy and I choose to bring new life into this world, it will be accomplished clinically, with fertility experts in a lab with petri dishes. Which reminds me, you have broad hips and a certain corn-fed vigour. Is your womb available for rental?"
Leonard,Still digging the Shamy?
Penny,"Look, Sheldon, before you race off to the fertility clinic, you might want to think about, uh gee, I donêt know, maybe actually spending some time with her."
Sheldon,You mean dating?
Sheldon,I canêt date Amy.
Penny,Why not?
Sheldon,Sheês not my girlfriend.
Penny,"Okay, look, donêt think of it as dating a girlfriend. Think of it as, uh, getting to know the future mother of your child."
Sheldon,Oh. I hadnêt considered that. I suppose she will have to have access to our progeny. And you donêt think I can achieve the required intimacy via text messaging?
Penny,Probably not.
Sheldon,Huh. It would appear as if the phone companies have been lying to me.
Sheldon, Penny.
Penny,You do realize I stand on the other side of the door waiting for you to finish knocking three times.
Sheldon,I know. I can see the shadow of your feet under the door.
Penny,"Yeah, my point is itês a waste of time."
Sheldon,"If youêre looking for an example of a waste of time, I would refer you to the conversation weêre having right now."
Penny,What do you want?
Sheldon,Iêve decided to take your advice and have arranged to go on a date with Amy Farrah Fowler.
Penny,"Oh, thatês great. Have fun."
Sheldon,Wait. You have to drive me.
Sheldon,You know I donêt drive.
Penny,"Well, go ask Leonard."
Sheldon,"I did. He said, and I quote, ask Penny, it was her cockamamie idea."
Penny,Leonard said cockamamie?
Sheldon,"Actually, Iêm paraphrasing. Having been raised in a Christian household, Iêm uncomfortable with the language he used. And to be honest, Iêm not entirely comfortable with cockamamie."
Penny,"Okay, fine. Whenês the date?"
Sheldon,Hurry. Weêre going to be late.
Penny,"Sheldon, did it ever occur to you that I might have other plans?"
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. Do you have other plans?
Penny,"Well, no, not per se, butÑ"
Sheldon,So this conversation is as pointless as your door-knocking soliloquy?
Penny,Let me get my cockamamie keys.
Howard,"Oh, God, that feels so good. Yeah, thatês the spot. Oh, baby."
Howard,"Iêll eat later. Iêm busy! Oh, yeah. Just like a real hand. Hmm."
Sheldon,Thank you for driving me.
Penny,Youêre welcome.
Sheldon,I wish you werenêt wearing flip-flops. Itês dangerous to drive in flip-flops.
Sheldon,Sorry. I just donêt want to be yet another flip-flop fatality.
Penny,Can I ask you a question?
Sheldon,"Given your community college education, I encourage you to ask me as many as possible."
Penny,"Yeah. Well, my question is, and Iêm pretty sure I know the answer, is this your first date?"
Sheldon,That depends. Does square-dancing with my sister at a Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown count as a date?
Sheldon,"Then, this is my first date."
Penny,"Okay. Well, then, thereês a couple of things you should probably know."
Sheldon,"I have a masterês degree and two doctorates. The things I should know, I do know."
Penny,"My point is, I know more about dating than you, and if you were as smart as you think you are, you would listen to me."
Sheldon,"If you know so much, how come I have a date tonight and you have nothing better to do than drive me to it?"
Penny,Fair point.
Raj,"You know, thereês something Iêve always wondered about Aquaman."
Raj,Where does he poop?
Raj,"What would a toilet look like in Atlantis? How would you flush it? And when you did flush it, where would the poop go?"
Penny,"So, um, Amy, Sheldon tells me youêre a neuro something-or-other."
Amy,Neurobiologist. Your check engine light is on.
Penny,"Yeah, itês okay."
Amy,But the light indicatesÑ
Sheldon,Donêt bother. Iêve wasted many an hour tilting at that particular windmill.
Penny,"Um, what is that scent youêre wearing? It smells great."
Amy,Dandruff shampoo. I have dry scalp.
Penny,"Ah. Well, your hair looks very nice."
Amy,Are you a homosexual?
Penny,"No, no, I was just giving you a compliment."
Amy,Hmm. Would have been more flattered if you were a homosexual.
Penny,"Guys, how êbout some music?"
Sheldon,"Oh, no, I wouldnêt care for that. Amy?"
Amy,"No, thank you."
Penny,"Okay. Uncomfortable silence it is. Hey, Sheldon, have you told Amy what it was like for you growing up in Texas?"
Penny,"Well, why donêt you tell her?"
Sheldon,All right. It was hell.
Penny,"Any follow up, Amy?"
Penny,"I myself grew up in Nebraska. Small town outside of Omaha. You know, nice place, mostly family farms, a few meth labs."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, how is this better than uncomfortable silence?"
Penny,I donêt know. I was just trying something.
Raj,You slipped and fell into a robot hand?
Raj,Penis first?
Howard,"Yes. Now, help me!"
Leonard,"Iêd suggest a lubricant, but I have a feeling you fell on some of that as well."
Howard,"Not funny, Leonard."
Raj,"Really? A robot handês got a death grip on your junk, dude. Thatês funny, ask anyone."
Howard,"Please, before my mother walks in, just get this off me!"
Leonard,"Okay, letês see."
Howard,"No, no! Donêt touch, the program is paused."
Leonard,"Well, then letês un-pause it."
Howard,"No, no! I loaded the wrong program. The hand thinks itês holding a screwdriver in outer space. If you continue the program, itês gonna start twisting."
Raj,"A-All right, um, how about this. When, when Winnie the Pooh got his head stuck in the honey tree, his friends all grabbed onto him and pulled and pulled."
Leonard,"You do what you want, Iêm not touching another manês honey tree."
Raj,"All right, uh, forget pulling. How about we get an electric saw and cut it off?"
Howard,No saws! One circumcision was enough.
Leonard,How about an acetylene torch?
Howard,"Okay, I canêt believe this needs to be said out loud. No pulling, no saws, no torches."
Leonard,"Well, then what do you want us to do?"
Howard,"Thatês great, Mom, thanks!"
Howard,Donêt come up here!
Howard,"Yes, but thatês not the point! Get me out of here."
Leonard,"You have any ideas, Raj?"
Raj,"Right now, all I can think about is cookies and Hawaiian Punch."
Penny,"Hey, hereês another possible topic of conversation. This is a big night for Sheldon. Right, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,Big night? The winter solstice is a big night. Itês over 14 hours in Southern California.
Amy,Thatês an amusing factoid.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Penny,"No, no. My point is, uh, tonight is Sheldonês first official date. Discuss."
Amy,Is this true?
Sheldon,"Apparently, a semi-incestuous Teens for Jesus Fourth of July Hoedown didnêt count."
Penny,"So, um, Amy, what about you? Do you date much?"
Amy,"Once a year. Itês a deal I made with my mother in exchange for her silence on the matter, as well as the occasional use of her George Foreman Grill that seals in the flavour without the fat. How about you, Penny? Do you go on many dates?"
Penny,"Uh, yeah, I wouldnêt say many. A few. "
Sheldon,Your characterization of approximately 171 different men as a few.
Penny,Where did you get 171 men?
Sheldon,"Simple extrapolation. In the three years that Iêve known you, you were single for two. During that time, I saw 17 different suitors. If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias and postulate an initial dating age of 15Ñ"
Penny,"Whoa, wait, wait, wait. I did not start dating at 15."
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. 16?
Sheldon,"My mistake. Now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present, that would bring the total up to 193 men. Plus or minus eight men."
Amy,Remarkable. Did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?
Sheldon,Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate.
Sheldon,"Based on the number of awkward encounters Iêve had with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning, plus the number of times sheês returned home wearing the same clothes she wore the night beforeÑ"
Penny,"Okay, Sheldon, I think youêve made your point."
Sheldon,"So we multiply 193, minus 21 men before the loss of virginity, so 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners. Letês round that up to 31."
Penny,"Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong. That is not even close to the real number. Iêm gonna need a drink over here."
Amy,"This is very interesting. Cultural perceptions are subjective. Penny, to your mind, are you a slut?"
Penny,"No! No! Letês just all finish our dinners, okay?"
Sheldon,This is an interesting topic. How many sexual encounters have you had?
Amy,Does volunteering for a scientific experiment in which orgasm was achieved by electronically stimulating the pleasure centres of the brain count?
Sheldon,I should think so.
Amy,Then 128.
Leonard,"Okay, come on. Almost there."
Howard,Donêt tug. No tugging.
Raj,"Next time, take your own advice."
Leonard,"Excuse me, could you help us out?"
Howard,I slipped and fell.
Howard,Itês a robot arm.
Howard,I only built the arm.
Howard,Can you please just help me?
Howard,You think you could be a little more discreet?
Leonard,"Uh, itês what controls the arm."
Howard,But itês frozen.
Howard,"No, you see, itês more complicated than that.  Winnie the Pooh is out of the honey tree."
Raj,Now can we have cookies and Hawaiian Punch?
Sheldon,You were right. This was a very productive evening. I saw a whole new side of Amy Farrah Fowler tonight.
Penny,I did not have sex with 31 guys.
Sheldon,"Iêll be happy to check the math, but numbers donêt lie, Penny. In any event, now that Amy and I have spent quality time together, I feel much more confident proceeding to the next stage of our relationship."
Penny,And that is?
Sheldon,Using in vitro fertilization and a surrogate uterus to gift humanity with our progeny.
Penny,Youêre still on that?
Sheldon,"In these uncertain times, doesnêt humanity deserve a gift?"
Penny,"Okay, you know what? Iêm gonna come at this in a whole new way. Sheldon, if you try to make a baby with Amy in a petri dish, Iêm gonna tell your mother on you."
Sheldon,Thatês no threat. My motherês always wanted a grandchild.
Penny,Really? Your deeply religious born-again Christian mother wants a test-tube grandbaby born out of wedlock?
Penny,"If Iêd thought of that in the first place, I couldêve saved myself this whole night."
Sheldon,"Well, itês not that late. You could still go out and look for number 32. Good night."
Leonard,"Hey, Howard, whatês up?"
Sheldon,Iêve decided not to procreate.
Leonard,"Yeah, yeah, great. Howard, uh, slow down. What do you mean it happened again?"
Leonard,Whatcha doinê there? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?
Sheldon,The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?
Sheldon,And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?
Sheldon,What Iêm doing here is trying to determine when Iêm going to die.
Leonard,A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?
Sheldon,"My family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera."
Leonard,Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. Whatês KBB?
Sheldon,Killed by badger.
Leonard,Howês that?
Sheldon,"It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, I think thereês a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us."
Leonard,I donêt think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.
Sheldon,"Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Whoês to say that I donêt share that flawed DNA?"
Leonard,You can always get a badger and find out.
Sheldon,"But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left."
Leonard,"That long, huh?"
Sheldon,60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here.
Leonard,Whatês there?
Sheldon,"The earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality."
Leonard,"So, youêre upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?"
Sheldon,By this much.
Leonard,Tough break. You want eggs?
Sheldon,"You donêt get it, Leonard. Iêm going to miss so much, the unified field theory,  cold fusion, the dogapus."
Leonard,Whatês a dogapus?
Sheldon,A hybrid dog and octopus. Manês underwater best friend.
Leonard,Is somebody working on that?
Sheldon,I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.
Leonard,Wait a minute. You hate dogs.
Sheldon,A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.
Howard,What do we owe you?
Leonard,It came to $28.17. Letês say six bucks apiece.
Howard,Here you go.
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,Never mind. I got it.
Penny,"Oh, you wanted me to pay."
Leonard,Itês no big deal.
Penny,"No, no, no, no. Youêre right. Weêre not going out anymore, I should pay for myself.  What?"
Howard,"He said if he had woman parts, heêd eat for free the rest of his life."
Penny,"Yeah, but you wouldnêt be able to talk to yourself. Iêm a little low on cash."
Leonard,Hmm? How much you got?
Leonard,How can you walk around with no money?
Penny,Iêm cute. I get by.
Leonard,"Itês okay, you can owe me."
Leonard,"Sheldon, six bucks."
Sheldon,"No, thank you. Iêm not eating pizza tonight."
Penny,But itês Thursday. Thursdayês pizza night.
Sheldon,"Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night. Tonightês selection, brussels sprouts."
Howard,Really? Youêre changing the Sheldonian calendar?
Sheldon,Itês a small price to pay.
Penny,For what?
Leonard,"No, no, donêt ask."
Penny,"Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry."
Sheldon,"In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, I need to change my diet."
Penny,"Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?"
Penny,So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?
Sheldon,"Essentially, yes."
Penny,"Okay, hereês my question. Didnêt you already do that?"
Sheldon,"Flattering, but sadly, no. Iêm also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. AKA jogging."
Penny,"Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?"
Sheldon,"Certainly. Iêve run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test."
Howard,"Youêre right, Penny jogs. Maybe you guys can run together."
Sheldon,"Thatês an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster."
Penny,"No, it wonêt. Um, how does he know I jog?"
Howard,"Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars."
Penny,"Oh, my God, that is so creepy!"
Howard,I know!  Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women.
Leonard,What the hell? Whatês the matter?
Sheldon,I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. Iêm nauseated and feverish. I believe I may have cholera.
Leonard,"Thereês no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena."
Sheldon,"Well, if itês not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprungês Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms."
Leonard,When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?
Sheldon,"Itês part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly!"
Leonard,Have you had your appendix out?
Sheldon,"I havenêt. Iêve been meaning to, but who has the time?"
Leonard,Letês get you to the hospital.
Sheldon,"So this is how it ends, with cruel irony. Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body, I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ. Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?"
Sheldon,I do. And yet Iêm doomed while you live on.
Leonard,"Funny how things work out, isnêt it?"
Sheldon,"Oh, Lord, I think itês about to burst!  On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels sprouts."
Leonard,Good night.
Sheldon,Good night. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.
Sheldon, Penny.
Penny,"Coming, coming. Hey, nice knees."
Sheldon,Thank you. Theyêre my motherês.
Penny,Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because youêre gonna run really fast?
Sheldon,"No, the Flash shirt is because itês Friday, but itês nice when things work out. Whereês your heart rate monitor?"
Penny,I donêt have one.
Sheldon,What about your pedometer?
Penny,Donêt have one.
Sheldon,Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?
Penny,"Uh, no."
Sheldon,"What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?"
Penny,"I just run till Iêm hungry, then I stop for a bear claw."
Sheldon,Why are you doing that?
Penny,Itês good to stretch your muscles before you run.
Sheldon,All right.
Penny,"All right, letês start with a toe touch. Okay, you do it."
Sheldon,I am doing it.
Penny,"Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this?"
Sheldon,Weêll never know.
Penny,"Okay, letês just warm up on the run."
Penny,"Okay, letês go."
Sheldon,"Yeah, Iêve been reading up on biomechanics. I think youêll be surprised at myÑ Wah! Oh!"
Penny,"Oh, my God, are you okay?"
Sheldon,I think so.
Penny,"Oh, let me help you up."
Sheldon,Thank you. 
Penny,"Oh, Sheldon!"
Sheldon,"If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night."
Leonard,"Hereês my chicken curry. Howard, your shrimp biryani."
Howard,"Thank you, sir."
Leonard,"Palak paneer, thatês Penny."
Leonard,"And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets."
Penny,"Hey, whatês my share?"
Leonard,"Uh, 12 bucks."
Penny,"Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?"
Penny,What am I up to now?
Leonard,"Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars."
Penny,What now?
Howard,Heês just expressing his admiration that you donêt even have to put out to get free stuff.
Penny,"Itês not free, Iêm gonna pay him back.  Shut up!"
Leonard,"Sheldon, are you gonna join us?"
Sheldon,"Coming! . Greetings, friends."
Leonard,"Greetings, whatever the hell you are."
Howard,Really? Thatês your question? When did he put a ramp in?
Penny,"Yeah, to be honest, I donêt see much difference."
Leonard,This is ridiculous. Iêm coming to talk to you.
Leonard,Youêre in your bedroom.
Leonard,I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.
Penny,"So, either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear? Only fourteen hundred bucks."
Leonard,"Sheldon, this is ridiculous."
Sheldon,Iêm behind you. Please look at me when youêre talking to me.
Leonard,I am looking at you.
Sheldon,"No, youêre not. Pay no attention to that man in the bed."
Leonard,"You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh, good God."
Sheldon,"At my age, do you know how Iêm statistically most likely to die?"
Leonard,At the hands of your roommate?
Sheldon,An accident.
Leonard,Thatês how Iêm going to make it look.
Sheldon,"Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed."
Leonard,"Fine, but donêt expect my help."
Sheldon,"You have to help, itês in the roommate agreement."
Leonard,"No, itês not."
Sheldon,Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.
Leonard,Iêll be damned.
Leonard,Refresh my memory. Why didnêt I just put you in the trunk?
Leonard,"I donêt want to listen to music, Sheldon."
Leonard,"Except in Knight Rider, the car isnêt a yammering sphincter."
Leonard,"I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider."
Leonard,Thatês it. Bye-bye. 
Leonard,I almost died!
Leonard,Iêm still going to go with you.
Leonard,What about it?
Leonard,Why? Whatês the problem?
Leonard,"No, I think a doorknob has you stymied."
Howard,"Oh, look, itês Leonard and R2-D-Bag."
Raj,Thatês my joke. I told it last night. You canêt just use it.
Raj,"Oh, sure."
Raj,Iêm a lamb.
Howard,I say we just take him to Tatooine and sell him to some Jawas.
Raj,"Thatês two, dude. Write your own jokes."
Penny,"Oh, great. Hi, Iêm Penny, Iêll be your waitress."
Leonard,Why are you introducing yourself?
Penny,Iêd rather people not know I have any prior connection to you whatsoever.
Penny,"Sheldon, Iêm not waiting on you."
Penny,Because youêre not here.
Howard,Is that Steve Wozniak?
Leonard,I think it is.
Leonard,"Penny, Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of Apple Computer. He and Steve Jobs started itÑ"
Penny,"Yeah, I know who he is. I watch Dancing with the Stars."
Leonard,Of course you must.
Penny,"You know, thereês an Olive Garden down the street. You guys should try it sometime."
Sheldon,"Iêm coming, Woz, Iêm coming.  Ow! Aw."
Penny,"What up, Shel-Bot?"
Penny,What do you want me to do?
Penny,"Really, you want me to sing Soft Kitty to a computer monitor?"
Penny,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur."
Penny,"Happy kitty, sleepyÑ"
Penny,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
Sheldon,"All right, Iêm ready for my next question."
Amy,"In a world where rhinoceroses are domesticated pets, who wins the Second World War?"
Sheldon,"Kenya rises to power on the export of rhinoceroses. A Central African power block is formed, colonizing North Africa and Europe. When war breaks out, no one can afford the luxury of a rhino. Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs."
Amy,Correct. My turn.
Sheldon,"In a world where a piano is a weapon, not a musical instrument, on what does Scott Joplin play The Maple Leaf Rag?"
Amy,Tuned bayonets.
Amy,Isnêt it obvious?
Sheldon,Youêre right. My apologies.
Leonard,What the hell are you guys playing?
Sheldon,Itês a game we invented. Itês called Counterfactuals.
Amy,We postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect and then pose questions to each other.
Sheldon,Itês fun for ages eight to eighty. Join us.
Leonard,All right. I like a good brainteaser. Give it a whirl.
Sheldon,"Youêre in luck, this is an easy one. In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver, what food is no longer consumed?"
Leonard,"Uh, a BLT where the B stands for beaver? I donêt know."
Sheldon,"Leonard, be serious. Weêre playing a game here."
Leonard,"I can figure this out, letês see. Um, well, beavers eat tree bark. The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon. So, Iêll say cinnamon."
Sheldon,"Incorrect. Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish."
Amy,"In a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams to please the beaver overlord. The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded. Thousands die. Devastated, the Danes never invent their namesake pastry. How does one miss that?"
Leonard,This is ridiculous. Youêre just making stuff up.
Amy,Is he always like this when he loses?
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. You shouldêve been here for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008."
Leonard,You bumped the table and you know it.
Amy,Perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities. Weêll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide.
Leonard,Iêm going to my room.
Amy,"Very good, Leonard. But next time, donêt tell us where youêre hiding."
Leonard,Did you guys see the paper in The American Physics Journal on supersolids? Itês pretty interesting. This guyês working from a hypothesis whereÑ
Raj,Spoiler alert! Spoiler alert.
Raj,"Donêt ruin it for me, man. I printed out a PDF to read on the potty."
Howard,"On the potty? What are you, five?"
Raj,Itês a potty. What do you call it?
Raj,"Thatês a little vulgar for the dinner table, donêt you think?"
Howard,"Oh, and potty is okay?"
Raj,Potty is innocent. Potty is adorable.
Howard,"What do you do in the potty, wee-wee?"
Raj,If I donêt have to boom-boom.
Sheldon,Greetings. You all remember Amy Farrah Fowler.
Howard,Nice to see you.
Sheldon,Sorry weêre late.
Amy,I must take responsibility. I had to stop for feminine hygiene supplies.
Howard,"Ah, ah."
Sheldon,I believe sheês experiencing her menses.
Amy,"Actually, Iêm not. In order to avoid surprises, I wear them all the time."
Leonard,"Ah, ah."
Howard,"Okay. Toiletês sounding pretty good now, huh?"
Penny,"Hey, look, itês Shamy."
Sheldon,"A juvenile amalgamation of our names. Sheldon and Amy,  Shamy."
Amy,Oh. I donêt like that. Donêt do that.
Penny,All righty. Whatês new?
Amy,"Well, just recently, I learned that you refer to us as Shamy, and I donêt like that."
Penny,"I got it. But what I was going for was, you know, howês your life?"
Amy,"Like everybody elseês. Subject to entropy, decay and eventual death. Thank you for asking. Why is she not taking our order?"
Sheldon,"I shouldêve warned you, one has to navigate a labyrinth of social nonsense before one can be fed here."
Amy,Really? I assumed an establishment called the Cheesecake Factory would function more efficiently.
Sheldon,Itês how they lure you in. I believe itês called bait and switch.
Penny,"Okay, Iêm just gonna walk away, êcause I donêt want to be here."
Leonard,"So, this is nice. First time weêve all gotten together to eat."
Amy,"Youêre right, heês a festival of humdrum chitchat."
Leonard,"Okay, thatês all I got. Howard, youêre up."
Howard,"Um, tell us about your work, Amy."
Amy,I doubt youêd understand. Sheldon tells me you only have a masterês degree.
Howard,"Raj, do you have any questions for Amy?"
Amy,Iêm curious as to why weêre not eating alone.
Sheldon,They canêt function without me. Iêm the social glue that holds this little group together. Youêre welcome.
Leonard,"Listen, can I talk to you about your girlfriend?"
Sheldon,"Sheês not my girlfriend. Sheês a girl and sheês my friend, but thereês no touching or unsanitary exchange of saliva."
Leonard,Got it.
Sheldon,"Although, for the record, on one occasion, she licked her thumb to remove raspberry jelly from the corner of my mouth. Itês an action we both regret to this day."
Leonard,"Uh-huh. Anyway, Iêm not sure sheês the best fit for our little, how should we call it, rebel alliance."
Sheldon,"Oh, I never identified with the rebel alliance. Despite their tendency to build Death Stars, Iêve always been more of an empire man."
Leonard,"Yeah, not my point."
Sheldon,"I know what your point is. Youêre intimidated by Amyês intellect. To that I say, buck up."
Leonard,"Okay, let me just get right to it. Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious and frankly just obnoxious."
Leonard,So we already have you for all that.
Sheldon,Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?
Leonard,"No, no, of course not. Just have your relationship someplace else."
Sheldon,"May I point out that for eight long months, I suffered in silence as your female companion filled our apartment with her off-key country music caterwauling, the unappetizing spectacle of her grinding a pumice stone against her calloused feet in our living room, and night after night of uninformative TV documentaries about the Jersey Shore."
Leonard,Suffered in silence?
Sheldon,Yes. And Iêd thank you to do the same.
Leonard,Really? Silence?
Raj,"Ah. Nothing makes beer taste better than cool clear Rocky Mountain spring water. Where are the Rocky Mountains, anyway?"
Raj,Really? I thought they were out West someplace.
Howard,"Think about it, Raj. Where did the movie Rocky take place?"
Raj,"Philadelphia. Okay, now I get it."
Penny,"So this is the plan? From now on, weêre just gonna hide out in here to avoid the Shamy?"
Raj,"Iêm very comfortable here. Penny, dear, why donêt you shoot another silver bullet my way?"
Penny,Get one yourself.
Raj,"Ooh, somebodyês been taking bitchy pills."
Penny,"God, heês an ass when he drinks."
Howard,"Oh, heês an ass when he doesnêt. You just donêt hear it."
Leonard,I think we need to start entertaining the possibility that the Shamy could go on for years.
Raj,"Well, if thatês the case, Penny will have to get satellite TV and maybe once a week run a vacuum through this place."
Penny,I thought you were going to talk to Sheldon.
Leonard,I did.
Penny,"Well, whatêd he say?"
Leonard,"Well, he pointed out that he kinda, sorta had to put up with you."
Penny,"Kinda, sorta had to?"
Leonard,I didnêt agree with him.
Penny,"Well, you defended me, right?"
Leonard,"I tried, but  he made a fairly well-reasoned argument."
Howard,Youêre not doing that right.
Howard,Trust me.
Howard,I do this for my mom all the time. See? With the grain.
Penny,"Wow, that is better."
Howard,"And someday, when you have varicose veins, Iêll show you how to massage them."
Raj,"Oh, God, never again."
Leonard,"I assume by never again, you mean never again will you drink all of Pennyês beer, then run down to the gas station for a couple of 40s, a box of Slim Jims and the latest issue of Bombay Badonkadonks."
Raj,I was homesick.
Howard,The highlight of the evening was when you showed us your Bollywood break dancing skills. 
Raj,Thatês very offensive.
Howard,"Yeah, we all thought so."
Leonard,"Oh, no."
Leonard,John and Yoko.
Howard,More like Yoko and Yoko.
Sheldon,I brought Amy here to show her some of the work Iêm doing.
Amy,"Itês very impressive, for theoretical work."
Sheldon,Do I detect a hint of condescension?
Amy,"Iêm sorry, was I being too subtle? I meant compared to the real-world applications of neurobiology, theoretical physics is, whatês the word Iêm looking for? Hmm, cute."
Sheldon,Are you suggesting the work of a neurobiologist like Babinski could ever rise to the significance of a physicist like Clarke-Maxwell or Dirac?
Amy,Iêm stating it outright. Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast and defecates Clarke-Maxwell.
Sheldon,You take that back.
Amy,"Absolutely not. My colleagues and I are mapping the neurological substrates that subserve global information processing, which is required for all cognitive reasoning, including scientific inquiry, making my research ipso facto prior in the ordo cognoscendi. That means itês better than his research, and by extension, of course, yours."
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, Iêm-Iêm still trying to work on the defecating Clark Maxwell, soÑ"
Sheldon,"Excuse me, but a grand unified theory, insofar as it explains everything, will ipso facto explain neurobiology."
Amy,"Yes, but if Iêm successful, I will be able to map and reproduce your thought processes in deriving a grand unified theory, and therefore, subsume your conclusions under my paradigm."
Sheldon,"Thatês the rankest psychologism, and was conclusively revealed as hogwash by Gottlob Frege in the 1890s!"
Amy,We appear to have reached an impasse.
Sheldon,I agree. I move our relationship terminate immediately.
Sheldon,There being no objectionsÑ
Sheldon,"The motion carries. Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler."
Amy,"Good day, Sheldon Cooper."
Howard,"Women, huh? Canêt live with them, canêt successfully refute their hypotheses."
Sheldon,Amen to that.
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
Penny,I hear you broke up with Amy.
Sheldon,A breakup would imply she was my girlfriend. She was a girl who was my friend who is now a girl who is not my friend.
Penny,"Wow. Thatês like the worst country song ever. So, how are you doing?"
Sheldon,Regarding what?
Sheldon,I donêt follow.
Penny,"Well, breakups, or whatever the hell this is, can be tough."
Sheldon,"Penny, I assure you, Iêm fine. My relationship with Amy was purely intellectual. There were no emotional bonds, the severing of which would cause me any discomfort. The relationship simply outlived its utility, and Iêm continuing on with my life as before."
Penny,Okay. Good.
Sheldon,"Now, if youêll excuse me, Iêm off to buy a pussycat."
Leonard,"I gotta tell you guys, Iêm a little worried about Sheldon."
Howard,Weêre all a little worried about Sheldon.
Leonard,"No, I mean since the Shamy hit a reef."
Howard,"Oh, I thought you were just making a generalization, you know, Iêm worried about Sheldon someday setting off a low-yield nuclear device because the cafeteria ran out of lime Jell-O."
Raj,What does hit a reef mean?
Leonard,"Uh, went splitsville."
Leonard,Turned to boom-boom.
Leonard,I think Sheldon really misses Amy.
Howard,You should lend him your copy of Bombay Badonkadonks.
Leonard,He got a cat to keep him company.
Raj,Youêre kidding.
Leonard,"He takes it everywhere, to bed, to the bathroom."
Raj,He takes the kitty to the potty?
Howard,I thought we discussed the P-word.
Raj,"Donêt try to change me, dude. I am what I am."
Sheldon,"Oh, gentlemen."
Howard,Hey. Arenêt you going to introduce us to your little friend?
Sheldon,"My apologies. Raj, Howard, Iêd like you to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer."
Sheldon,"Now, if youêll excuse me, the father of the atomic bomb wants a saucer of milk."
Howard,"Okay, I get it. Weêre worried about Sheldon."
Leonard,"Hey.  Oh, no."
Sheldon,Robert Oppenheimer was lonely.
Leonard,So you decided to get the whole Manhattan Project?
Sheldon,"Yes. This is Enrico Fermi, Richard Feynman, Edward Teller, Otto Frisch, and Zazzles."
Sheldon,"I was going to name him Herman von Helmholtz, but heês so zazzy."
Leonard,"Okay, we need to talk."
Sheldon,About what?
Leonard,"Cats, Sheldon. Youêre clearly upset about Amy being gone, and youêre trying to replace her with a bunch of cats."
Sheldon,A group of cats is a clowder. Or a glaring.
Leonard,"Okay, yeah, fine."
Sheldon,Itês the kind of thing you ought to know now that we have one.
Leonard,Terrific. My-my point is you need to face up to what youêre feeling with this breakup.
Sheldon,It wasnêt a breakup. A breakup would imply that Amy was my girlfriend.
Leonard,"Okay, I got it, I got it, sheês not your girlfriend. Now listen to me. I know about loneliness. I know about trying to replace someone with other stuff. When I broke up with Penny, I got back into my cello, I built a bunch of model rockets, I got those weightlifting gloves and that five-pound dumbbell."
Sheldon,"You didnêt break up, she dumped you."
Leonard,She didnêt dump me. It was mutual!
Sheldon,I was there. She dumped you.
Leonard,"Okay, fine. Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy. She had dozens of them. And do you know what happened after she died? They ate her."
Sheldon,"You donêt have to sell me on cats, Leonard. Iêm already a fan. All right, fellas, whoês in the mood for Fancy Feast? Well, thatês not fancy at all."
Leonard,"Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming."
Leonard,Heês in his bedroom.
Leonard,"No, sheês real."
Leonard,"No, no, itês not like that. Itês, uh, I donêt know what itês like. But there is something I should prepare you for."
Leonard,Hold on to that thought. 
Sheldon,Come in. 
Sheldon,"Mom, what an unexpected pleasure."
Sheldon,"Iêd like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, WeisskopfÑ"
Sheldon,What are you doing here?
Sheldon,"Oh, thatês preposterous. Iêm not pining over anyone."
Sheldon,"I do not agree. Cats make wonderful companions. They donêt argue or question my intellectual authority, and this little guy here, I think youêll find to be quite zazzy."
Sheldon,Aw. What is she doing here?
Amy,"Your mother thinks you might be losing your mind over me. As a neurobiologist, I was curious."
Sheldon,"Well, rest assured, I am in full possession of my faculties."
Leonard,25 cats!
Sheldon,"All right, but youêre not fooling me. Whenever you say we have to talk, it means you want me to listen."
Sheldon,"Yes, maêam."
Sheldon,"Thatês a peculiar conclusion. By any standard, Amy is more similar to me than anyone Iêve ever met."
Sheldon,"Well, whether you see it or not is irrelevant. I canêt see subatomic particles, but nevertheless, theyêre there."
Amy,Excellent point.
Sheldon,A physics point.
Sheldon,"Amy, after consideration, I believe we may have acted rashly. I propose we resume our relationship and attempt to resolve our differences."
Amy,Iêll agree to that only if youêll stipulate that 80% of our difficulties were caused by you.
Sheldon,Iêll go as high as 40.
Sheldon,"Done. You understand that moving forward, we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?"
Amy,I do. I find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.
Sheldon,Would you like to see my cats?
Amy,I would. I love cats. Theyêre the epitome of indifference.
Sheldon,"Ah, then you may find Zazzles a little cloying."
Leonard,I saw what you did there.
Leonard,"No, no, no, I can do it."
Sheldon,"Thank you, Amy. Hereês your cat. And hereês your $20."
Sheldon,"Thank you, Amy. Hereês your cat. And hereês your $20."
Raj,"Iêm telling you, if xenon emits ultraviolet light, then those dark matter discoveries must be wrong."
Sheldon,"Yes, well, if we lived in a world where slow-moving xenon produced light, then youêd be correct. Also, pigs would fly, my derriere would produce cotton candy, and The Phantom Menace would be a timeless classic."
Raj,"Oh, youêre so arrogant. If you were a superhero, your name would be Captain Arrogant. And you know what your superpower would be? Arrogance."
Sheldon,"Youêre wrong again. If my superpower were arrogance, my name would be Dr. Arroganto."
Howard,I love watching Raj and Sheldon try to work together.
Leonard,"Yeah, itês like if Alien and Predator decided to go partners in a Jamba Juice."
Raj,Has it occurred to you youêre missing the big picture? If you look at neutron scattering dataÑ
Sheldon,"Oh, Penny? Penny?"
Penny,Whatês up?
Sheldon,Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.
Howard,"No, no, no. He won. Suck it up."
Penny,"Well, Iêd ask you guys if you want dessert, but I know Sheldon doesnêt eat dessert on Tuesdays. And even if Raj wanted something, he couldnêt tell me. Howard wonêt order anything, but he will come up with some sort of skeevy comment involving the words pie or cheesecake. And Leonardês lactose intolerant, so he canêt eat anything here without his intestines blowing up like a balloon animal."
Leonard,Hang on a second. I could have the fruit platter.
Penny,You want the fruit platter?
Leonard,Does it have melon on it?
Leonard,"No, I canêt eat melon."
Penny,"Oh, Howard, heads up. Your ex-girlfriend just came in for her shift."
Leonard,When was the last time you saw her?
Howard,"Oh, not since we broke up. Wow. How am I going to play this? Sophisticated and relaxed? Friendly, noncommittal? Cold and distant? ."
Bernadette,"Hi, guys."
Sheldon,Hello. I see you decided to go with pathetic and frightened.
Raj,Itês one of his best moves.
Howard,"So, my dear, we meet again."
Howard,"Iêve missed you, Katee Sackhoff."
Howard,"Why are you in bed with me? If we start to question this, it all falls apart."
Howard,"Okay, if you insist."
Howard,"No, Ma!"
Howard,"Maybe it committed suicide! Leave me alone! Now, where were we?"
Bernadette,I believe you were about to rip off my uniform with your teeth.
Howard,Bernadette? What are you doing here?
Howard,"No, Iêm not."
Bernadette,"Clearly you are. Otherwise, based on past experience, weêd be done by now."
Howard,"Okay, Iêm a little confused here."
Howard,Not that kind of confused.
Bernadette,Whatês George Takei doing here?
Howard,"No, of course not."
Howard,"Wait. Katee, why are you leaving?"
Bernadette,Sheês leaving because you really want to be with me.
Howard,"Great, Ma!"
Howard,"And with that mental picture, I think weêre done for the evening."
Leonard,"You know, you never told me what happened between you and Bernadette."
Howard,I did a stupid thing.
Leonard,"Yeah, I guessed that."
Howard,It was the kind of thing that makes it kind of hard to face her now.
Leonard,"That covers anything from farting in bed to killing a homeless guy. Oh, my God. You ran over a hobo."
Howard,Stop asking.
Leonard,"All right, fine. So you want to get back together with her, but youêre too ashamed to face her because of whatever it is you did."
Howard,In a nutshell.
Leonard,"Okay. Well, how about this? Kidnap Bernadette from the opera wearing a creepy mask so she doesnêt know itês you."
Howard,"Now, you see, I donêt know if youêre kidding or not."
Raj,Youêre being unreasonable. Why canêt I have a desk?
Sheldon,Our collaboration is a work of the mind. We donêt need desks.
Raj,You have a desk.
Raj,But I canêt have one.
Sheldon,Youêre two for two.
Leonard,"Why canêt he have a desk, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,"Oh, Lord, will this day never end? As Iêve explained repeatedly to Dr. Koothrappali, whose ability to comprehend the American idiom fails him when itês convenient, thereês absolutely no money in my budget for additional office furniture."
Raj,"Oh, but thereês money for a drawer full of Red Vines, a marshmallow shooting rifle, and a super executive ant farm with glow-in-the-dark sand?"
Howard,"Okay, what if he buys his own desk?"
Raj,"Yeah, what if I buy my own desk?"
Sheldon,Thatês ridiculous.
Sheldon,Itês my office.
Sheldon,"All right, all right. He can buy his own desk."
Raj,And I can put it in your office?
Sheldon,"Well, you really want to dot the Iês and cross the Tês, donêt you?"
Leonard,Why would you want a glow-in-the-dark ant farm?
Sheldon,They do some of their best work at night.
Penny,"Ah, itês okay."
Howard,Would you have opened the door if you knew it was me?
Penny,Not since I found out the teddy bear you gave me had a webcam in it.
Howard,I just have a question. Does Bernadette ever talk about me?
Penny,"Oh, absolutely."
Howard,She does?
Penny,"Yeah, sure. Just yesterday, she asked, why is Howard hiding under the table?"
Howard,"She saw that, huh?"
Penny,"Oh, no, not at first. Right after I pointed it out."
Howard,Let me ask you something else. Is she seeing anybody?
Penny,"Uh, not that I know of. Hey, while weêre on the subject, why did you guys break up anyway?"
Howard,"Oh, Iêd rather not say."
Penny,"Howard, if you want my help, Iêve got to know what happened."
Howard,But itês embarrassing.
Penny,"Yeah, thatês what Iêm counting on. Spill."
Howard,"Okay. Well, you know World of Warcraft?"
Penny,"Um, the online game? Sure."
Howard,"Well, did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?"
Penny,"Oh, God. I think I see where this is going."
Howard,Her name was Glissinda the Troll. Bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cyber-nasty under the Bridge of Souls.
Penny,"Oh, youêre right. That is so embarrassing."
Howard,Would you talk to her?
Penny,Bernadette or the troll?
Howard,"Bernadette. She was so mad at me, she wouldnêt even listen to my side of the story."
Penny,"Well, what was your side?"
Howard,"Well, for all we know, Glissinda the Troll wasnêt even a real woman. I mean, she couldêve been a 50-year-old truck driver in New Jersey."
Penny,Really? And that didnêt make her feel better?
Howard,"Will you talk to her, see if thereês any chance at all we could get back together?"
Penny,"Oh, gee, Howard, I really donêt want to get in the middle of this."
Howard,"Why would you? Iêm just another lonely nerd, living with his mother, trying to find any scrap of happiness he can. You know, maybe to make up for the fact that his dad left him when he was 11."
Penny,"Okay, I will think about it."
Howard,"You know, Iêve always blamed myself for him leaving. I always thought it was because I wasnêt the son he wanted."
Penny,"Yeah, I said Iêd think about it."
Howard,"I wasnêt athletic, yeah, I was kind of sickly."
Penny,"Okay, fine. Look, look, Iêm calling her now! See?"
Howard,Thank you.
Leonard,"So anyway, Howard asked Penny to talk to Bernadette, and she did, and Bernadette agreed to meet him for a cup of coffee."
Sheldon,One question.
Sheldon,Why on earth are you telling me all this?
Leonard,"I donêt know. Sometimes your movements are so lifelike, I forget youêre not a real boy."
Raj,You said I could buy a desk.
Sheldon,This isnêt a desk. This is a Brobdingnagian monstrosity.
Raj,"Is that the American idiom for giant, big-ass desk?"
Sheldon,Itês actually British.
Raj,Can you say it again for me?
Raj,One more time?
Raj,Now three times fast?
Sheldon,"Brobdingnagian, BrobdingnaÑ How did you even get it in here?"
Raj,"Thatês for me, Ramon, Julio, Jesus and Rodrigo to know and you to find out."
Sheldon,"All right, youêve made your point. A fine prank, very amusing. Now get it out."
Raj,"I have three brothers and two sisters, Sheldon, I can do this all day."
Sheldon,"All right, if youêre not going to remove it, Iêll remove it for you."
Raj,Knock yourself out.
Sheldon,Help me move my desk.
Raj,Itês too Brobdingnagian.
Sheldon,Why do you even want this here? Its size is completely disproportionate to its purpose.
Raj,"Well, seeing as its purpose was to piss you off, Iêd say itês spot-on."
Sheldon,"All right, I see whatês going on. This is the opening salvo in what will be an escalating series of juvenile tit-for-tat exchanges. Well titted."
Raj,Thank you.
Sheldon,Stand by for my upcoming tat.
Raj,"Hey, Sheldon?"
Raj,See what I did there? I turned it around.
Bernadette,"Sorry, I had to clock out."
Howard,"Oh, no, thatês okay. How have you been?"
Bernadette,"Okay. You know, busy, school, work. You?"
Howard,"Same. I took a scuba-diving course over the summer, but it turns out Iêm terrified of the ocean."
Bernadette,Too bad.
Howard,"You wouldnêt know anybody who wants to buy a wet suit, boyês large? Yeah, forget it. Not important. So, are you seeing anyone?"
Bernadette,"Well, to be honest, IÑ"
Penny,"Hey, how are we doing over here? Can I get you something to drink?"
Howard,"Not for me, thanks."
Bernadette,Iêm okay.
Penny,Are you gonna want to order food?
Howard,Maybe later.
Howard,"So, are you seeing anybody?"
Penny,Thatês what I told him when he asked me. I hope thatês not out of line.
Bernadette,"No, itês fine."
Howard,"Penny, can we have a little privacy?"
Penny,Oh. Iêm sorry.
Bernadette,"What about you, have you been seeing anybody?"
Howard,"Well, you know how it is with guys. I mean, we have needs andÑ"
Bernadette,So youêve been seeing other girls?
Howard,"Well, not real girls."
Bernadette,Does that mean slutty trolls?
Penny,"You know, you look thirsty. I brought you some iced tea."
Bernadette,Thank you.
Penny,"Itês passion fruit, new on the menu."
Bernadette,I know. I work here.
Penny,"Oh, sorry. Yeah, youêre right. Doy. So, Howard, trolls, yay or nay?"
Howard,Isnêt there somewhere else you can be?
Penny,Not where I can hear you guys.
Howard,"Okay, fine. Iêll admit, there are dark, sordid little corners of the Internet where the name Wolowizard is whispered in hushed tones. But the only reason I go there, the only reason Iêve ever gone there is because I donêt have a real woman in my life. You happy?"
Penny,"Yeah, thatêll hold me for a while."
Bernadette,"Howard, you did have a real woman. I was right there in the next room while you were clicking that trollês brains out."
Howard,"Yeah, but we werenêt, I-I mean, you and I neverÑ"
Bernadette,Had sex?
Bernadette,"Well, whose fault was that?"
Penny,Complimentary nachos! You enjoy. Never had sex? Wow.
Howard,"What do you mean, whose fault was that?"
Bernadette,"Well, we couldêve been having sex, but you never made the move."
Howard,I didnêt think you wanted me to make the move.
Bernadette,"Howard, a girl doesnêt go out with a man like you, with your looks, your fancy patter and your tight hoochie pants if sheês not expecting him to eventually make the move."
Howard,Son of a bitch.
Penny,"Hey, this is a little awkward, but my manager says I canêt actually give nachos away. So, just take that when youêre ready."
Howard,"Yeah, we had a really great talk, and weêre gonna start seeing each other again."
Leonard,"Oh, congratulations. Have you broken it to the troll yet?"
Howard,Did Penny tell you about that?
Leonard,Steve Patterson told me.
Howard,The greasy old fat guy in Facilities Management?
Howard,Howêd he know about it?
Leonard,Heês Glissinda the troll.
Raj,"Sorry, dude, the thermostatês on my side of the room, so it stays Mumbai hot in here until you turn off that stupid Indian music!"
Sheldon,Iêll turn off the music when you get rid of that salmonella-ridden parakeet!
Raj,"Oh, too bad! Sheldonês pathologically afraid of birds! Hey, look, Sheldon! Birdie, birdie, birdie!"
Sheldon,Thatês it! Prepare for marshmallow death!
Leonard,"So anyway, thatês great news about you and Bernadette."
Howard,Yeah. I think Iêm gonna take her to miniature golf.
Leonard,"Ah. Well, I guess for you guys thatês like regular golf."
Howard,"Short jokes? Really? Youêre, like, a quarter of an inch taller than me."
Leonard,"Yeah, and donêt you forget it."
Howard,I had a good time.
Bernadette,"Me, too."
Bernadette,Mm! What are you doing?
Howard,"You said, well, the move, remember?"
Bernadette,"Oh, not now. Weêre starting a new relationship. I need to get to know you again."
Howard,"No, you donêt. Itês me. The lusty charmer with the fancy patter and the hoochie pants."
Bernadette,"Be patient, weêll get there."
Leonard,"Oh, God, whatês that smell? . Oh-ho-hoo!"
Leonard,What are you doing in there?
Sheldon,Iêm making hydrogen sulphide and ammonia gas. Just a little experiment in pest control.
Raj,"Itês not gonna work, dude, I grew up in India, an entire subcontinent where cows walk in the street, and nobody has ever had a solid bowel movement."
Sheldon,"Well, weêll just see how long you can hold out."
Raj,"Well, weêll just see how your noxious gas fares against my cinnamon-apple-scented aroma therapy candles."
Leonard,Didnêt you say youêre making hydrogen sulphide gas?
Leonard,Isnêt that flammable?
Sheldon,"Highly. Oh, dear. "
Raj,This is not over.
Leonard,"All Iêm saying is, if they took all the money they spent trying to make a decent Hulk movie, they could probably just make an actual Hulk."
Sheldon,That is apt and amusing. I think I shall share that with Amy Farrah Fowler. Sheêll appreciate the witticism.
Leonard,Thank you.
Sheldon,Itêll also help improve her initial impression of you.
Leonard,So whatês going on with you two?
Sheldon,"Well, the status is as it always was. Sheês a girl. Sheês a friend. She is not my, please forgive me for doing this, girlfriend."
Leonard,"Right, right. So youêre still just texting and emailing? You donêt feel any need to hang out with her, you know, be in the same room?"
Sheldon,"Leonard, you are my best friend. Iêve known you for seven years, and I can barely tolerate sitting on the couch with you. Imagine my attitude regarding prolonged physical proximity to Amy Farrah Fowler."
Leonard,Got it.
Sheldon,I sense judgment on your part.
Leonard,"No, no. Maybe a little."
Sheldon,May I suggest that your criticism is based on jealousy.
Leonard,Jealousy? What do I have to be jealous of?
Sheldon,I have a functioning and satisfying relationship with a female. You have none.
Leonard,"Oh, right. That."
Sheldon,"Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster, not unlike the Hulk, who, by the way, also has a girlfriend. In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly, whom you may recall as the girlfriend of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, a feel-good romp if there ever was one."
Leonard,Iêm not jealous.
Sheldon,Hu-u-urgh! Leonard not jealous.
Sheldon,"You know, it just occurred to me, if there are an infinite number of parallel universes, in one of them, thereês probably a Sheldon who doesnêt believe parallel universes exist."
Leonard,Probably. Whatês your point?
Sheldon,"No point. Itês just one of the things that makes one of the mes chuckle. What makes you chuckle, Leonard?"
Leonard,"Hmm, recently? Not much."
Sheldon,"Is it because of the conflict that arises from your desperate need to pair-bond with a woman, and the apparent collective decision of all womankind to deny you that opportunity?"
Leonard,"Um, shut up."
Sheldon,"You know, when my grandfather died, and Meemaw was alone, my mom arranged for her to visit a centre three times a week where she could socialize with other lonely people. Itês very nice. They discuss current events, play bridge, get a hot meal."
Leonard,That sounds lovely.
Sheldon,"It is if you like bridge. Do you like bridge, Leonard?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, Iêm just not dating someone right now. I donêt need to go to a senior centre."
Sheldon,"Meemaw resisted at first, but now she loves it."
Leonard,"Fine. If I donêt meet someone soon, you can put me in a home."
Sheldon,Itês not a home. Itês a senior centre.  Weêd never put Meemaw in a home!
Leonard,"Hey, guys."
Sheldon,"All right, Iêll bow to social pressure. Hey!"
Howard,"Excuse me. Thatês my girlfriend, Bernadette. I assigned her her own ringtone, Bernadette by The Four Tops. Hello, Bernadette."
Raj,"When I call him, his phone plays Brown Eyed Girl. Which, now that I think about it, is not so good."
Leonard,"You realize heês just rubbing our noses in the fact that he has a girlfriend, and we donêt."
Leonard,You have a girlfriend? How could you have a girlfriend? You canêt even speak to women.
Raj,"Two words, deaf chick. It doesnêt matter if I canêt talk, because she canêt hear me."
Raj,Thatês what she said.
Leonard,"Great. You have a girlfriend, Howardês got a girlfriend, Sheldonês got a girlÑ"
Sheldon,"No, no, no, no!"
Leonard,Ñwhoês a friend.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Leonard,"What about you, Stuart? You have a girlfriend yet?"
Leonard,"Oh. Well, good for you."
Leonard,Why donêt you just break up with her?
Leonard,Why not?
Raj,"Dude, why donêt you just invoke your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?"
Leonard,Because I donêt need his girlfriend to set me up with one of her girlfriends. Iêm perfectly capable of finding a girl on my own.
Raj,"Oh, Leonard, you remind me of the funny old story about a man who walks into a womenês correctional institution with a stack of paperwork that will allow the female convicts to go free."
Leonard,Youêre saying I couldnêt get laid in a womenês prison with a handful of pardons.
Raj,Are you going to let me tell the story or not?
Sheldon,Leonard? Are you sleeping?
Sheldon,Are you ill?
Sheldon,"Are you still depressed because youêre alone, and no one loves you?"
Leonard,I donêt know. Maybe.
Sheldon,I want you to know that Iêm genuinely concerned about your well-being.
Leonard,Thank you.
Sheldon,Youêre welcome. But itês still no reason to have your feet in my spot.
Amy,May I offer an observation?
Leonard,What the hell? How long has she been here?
Sheldon,Since we got home from the comic bookstore.
Leonard,That was two hours ago.
Sheldon,"As per your suggestion, weêre hanging out. Quite frankly, I donêt see what all the hooplaês about. Go on, Amy."
Amy,"From a neurobiological standpoint, Leonard, you may be alone because your psychological state is causing an actual pheromone-based stink of desperation."
Sheldon,"Did you know that, Leonard?"
Sheldon,I did.
Amy,I understand that some people find mates in social gathering places such as bars or taverns. Have you tried a bar or tavern?
Leonard,"No, Iêm not gonna try to pick up a woman in a bar."
Sheldon,"Wise decision. You see, Amy, success at a bar is based on classic male attributes such as height, strength, attractiveness, the ability to hold oneês liquor and throw darts, separately or together. Leonard has none of these attributes, right, Leonard?"
Amy,"Thatês not true of all bars. Juice bars, for example."
Sheldon,"Oh! Good point, Amy. Yeah, building on your premise, Leonard could frequent sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars, the Apple Genius Bar, what are you doing?"
Leonard,Keep going. Iêm listening.
Amy,That was rude.
Sheldon,He does it all the time. Heês a cornucopia of social awkwardness.
Amy,Cornucopia. What a mellifluous word.
Sheldon,Letês make that our word of the day.
Amy,Agreed. And weêll use mellifluous tomorrow.
Sheldon,"Well, I have to void my bladder. It was nice spending this time with you."
Amy,Wait. I have a request.
Amy,Iêd like you to meet my mother.
Sheldon,I see. Can I get back to you on that?
Amy,Certainly. Good night.
Sheldon,"Good night.  Leonard, Leonard, Leonard,"
Leonard,"Yeah, what?"
Sheldon,Amy Farrah Fowler has asked me to meet her mother.
Leonard,Yeah. So?
Sheldon,What does that mean?
Leonard,"Well, you know how youêre always saying that Amy is a girl whoês your friend, and not your girlfriend?"
Leonard,You canêt say that anymore.
Sheldon,Wait. What?
Leonard,"Look, she obviously wants to take your relationship to the next level."
Sheldon,I donêt want the next level. I like this level. Fix it for me!
Leonard,"Me? Well, how am I supposed to fix it?"
Sheldon,"Simple! You want a girlfriend, Amy wants to be someoneês girlfriend. Take her off my hands. I give you my blessing."
Leonard,That is insane.
Sheldon,Youêre right. It would never work. Amy finds you tedious.
Leonard,"Okay, good luck."
Sheldon,Wait! What am I supposed to do?
Leonard,"Well, have you considered telling her how you feel?"
Sheldon,"Leonard, Iêm a physicist, not a hippie."
Leonard,"All right, well, let me see if I can explain your situation using physics. What would you be if you were attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis?"
Leonard,There you go.
Sheldon,Amyês right. He is tedious.
Howard,Why canêt you get it?
Howard,"Oh, hey. I hope you didnêt hear that."
Leonard,The volcano thing? No.
Howard,Whatês with the T-shirt? You working at the Apple store now?
Leonard,"No, itês just something I threw on."
Howard,"I know all your shirts. Thatês not one of them. You were pretending to work at the Genius Bar to pick up women, werenêt you?"
Leonard,"Yeah. Turns out, they guard the iPods, but they donêt guard the shirts."
Howard,"So, howêd it go?"
Leonard,"It was going well. I was showing this super hot girl how to boot up in Safe Mode. The manager got suspicious, and, well, long story short, they really do have a little jail in the mall."
Howard,"Just FYI, donêt try to go back with a fake moustache. I mean, they may not really be geniuses, but they see right through that."
Leonard,"I want to invoke the girlfriend pact, Howard."
Howard,You that desperate?
Leonard,"No, I just, I want what you have. You know, I want a woman in my life."
Leonard,"To be clear, I meant like Bernadette, not your mother."
Howard,"Yeah, I know what you mean."
Leonard,"Well, Iêm off to meet Bernadetteês friend. How do I look?"
Sheldon,"As if one of the plants from Invasion of the Body Snatchers duplicated you in every way, only with an absurd amount of hair gel."
Leonard,What are you working on?
Sheldon,Iêm removing my digital footprint from the Internet so Amy Farrah Fowler canêt find me and compel me to meet her mother.
Leonard,"Ah, youêre going off the grid."
Leonard,The old Unabomber approach. Kudos.
Sheldon,Thank you. Iêve also sent Amy a relationship termination notice and changed my cell phone number and e-mail address.
Leonard,What if she just comes over?
Sheldon,Sheêll get lost. We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles. We now live at 311 Los Robles.
Leonard,You changed the address on the building? What about mail?
Sheldon,"Oh, no worries, I explained my predicament to our letter carrier. He was sympathetic. His exact words were, Got your back, Jack. Bitches be crazy."
Leonard,Who is it?
Amy,Amy Farrah Fowler.
Sheldon,Darn! She found me!
Leonard,Sheês been here before.
Sheldon,"The only flaw in an otherwise perfect plan. Now, get my back, Jack."
Leonard,What do you want to do?
Sheldon,Tell her Iêm not here.
Leonard,"Okay, where are you?"
Sheldon,"I donêt know. Youêll have to devise a scenario that plausibly explains my absence, keeping in mind that the key to a good lie lies in the details."
Leonard,"Hi, Amy. Sheldonês not here."
Amy,All right. 
Sheldon,Way to go on the details.
Leonard,"Thanks again for doing this, Bernadette."
Bernadette,"Oh, I take pacts very seriously. One time at my lab, a petri dish of genetically modified super-virus went missing. That day we made a pinky swear never to admit we crossed Ebola with the common cold."
Howard,Why the hell would you cross Ebola with the common cold?
Bernadette,"We never did. That would be a terrible, terrible thing."
Bernadette,"Joy, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is Joy."
Leonard,"Yeah. So, Bernadette tells me she knows you from self-defence classes?"
Leonard,Wow. Wouldnêt think thereêd be that many.
Bernadette,Isnêt she a pip?
Leonard,"Should be, itês thirty dollars a pound."
Leonard,"Yep, it is."
Bernadette,Iêll go with you.
Howard,I think she likes you.
Sheldon,"EZ Aquarii B, EZ Aquarii C, excuse me, madam."
Amy,I believe a misunderstanding may have occurred when I asked you to meet my mother.
Sheldon,"No misunderstanding. Iêve learned what that request actually means, and I donêt want to be joined to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis."
Amy,In what way are you screwed? All I want to do is present you as my boyfriend to my mother so sheêll be satisfied that Iêm in a relationship.
Sheldon,So weêd be perpetrating a ruse?
Sheldon,And you havenêt fallen hopelessly in love with me?
Amy,Donêt be absurd. I find the notion of romantic love to be an unnecessary cultural construct that adds no value to human relationships.
Sheldon,"Amy Farrah Fowler, thatês the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me."
Amy,I trust this clarification allows us to return to boy-slash-friend-slash-girl-slash-friend status.
Sheldon,Of course. Would you like to join me for Chinese food?
Amy,"Sheldon, please, youêre suffocating me."
Sheldon,"My apologies. Good night, Amy."
Amy,"Good night, Sheldon."
Howard,"Come on, just give her a chance. Maybe sheêll grow on you."
Leonard,"Or maybe sheêll finally succeed in ripping my nuts off. There are still 93 ways she hasnêt tried yet. Look, Howard, I appreciate the effort, but this is, like, the worst date of my life."
Howard,"Seriously? I was once robbed by a pre-op transsexual I met on J-Date, and that didnêt even crack my top ten."
Leonard,"I guess the difference is, I have some self-respect."
Howard,Not that Iêve ever seen.
Leonard,Itês relatively new. I just know that Iêm not gonna spend time with someone I donêt like simply to have a girlfriend. Iêm okay on my own.
Leonard,"Look, uh, Joy, it was nice to meet you, butÑ"
Leonard,Youêre asking me out?
Leonard,I look forward to it.
Sheldon,I assure you I am quite real and Iêm having regular intercourse with your daughter.
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. Weêre like wild animals in heat. Itês a wonder neither of us has been hurt."
Amy,"You wanted me to have a boyfriend, Mother. Well, here he is. Have to sign off now. My hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, itês time for me to make love to your daughterês vagina."
Amy,"Thank you, Sheldon, that went very well."
Sheldon,"Agreed. Amy, I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in coitus at least one time in our relationship. Bazinga. Bedtime. Please show yourself out."
Howard,This is the worst cobbler Iêve ever eaten. I mean it tastes like it was made of actual ground-up shoemaker.
Sheldon,Amusing. A play on the two meanings of cobbler.
Raj,"Hey guys, guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya."
Sheldon,"Excuse me. I object. You propose a guessing game, yet you donêt give me enough time to guess. For the record, I was going to say your sister Priya."
Sheldon,Why would I change?
Leonard,"The hope has been that youêd eventually bend to public opinion. So, Priya, what brings you back to LA?"
Raj,Can you believe it? Little Priyaês one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.
Sheldon,"Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, itês actually extremely plausible."
Leonard,And your poll numbers just keep dropping.
Leonard,"Iêm going too, Iêll show you where it is."
Raj,"Alright, this goes without saying, but Iêm just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister."
Sheldon,"Why would I touch her, sheês covered with airplane germs."
Raj,Iêm so not talking to you. Iêm talking to him.
Howard,"Hey, Iêve got a girlfriend now."
Raj,Oh please. My sisterês much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.
Howard,Letês just agree theyêre both hot.
Raj,"Dude, thatês my sister youêre talking about."
Howard,"Okay, forget whoês hotter. The first time Priya came to LA, Leonard and I made a pact out of respect to our friendship, and to you, that neither of us would hit on her."
Raj,Did you pinky swear?
Raj,Okay then.
Sheldon,Cobbler. Iêm still laughing.
Leonard,Yeah. Itês good to see you too. Here you go.
Leonard,Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.  Okay.
Howard,"So, you got any special plans with your sister?"
Raj,"Oh, not really, just hang out."
Sheldon,"I always tell people, if you have only one day in Los Angeles, make it a train day."
Raj,Train day?
Sheldon,"The fun starts with brunch at Carneyês in Studio City, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop, Travel Town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Finally, weêre off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for dinner at, thatês right, the Hollywood Carneyês, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car."
Raj,I donêt think weêre going to do that.
Sheldon,"Well then apparently, you hate fun."
Leonard,"Hmm, Priyaês not back yet? Well, I guess thatês not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?"
Raj,"Uh, my plans with Priya."
Sheldon,He rejected train day.
Leonard,Did you make it clear that itês two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?
Leonard,I guess he just hates fun.
Sheldon,Thatês what I said.
Howard,I have a girlfriend now.
Howard,"Yeah, I just wanna put it out there in case I inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction. Happy? . "
Leonard,"So, uh, Priya, what are your plans while youêre here."
Sheldon,Do you like trains?
Sheldon,You might as well just wait at the airport for your flight.
Sheldon,"You are in a forest. There is quicksand to the west, a path leads to the east. Go east. An iron gate blocks your way. Open gate. Itês locked. Hmm, well, so much for that."
Leonard,"Itês getting pretty late, how come youêre still up?"
Sheldon,Iêve found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.
Leonard,Thatês pretty cool.
Sheldon,"Oh yes. It runs on the worldês most powerful graphics chip, imagination."
Leonard,Youêve really got to get out more.
Sheldon,"Go north. You canêt go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. With what? With sword.  You donêt have the sword. Good golly, itês as if itês actually happening to me."
Leonard,"Yeah, well,  Sheldonês still up."
Leonard,"Yeah, he does but he got caught up in a computer game andÑ"
Sheldon,"Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Oh my, this is one tough troll."
Leonard,"If the past is any indication, no."
Sheldon,"Leonard, Iêm trapped in quicksand, the axe is dragging me down."
Leonard,Drop axe.
Sheldon,Drop axe. Brilliant.
Leonard,"Give me a minute. Sheldon,"
Sheldon,"Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket, so I can carry the mud past the dragon."
Leonard,"Sheldon, you need to work in the morning."
Sheldon,I know.
Leonard,"Well then, bed mister."
Sheldon,Five more minutes.
Leonard,Really? Youêre going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.
Sheldon,Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.
Leonard,"You donêt want that, do you?"
Sheldon,But itês a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated. Who was at the door?
Leonard,"Oh, uh, building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two."
Sheldon,Thatês unacceptable. Weêre supposed to be given written notice.
Leonard,"No, no, it doesnêt matter, weêll be at work."
Sheldon,"Well, what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change, only to find thereês no water for an enzyme soak."
Leonard,"Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!"
Sheldon,Iêll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.
Leonard,Weêre going to have to be very quiet.
Sheldon,"I know how to get the bucket! I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it. Letês see. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Oh dear, I believe Iêm lost. Well, Iêll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow."
Leonard,"No, no, no, no, no. You just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. Come on, Iêll help you. So, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?"
Leonard,"Youêre right, youêre lost, good luck."
Leonard,Huh! Sorry!
Leonard,"I donêt know. When Iêm in bed with a girl, itês just, itês my go to response."
Leonard,"Oh, right, sure. I wish you could stay in LA a while longer."
Leonard,"You know, I was thinking, there are some great research facilities in India."
Leonard,"Well, Iêm just saying, I donêt have any real ties here, so if I were to move to New Delhi we could, you know, go out."
Leonard,"Well, yes, but, things have changed, you know, youêre older, Iêm older. Look, no more superhero bedsheets."
Leonard,It doesnêt?
Leonard,Iêm not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know thatês not the right kind of Indian but it is something.
Sheldon, Leonard.
Sheldon,I heard a woman laughing.
Leonard,"Oh, uh, yeah, I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman."
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, good job, quite convincing. I smell perfume."
Leonard,Air freshener.
Sheldon,And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.
Leonard,"Uh, rash, thatês a bad rash."
Sheldon,My sympathies. I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great."
Sheldon,"Very well, Iêm sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch."
Leonard,"Okay, heês in the bathroom, letês go."
Sheldon,Do you prefer ointment or cream?
Leonard,"Uh, cream."
Sheldon,With or without a numbing agent?
Sheldon,"Really? Leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis."
Leonard,Fine. With.
Sheldon,Prescription or non-prescription strength.
Leonard,Use your best judgement.
Sheldon,"Well, I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC. Itês usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids, but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts."
Leonard,Sounds great.
Sheldon,Excellent choice.
Sheldon,"For shame, Leonard. For shame. And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you."
Leonard,"Making pretty good time, huh?"
Sheldon,"Is that really what you want to talk about, Leonard?"
Sheldon,What do you want to talk about?
Leonard,Please donêt tell anyone I spent the night with Rajês sister.
Sheldon,There it is. What if someone asks?
Leonard,No-oneês going to ask if I spent the night with Rajês sister.
Sheldon,Perhaps. But they might ask me something else.
Leonard,Like what?
Sheldon,"Like, has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?"
Leonard,Priya and I are both adults. We didnêt betray Raj.
Sheldon,"In fact, you did, but I was referring to Howard."
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Sheldon,"April 12th, 2005, Bobês Big Boy, Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bobês Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship, you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt."
Leonard,"Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard."
Sheldon,And Raj.
Leonard,"Alright, and Raj."
Sheldon,And me.
Sheldon,"Violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause."
Leonard,"Okay fine, Iêm, Iêm a horrible human being, Iêm the Darth Vader of Pasadena."
Sheldon,Youêre far too short to be Darth Vader. At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.
Leonard,"My point is, Priyaês gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this."
Sheldon,"You mean, you want me to keep a secret."
Sheldon,You know I canêt keep a secret.
Leonard,"You can if you try. Think about it this way, if I were Batman and you were Alfred, youêd keep that secret. Right?"
Sheldon,Why do you get to be Batman?
Leonard,"Because, well, Batman has the secret."
Sheldon,Well Alfred has secrets too.
Leonard,Like what?
Sheldon,"Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Which Iêve now just told to Batman. See, I canêt keep a secret."
Sheldon,Ta-da. Itês short for da-da-da-da!
Leonard,"Kind of busy here, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"I know, thatês why I shortened it."
Leonard,What do you want.
Sheldon,I came to go over your alibi for last night.
Leonard,What alibi?
Sheldon,"Youêve asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so Iêve provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldnêt have spent last night with Priya, because you were with another woman."
Leonard,"Oh, Iêm so sure Iêm going to regret this, but, who was I with?"
Sheldon,"The fun loving, and morally loose, Miss Maggie McGeary."
Leonard,"Oh, God."
Sheldon,"You met her at Pasadenaês most popular Irish watering hole, Lucky Baldwinês, where Maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams."
Leonard,"Leonard, call me if youêre interested in coitus. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary."
Sheldon,And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.
Sheldon,"Itês pretty convincing, huh? And it wasnêt even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggieês flaming auburn hair."
Leonard,Where did you get that?
Sheldon,From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.
Leonard,An orang-u-tan?
Sheldon,"Well, no-oneês going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard, honestly you over-think everything."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I donêt need an alibi. Nobodyês going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip.  Thankyou. Now donêt worry, everything is going to be fine. (Sheldon writes _I doubt itî on Leonardês whiteboard."
Raj,"Hey, Leonard, will you please tell Howard my sisterês never been attracted to him."
Leonard,"Cêmon Raj, how am I supposed to know who sheês attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future."
Sheldon,"And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priyaês preferences in male companionship. And with that, I will re-zip my lip."
Raj,"Hey, so what did you guys think of the new episode of Caprica last night?"
Leonard,I didnêt see it.
Howard,Didnêt see it? What were you doing?
Leonard,"Uh, I was out."
Raj,On Caprica night?
Leonard,"Yeah, I, uh, went for a drink."
Howard,"Really, you, and where, where did you go?"
Leonard,"To, uh, Lucky Baldwinês."
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêve heard of that place, isnêt that Pasadenaês favourite Irish watering hole."
Sheldon,"Did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?"
Leonard,As a matter of fact I.. IÑ I canêtÑ I canêtÑ I canêt do it.
Sheldon,"Sure you can, youêre doing fine, itês very believable."
Leonard,"Look, Iêm sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night."
Sheldon,"Donêt listen to him, heês still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system."
Raj,What were you doing with Priya?
Sheldon,"I believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?"
Raj,You slept with my sister?
Howard,How could you? We had a pact!
Raj,"Excuse me, I think how could you sheês my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!"
Sheldon,"May I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying Maggie McGeary, she sounds lovely."
Leonard,"Look, I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman. To her, Iêm a forbidden piece of white chocolate."
Raj,"IÑ I donêt believe it, this is a terrible betrayal of my trust."
Leonard,"No, no, no, would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it."
Raj,How hard did she stomp?
Leonard,Very hard.
Raj,"Okay, Iêm good."
Howard,"Yeah, well, Raj, I just want to say that Iêd never betray your trust. Unlike Leonard, I respect you."
Leonard,Was it out of respect that you didnêt tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?
Raj,Dude! I put that thing on my face!
Sheldon,I think a more amusing violation of Rajês trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.
Howard,"Hey, I didnêt see you giving back your Snoopy snowcone maker."
Raj,That was all a lie? This yearês gifts are already wrapped!
Howard,"And as long as weêre talking about betraying our friends, how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonardês food."
Sheldon,"Well, excuse me. That was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy."
Leonard,You put moths in my food?
Sheldon,For science.
Raj,I canêt believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.
Leonard,"Well, uh, I canêt believe you used Sheldonês toothbrush."
Sheldon,You used my toothbrush?
Raj,"Not the brush part, just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums."
Leonard,"Okay, I, I, I think itês safe to say that weêve all done some things weêre not particularly proud of. But come on, weêre friends. Friends overlook each otherês minor lapses. For the record, Howard, Iêm sorry that I broke our pact."
Howard,"Thankyou, and Iêm sorry about your phone. And Thanksgiving. And while weêre at it, you donêt have to wash our clothes on the fourth of July."
Raj,"As long as weêre apologising, Sheldon, I, Iêm sorry I used your toothbrush."
Sheldon,And Iêm sorry. But that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated. We are no longer friends.
Raj,I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.
Sheldon,With real puffing smoke?
Sheldon,Alright. But Iêm watching you.
Leonard,"Hey, you got Snoopy out. Can I have a snowcone?"
Sheldon,"Well, sure."
Leonard,"These are pretty god, what flavour is this?"
Sheldon,Youêre so close.
Leonard,I give up.
Sheldon,"Mango, caterpillar. What are you doing? You said you liked it!"
Leonard,"No, seriously, I think Iêve finally figured out my problem with women."
Sheldon,The capybara is the largest member of the rodent family.
Leonard,What does that have to do with me and women?
Sheldon,Nothing. It was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.
Leonard,"My problem is, I donêt project confidence. So I decided that the next time I meet a woman I think is attractive, rather than holding back and being cautious, Iêm going to assume the mantle of self-assurance."
Raj,"Oh, yeah? Whatês that look like?"
Leonard,"Hi. Iêm Leonard. And you are beautiful. You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. Iêm going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget."
Raj,Where are we going?
Howard,Good news. I made it onto the team for the new Defence Department laser-equipped surveillance satellite.
Sheldon,"Excuse me. If weêre changing topics, I believe I have first dibs with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo."
Leonard,Congratulations Howard.
Howard,"Thanks. Listen, I have to get a security clearance, so you guys might be hearing from the FBI."
Raj,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! I donêt want to speak to the FBI."
Leonard,Why not?
Raj,Iêm brown and I talk funny.
Howard,Theyêre just doing a background check on me.
Raj,"It doesnêt matter. Theyêll find a reason to give me a one-way ticket back to Gandhi-ville. By the way, when I say that, itês not offensive."
Leonard,"Donêt be ridiculous, Raj. Youêre here legally."
Raj,Nobody cares. Do you know how long itês been since I got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy?
Sheldon,"You know, I try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative, but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn."
Leonard,"Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents."
Sheldon,"No, you squandered your time with me, and the moment has now passed. Feast on your disappointment, much as the capybara feasts on its own waste."
Raj,"Oh, Bella, donêt you see? Edwardês only pushing you away because he loves you.  Coming."
Raj,Rum cake?
Raj,Seven years.
Raj,"Iêm in this country legally, you know."
Raj,"Of course not. Iêm here on an H-1B visa, which means I canêt be associated in any way with crime or criminal activity. And Iêm not."
Raj,"No, just me. Oh, there it is. Here comes a cavity search."
Raj,"Please donêt send me back to India, itês so crowded. Itês like the whole country is one endless Comic-Con, except everybodyês wearing the same costume, Indian Guy."
Raj,"I love this country! The-the baseball, the freedom, the rampant morbid obesity! From California to the New York Island, Iêm a real Yankee Doodle boy!"
Raj,"My country êtis of thee, duh duh duh liberty, Itês really great."
Leonard,"So, when Howard said the FBI would be contacting me, I was expecting Mulder. Glad to see I got Scully."
Leonard,"Mulder and Scully. X-Files. The truth is out there. Never mind. Uh, so, what would you like to know?"
Leonard,"Yes. Of course, weêre in different departments. Heês an engineer and Iêm an experimental physicist. You know, one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says, Hello, maker of the universe, I see what you did there. Good one."
Leonard,"Good. Itês a good relationship. Of course, most of my relationships are good. Probably because I exude confidence. People are drawn to that, you know? Confidence, not exuding."
Leonard,"You are beautiful, you know that? You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. Iêm going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget."
Leonard,"Is that, oh, my, I didnêt see the ring with my glasses off, so, look at that, Iêm starting to exude."
Leonard,Want to get that?
Sheldon,Not particularly.
Leonard,Could you get that?
Sheldon,I suppose I could if I were asked.
Leonard,Would you please get that?
Sheldon,Of course. Why do you have to make things so complicated?
Sheldon,"You say youêre Special Agent Page, FBI."
Sheldon,And here is my Justice League membership card. But that doesnêt prove I know Batman.
Sheldon,Oh. All right. I doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved Oedipal complex.
Sheldon,"For the record, I truly support the FBI in the mission which is expressed through their motto?"
Sheldon,"Correct. Now to business. 18 years ago, I sent the FBI Crime Lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch for fingerprinting and DNA analysis. Why havenêt I heard back yet?"
Sheldon,Thatês of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes.
Sheldon,"A little, but go on."
Sheldon,"Iêm going to answer that with a visual aid. This is my nine-disc complete Lord of the Rings trilogy blu-ray set.  Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it, damaged plastic retention hub number three, and then returned it to me, hoping I wouldnêt notice. Would you characterize that as responsible?"
Sheldon,"You heard me say blu-ray, right?"
Sheldon,Very well. Would you be interested in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck onto my World of Warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level-80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor?
Sheldon,"Is there anything else? Where would you like to start? He refuses to pay fines when heês overdue with books I lend him. He crashed the Mars Rover while attempting to impress a woman. He recommended that I go see the third Matrix movie because it was, and I quote, just as good as the first one. If thatês not irresponsible, I donêt know what is."
Sheldon,Did I say Mars Rover?
Sheldon,"That was actually a poorly chosen example, as it had nothing to do with me."
Sheldon,I donêt want to. Not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of Howard Wolowitzês culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars.
Sheldon,"Oh, good. I was afraid you were going to fixate on that Mars Rover incident."
Howard,"Hey, buddies. Guess who didnêt get security clearance to work on the giant space laser?"
Leonard,What happened?
Howard,"Apparently, the background interviews didnêt go well. You guys wouldnêt know anything about that, would you?"
Raj,"Well, actually, I may have gotten a little tipsy when I talked to her."
Leonard,And I may have hit on her a little bit.
Raj,I may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes.
Howard,"I see. Well, itês good to know, when I need you guys, I can always count on you to step up and ruin everything."
Leonard,I feel awful.
Raj,"Ah, me, too."
Leonard,"To tell you the truth, I thought if anyone was going to screw things up for Howard, itêd be Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Well, your expectations have been subverted. Aha."
Leonard,What are you doing up?
Sheldon,"Sleep eludes me, Leonard."
Leonard,Really? Maybe sleep has met you before.
Sheldon,Mockery? Thatês all you have to offer?
Leonard,Iêm sorry. Why canêt you sleep?
Sheldon,Who knows? I havenêt watched any scary movies recently. Iêm no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe. And itês been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.
Leonard,Did something happen today thatês bothering you?
Sheldon,"Well, I did mention the Mars Rover incident to that FBI agent and probably cost Howard his security clearance."
Sheldon,But why should that keep me up?
Leonard,Because you feel guilty?
Sheldon,Interesting. So youêre saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.
Leonard,"Actually, you donêt have insomnia. Youêre sleeping now."
Sheldon,Excuse me?
Leonard,Youêre having a guilt-ridden dream.
Sheldon,Do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis?
Leonard,How about that Gorn sitting on the couch?
Sheldon,"That seems fairly conclusive.  No, Gorn, no. Thatês where I sit."
Sheldon,"Thank you for agreeing to see me, Agent Page."
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. I donêt recall you saying no backsies.
Sheldon,"Yes. Iêd like to offer a laudatory statement about Howardês many excellent qualities that I believe will tip the scales back in his favour. Howard Joel Wolowitz. H is for honesty, of which he has much. Oês for outstanding, which he is such. Wês for witty, heês quick with a joke. Aês for artistic, his abilityÑ"
Sheldon,But I still have rd Joel Wolowitz left to go.
Sheldon,"I donêt understand why you people are picking on my friend, Howard, when there are much more serious security threats to pursue. For instance, when I first met Leonard, he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a North Korean spy, and not one agent ever investigated that."
Sheldon,"No, itês a different Leonard. Heês Chinese, red hair, six fingers. Good-bye."
Sheldon,Raj. Have you seen Howard?
Raj,"I think heês eating lunch. Uh, Sheldon, I want you to meet Neil deGrasse Tyson from the Hayden Planetarium in New York."
Sheldon,Iêm quite familiar with Dr. Tyson. Heês responsible for the demotion of Pluto from planetary status. I liked Pluto. Ergo I do not like you.
Sheldon,"If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, weêd all have a merry Christmas. Think about that, Dr. Tyson."
Raj,"Oh, yeah."
Sheldon,Howard. The person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me.
Sheldon,"Yes, but before you get upset, I want you to know I went to the FBI and retracted my statement."
Howard,And they were okay with that?
Sheldon,"If anything, I made it worse. In any case, I have been riddled with guilt, which is causing Gorn-infested REM sleep. So, Iêm here now to say Iêm sorry."
Howard,"Are you kidding me? Youêve set my career back at least two years, and you think you can make it right with Iêm sorry?"
Sheldon,"Yes. I followed the social protocol. I attempted to right the wrong, and when I failed to do so I delivered a heartfelt apology. Now you say apology accepted, and I will offer you a one-time-only high five."
Howard,Your apology is not accepted.
Sheldon,"Youêre tricking me. It really is, isnêt it?"
Howard,"Leave me alone, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Oh, shut up."
Penny,What are you doing here?
Sheldon,"I have troubles, Penny. Iêve come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep."
Penny,"You know, they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden."
Sheldon,I donêt like the Olive Garden. They treat me like family.
Penny,"Okay, Sheldon. What can I get you?"
Penny,Could you be a little more specific?
Sheldon,Ethyl alcohol. 40 millilitres.
Penny,"Iêm sorry, honey, I donêt know millilitres."
Sheldon,Ah. Blame President James _Jimmyî Carter. He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. He wonders why he was a one-term president.
Penny,Would you say thatês about 40 milliliters?
Sheldon,More or less.
Penny,"Great.  Now, where were we?"
Sheldon,"I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail. Fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics, thereês an app for that. Letês see. Harvey Wallbanger. Eh. Sex on the Beach. I hardly think so. Rob Roy, Silk Slipper, Mad Hatter. Ooh! Iêll have a Rosewater Ricky."
Penny,A what?
Sheldon,"Youêll need pitted, brandied cherries, gin, rosewater, angostura bitters and overproofed rum. Now, first, dust the cherries with sugar, then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters. Then ignite the rum, caramelÑ"
Penny,"Here you go, one Rosewater Ricky."
Sheldon,Thatês not how it looks in the picture.
Penny,"Oh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently. Why donêt you give it a try."
Sheldon,All right. To the metric system.  I canêt taste the cherries.
Penny,"All right. Sheldon, whatês on your mind?"
Sheldon,"I wronged Howard, and he wonêt accept my apology."
Penny,"Oh, right, that. Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey."
Sheldon,"Penny, you face failure on a daily basis. How do you cope?"
Penny,I drink.
Sheldon,"To drinking.  Nope. Oh, if only there were some way to force Howard to accept my apology so I could escape this miasma of guilt."
Penny,"You know, sometimes stuff just happens, and thereês nothing you can do about it. For example, Lisa Peterson hasnêt talked to me since the 11th grade, because no matter how much you apologize, you canêt go back and un-dry-hump someoneês boyfriend."
Sheldon,"I see. Youêre saying Iêm facing Starfleet Academyês unwinnable command scenario, the Kobayashi Maru."
Penny,Exactly. Sometimes you canêt win.
Sheldon,Captain Kirk won.
Penny,Kirk cheated.
Sheldon,Impressive that you know that. Itês hard to believe Iêm actually having this conversation with you.
Penny,Right there with you.
Sheldon,Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the simulator. Thatês it.
Sheldon,Iêll reprogram Howard.
Penny,"Sheldon, you canêt reprogram people."
Sheldon,"No, you canêt reprogram people. To James Tiberius Kirk. "
Sheldon,"Hello, all."
Sheldon,"Howard, youêre feeling better about me today, arenêt you?"
Howard,Not really.
Sheldon,"Yes, you are. Iêm using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns."
Howard,"Oh. Go away, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Thereês a nine ninety five e-book down the drain.
Raj,Whatês in the bag?
Sheldon,Itês for Howard.
Howard,"Oh. Sheldon, you canêt fix this with gifts."
Sheldon,"Nevertheless, Iêve hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not, I want you to have this."
Howard,Youêre giving me a couch cushion?
Sheldon,The cushion is merely symbolic. Iêm giving you my spot on the couch.
Howard,But you love that spot.
Sheldon,I love my mother. My feelings for my spot are much greater. It is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe. And now itês yours.
Raj,"Oh, my God, dude. Now you have to forgive him."
Howard,All right. Apology accepted.
Sheldon,High five. Not too hard. Thank you.
Raj,I havenêt cried like this since Toy Story 3.
Howard,"I got to tell you, Sheldon, I understand why you chose this spot. I mean, the temperature is good, but thereês no draft. I can see the television, but I can still talk toÑ"
Sheldon,I changed my mind. Get out of my spot.
Penny,How long?
Leonard,94 seconds.
Penny,"Okay, help me out here. How does an archaeology professor get that good with a whip?"
Howard,Maybe he took a class at the adult bookstore. Thatês how I learned.
Leonard,I canêt believe youêve never seen Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Penny,"And I canêt believe youêve never read Eat, Pray, Love."
Leonard,"When she comes out with Eat, Pray, Run Away From A Giant Boulder, Iêll read it."
Howard,"I donêt care if Eat, Pray, Love changed your life, Iêm not reading it."
Penny,"You know, I could totally rock a hat like that."
Sheldon,"Thatês the work of noted Hollywood costume designer Deborah Nadoolman. She also designed the iconic red and black jacket in Michael Jacksonês Thriller video, which Iêve never viewed in its entirety, as I find zombies dancing in choreographed synchronicity implausible. And also, itês really scary."
Leonard,Would someone please turn off the Sheldon commentary track?
Sheldon,Thereês no switch. Just listen and learn.
Howard,"Penny, if you think this is good, you should come with us Friday to see it on the big screen at the Colonial."
Penny,"Well, Iêm watching it now. Why would I want to see it again on Friday?"
Sheldon,Because the print theyêre showing on Friday has an additional 21 seconds of previously unseen footage.
Penny,21 seconds? Thatêll be like seeing a whole new movie!
Leonard,Exactly. They say it finally solves the submarine controversy.
Sheldon,"Did Leonard? Iêm no expert, but I believe what we just heard from Penny was sarcasm.  Oh, good. Iêm eight for 26 this month."
Penny,"Yeah, I think Iêll pass. But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds."
Leonard,"Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing, weêd still be together."
Penny,"Mm, yeah, no, we wouldnêt."
Howard,"Uh-huh. Iêm guessing 21 seconds had something to do with that, too."
Sheldon,"May I point out to you all that the screening is first come, first served?"
Leonard,"Relax, itês five oêclock. The movie doesnêt start till midnight."
Sheldon,"Another way of saying that is the movie starts at midnight, and itês already five oêclock. Letês go."
Howard,"You know, if we miss it, weêll have the fun of listening to Sheldon whine about it for the rest of our lives."
Sheldon,See? Howardês on my side.
Howard,"Actually, Iêm not. Iêm using sarcasm to mock you."
Sheldon,Drat. Now Iêm 8 for 27.
Leonard,"Donêt worry, Sheldon. Weêll be fine."
Sheldon,What happened to the Leonard Hofstadter who waited in line with me for 14 hours to see the midnight premiere of Star Trek: Nemesis?
Leonard,"Oh. Well, he waited in line for 14 hours, while you napped in a lawn chair, he got in a fight with a Klingon when he stepped out of line to pee and you wouldnêt wake up to vouch for him, and worst of all, he saw Star Trek: Nemesis."
Sheldon,But how were our seats?
Sheldon,"I rest my case. Amy, donêt you agree we should leave now and get in line?"
Amy,"Actually, as the newest member of your social group, I believe Iêll gain more acceptance by arbitrarily siding with your friends from time to time."
Amy,"Leonard, youêre right. We should enjoy our meal, arrive late, and risk winding up with terrible seats, assuming we get in at all."
Leonard,"Thank you, Amy."
Amy,See? Itês working.
Howard,Whoês there?
Howard,"Olive you, too."
Leonard,"Guys, thatês really starting to get old."
Leonard,Whoês there?
Howard,I have a girlfriend and you donêt.
Sheldon,"Wait, now, we donêt know that yet. He isnêt finished. I have a girlfriend and you donêt who?"
Howard,So. Are you sure you donêt want to come with us to Raiders?
Bernadette,"Oh, no. That movie has melting faces. It reminds me too much of the time I dropped that vial of flesh-eating bacteria into the Rhesus monkey lab. Besides, Penny and I are having a girlsê night tonight."
Amy,Girlsê night? What does that entail?
Bernadette,"Oh, you know, girls get together, hang out, share girl talk."
Amy,Iêm a girl.
Bernadette,"Oh. Well, maybe you can join us. Iêll ask Penny."
Amy,No need. Penny and I are very close.
Bernadette,You are?
Amy,"Yes. In fact, our menses are synchronized. Penny. Bernadette tells me youêre planning a girlsê night."
Amy,Iêm a girl.
Penny,"Oh. Um, it was, it was just going to be me and Bernadette. Besides, I thought you were going to the movies with Sheldon and the guys."
Amy,"Yes, but theyêre not girls. Iêm a girl."
Penny,"Yeah, no, no, I-I-I got that."
Amy,Whatês the dress code?
Penny,"Uh, just wear something comfortable."
Amy,All right. Iêll have to go shopping.
Leonard,Who‚s there?
Leonard,Hugh who?
Sheldon,Hugh people need to listen to me. Itês time to get in line for the movie. And thatês how you tell a knock-knock joke.
Sheldon,"Under normal circumstances Iêd say, I told you so. But as I have told you so with such vehemence and frequency already, the phrase has lost all meaning. Therefore, I will be replacing it with the phrase I informed you thusly."
Howard,Ooh. Canêt wait for that to start.
Sheldon,I informed you thusly.
Raj,Eight for 28.
Sheldon,This is where we could have been if we hadnêt stopped for dinner. This is where we could have been if Koothrappali hadnêt ordered dessert.
Raj,"Well I earned it, dude, I ate all my broccoli."
Sheldon,"And hereês where we are. The runts in a large litter, unlikely to ever reach the nourishing teats of Indiana Jones."
Leonard,So I guess itês a good thing we stopped for dinner.
Raj,"You know, guys, when facing disappointment, Eat, Pray, Love teaches us_"
Howard,"Oh, shut up."
Amy,"So anyway, to make a long story short, turns out I have an unusually firm cervix."
Penny,"You know Amy, when we say girl talk, it doesnêt just have to be about our lady parts."
Amy,Shame. ‚Cause I have a real zinger about my titled uterus.
Bernadette,"Penny, your nails look great."
Penny,"Oh, thanks. I found this place in Alhambra. Itês in a womanês basement. I think itês a front"
Amy,A colleague of mine did her graduate thesis on the fungus that grows on improperly sterilized manicure implements. Well donêt tell me thatês not girl talk.
Penny,So where should we go tonight? A bar? A club? A movie?
Bernadette,Or we could just stay here.
Amy,"Yes, and continue to bond. I have a feeling that after tonight, one of you will become my best friend forever. Or BFF, if you prefer. Which I donêt."
Penny,"All right, time to open Bachelor Number Two."
Bernadette,"Gee, I donêt know if I should drink more. I have to drive home, and Iêve got enough trouble seeing over the dashboard as it is."
Penny,Thatês okay. Y ou can just sleep here.
Amy,"Oh, good, a slumber party! Weêll do makeovers, initiate phony phone calls, and have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties!"
Penny,"Oh, gosh, Amy. I donêt know if I would call this an actual slumber party."
Amy,"Well, thatês disappointing. Iêve always wanted to be invited to a slumber party."
Bernadette,"Oh, you never were?"
Penny,Not even when you were a kid?
Amy,"Well, there was the time I had my tonsils out, and I shared a room with a little Vietnamese girl. She didnêt make it through the night, but up till then, it was kind of fun."
Penny,"Okay. Well, I guess weêre having a slumber party. Oh!"
Amy,Pillow fight!
Leonard,"Oh, I hope they let us in soon. Iêm tired of running to the gas station to use the bathroom. The guy makes me buy a Gatorade every time. Itês a vicious circle."
Howard,Too bad you donêt have a stadium pal like me.
Leonard,Whatês a stadium pal?
Howard,"Let me put it this way, takes care of the bathroom problem, and it keeps your calf warm."
Raj,"Hey, guys, bad news. I just did a quick calculation. Given the size of the theatre  and the length of this line, we might not get seats."
Sheldon,What did he say?
Leonard,"Nice going, Raj, just got him down for his nap."
Sheldon,We might not get seats?
Leonard,"Itês fine, itês fine. Go back to sleep."
Sheldon,"Oh, I informed you thusly. I so informed you thusly."
Leonard,"Howard, you talk to him. Howard? Youêre peeing, arenêt you?"
Sheldon,"Well, if it isnêt Wil Wheaton, the Jar Jar Binks of the Star Trek universe."
Sheldon,"Well, you-sa can go think that at the back of the line. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts."
Sheldon,Of what? Poorly executed beards?
Sheldon,"This is Indiana Jones, not Star Trek. There should be no value to his pseudo-celebrity here. And even at Star Trek conventions, they only let him in if he helps set up."
Leonard,"Calm down, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"I will not calm down. This affront to justice and decency cannot go unanswered. As Captain Jean-Luc Picard once said, the line must be drawn here! This far, no farther!"
Leonard,"Had to wake him up from his nap, didnêt you?"
Bernadette,You know what I really love about Howard? His chest hair.
Penny,Howard has a hairy chest?
Bernadette,"No, just the one. But itês really long."
Penny,"Okay, there you go, Sultry Sunrise Red. What do you think?"
Amy,My nails have never looked so pretty before. Get it off.
Raj,"Oh, oh, uh, looks like theyêre getting ready to let people in."
Sheldon,"Listen to what Mr. Wil Wheaton is tweeting. Best seats in house for Raiders screening. Suck on that, Sheldon Cooper."
Leonard,Why do you read his Twitter feed? You know itês only going to upset you.
Sheldon,"I believe in knowing my enemy, Leonard. Had Twitter existed at the time, would not General Custer have followed the tweets of Sitting Bull? Would not Lee have followed Grant? Would not Spy have followed Spy? I have more examples, but excuse me.  Hello. Well, this seems like an odd time to test my cell phone quality, but go on. Test phrases? All right. Imatote. Ulbu. Twad. All together? Iêm a total buttwad. Why are you laughing? Hello?"
Penny,"And that, girls, is how you make a phony phone call."
Amy,"Iêm not sure I grasp the full entertainment value, but all right. Next on Wikipediaês list of slumber party activities, Truth or Dare."
Penny,"Okay, itês your game. You go first."
Amy,"Hang on. Iêm familiarizing myself with the rules. Seems fairly straightforward. Bernadette, truth or dare?"
Amy,All right. To what temperature must you heat beef in order to kill the prion that causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy?
Amy,"Remember, you have to answer honestly."
Penny,"Wait. No, Amy, youêre supposed to ask her something personal or embarrassing."
Amy,Oh. All right. What is the circumference of your areolas?
Sheldon,"Munching on complimentary popcorn. Woot, woot. Oh, the gall. I hope his next tweet is popcorn lodged in trachea, choking to death, woot, woot."
Leonard,We really want to see this. Is there anything you can do?
Sheldon,This is nothing but a blatant abuse of power by a petty functionary. Explain to me why Wil Wheaton and his lackeys get in and we donêt.
Howard,I guess thatês that. Letês go home.
Sheldon,You know what? Iêm going back to I told you so. I told you so.
Raj,"We can still see something. Uh, the new Sandra Bullock movie is playing two blocks away. You know Sandy B always brings it."
Sheldon,"Look, a side door. Come on, Short Round."
Howard,I guess weêd better go after him.
Leonard,Short Round?
Raj,Indyês young sidekick from Temple of Doom.
Leonard,"Yeah, I know who it is, but why is it me?"
Raj,Youêre right. It should be a cuddly Asian boy. Like me.
Amy,"And Absolon hath kist hir nether yea, and Nicholas is scalded in the towte. This tale is doon, and God save al the rowte.î"
Penny,What the hell was that?
Amy,Bernadette dared me to tell a dirty story. The Millerês Tale by Chaucer is the dirtiest story I know. It would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks.
Bernadette,I thought it was pretty spicy. Especially the part where he kisses her nether yea.
Amy,"You might not like it as much if you knew what nether yea meant. Hint, if one cares about hygiene, one ought not be kissing it."
Bernadette,"Okay, my turn. Penny, truth or dare?"
Bernadette,Why are you still hanging out with Leonard so much even though you broke up with him?
Amy,"Oh, thatês an excellent question. For two people who claim to be no longer pair-bonded, you spend an inordinate amount of time in each otherês company."
Amy,I donêt believe the rules allow for an ex post facto option change.
Penny,"Okay, look, just because weêre not seeing each other anymore doesnêt mean we canêt be friends. I mean, Leonardês a great guy."
Amy,"Then, why did you terminate your relationship with him?"
Penny,"I donêt know. He got really serious, and I wasnêt ready for it."
Amy,"Interesting. How will you react if, in the future, you become ready for it, and Leonard is unavailable, because another woman has realized that he is, to use your words, a great guy?"
Penny,You can only ask one question.
Penny,"You know what, I donêt want to play anymore."
Amy,"Well, Iêm not sure how this is scored, but I believe we may have won."
Leonard,Sheldon? Sheldon?
Howard,"Where did he go?  Weêre looking for Sheldon, not Marmaduke."
Sheldon,You whistled?
Leonard,What is that?
Sheldon,"Raiders of the Lost Ark, with 21 additional seconds. If I canêt see it, no one else can see it."
Leonard,"Sheldon, this is crazy."
Sheldon,Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.
Leonard,Listen to me. You are over-tired. Youêre not thinking right. Put the movie back before we get into trouble.
Sheldon,"Trouble is my middle name, Leonard. Actually, itês Lee, but I prefer Trouble."
Sheldon,"Donêt worry, Wil Wheaton. I was just leaving.  Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!"
Howard,"Come on, Short Round."
Sheldon,"Da-da-da-da, da-da-da!"
Raj,"Come on, guys! Hurry up! Hurry up!"
Howard,Letês see you run with a bag of urine strapped to your leg.
Sheldon,Why is there never a pontoon plane when you need one?
Bernadette,Sheês been in there a long time.
Amy,"Clearly, losing Truth or Dare upset her. Perhaps we should try to take her mind off it with another popular slumber party activity."
Bernadette,"Ooh, like what?"
Amy,"Well, the Internet suggests that slumber party guests often engage in harmless experimentation with lesbianism."
Bernadette,Where exactly on the Internet have you been looking?
Penny,"Oh, hey, Amy. Look, Iêm sorry I got so upset. I just,whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa! What are you doing?"
Amy,Donêt worry. Iêll avoid the nether yea.
Bernadette,I might have gone with eating raw cookie dough.
Raj,You know whoês got to be the bravest person in the Marvel Universe? Whoever has to give She-Hulk a bikini wax.
Howard,"You want to talk brave, how about Captain Americaês undocumented Mexican gardener?"
Leonard,Heês not braver than whoever uses the bathroom after The Thing?
Sheldon,"As usual, youêre all wrong. The bravest person in the Marvel Universe is the doctor who gives Wolverine his prostate exam."
Howard,How about the guy who gets a prostate exam from Wolverine?
Sheldon,"Now you just being silly. Wolverineês never displayed the slightest interest in helping others prevent prostate cancer.  Hello. Yes, the elevatorês out of order youêll have to use the stairs. Of course you can. Pizza dates back to the 16th century, while the first elevator was not installed until 1852. That means that for over 300 years, people carried pizzas up stairs. Be part of that proud tradition."
Leonard,Iêll go get Penny while that guy spits on our food.
Raj,Do you think they gave Wolverine an Adamantium prostate?
Howard,Thatês a stupid question.
Raj,Weêre having a conversation about probing the heinies of superheroes. There are no stupid questions.
Leonard,"Oh, um, is Penny here?"
Leonard,"Okay, I think a bit of context here might help."
Penny,"Oh, hey, Leonard. I see you met my dad."
Leonard,"Oh, good. Context."
Penny,"Oh, gee, dad, Leonard canêt stay. He just dropped by to say hello. Thanks for stopping by, sweetie. Iêll see you later.  Bye."
Leonard,That was odd.
Sheldon,"Are you sure you have enough comics? Youêre going to be monitoring the telescope for 12 hours, and by my estimate, youêve only selected seven hours of reading material. Thatês even factoring in your difficulty in parsing American comic book idioms like Bamf and Snikt."
Raj,Is that racist? It feels racist.
Howard,"Donêt be oversensitive. Heês calling you illiterate, not your race."
Raj,"Oh, okay. Good. I donêt need more comics. Howardês gonna stop by, weêre gonna play intergalactic battleship and Indian Monopoly."
Sheldon,"I donêt care for novelty editions of Monopoly. I prefer the classics, regular and Klingon."
Howard,"Actually, Indian Monopolyês just like regular, except the moneyês in Rupees, instead of hotels you build call centers, and when you pick a chance card, you might die of dysentery. Just FYI, that was racist."
Leonard,Youêll never guess what just happened.
Sheldon,"You went out in the hallway, stumbled into an interdimensional portal which brought you 5,000 years into the future, where you took advantage of the advanced technology to build a time machine, and now youêre back to bring us all with you to the year 7010 where we are transported to work at the thinkatorium by telepathically controlled flying dolphins?"
Leonard,Penny kissed me.
Sheldon,"Well, who would ever guess that?"
Raj,what kind of a kiss?
Leonard,A big kiss. On the mouth.
Howard,Is it possible that she was going for your cheek and you moved and she accidentally got lip? That happens with me and my mom all the time.
Leonard,"She introduced me to her father, kissed me and then shut the door in my face."
Leonard,You think?
Howard,Yeah. This man is not my father. Iêm being held hostage. So Iêm going to do something insane in the hopes that youêll call 911.
Leonard,Penny kissing me is not insane. She used to kiss me all the time.
Sheldon,"Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. By that standard, Penny is cuckoo for cocoa puffs."
Leonard,"Iêm just saying, it felt like it may have meant something."
Howard,"Ah, this takes me back. Leonard obsessing about Penny. I mean, donêt get me wrong, I love your new stuff, but once in a while itês nice to hear the hits."
Raj,"Ooh, ooh! Do our babies will be smart and beautiful. That one always makes me laugh."
Leonard,Why do I bother talking to you people?
Sheldon,"If itêll make you feel better, we rarely listen."
Penny,"Hey, can I talk to you out here for a sec?"
Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
Sheldon,Iêm starting to think weêre never going to see that pizza.
Penny,So youêre probably wondering what that was all about.
Leonard,"uh, the kissing and everything? Nah, women do that to me all the time."
Penny,"Yeah, okay. The thing is, I kind of told my father we got back together again."
Leonard,Why?
Penny,"Well, youêre the first guy heês ever really approved of, you know? Youêre a scientist who went to college and you donêt have a neck tattoo or outstanding warrants or, or a baby."
Leonard,What kind of guys did you used to go out with?
Penny,"Just guys. Anyway, when I told him we split up, he was heartbroken, and he kept bugging me, howês Leonard? why canêt you get back together with Leonard? I bet Leonard never tipped a cow over on himself. So to get him off my back, I told him we worked things out."
Leonard,"Really? How, howêd we manage that?"
Leonard,"Well, did you apologize? Did you have to woo me?"
Penny,"Get over yourself. I whistled, you came running."
Leonard,"Yeah, no, I donêt think so."
Penny,"Okay, why are you arguing about this?"
Leonard,"Iêm just saying, if we fake got back together, thatês totally not how it fake happened."
Penny,"Oh, okay, whatever. Will you please just play along until my dad leaves?"
Leonard,"Hold on, you actually want me to deceive your father with some sort of sham play acting and kissing? Cause Iêm good with that."
Penny,"Come on, honey, not in front of my dad."
Leonard,See? He doesnêt mind.
Penny,"Oh, dad, thatês nice, but Leonard has to work. Right, Leonard?"
Leonard,"Uh, I do, I have to work. But Iêm gonna blow that off to spend the evening with my sweetie and her father, êcause, you know, just the kind of boyfriend I am."
Leonard,"Come here, you."
Howard,"How could that be a miss? C-6 was a hit, C-8 was a hit. Part of your starship has to be on C-7."
Raj,Not if it has a hole in the middle.
Howard,What kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle?
Raj,A Romulan battle bagel?
Howard,"Oh, great, you made it. Come on in. I invited her."
Bernadette,So whereês the telescope?
Howard,"Itês in Hawaii, but Raj controls it from here. Heês hoping to see Epsilon Eridani dim, which would be evidence of a planet orbiting it."
Bernadette,"So we just sit and stare at the screen, waiting for something to happen?"
Howard,"I did it with you when we rented The Notebook.  Yes, Gena Rowlands is a treasure. Youêd better open up that bottle of wine or Iêm gonna end up with swimmerês ear."
Raj,"Excuse me. I canêt be drinking, Iêm about to make an important scientific discovery here."
Howard,Galileo did his best work while drinking wine.
Raj,How do you know that?
Howard,"Well, he was Italian. Itês a reasonable assumption."
Raj,"Dude, can you even open your mouth without spewing a cultural stereotype?"
Howard,"Oh, I, Iêm sorry, Galileo drank diet sprite. Look, youêre my best friend, sheês my girlfriend, you should bond. You know, like you and my mom did."
Raj,Your mom creeps the hell out of me.
Howard,"Yes, but sheês stopped calling you slumdog millionaire."
Raj,I do appreciate that.
Bernadette,Here we go.
Howard,Well Iêd like to propose a toast. To science and friendship.
Bernadette,"Hold on. Wait. No, itês okay, go ahead."
Bernadette,"Oh, I was working with Penicillin-resistant gonorrhoea in the lab today and I was just trying to remember if I washed my hands."
Leonard,"Thanks for the steak, Wyatt."
Penny,"So not funny, dad."
Penny,"Oh, will you please let it go?"
Leonard,A lot of people are doing that.
Penny,"Oh, see?"
Penny,"Yeah, thatês great. Itês a funny story. Moving on."
Penny,"Curtis, and Iêm pretty sure he was joking."
Penny,"Yeah, okay, I think this ends the ex-boyfriend portion of our evening."
Leonard,"Thanks, Wyatt. Iêm a keeper."
Penny,"Oh, gee, dad, heêd love to, but Leonard has to work in the morning."
Leonard,Maybe I could go in a little late.
Penny,"No, no, no, you canêt. Your career is far too important."
Leonard,Donêt I know it.
Leonard,"Good night, Wyatt. Oh, good night, honey."
Penny,Good night.
Leonard,I love you.
Penny,"Love you, too."
Sheldon,"Oh, friggety-frak. Not this again."
Howard,"Three, four, five, pass go, get 2,000 Rupees, Six, seven, whoops. Canêt go any further. Thereês a sacred cow in my way."
Raj,"Bernadette, please tell your boyfriend to cool it with the cow jokes."
Bernadette,"It wonêt help. Once he finds a joke he likes, he sticks with it."
Raj,Yeah. Like his haircut material.
Bernadette,"Oh, right. Did you get your hair cut?"
Raj,I got them all cut.
Bernadette,Which is still so funny.
Raj,"And when you go to a Chinese restaurant, he always gets the same fortune in his fortune cookie."
Bernadette,"Right. Help, Iêm a prisoner in a Chinese fortune cookie factory."
Howard,"Okay, I think thatês enough about me."
Raj,"Heês right. Letês make fun of his mother. Howard, come rub my feet! My corns are killing me!"
Bernadette,"Howard, help me out of the tub! Iêm stuck again!"
Leonard,"Coming. Hey, lovebug."
Penny,Shut up. You know what Iêve been doing for the last hour?
Leonard,"Mm, dreamily doodling Mrs. Leonard Hofstadter in a notebook?"
Penny,Listening to my father go on and on about what a great guy you are.
Leonard,"You got to admit, I am, Iêm delightful."
Penny,Why are you making this so difficult?
Leonard,Itês not difficult for me. Iêm having fun.
Leonard,What do you want me to do? You started this. Do you want to go over and tell him weêre broken up?
Leonard,"Well, then, what do you want?"
Penny,I donêt know.
Leonard,Donêt you think thatês something you should have figured out before you stomped over here?
Sheldon,"Leonard, Penny, excellent. Iêd like to say Iêm very happy that youêre back together, and if I can figure out a way to do so and sound sincere, I will. In the meantime, Iêd like to go over some proposed changes to the roommate agreement specifically to address Pennyês annoying personal habits."
Penny,"Oh, my God. What personal habits?"
Leonard,"I have a list. FYI, overuse of the phrase, oh, my god, is number 12."
Penny,"Okay, Sheldon, you donêt have to do this because Leonard and I are notÑ"
Leonard,Ba-ba-ba-ba. Are you sure you want to include him in this?
Sheldon,Include me in what? Is there a plot afoot? Iêll have no truck with plots.
Penny,"No, youêre right. No, thereês, thereês no plots, no trucks, no feet. So what other annoying habits shall we discuss?"
Sheldon,"Uh, we donêt discuss anything. Leonard is the signatory to the Roommate Agreement. As such, he bears responsibility for all your infractions and must pay all fines."
Sheldon,"Yes. If Pennyês going to be spending nights here again, youêll need to set up an escrow account. Sign here."
Raj,"Hello, Hawaii. This is Dr. Koothrappali in Pasadena. Iêd like you to reposition the telescope, please. Scarlett Johanssonês house! Iêm kidding, Hawaii. Mahalo. Whoo!"
Howard,It might have been a mistake to open that second bottle of wine.
Bernadette,"Well, live and learn. So, Raj, do you think this planet youêre looking for could have an atmosphere that supports life?"
Raj,"Maybe. If it did, Iêd be famous. Iêd be on the cover of magazines. And then, instead of living alone in my tiny apartment, Iêd have a big mansion."
Bernadette,That sounds great.
Raj,"It is. If you like wandering around a big, empty house with no one to love you."
Howard,Weêd come visit you.
Raj,"No, you wouldnêt. Youêd be intimidated by my wealth and fame. My only friends would be my genetically engineered monkey butler, and the little people I hired to be my living chess set."
Bernadette,"Heês taking a turn to the dark side, isnêt he?"
Howard,Hold on. He could come back.
Raj,"Oh, whatês the point of everything?"
Howard,Nope. Heês gone.
Raj,You know itês been more than a year since Iêve even kissed a girl?
Howard,What about that hook-up at Comic-Con you told me about?
Raj,"Oh, grow up. I was lying. I lie all the time. Nobody wants to kiss me."
Bernadette,"Oh, you poor, poor thing. Raj, you have to know youêre a wonderful man. There are a lot of girls out there whoêll want to kiss you."
Bernadette,You just have to look.
Bernadette,"Well, this was fun."
Leonard,"Oh, b-be careful. Give him some line. Okay, now reel him in."
Leonard,Yeah. They do that when you set it on easy.
Leonard,"Hey, baby. I love you! Mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh, mwuh."
Leonard,"Oh, hey. Thereês been something Iêve been meaning to tell you."
Leonard,"Just for the record, I did not want to be a part of this."
Leonard,No hurry.
Penny,"Iêm sorry, daddyÑ"
Penny,"You know, Iêm sorry."
Penny,"Youêre right. Look, from now on, I will tell you the truth."
Penny,"Daddy, he had nothing to doÑ"
Leonard,"Gee, I donêt know if itês in the cards, sir."
Leonard,Iêll give it a shot.
Leonard,Excuse me?
Leonard,"Oh, the reverse psychology thing. I see. Thatês very clever."
Leonard,Iêll friend you on Facebook.
Sheldon,"Oh, there you are. Just so you know, I was up all night, but I have finally completed the Penny-specific section of the new roommate agreement."
Leonard,"Yeah, well, not necessary. We broke up again."
Sheldon,"Do you even think about other people, Leonard? Do you?"
Leonard,"Oh, howêd it go last night?"
Raj,"Oh, you know. Same old, same old. Looked through a telescope, saw some stars. Big whoop."
Leonard,Really? You waited months for time with that telescope. What happened?
Raj,Why? You writing a book?
Sheldon,"Iêm going to propose a hypothesis. Last night, Raj accidentally made contact with an alien civilization and has been ordered by the United States government to keep it a secret."
Raj,Nothing happened. Can we please just change the subject?
Sheldon,That sounds rehearsed. We are not alone.
Leonard,You get to play with Rajês big telescope last night?
Howard,Whoa. Where did that come from?
Raj,He never touched my telescope.
Howard,Way to go shutting up.
Raj,I did shut up. Now you shut up.
Raj,Thank you. How come you didnêt call me this morning?
Sheldon,Clarify something for me. Isnêt the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions? An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?
Leonard,"It is. You just kind of put a damper on things when you said, the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death."
Sheldon,"Well, we could argue about who said what all night long, but to set things back on course, I will propose a new topic of conversation."
Sheldon,"What is the best number? By the way, thereês only one correct answer."
Raj,"Five million, three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?"
Sheldon,Wrong. The best number is 73. Youêre probably wondering why.
Raj,Weêre good.
Sheldon,"73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, seven and three. Eh? Eh? Did I lie?"
Leonard,We get it. 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.
Sheldon,"Chuck Norris wishes. In binary, 73 is a palindrome, one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one, exactly the same. All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc."
Raj,"Just for the record, when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator, upside-down it spells boobies."
Leonard,Remember when you were wondering why the girls didnêt want to eat with us tonight?
Howard,"Yeah, I get it now."
Penny,"I love your little heart locket, Bernadette."
Bernadette,"Oh, thanks. Howard gave it to me. Itês the cutest thing. Every time I have dinner with his mom, the next day I get jewellery."
Amy,"Did you know that the iconic Valentineês heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart, but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?"
Penny,"Oh, so I spent seventh grade dotting my Iês with little asses? Cool."
Penny,"Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?"
Penny,"Yeah, I got it, I got it. Uh, Zack, these are my friends Bernadette and Amy."
Penny,"Yeah, you, too."
Bernadette,Heês really cute. How do you know him?
Penny,"Oh, we went out a couple of times."
Amy,Iêm often flummoxed by current slang. Does went out mean had intercourse?
Penny,"No, no. But in this case, yes."
Amy,Interesting. And was it not satisfactory?
Penny,"No, it was great. He just didnêt really challenge me on an intellectual level."
Bernadette,Couldnêt you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?
Penny,Wouldnêt help. Zack canêt even spell NPR.
Bernadette,Itês what I do with Howard. Iêm much smarter than he is. But itês important to protect his manhood.
Bernadette,Whatês the matter?
Amy,"Iêm suddenly feeling flushed. My heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry. In addition, I keep involuntarily saying hoo."
Penny,"Oh, we know whatês causing that, donêt we?"
Amy,Itês no mystery. I obviously have the flu coupled with sudden-onset Touretteês syndrome.
Howard,Did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?
Leonard,What happened?
Howard,They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.
Raj,Did he get superpowers?
Howard,"No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot."
Raj,"Oh. Well, thatês disappointing."
Raj,"Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero."
Howard,"Yeah, but whoêd want to become Rat-Man?"
Raj,"Who wouldnêt? You could zip through a maze in nothing flat, squeeze through really small holes, and shut down restaurants in a single bound. And the best part is, if I were Rat-Man, you could be my sidekick, Mouse Boy."
Howard,Mouse Boy?
Raj,"You donêt like Mouse Boy? How about, uh, uh, Kid Vermin?"
Howard,"First of all, if we had superpowers, I wouldnêt be the sidekick. Youêd be the sidekick."
Raj,Rat-Man is nobodyês sidekick.
Howard,"Leonard, settle this. Of the two of us, whoês the obvious sidekick?"
Raj,"Yeah, Leonard, who?"
Leonard,"12 years after high school, and Iêm still at the nerd table."
Sheldon,Arenêt you slicing that manês brain a little too thin?
Amy,"Itês too thin if I were making a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos. For examination under a two-photon microscope, itês fine."
Sheldon,"Well, youêre the expert. If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield."
Amy,"Very well. If you die and donate your body to science, I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Amy,"Now, if youêll excuse me, I have to take my temperature."
Sheldon,"Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity? I did that one summer. Ah, youth."
Amy,"No, I experienced some distressing symptoms last night, so Iêm checking my vital signs every hour."
Sheldon,Iêd be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis.
Amy,"Oh, that sounds like fun."
Sheldon,All right. What were the symptoms?
Amy,"Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing."
Sheldon,Localized to what region?
Amy,Ears and genitalia.
Sheldon,Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about environmental factors? Describe the scene for me.
Amy,"I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette, drinking water, carbonated as it was a special occasion. Pennyês friend Zack stopped by and said hello and I said hoo."
Sheldon,Then why did you ask?
Amy,Ask what?
Sheldon,"All right, letês start over. What did you say when Zack walked in?"
Amy,Why do you keep saying Zack?
Sheldon,Because you keep saying who.
Amy,Iêm not saying hoo now. I said hoo last night.
Sheldon,"And the answer was Zack, correct?"
Amy,There was no question. I simply said hoo.
Sheldon,"All right, I think I have enough to go on. Possible explanations for your symptoms are, in descending order of likelihood, hyperthyroidism, premature menopause, hosting an alien parasite or, and I only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases, sexual arousal."
Amy,Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?
Howard,There you are.
Raj,"Oh, hey."
Howard,Let me ask you a question. What are you most afraid of?
Raj,"I donêt know. Um, nuclear war. Accidentally being buried alive. Any of those movies where you get that phone call that says youêre going to die, and then you do."
Howard,"Something very specific that we both know you, Rajesh Koothrappali, are terrified of."
Raj,"Well, type two diabetes runs in my family. The thought of losing a toeÑ"
Howard,Spiders! Youêre afraid of spiders!
Raj,What the heck is this?
Howard,"A jar with a big spider in it, of course. Bravery test. First one to take his hand out is the sidekick."
Raj,Are you crazy?
Howard,Perhaps. Are you scared?
Raj,But itês a stupid test.
Howard,"Oh, really? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?"
Raj,"Oh, yeah? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?"
Howard,"Oh, come on. Thatês never gonna happen. Now put your hand in the jar or forever be revealed as my sidekick."
Raj,"All right, I will."
Howard,How did you get so brave all of a sudden?
Raj,Itês easy. The spiderês crawling up your arm.
Howard,"Get it off! Get it off! Please, Raj! Ah! Ah! Ah! Please. Oh!"
Amy,My blood work shows thyroid function normal. Cortisol levels normal.
Sheldon,How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?
Amy,"Sheldon, I am not going through menopause."
Sheldon,Are you sure? You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.
Amy,"I think we need to face the cold, hard truth, I was sexually aroused by Pennyês friend Zack."
Sheldon,Hang on. I donêt know that weêve given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.
Amy,"Letês look at this logically. I have a stomach, I get hungry. I have genitals, I have the potential for sexual arousal."
Sheldon,"A cross we all must bear. You know, in difficult moments like this, I often turn to a force greater than myself."
Sheldon,Star Trek. Did you see Star Trek: The Motion Picture?
Sheldon,"Donêt. Itês terrible. However, in it, we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar."
Amy,Are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?
Sheldon,Cheap science fiction?
Amy,What are you doing?
Sheldon,Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.
Amy,Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?
Sheldon,"I hadnêt considered that. Give me a moment. All right, Iêve considered it."
Sheldon,I reject it.
Amy,"You reject it because you donêt feel jealousy, or because you are suppressing jealousy?"
Sheldon,I think Iêll eat my lunch at home.
Amy,"Thatês not your lunch, Sheldon, those are the cadaver brain specimens."
Sheldon,"Oh. As they were incorrectly sliced, you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi."
Penny,Hey. Isnêt tomorrow your usual laundry night?
Sheldon,"The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens, Iêll need time to make things right."
Penny,Thatês thinking ahead.
Sheldon,The alternative would be to think backwards. And thatês just remembering.
Penny,So howês Amy?
Sheldon,Amyês changed. I might have to let her go.
Penny,"Oh, no. Why?"
Sheldon,"I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me. But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. Like you."
Penny,Just going to skip over that insult.
Sheldon,What insult?
Penny,"Yeah. Thatês why Iêm going to skip over it. Are you saying that Amy is, oh, whatês the"
Sheldon,Forget science. Sheês horny.
Penny,Oh! Okay. Wow.
Sheldon,Itês simple biology. Thereês nothing I can do about it.
Penny,Are you sure?
Sheldon,What are you suggesting?
Penny,Iêm suggesting there might be something you could do about Amyês urges?
Sheldon,Itês illegal to spay a human being.
Penny,Yeah. Thatês not what I had in mind.
Sheldon,Oh. Oh! You mean something I could do.
Sheldon,"Well, I was hoping to avoid this. But I might as well get it over with. Thank you, Penny. Iêll let you know what happens."
Penny,"Oh, Amy, you lucky girl."
Sheldon,"Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Is this the Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny? Sorry to bother you. Hello. Iêm looking for a Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny. Coitus. It means intercourse. And I have a feeling Iêm speaking to the right Zack. This is Sheldon Cooper. Fine. Shelly. Yes, that does sound like a girlês name. No, it doesnêt bother me. Yes, Smelly Shelly does bother me. Let me tell you why Iêm calling. Iêd like to know if youêd be interested in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler. Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, that is a girlês name. Good grief. Itês like trying to talk to a dolphin."
Leonard,Really? This is going to decide whoês the hero and whoês the sidekick?
Howard,You got a better idea?
Leonard,Every idea is better than this idea.
Raj,Wait. What the hell is ding?
Howard,Itês a bell.
Raj,I donêt think this kind of wrestling has a bell.
Howard,Fine. How do you want to start?
Raj,"I say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?"
Howard,One-two-three-go? Thatês for babies.
Raj,"Okay, how about, uh, on your mark, get set, go?"
Howard,"Thatês for a footrace. If you want to race, we have to go outside."
Raj,"No, itês chilly outside. Didnêt bring my jacket."
Howard,"Oh, for crying out loud. What kind of superhero needs a jacket?"
Raj,"What kind of superhero says dibs on the red tights, dibs on the red tights."
Howard,"All right, how about this? Ready, wrestle."
Raj,"Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what youêre going to say when we do start, orÑ"
Howard,Weêre starting now!
Raj,Donêt yell at me!
Leonard,Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night. None come to mind.
Sheldon,Look at this stamp. On what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?
Amy,Iêm sure itêll wash off.
Sheldon,Little comfort tonight. I look like a Hellês Angel.
Amy,Thereês Zack.
Sheldon,Are you sure this is what you want to do?
Amy,"Itês not what I want to do, itês what I have to do."
Sheldon,"Go, Amy Farrah Fowler. Follow your endocrine system."
Amy,"Thank you, Sheldon. Youêre a good friend."
Sheldon,Please donêt drag this out. This is never going to come off.
Amy,"Excuse me? Zack? I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night. I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. And yet here I stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make Shakespeareês metaphorical beast with two backs."
Amy,"On the other hand, as I look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face, I have decided to adopt the Vulcan practice of Kolinar. Good-bye, Zack."
Howard,Iêm legally obligated to inform you that I took a karate lesson when I was 11. Iêd be a regular ninja by now if my mom couldêve arranged a carpool.
Raj,"Oh, yeah? Well, Iêve been taking Pilates class at the rec center, and my abs look like sections of a Hershey bar."
Howard,"Oh, yeah? Wonêt matter, youêre going down!"
Raj,"No, uh-uh, youêre going down!"
Howard,"If anybodyês going to go down, itês going to be you."
Leonard,Fellas. Itês been 30 minutes. Nobodyês touched each other.
Sheldon,Iêm glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect.
Amy,As am I. 
Sheldon,What are you doing?
Amy,An experiment. Nope. Nothing. Never mind.
Raj,You realize you canêt win.
Howard,I prefer to think that I canêt lose.
Raj,Youêre wrong. Itês only a matter of time before you fall into Rat-Manês rat trap.
Howard,"You pathetic fool! If there were a rat-catcher, wouldnêt it catch Rat-Man?"
Raj,Just because I didnêt express myself well doesnêt mean my underlying point was invalid! You bloviating buffoon!
Howard,You narcissistic nincompoop!
Raj,"You crimson coward! Oh, Leonard, wake up, youêre missing some very excellent superhero quips."
Raj,Water Demon.
Howard,Ice Dragon.
Leonard,Lesser Warlord of Kaêa.
Sheldon,Not so fast. Infinite Sheldon.
Leonard,Infinite Sheldon?
Sheldon,"Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work."
Leonard,Do you understand why people donêt want to play with you?
Sheldon,"No, although itês a question Iêve been pondering since preschool."
Penny,"Hey, your copy of Science magazine was in my mailbox."
Leonard,"Oh, thanks."
Leonard,Thatês an atom.
Leonard,"So, you and Zack again, huh?"
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again."
Penny,"Okay, we should, we should go."
Howard,"Oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you. What do you want to talk about, rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?"
Sheldon,Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.
Leonard,They might be smarter than some people.
Sheldon,"Oh, thatês easy enough. Weêd need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through, and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty."
Leonard,A dolphin might.
Sheldon,Thatês not correct. We were implying it. You then inferred it.
Penny,"You know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. Shame on all of you. "
Raj,What the hell did I do?
Penny,You laughed.
Leonard,You think Pennyês right? Were we bullying Zack?
Howard,"No, I know bullying. He left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free."
Raj,And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.
Leonard,That happened to you?
Raj,First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.
Leonard,"I donêt know, I think we might owe the guy an apology."
Howard,So go apologize.
Leonard,Why me?
Howard,"You started it, we just piled on."
Leonard,What would I even say?
Sheldon,"Zack, Iêm sorry youêre stupid. Have a Milk Dud."
Raj,A Milk Dud?
Sheldon,"Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies."
Leonard,"I got a better idea. Weêre all responsible. I say we all go. Come on, whoês with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?"
Raj,Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.
Sheldon,Youêre embarrassing yourself.
Leonard,"Yeah, we came to talk to Zack. Hey, Zack."
Leonard,"Listen, uh, the stuff we were saying before, we were just kidding around."
Leonard,"Come on, thatês what we do. We give each other a hard time. Hey, Sheldon, you look like a praying mantis."
Sheldon,Thatês very hurtful.
Sheldon,Milk Dud?
Sheldon,Junior Mints.
Leonard,"Uh, weêre on our way to the comic book store."
Howard,Leonardês buying.
Sheldon,Literally? Literally a million years?
Penny,"Wait, w-w-wait-wait-wait, youêre ditching me to go look at comic books?"
Penny,Iêm not happy.
Sheldon,"In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong."
Leonard,"Uh, no. Oh, this is Zack. Heês a friend of ours. Zack, this is Stuart. He owns the store."
Howard,"Uh, no, itês an indictment of the American education system."
Raj,The Archies are over here.
Sheldon,Of course. Weêre coming as the Justice League of America.
Howard,Switching it up from last year when we came as the Justice League of America.
Sheldon,"To that point, it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link, which is clearly Leonard as Superman."
Leonard,"Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches."
Sheldon,"Thatês sad. Letês ask ourselves, is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?"
Sheldon,I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.
Howard,He is the only person we know with actual muscles.
Leonard,You canêt replace me with Zack.
Sheldon,Why not? Penny did it.
Howard,"Yeah, she seems happier. Why wouldnêt we be?"
Sheldon,"Congratulations. Zack, how would you like to be Superman?"
Leonard,"Fine, if Zackês going to be Superman, I want to be Green Lantern."
Raj,But Iêm Green Lantern.
Leonard,You can be Aquaman.
Raj,I donêt want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere."
Penny,Iêm still mad at you.
Penny,What great news?
Sheldon,Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible plane sold separately.
Penny,"Wait, why me? Wh-Why canêt your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?"
Howard,She and her lab team are under quarantine. Seems at the Christmas party they were doing Jell-O shots out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever.
Penny,"Okay, what about your friend Amy?"
Sheldon,Amy Farrah Fowler doesnêt believe in wearing costumes. She isnêt the free spirit I am.
Penny,"Okay, well, forget it. Iêm not spending my New Yearês Eve at a comic book store wearing a Wonder Woman costume."
Howard,He says heêll wear it if youêll be Aquaman.
Leonard,What are you doing?
Sheldon,Weêre going to be late. Iêm pacing nervously.
Leonard,Youêre jogging.
Sheldon,This is how the Flash paces.
Sheldon,Iêm not Sheldon. Iêm the Flash. And now Iêm going to the Grand Canyon to scream in frustration. Iêm back.
Howard,Iêm Batman.
Sheldon,"Oh, I hardly think so. The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when heês running late."
Howard,I had to walk. I couldnêt get Raj on the back of my scooter.
Raj,"Iêve said this before, and Iêll say it again. Aquaman sucks."
Penny,All right. Letês get this thing over with.
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?
Howard,"Relax. No oneês going to be looking at her hair. Ow! I mean, ow."
Penny,Iêm not wearing it. It looks stupid.
Penny,Forget it. Iêm not wearing the wig.
Howard,"Well, actually."
Sheldon,Donêt. Heês making our case.
Penny,Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. Iêm not going.
Raj,Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.
Penny,Iêm not talking to you.
Sheldon,  Penny.
Penny,What the hell is wrong with you?
Sheldon,"Iêm the Flash. I just knocked 30,000 times."
Penny,"Okay. What do you want, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,I understand why youêre upset.
Sheldon,Yes. Youêre afraid that costume makes you look fat.
Penny,"Wait, wait, does it?"
Sheldon,Donêt worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.
Penny,"Good-bye, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"But theyêre not blonde, so put on your wig. Hello?"
Raj,Stupid Aquaman.
Leonard,"If it makes you feel any better, when I was dating Penny, she used to flip out on me all the time."
Leonard,She didnêt tell you?
Leonard,Who else would it be?
Sheldon,I may have failed.
Howard,"Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman."
Raj,"Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All weêve got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight."
Sheldon,"Obviously, weêre no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes."
Raj,"Ooh, I call Kermit."
Sheldon,Iêm Kermit. Youêre Scooter.
Raj,"Oh, man. Scooter sucks. Heês the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies."
Howard,"No, we can still make this work. Leonard, you talk to Penny."
Leonard,What makes you think I can convince her?
Howard,"You got her to have sex with you. Obviously, your superpower is brainwashing."
Leonard,"Okay, let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?"
Sheldon,Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.
Penny,"Go away, Sheldon."
Leonard,Itês Leonard.
Penny,"Oh. Go away, Leonard."
Penny,Itês open.
Penny,"Iêm not going to that party, Leonard."
Leonard,"Okay, listen. You donêt have to wear the wig. At this party, weêre gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl."
Penny,Itês not the wig.
Leonard,"Did I do something? I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him."
Penny,"Okay, look. Weêre not really me and him."
Leonard,Then what are you?
Penny,I donêt know. I only started seeing Zack again so I wouldnêt be alone on New Yearês Eve. How pathetic is that?
Leonard,Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Yearês Eve.
Penny,You make a cute Green Arrow.
Leonard,Green Lantern.
Penny,Like thereês a difference.
Leonard,Thereês a big difference. Arrow. Lantern.
Penny,"Whatever. Look, if Zack and I had just gone to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine, but this, with the costumes, and you."
Leonard,What about me?
Penny,Nothing. Letês go to the party.  How do I look?
Leonard,"Um, I guarantee youêll be the prettiest girl there."
Howard,"Okay, the good news is, we have a Wonder Woman."
Sheldon,Whatês the bad news?
Howard,Superman probably isnêt getting laid tonight.
Sheldon,Thank you! Thank you so much!
Sheldon,"No, wait! I have a speech."
Sheldon,Stop counting!
Sheldon,"This is my moment, dag nab it!"
Sheldon,Iêm not going to say another word until you people settle down. Iêm waiting.
Penny,Are you high?
Leonard,Youêre being a bully.
Howard,Check it out. Those guys are breaking into that car.
Leonard,What should we do?
Sheldon,Weêre the Justice League of America. Thereês only one thing we can do. Turn around and slowly walk away.
Leonard,"Look, I know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees, but Iêm a little warm, so Iêm going to turn it down."
Howard,"Ma, Ma, calm down. Listen to me. I know it says click with the mouse, but on a laptop, the trackpad is the mouse. Now, put your finger on it. Doesnêt matter which finger. Good choice. Now move it down to your e-mail icon. Yeah, the little envelope. What do you mean, what does it look like? It looks like an envelope! Fine, you donêt like the computer, donêt use it! Sure, we can exchange it for a salad spinner. Good-bye!"
Raj,"Thatês a Hanukkah present youêre regretting, huh?"
Sheldon,"I wonêt say that all senior citizens who canêt master technology should be publicly flogged, but if we made an example of one or two, it might give the others incentive to try harder."
Leonard,"I had a great idea. You know how weêre always having to stop and solve differential equations, like when youêre doing Fourier analysis, or using the Schrodinger equation?"
Sheldon,Howard doesnêt. Heês only an engineer.
Leonard,"I was thinking, we could write a little app that would use handwriting recognition, and then run it through a symbolic evaluation engine. You just use your smartphone, take a picture of the equation and bam!"
Raj,You know whatês a great app? The one that makes fart noises.
Sheldon,"You know, Leonard, thatês actually a valid idea. Very good."
Leonard,Can you say that and not make it sound like Iêm a cat who learned how to use the toilet?
Sheldon,"The two achievements are equally surprising and equally admirable, though if pressed, Iêd have to give a slight edge to the cat. Iêll save you the pain and nervousness of waiting for the answer. I agree to be part of your project. Congratulations."
Leonard,"Oh, yay for me. What about you guys? I canêt promise anything, but people do make money off stuff like this."
Howard,A few extra bucks would be nice. I could finally move out of my motherês house.
Raj,Where would you go?
Howard,I always dreamed about building a little place of my own over the garage.
Raj,"You know, if I made more money, I could take time off from work and give pretty girls submarine rides."
Howard,Whatês that? Some weird sex thing?
Raj,"You take pretty girls underwater in your private submarine, and you show them fish. Why does everything have to be dirty with you?"
Leonard,"I was thinking we could work on this at night, and then maybe in a couple of weeks, weêll have ourselves an app to sell."
Howard,Sounds like weêre in business.
Raj,I think we should take a picture to capture this moment.
Raj,"Was that the best 99 cents I ever spent, or what?"
Leonard,I checked the App Store. No one is doing handwriting-recognition differential equation solving.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, shush."
Sheldon,"You have so few good ideas, Leonard. And youêre just going to spill the beans in front of an outsider?"
Penny,"Who, me?"
Howard,"Sheldon, I donêt think Penny cares about handwriting-recognition based differentialÑ"
Sheldon,"The stars at night are big and bright, deep in the heart of Texas."
Leonard,Sheês not going to steal our idea.
Penny,What idea?
Leonard,Weêre gonna write an applicationÑ
Sheldon,"The prairie sky is wide and high, deep in the heartÑ"
Penny,"Okay, stop, stop!"
Sheldon,Of Texas.
Penny,"Whatever your secret is, Iêm sure itês boring, so Iêm not interested."
Leonard,"Itês not boring at all. You see, in higher order mathematics, there are certain sets of equations thatÑ"
Sheldon,Hardly. Consider this unlikely but very plausible scenario. A young woman alone in the big city. Her ridiculous dream of becoming an actress lies shattered about her.
Penny,"Hey, wait a minute."
Howard,"Well, hang on. Letês see where heês going."
Sheldon,"Then it hits her. How is she going to survive? I mean, she has no prospects, no marketable skills. And then one day, she meets a group of geniuses and their friend Howard."
Howard,"Hey, IÑ"
Penny,Hang on. Letês see where heês going.
Sheldon,"She befriends them, and then lies in wait until they reveal a marketable idea, which she steals and sells to the highest bidder."
Leonard,That is ridiculous.
Sheldon,"Oh, is it? Well letês see you come up with an explanation as to why this woman hangs out with us all the time."
Penny,"Oh, great. You know what? Iêve already mooched dinner off you guys. I donêt need to listen to this."
Howard,"Thereês your answer, free food."
Sheldon,"All right, Iêve taken the liberty of drafting these workflow charts which outline our various duties and the path we will follow as we develop our ground-breaking new app."
Raj,"Hey, why am I in charge of phone support? Seems a bit racist."
Sheldon,A customer service representative with an Indian accent will create the impression weêre a vast enterprise that uses overseas call centres.
Raj,Oh. Very clever. But still racist.
Sheldon,"Duly noted, Steve from Wichita."
Howard,Why am I listed as your executive assistant?
Sheldon,"Because the word secretary has fallen into disrepute. FYI, my motherês birthday is coming up. Iêm going to need you to pick up a present."
Leonard,"Okay, we need to stop for a minute."
Sheldon,"Leonard, please, we can talk during our break. We have one coming up at midnight. Weêll need snacks."
Leonard,"Sheldon, youêre not in charge. Itês my idea. Iêm in charge."
Sheldon,"Oh, of course you are. Look at the organizational chart. Youêre clearly listed as founder."
Leonard,"Well, yes, and youêre listed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer."
Sheldon,"You missed Chief Science Officer, Chairman of the Board, and Head of the Secret Santa Committee."
Leonard,Okay. You need to get clear on this right now. I am in charge of this project.
Raj,Ooh. Leonardês going all alpha nerd on Sheldonês ass.
Sheldon,"All right. All right, Iêm not going to argue with you. Sheldon Cooper is nothing if not a team player. Dr. Hofstadter, you have the conn."
Leonard,Thank you. I thought we might start by talking about the user interface.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, weêre doomed."
Leonard,"So this button here will allow you to scan a new equation, but over here, you can press this, and just substitute new values for the coefficients."
Sheldon,"Good one, boss."
Sheldon,This diagram. I assume you were opening with a joke. It certainly buoyed up this employeeês esprit de corps.
Leonard,Itês not a joke. Itês the real design.
Sheldon,"In that case, may I offer 27 little tweaks to make it slightly less embarrassing?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, I think this will work. Letês just try it my way."
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm, Iêm sorry. I assumed that you wanted candid truth-telling from your employees, but I realize now, you want the mindless nattering of complacent yes-men."
Leonard,Are you done?
Sheldon,"If you say so, boss."
Howard,"So right now, this button-press event is just triggering a dummy procedure callÑ"
Sheldon,How about this for the app name? The Surprisingly Helpful Equation-Linked Differential Optimized Numerator.
Raj,So it spells Sheldon?
Sheldon,Does it? A happy accident.
Leonard,Weêre not doing names now. Howard?
Howard,"Like I was saying, right now itês just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us intoÑ"
Sheldon,"All right, fine. If weêre not going to give it a name, can we at least give it a secret code designation?"
Sheldon,"Well, but hear me out. The atomic bomb was The Manhattan Project. Windows 95 was originally Project Chicago. For our app, I would humbly suggest Project Nodlehs."
Leonard,Thatês just Sheldon backwards.
Sheldon,Another happy accident.
Leonard,Weêre not wasting time with names right now.
Sheldon,I see. Is that decision open for discussion?
Sheldon,Is the decision to not discuss it open for discussion?
Howard,"Again, right now itês just a dummy procedure, but eventually, it will drop us intoÑ"
Sheldon,I call for a vote of no confidence and an immediate change in leadership.
Leonard,"Oh Sheldon, stop it."
Sheldon,"When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to dissolve the bonds that tie three competent scientists togetherÑ"
Leonard,"Thatês enough, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"All right, letês get right to the vote. Show of hands all those opposed to Leonard and his reign of tyranny."
Leonard,"Okay, thatês it, youêre fired."
Sheldon,Really? Why?
Leonard,Because youêre impossible to work with.
Sheldon,I see. And is that open for discussion?
Leonard,What are you doing?
Sheldon,"Oh. Good morning, shoemaker. I think youêll be pleased with what the elves were up to last night."
Leonard,But I fired you.
Sheldon,"Oh, I know. Iêm now an independent contractor."
Leonard,"No, you are now nothing. You have no connection to this project whatsoever."
Sheldon,But I made it better.
Leonard,I donêt want it better. I want it my way.
Sheldon,"Well, that speaks volumes, doesnêt it? All right, I suppose Iêll go put on my bus pants."
Leonard,What the hell are bus pants?
Sheldon,"They are pants one wears over oneês regular pants when one sits on bus seats that other people have previously sat on. But perhaps from your lofty heights atop the corporate ladder, youêve lost touch with the struggles of the common man."
Leonard,"Look, Iêm still happy to drive you to work. Nothingês changed in that regard. Weêre still roommates, weêre still friends."
Sheldon,"Except you identified me, your best friend, as a gangrenous limb that needed to be severed from the organism and tossed away. The desperate act of a little man with a big Napoleon complex."
Leonard,You know what? Go put on your bus pants.
Raj,"Mm. Last night, I had a dream we got so rich from the app, you and I bought matching side-by-side mansions. But there was a secret tunnel connecting your front yard to my back yard. What do you think that means?"
Howard,"It means after we play handball, Iêm showering at home."
Sheldon,"Good morning, Friend Howard. Friend Raj. I see you gentlemen are enjoying beverages. Perhaps they would taste better out of these."
Raj,Worldês Greatest Astrophysicist?
Sheldon,Donêt thank me. You earned it.
Howard,Howard Wolowitz. Why not Worldês Greatest Engineer?
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry. I typed that into the label maker, but I just couldnêt press enter. Now down to business. What would it take for you to abandon Leonard and join me in a rival company? Unless, of course, the mugs are sufficient, in which case, welcome aboard."
Howard,Weêre not quitting on Leonard.
Sheldon,I understand. And your loyalty is admirable. But what if I were to up the ante?
Raj,What are you talking about?
Sheldon,"Monogrammed key chains with a built-in laser pointer. No? How about can cosies emblazoned with our university mascot? Go, Beavers. Iêll be back."
Howard,"Okay, letês try this one. Spherical Hankel function."
Leonard,Hold on. Thatês it!
Raj,"Hey, we agreed when it was Eureka time, we were all gonna say it together."
Howard,Fine. Letês say it together.
Raj,The moment has passed.
Sheldon,"Greetings, gentlemen. How goes your little project?"
Raj,"You mean, Project Lenwoloppali?"
Sheldon,"Ah, a combination of all your names. Very clever. I assume Koothranardowitz was taken?"
Leonard,Weêre actually scanning equations and getting good results.
Sheldon,"Oh, well then, by all means, carry on. I wouldnêt want to impede your progress."
Leonard,"Howard, did you solve the install time problem yet?"
Howard,Itês a little tricky. Iêm gonna try having it pick up the libraries dynamÑ
Leonard,What are you doing?!
Sheldon,Playing the theremin.
Leonard,"I mean, what are you doing with a theremin?"
Sheldon,"Playing it. Iêve loved the theremin from the first moment I heard the original Star Trek theme. And itês been killing me that it just sits in my closet, gathering dust."
Leonard,Sheldon! Weêre working here!
Sheldon,"Thatês all right. I can barely hear you over my theremin.  Well, that was a little uncalled for."
Leonard,"No, that was completely called for. We need quiet."
Sheldon,"So, your project is more important than mine?"
Leonard,"Well, seeing as your project is to sabotage my project, yes."
Sheldon,"Donêt beat around the bush, Leonard. If you donêt want me here, just say the word, and Iêll leave."
Sheldon,Could have beaten around the bush a little.
Sheldon,"Nobody knows the trouble Iêve seen, nobody knows my sorrow-ow-ow-ow."
Penny,What you doing? Trying to contact your home planet?
Sheldon,Iêm practicing my theremin.
Sheldon,"Nobody knows the trouble Iêve seen. Glory, hallelujah."
Penny,"Something got you down, there, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,Leonard kicked me out of my own apartment. And his app team.
Penny,"Oh, honey, Iêm sorry."
Sheldon,He wouldnêt drive me to work today. I had to wear my bus pants.
Penny,Is that so?
Sheldon,Yes. And theyêre still sticky.
Sheldon,Probably going to have to throw them away.
Penny,"Hey, you donêt need Leonard and his app. You can make one with me."
Sheldon,With you?
Penny,"Seriously, I have a great idea for one."
Sheldon,Is it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles and become a famous actress?
Penny,"Okay, look, when you see someone wearing shoes you like, you just snap a picture of them, and the app goes on the Internet to find out where you can buy them."
Sheldon,Thatês your app idea?
Penny,"Well, you donêt like it?"
Sheldon,"I didnêt say that. But no, I donêt."
Penny,Why not?
Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, where do I begin? The simple-mindedness of your idea is exceeded only by its crass consumerism and banality."
Penny,And Leonard didnêt want to work with you? Imagine that.
Sheldon,"I know, itês baffling.  Nobody knows the trouble Iêve seen."
Penny,"Sheldon, Iêm gonna make some cocoa. Do you want some?"
Sheldon,Do you make it with milk or water?
Sheldon,Real cocoa?
Penny,Thatês what it says on the packet.
Sheldon,Do you have those little marshmallows?
Penny,"No, sorry."
Sheldon,"Well, I suppose itês appropriate."
Penny,What does that mean?
Sheldon,A disappointing drink for a disappointing day.
Raj,"Hey, look at this. 20 people from the university have already signed up for our private beta."
Leonard,"Iêm telling you, the Lenwoloppali Differential Equation Scanner meets a real need. Weêve got a hit."
Raj,What do you think we should sell it for?
Howard,"Well, based on the fact that our potential market is about 70 or 80 guys, and you want a submarine, Iêd say about a million dollars a pop."
Raj,"Well, what if we put out a lite version for half a million? You know, get the word of mouth going."
Penny,"Hi. Iêm sorry to bother you guys, but youêve got to come take your Sheldon back."
Leonard,Whatês he doing in your apartment?
Penny,"Well, he was moping down in the lobby, so I invited him over, and now I regret it."
Leonard,"Why do you regret, uh, never mind, stupid question."
Penny,"Look, canêt you just let him play with you until bedtime?"
Leonard,Weêre not playing. This is real work.
Howard,Weêre going to be hundred-aires.
Penny,Okay. What if I got him to apologize and promise to behave?
Leonard,"Then I guess we would let him back on the app team, and while weêre doing that, you could take an aerial tour of L.A. on your flying pig."
Penny,Okay. Wait right here.
Raj,"Iêll tell you one thing. If I get rich enough, thatês the kind of girl I want to take on a submarine ride. And yes, that time, I meant it to be dirty."
Sheldon,Really? Leonard wants me back?
Penny,"Oh, yes. He says they are lost without you."
Sheldon,"Well, we sure saw that coming."
Penny,Thatês right.
Sheldon,You know what Iêm going to do? I am going to sit here and just let them stew.
Penny,"No, no, no. You know, they have suffered enough. Everybodyês suffered enough. The thing is, youêre going to have to offer him a face-saving way out of this."
Penny,Say youêre sorry.
Sheldon,"Oh, no. Mrs. Mary Cooper didnêt raise her no liars."
Penny,"Okay. Um, how about this? You know how youêre always trying to learn about sarcasm?"
Sheldon,I was being sarcastic.
Penny,"Oh. Good for you. So all you have to do here is say youêre sorry to Leonard, but say it sarcastically."
Sheldon,"Of course. He will hear it as an attempt to mend fences, as opposed to the withering condemnation you and I will know it to be."
Penny,"Yeah. Yeah, that was my plan. All right. Come on. Letês go."
Sheldon,"Oh, by the way, thank you for the delicious cocoa."
Penny,"Oh, youêre welcome."
Sheldon,"Boy, Iêm getting good at this."
Leonard,"Okay, now that youêre back on the team, letês get you caught up."
Sheldon,"Before you begin, let me say again how deeply sorry I am for my earlier behaviour and how much I respect and admire your leadership."
Leonard,"Thank you. So as you can see, not only can you store your favourite equations, but you can forward them to your friends or post them on Facebook right from the app."
Sheldon,"Well, I must say, I am impressed."
Sheldon,You all have clearly put in a lot of hard work.
Howard,We have.
Sheldon,"As a result, you have taken the most important step on the road to success, learning what not to do. Now, letês start fresh. Howard, weêre going to need some tea."
Penny,"Okay, these are Uggs. These are Crocs. These are knockoff Manolo Blahniks."
Penny,"Look, you said it yourself, we have to create a database before you can write an alga-thingy."
Sheldon,"Algorithm. You see, Penny, Alan Turing defined an algorithmÑ"
Penny,"Bored. Okay. These are Steve Maddens. These are Nine West. These are Target. Oh, but donêt they look like Chanel? These are Michael Kors. These are Roxy. These are Sachelês. Oh, these are Betsy Johnson, theyêre so cuteÑ"
Sheldon,"Nobody knows the trouble Iêve seen, nobody knows my sorrowÑ"
Penny,Hey. So you guys ready to order?
Sheldon,"Since we come in every Tuesday night at six oêclock and order the same exact thing, and itês now six oh eight, I believe your question not only answers itself but also stands alongside such other nonsensical queries as who let the dogs out? and, uh, How are they hanging?"
Penny,"Okay. So, the usual, with extra spit on Sheldonês hamburger."
Amy,"Penny, a moment? Do you have plans this weekend?"
Penny,"Oh, gee, Amy, Iêm sorry, Iêm actually pretty busy this weekend."
Sheldon,Probably serving food that was ordered today.
Amy,Thatês too bad. I was hoping you could be my plus-one at the Institute of Interdisciplinary Studiesê symposium on the impact of current scientific research on societal interactions.
Penny,The what?
Leonard,Itês an annual science conference. Weêve all been invited to speak.
Penny,"Oh. Oh, okay, well, you know, like I said, I have plans, so."
Amy,"Shame. Since youêre my best friend, I thought it would be a good bonding opportunity."
Penny,Iêm your best friend?
Amy,Donêt you read my blog?
Penny,"Oh, donêt feel bad. I never read Leonardês, and I used to sleep with him."
Amy,Do you know anybody else who would appreciate an all-expense-paid spa weekend at a four-star resort in Big Sur?
Penny,"No, I really, Iêm sorry, free what? Sorry, what, what?"
Leonard,I think her weekend just opened up.
Penny,"Wait, wait, just to be clear, when you guys say spa, does that mean the same thing as when regular people say it?"
Leonard,Pretty much. Except we keep our shirts on in the sauna.
Penny,"You know, it is going to be difficult, but Iêm going to cancel my plans so I can do this for my bestie."
Amy,Please donêt touch my breasts.
Penny,"I, I wasnêt going to."
Amy,All right. I just want to establish boundaries.
Penny,"Boy, this is great. I havenêt had a vacation in ages."
Sheldon,"In order to take a vacation, one first has to work."
Penny,"You know, for a smart guy, you really seem to have a hard time grasping the concept, donêt piss off the people who handle the things you eat."
Amy,That does seem to be a valid principle.
Sheldon,I trust Penny will adhere to the Official California Restaurant Workersê Solemn Oath of Ethics and Cleanliness.î
Amy,I donêt believe thereês any such thing.
Sheldon,You lied to me?
Sheldon,"Good morning. If I could have everyoneês attention, please? I know weêre all eager to get on the road to Big Sur, so if we focus, Iêm sure we can get through this orientation in under a half an hour. Then itês just Q&A, quiz, safety drills, pose for commemorative group photo and weêre off."
Leonard,"Donêt worry. Just sit next to me during the quiz, and you can copy my answers."
Sheldon,"Raj? What are you doing? I donêt think so. Youêve had your allotted six ounces. The first bathroom break isnêt until the Dennyês located near Bakersfield, which is approximately two and half hours away. Remember, people, weêre only as strong as our weakest bladder."
Howard,Nobody cares about your Kegel exercises.
Sheldon,"All right. We have seven people, and two cars. In the lead car, driven by Leonard, will be myself, Amy Farrah Fowler and Penny."
Amy,"Yes! He had you in the other car, but I got you upgraded."
Sheldon,"She made the case that if we break down in the middle of nowhere, your Nebraska backwoods skills and brawny hands will give us the best chance to survive in the wild."
Leonard,Theyêre bigger than mine.
Sheldon,"Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Red Leader to Red Five, come in. Howard, you promised."
Howard,Fine.  Red Five to Red Leader. What do you want now?
Sheldon,Itês eleven fifteen. Iêm requesting your quarter-hourly location update.
Howard,Still right behind you.
Sheldon,"Copy that, Red Five. Radio contact is sufficient. No need to extend your middle finger."
Penny,"So, Amy, Iêve been wondering, are you and Sheldon going to be sharing a room?"
Amy,"No, we discussed it. We decided we didnêt want to jeopardize our relationship by getting to know each other too well."
Sheldon,Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more than over-familiarity with someoneês toilet routine.
Leonard,I can vouch for that.
Leonard,"Not you, him."
Penny,Oh. Thanks.
Leonard,Although yours was an eye-opener.
Amy,"Donêt worry, Penny. Youêre my plus-one. Youêll bunk with me. And FYI, travel makes me constipated, so Iêm the ideal hotel roommate."
Penny,Terrific. Are we there yet?
Bernadette,I hope we get there in time to see the keynote address.
Howard,Really? You want to see the keynote?
Bernadette,"Yeah, it sounds fun. Super bacteria: global apocalypse or exciting research opportunity?"
Howard,"Actually, I was thinking we could go straight to the room and take a nap."
Bernadette,Really? And miss the keynote?
Howard,"We can watch it later on C-SPAN. Besides, I was really looking forward to you and me napping together in the hotel."
Bernadette,"Well honey, if youêre that tired, why donêt you just take a nap here in the car?"
Howard,"No, see, itês notÑ"
Bernadette,"Hang on. Itês Leonard. Hi, Leonard."
Leonard,"Yeah, hi. Listen, I just got a text from Raj. He wanted me to tell you that when Howard says nap, he means sex."
Bernadette,"Oh. Thank you, Raj."
Leonard,Are you an element in the actinoid series?
Sheldon,Amy?
Amy,Are you usually radioactive when found in nature?
Amy,Are you in the lanthanoid series?
Sheldon,"Amy, itês Pennyês turn. Penny?"
Penny,"Uh, I donêt know. Are you food?"
Sheldon,Thatês not apropos. Weêve already established Iêm found in the periodic table.
Penny,"Well, itês a table, right? I mean, why canêt there be food on it?"
Sheldon,I knew she wasnêt lead car material.
Penny,Who elected you Road Trip God?
Leonard,"It was a late-night vote. We were all exhausted, and he was threatening to filibuster. Itês not technically Road Trip God, itês Travel Supervisor."
Sheldon,Although Road Trip God does have a certain ring to it.
Penny,I donêt understand why you people just let him bully you like this. Someone should stand up to him. Whatês he going to do?
Penny,I canêt believe you let him kick me out of the car.
Howard,What could we do? Heês the Travel Supervisor.
Bernadette,"Donêt worry, Penny. This is a better car anyway."
Howard,Yeah. Itês the Love Car.
Penny,Should I ask?
Bernadette,"They say weêre young and we donêt know, we wonêt find out until we grow."
Howard,"Well, I donêt know if all thatês true, êcause you got me, and, baby, I got you."
Penny,"Red Leader, Iêm really sorry."
Amy,I missed you.
Penny,"You know what? I missed you, too."
Bernadette,"Oh, my God, Glenn!"
Bernadette,Are you here for the conference?
Bernadette,"Oh, good for you. Uh, Glenn, this is my boyfriend Howard."
Howard,Hi. Ow. Hi.
Howard,Yes. Bernie sure is.
Bernadette,Iêll try to catch it.
Howard,"Hey, Bernie?"
Howard,Please tell me heês your gay cousin.
Bernadette,He was one of my professors in college.
Howard,Oh! Thatês a relief.
Bernadette,"Then we went out for a year. Come on, letês check in, so we can take that nap."
Howard,"No, itês not necessarily proportional. Shut up!"
Howard,"That green bag is Dr. Cooperês. Hereês an extra five. Make him wait. Oh. Right to the nap, huh? Okay? Uh, so, this Glenn guy. You say you went out with him for, like, a year."
Bernadette,Do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now?
Howard,"I guess not. What is he, like, six-four, six-five?"
Howard,Probably has a hard time finding a suit that fits.
Bernadette,Is something bothering you?
Howard,Itês justÑ
Howard,"Iêm just thinking. If you had sex with that guy, I mean, thereês nothing I can do here that will make any kind of impact."
Bernadette,"Howard, itês not a contest. I love you. I want to be with you."
Howard,"Yeah, great, love you, too, but, if it were a contest, I wouldnêt have a chance, right?"
Bernadette,You canêt think that way.
Howard,Yep. Loser.
Bernadette,"Howard, stop it."
Howard,Sorry. I just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that.
Bernadette,"Wait a minute, a girl like me? Whatês that mean?"
Howard,IêmÑ IÑ
Bernadette,Are you saying you donêt think Iêm hot enough to go out with a guy like Glenn?
Howard,"No! No, Iêm saying exactly the opposite."
Bernadette,Iêm too hot to go out with a guy like Glenn?
Howard,"Yeah, letês go with that."
Amy,Still nothing. Remind me to try again in an hour.
Penny,Will do.
Amy,"So, girl talk?"
Penny,"Um, sure. What do you, what do you got in mind?"
Amy,Do you subscribe to the Freudian theory of penis envy?
Penny,"Um, I never really thought about it. Why?"
Amy,Sometimes I think it might be nice to have one.
Amy,"Not for sex, for convenience. You canêt deny that, by comparison, our internal plumbing is extremely high maintenance."
Penny,"Again, Iêve never given it much thought."
Amy,We have time now. Think about it.
Penny,"Oh, good. Hey."
Bernadette,Can I stay here tonight?
Penny,"Yeah. Why, what happened?"
Bernadette,Howardês a complete and total ass.
Penny,"Oh, yeah, that. Come on in."
Bernadette,Thanks. Iêll sleep on the floor.
Amy,Not necessary. Penny and I are perfectly comfortable sharing a bed.
Penny,We are?
Amy,"Of course, weêre best friends."
Penny,"Oh, right, right, the blog."
Amy,"Word of warning, though. Iêm prone to night terrors, so if I wake up kicking and screaming, donêt panic. Just pin me down and stroke my hair, and Iêll be fine."
Penny,"Hey, can I stay here tonight?"
Leonard,Shh-shh-shh-shh. Sheldonês asleep. Whatês going on?
Penny,"Well, Howardês a complete and total ass, Bernadetteês in my bed, and no matter how much you stroke Amyês hair, she bites."
Penny,Never mind. Can I stay here or not?
Leonard,"Uh, sure."
Penny,All right.
Leonard,"So, how do you wanna do this?"
Penny,"Well, Iêm not getting in bed with him."
Leonard,"Yeah, it is a little like getting into Draculaês coffin."
Penny,Weêre just gonna have to make the best of this.
Leonard,"Okay, when you say make the best of it."
Leonard,Right. So weêll just call the middle here the Neutral Zone.
Penny,The what?
Leonard,"Star Trek. You know, the Neutral Zone between the Federation and the Romulan Empire."
Penny,"Oh, okay. Just like old times."
Leonard,"Of course, sometimes the Federation and the Romulans would enter the Neutral Zone to negotiate a temporary truce."
Penny,"Sweetie, let me put this in a way youêll understand. From the waist down, my shields are up."
Leonard,"Got it, got it. We can do all kinds of stuff from the waist up, you know?"
Penny,Go to sleep.
Leonard,Good night.
Sheldon,Please tell me youêre not having coitus.
Penny,We are not having coitus.
Sheldon,Can you guarantee that it wonêt happen at any time during the night?
Raj,"Oh, my God, Iêm crying already."
Sheldon, Raj? I need to sleep here tonight.
Sheldon,"Howard is a complete and total ass, Bernadette is in Pennyês bed, Amy bites, and Penny may or may not have coitus with Leonard."
Raj,Okay. Come on in.
Penny,"Leonard, are you asleep?"
Penny,I really appreciate you letting me stay here tonight.
Leonard,"Sure, no problem."
Penny,I know itês kinda weird.
Leonard,True dat.
Penny,True dat?
Leonard,Iêve gotten a lot more street since we broke up.
Penny,Right. Still mad at me about that?
Leonard,"No, I understand. I got too intense, you had to back off."
Penny,Thank you.
Leonard,"Iêve gotten a lot better at that, you know. Iêve dated four different women since we broke up and I didnêt tell any of them that I loved them and wanted to have their babies."
Penny,Good for you.
Leonard,"Okay, good night."
Penny,"Good night. You know, maybe it wouldnêt be the worst idea in the world to violate the Neutral Zone for just one night. Oh!"
Raj,"Hey, Leonard, Sheldon kicked me out of the room, gave me your key."
Leonard,"Pennyês here.  No, we donêt want to watch Bridget Jonesês Diary!"
Sheldon,"Good morning and welcome to Science and Society. Iêm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, BS, MS, MA, PhD, and ScD. OMG, right? Perhaps that joke was a little too hippie-dippy for this crowd. All right then, weêll begin with opening remarks. Miss Rostenkowski, would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of scienceês responsibility to society?"
Bernadette,"Sure. I think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days. Itês not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world. As a microbiologist, I can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one."
Howard,"Interesting. I think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of interest  is tiny organisms, she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive weaponry."
Bernadette,I think Mr. Wolowitz needs to keep in mind that the past is the past. But he should know that I am the kind of girl who could get all the giant missiles she wants.
Amy,Are we talking about women wanting penises? Because Iêd like to weigh in.
Sheldon,"Dr. Koothrappali, would you care to join the conversation?"
Raj,"Certainly. Iêd like to raise two points. Number one, I think they are talking about penises. And number two, these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass."
Leonard,Iêd like to kick your little brown ass.
Raj,What did I do?
Leonard,"Oh, I donêt know. Maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend, you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed."
Raj,I did. You said no Bridget Jones.
Penny,We werenêt getting back together! It was a one-time thing!
Sheldon,Excuse me. Weêre not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet.
Penny,"Oh, shut up, Sheldon!"
Amy,"Hi, bestie."
Penny,"Yeah, hi."
Sheldon,"All right, why donêt we see if we can bring this back to topic."
Howard,"Let me ask you something, Bernie."
Sheldon,I guess not.
Howard,How would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend and she was like Angelina Jolie?
Bernadette,"Oh, come on, Howard, be realistic."
Howard,Iêm not hot enough for Angelina Jolie?
Raj,Iêd like to weigh in here. No.
Sheldon,"All right, why donêt we open it up to Q&A from the audience?"
Penny,"Yeah, I have a question. Is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here and back to Los Angeles tonight?"
Bernadette,"Um, Penny, thatês Glenn. Glenn, thatês Penny."
Sheldon,Must be out of range.
Amy,"Leonard, can I ask you a question?"
Amy,Are you bothered by the fact that your former girlfriend left the symposium with what is probably the most beautiful man Iêve ever seen in my life?
Leonard,Why do you ask?
Amy,Because weêre going 120 miles per hour.
Sheldon,"All right, if no oneês going to guess, I was spying the aluminium rims on the police car we passed a few miles back."
Sheldon,"Good evening. Iêm your guest lecturer, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I was expecting applause, but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate. I agreed to speak to you this evening, because I was told that youêre the best and the brightest of this universityês doctoral candidates. Hmm. Of course, thatês like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. ‚Cause, you see, thereês only one electron in a hydrogen atom. Best and brightest, my sweet patootie. All right, letês begin. Show of hands, who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? Donêt kid yourselves."
Leonard,"I found another tweet from a student at Sheldonês lecture. Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. Plus, he looks like a giant insect."
Howard,"Look. Listen to this one. Does Einsteinês theory explain why time flies when youêre having fun, but when youêre listening to Dr. Cooper, it falls out of the sky, dead?"
Raj,"Ooh, somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their Flickr account."
Leonard,Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?
Howard,"Apparently, if youêre Sheldon, all you need to do is turn your back."
Penny,"Hey, Leonard, is your wi-fi down? I canêt get on."
Leonard,"Oh, Sheldon changed the password. Itês now Penny is a freeloader. No spaces."
Penny,Thanks. What are you guys doing?
Leonard,Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. Weêre reading the reviews.
Penny,Oh. Howêd he do?
Howard,"Well, picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl meets Three Mile Island meets Tron 2."
Penny,"That bad, huh?"
Leonard,Read this womanês tweet.
Penny,Listening to Dr. Cooper has made me want to start cutting myself again
Sheldon,"Good evening, Leonard, Howard, Raj, freeloader."
Howard,"So, howêd the lecture go?"
Leonard,"In a word, triumphant."
Leonard,Really? Triumphant?
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, you should have seen those young people. Thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom. I may have changed a few lives today."
Penny,"Oh, please let me tell him."
Leonard,"I donêt know, I kind of promised Howard."
Sheldon,Tell me what?
Howard,"Actually, we should all share the moment. Raj, if you would."
Sheldon,"Oh, tweets about my lecture. Hmm. Thatês rather unfair. Thatês downright cruel. Plus, insects have six legs. Yeah, Iêm not familiar with the acronym KMN."
Leonard,"Oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now."
Sheldon,"Well, I suppose everyoneês entitled to their own opinion. I think Iêll turn in. I didnêt want to teach those poopy heads, anyway."
Howard,"FYI, I think thatês what Darth Vader said just before he started building the Death Star."
Howard,Sheldon still moping?
Leonard,"Yeah, itês weird. Even though he didnêt want to give the lecture in the first place, being rejected by those students really hit him hard."
Raj,"Mmm, I know the feeling. Itês like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you. It-It happened to a friend of mine."
Bernadette,Are you guys doing okay?
Howard,"Yeah, Leonard and I are fine, but I think Raj needs to meet a girl really soon."
Bernadette,"Well, that shouldnêt be too hard. Heês such a cutie."
Raj,"Thank you, but cute is for bunnies. I want to be something with sex appeal, like, like a labradoodle."
Leonard,We might be starting to zero in on your problem.
Bernadette,Donêt you listen to them. Youêve got plenty of sex appeal.
Raj,You really think so?
Bernadette,Yeah. Youêre a hottie.
Raj,"Well, thanks, Bernadette. And just for the record, labradoodles are hypo-allergenic, which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander."
Amy,"So, what do you think?"
Sheldon,"Itês a charming illusion, but it does not cheer me up."
Amy,Not even when I do this? 
Amy,"Well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy."
Sheldon,Do you realize that teaching is the first thing Iêve failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?
Amy,"If this humiliating experience is really troubling you, there are things we could do about it."
Sheldon,For instance?
Amy,"Well, the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser."
Sheldon,"Hmm, no. One slip of the hand, and suddenly Iêm sitting in the Engineering Department, building doodads with Wolowitz."
Amy,"All right. Have you considered improving your socialization skills, thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people?"
Sheldon,Isnêt that their burden? Iêm the one with something interesting to say.
Amy,"Fair enough, but in its essence, teaching is a performance art. In the classroom paradigm, the teacher has the responsibility to communicate, as well as entertain and engage."
Sheldon,I sense that youêre trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany. Would you mind very much jumping to it?
Amy,Perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.
Sheldon,Acting lessons. Interesting. It might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn.
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon,"Youêre an  actress, correct?"
Penny,Iêm not an actress. Iêm an actress.
Sheldon,All right. Youêre an actress. I need you to teach me.
Penny,You want an acting lesson?
Sheldon,Perhaps two. Iêd like to master the craft.
Penny,"Okay, where is this coming from?"
Sheldon,"It has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed, I suck the big one."
Penny,"Yeah, I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put êem on my fridge."
Sheldon,"So, when could we start?"
Penny,"Okay, just to be clear. You are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesnêt."
Sheldon,I suppose thatês one way to look at it.
Penny,I think itês the only way to look at it.
Sheldon,Are you going to help me or not?
Penny,Probably. Iêm just enjoying the foreplay. Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm sorry, I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that oneês career had reached the end of the road."
Penny,Forget it.
Sheldon,Iêll pay you 40 dollars.
Penny,"Saturday, nine a.m. Bring cash."
Howard,"Raj, I have amazing news!"
Howard,I just got offered a fellowship at the Weitzmann Institute in Israel.
Raj,"Dude, thatês incredible!"
Howard,"I know. The only thing is, Iêm gonna be gone for two years."
Raj,"Aw, Iêm gonna miss you. Are you going with him?"
Bernadette,I have to stay here for school.
Howard,"Thatês what weêre here to talk to you about. You see, Bernadette has needs."
Raj,What kind of needs?
Howard,Sexual needs.
Bernadette,"Most of them regular, some of them kind of messed up."
Howard,"So, while Iêm gone, youêre going to have to satisfy her."
Bernadette,What do you say?
Raj,I say okey-dokey.
Howard,What ya thinking so hard about?
Raj,Just that Iêm definitely not gay.
Sheldon, Penny.
Penny,Whatês wrong?
Sheldon,Nothing. I was acting.
Penny,You were acting?
Sheldon,"Yes. In preparation for todayês studies, I read Stanislavskiês An Actor Prepares, Stella Adlerês"
Penny,"Well, good for you. Come on in."
Sheldon,How shall we begin?
Penny,"Well, I thought weêd start with some basic movement exercises. You know, get our bodies warmed up a little."
Sheldon,All right.
Penny,"So I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. You know, just do whatever feels natural. Sheldon?"
Sheldon,You said to do whatever feels natural. This feels natural. Certainly more natural than what youêre doing.
Penny,"Come on, you got to work with me. We need to get connected with our bodies."
Sheldon,"Penny, my body and I have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other."
Penny,"All right, letês just say weêve warmed up."
Sheldon,Youêre the teacher.
Penny,Okay. One of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. So why donêt we try some improvisation?
Sheldon,Why not? It seems like youêre improvising your entire curriculum.
Penny,This is all about listening and responding.
Penny,"Iêm going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it."
Sheldon,All right.
Penny,All right.
Penny,"Okay, itês not a movie. Itês improv. So no one calls action."
Sheldon,"Hey, you taught me something. Who would have thought it?"
Penny,"Okay. Uh, no, the shipment has not arrived, and I really need those shoes. They are my biggest seller. Yes, ladies sizes six through ten. Thank you. Oh, sorry, I have to go, I have a customer. Bye-bye. Hi. Can I help you?"
Sheldon,"Iêd like a frozen yogurt, please."
Penny,"Um, okay, sure. Luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here."
Sheldon,You do?
Penny,"Yes. Look up at the sign, and remember, improv is always about saying yes."
Sheldon,All right. Yes. I see a sign. It says Camarillo State Mental Hospital.
Sheldon,Itês the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.
Penny,"Okay, you know what? Letês just try a different improv. Uh, oh, this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass."
Sheldon,"Oh, and weêre going to use props?"
Penny,"You bet. I had dreams, you know. I was gonna be famous. Show everybody back home I could be someone. Now look at me. Want some?"
Sheldon,You have any frozen yogurt?
Leonard,Iêm still not adjusted to how the SyFy channel spells their name now. S-Y-F-Y. Thatês siffy.
Leonard,"Hello? Oh, my God! Is he okay?"
Raj,What happened?
Leonard,"Hang on. Hang on. Uh-huh. Okay, thank you. Howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck. Heês in critical condition."
Raj,"Oh, no!"
Bernadette,Did you hear? Isnêt it terrible?
Leonard,Have you seen him?
Bernadette,They wouldnêt let me in. Oh my Howie.
Leonard,Itêll be okay. Itêll be okay.
Raj,"Itêll be okay. Itêll be okay.  Itês Howard. Howard, hello."
Howard,"Raj, is that you?"
Raj,"Yeah, Iêm right here, buddy. How are you?"
Howard,"Shh, shh. Listen to me. Iêm not gonna make it."
Raj,"No, no, no, donêt say that. Youêre going to be all right."
Howard,"Raj, I donêt have time. Now, pay attention. My last wish is that you look after Bernadette."
Raj,"Of course, of course. Now when you say look after, you meanÑ"
Raj,"Excuse me, Bernadette. I have to hear it from him."
Raj,"Got it. Take care. I guess I have no choice but to make sweet, guilt-free love to you over and over again for the rest of my life."
Bernadette,Thatês how I heard it.
Leonard,Or it could be sy-fee.
Leonard,S-Y-F-Y. Sy-fee.
Raj,"Oh, right. Good one."
Penny,"So, did you get a chance to go over the scene I gave you?"
Sheldon,Yes. I didnêt care for it.
Penny,"Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic."
Sheldon,"So is the McRib sandwich. I donêt care for that, either."
Penny,Fine. What would you rather do as a scene study?
Sheldon,Iêm glad you asked. I took the liberty of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.
Penny,And you think itês better than Tennessee Williams?
Sheldon,Why donêt we leave that for future generations to decide?
Penny,Where No Sheldon Has Gone Before.
Sheldon,"Itês the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas to the 23rd Century, where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated."
Sheldon,"Now, in this pivotal scene, Sheldonês mother, played by you, argues with an emissary of the United Federation of Planets, Mr. Spock, the role I will bring to life."
Penny,"Okay, thatês fine, but letês try and get you out of your comfort zone."
Sheldon,Why would we want to do that? Itês called the comfort zone for a reason.
Penny,"Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so Iêm thinking youêll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock."
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. Youêll be Spock?
Penny,Itês only logical.
Sheldon,Very well. Iêll set the scene.
Penny,All right.
Sheldon,"East Texas. A warm summer night. A woman, Mary, stands on a porch. In the distance, we hear a lonesome train whistle. Woo-woo. The droning buzz of cicadas. Zzzzzzzzz. A coyote howls at the moon, frightening sensitive young boys everywhere. Aw-aw-aw! Out in the woods, an owl screeches."
Penny,"Okay, okay. We get it. You set the scene."
Penny,Now just read your motherês line.
Sheldon,"Shelly! Shelly, how many times have I told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? Goodness, Iêll never understand that boy. But then again, Iêm a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things."
Penny,Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. Spock to Enterprise. Transport successful.
Sheldon,"Glory be to Heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. George, put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ainêt foolinê no one, and get your shotgun!"
Penny,"Greetings, Mary Cooper. I am Spock."
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. I just donêt buy it.
Penny,Just keep going!
Sheldon,"Oh, my, your sudden appearance startles me."
Penny,"We have been monitoring your son Sheldon from the 23rd Century, and we have determined that he is now ready to join us. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy."
Sheldon,"I understand. Oh, Shelly? A manês here to take you away to the future! Be sure to pack clean underwear.î"
Penny,"Okay, okay, letês try that last line again, and this time, maybe try choking up a little."
Penny,"Well, youêre losing your son."
Sheldon,"Yes, but heês going to a better place where he wonêt get beat up. So much."
Penny,"All right, come on, just try it my way. Pretend youêre sad to see him go. Iêm gonna lead you in. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy. Thatês your cue."
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. I just love that line. Even the way you do it.
Penny,"All right, come on, come on. Put some real emotion into it. Blah-blah, blah, blah, vast and troubled galaxy. Go."
Sheldon,"Oh, Shelly? A manês here to take you away to the future. Be sure to pack clean underwear."
Penny,Thatês good. Thatês good. Thatês good.
Sheldon,"Mommy, why are you crying? ‚Cause Iêm gonna miss you, Shelly-bean, even though you creep the bejeezus out of me."
Penny,"Okay, I guess weêre improvising now."
Sheldon,"Well Iêm sorry. Itês not my fault. Iêm just incredibly smart, and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks. Oh, now, donêt you start crying. You get in that spaceship. Mommyês late for Indian bingo."
Penny,"Mrs. Cooper, hey, itês Penny. Yeah, I think I broke your son. Hey, hold on. Talk to your mother."
Sheldon,"Mommy, I love you. Donêt let Spock take me to the future!"
Bernadette,"Okay, Raj, I know youêve been avoiding me and Howard, and Iêm not leaving until you tell me whatês going on inside that little head of yours."
Raj,Like the wild elephant I am trumpeting my love for you!
Bernadette,Like a hidden flower my sweet fragrance comes into view!
Raj,My heart burns for you like the sun at noon!
Bernadette,My desert welcomes you like the rainy monsoon!
Raj,You are my heart!
Bernadette,My universe!
Raj,You are my heart!
Bernadette,My universe!
Raj,"Dance number aside, Iêm so not gay."
Raj,"Hereês what I wonder about zombies.  What happens if they canêt get any human flesh to eat? They canêt starve to death, theyêre already dead."
Howard,You take this one. I spent an hour last night on how do vampires shave when they canêt see themselves in the mirror?
Sheldon,Well-groomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other. Case closed.
Raj,"Yeah, okay, so, zombies."
Leonard,"I guess it depends on the zombies, Raj. Are we talking slow zombies, fast zombies? Like, in 28 Days, if those zombies didnêt eat, they starved."
Howard,Youêre thinking of 28 Days Later. 28 Days is where Sandra Bullock goes to rehab and puts the audience into an undead state
Raj,"Hey, donêt bag on Sandra Bullock! You think it makes you look cultured, but you just come off as bitter."
Leonard,"Oh, Dr. Siebert, twelve oêclock."
Howard,Whyês the president of the university slumming in the cafeteria?
Sheldon,"Perhaps heês emulating Shakespeareês Henry V, who dressed as a commoner and mingled among them, to find out how he was being perceived by his subjects. Course, if heêd have read any of the thirteen hundred e-mails Iêve sent him on the subject of his administration, he could have saved himself the trouble."
Raj,Or maybe he heard itês Tator Tot Tuesday. Thatês why Iêm here.
Sheldon,"That depends, how much longer do you plan on fondling my shoulder?"
Sheldon,"Itês not a touch phobia, itês a germ phobia. If youêd like to go put on a pair of latex gloves,"
Raj,Sounds great!
Howard,Iêm in!
Sheldon,"Hold on. Just because the nice man is offering you candy, doesnêt mean you should jump into his windowless van. Whatês the occasion?"
Sheldon,Aha! The tear-stained air mattress in the back of the van.
Sheldon,"I donêt care, itês demeaning. And I refuse to be trotted out and shown off like a prize hog at the Texas State Fair. Which, by the way, is something you donêt want to attend wearing a Star Trek ensignês uniform."
Raj,"Oh, you donêt want that."
Raj,"Oh, boy! Tator tots and a party invitation? What a great day!"
Penny,There you go.
Leonard,Are you sure this is right?
Penny,"Yeah, just tuck that part in your pants;  youêll be fine."
Howard,"Okay, letês go smooch some rich, wrinkled tuckus."
Penny,"Oh, Howard, I canêt believe Bernadette let you go to a fancy party wearing a dickey."
Howard,"Excuse me, my girlfriend doesnêt pick out my clothes. My mother does."
Leonard,Oh. We should get going.
Howard,What about Sheldon?
Sheldon,Sheldon is not going.
Leonard,Really? What do we tell Siebert?
Sheldon,Tell him Dr. Cooper feels that the best use of his time is to employ his rare and precious mental faculties to tear the mask off nature and stare at the face of God.
Penny,"Sheldon, itês Saturday night, youêll be doing laundry."
Sheldon,"Donêt tell him that, tell him the mask thing."
Howard,"Hey, put your tie back in your pants."
Raj,Nice place. Reminds me of my parentsê house back in New Delhi.
Howard,Youêre kidding.
Raj,"We are very wealthy. But the only difference is, we have more servants."
Leonard,More than this?
Raj,"More than we can use. You see, in India, we donêt make the mistake of letting our poor people have dreams."
Leonard,Heês tearing the mask off nature to look at the face of God.
Raj,I think we were misled about the cute girls.
Howard,Iêm an engineer. Most engineers donêt bother with a PhD. But you may be interested to know I designed the zero-gravity waste-disposal system for NASA.
Howard,Iêm gonna go hit the bar.
Raj,Do him first.
Leonard,Uh.. b.. d.. uh.. uh..
Leonard,Coffee maker?
Raj,Itês Koothrappali. I have to tinkle.
Sheldon,"And so, instead of bowing to pressure, and going to that pointless soiree, I stayed right here and did a load of whites."
Amy,"Well, normally I respect your macho rebellious attitude toward The Man, but, in this case, I think youêve made a foolish mistake."
Sheldon,"Unlikely. But make your case. Keeping in mind that your critical attitude is ruining our Saturday night together, and Iêm not above minimizing your window."
Amy,"Sheldon, like it or not, until you manage to upload your intelligence into a self-sustaining orbiting satellite, equipped with high-speed Internet and a cloaking device, you will be dependent on other members of the human race."
Sheldon,Thatês it. Prepare to be minimized.
Amy,"Iêm not finished. All scientists have to fund-raise, Sheldon. How do you think I paid for my lab?"
Sheldon,Your lab is funded by some Middle-Eastern dilettante?
Amy,"Technically, Faisal is my fiance. But I do have a state-of-the-art two-photon microscope and a place to stay in Riyadh for the winter."
Sheldon,"Well, that explains those puzzling camel race photos on your Facebook page."
Amy,"And consider this, without you to make the case for the physics department, the task will fall to people like Leonard and Rajesh."
Sheldon,Are you trying to scare me? ‚Cause youêre succeeding.
Amy,"Well, then prepare to be terrified. If your friends are unconvincing, this yearês donations might go to, say, the geology department."
Sheldon,"Oh, dear,not, not the dirt people!"
Amy,"Or worse, it could go to the liberal arts."
Amy,"Millions of dollars being showered on poets, literary theorists and students of gender studies."
Sheldon,"Oh, the humanities!"
Leonard,"On the bright side, I donêt think President Siebert will be making us go to any more fund-raisers."
Howard,"It was so much easier at my bar mitzvah. The old people just came up to you, pinched your cheek and handed you a savings bond."
Raj,"Oh, donêt be such gloomy Gusses. Look at the size of these shrimp! At what point do we start calling them lobsters?"
Leonard,"Face it, Raj, we crashed and burned tonight."
Leonard,"Mrs. Latham, the first machine I turn on in the morning is the helium-neon laser, êcause it needs to warm up."
Leonard,Youêre kidding. That was good for you? ‚Cause I was sweating through my T-shirt.
Sheldon,"No, no, no, Iêm just here for your money. I donêt want to shake anyoneês germy hands. Explain it to them, Siebert."
Sheldon,"I must confess I donêt understand you, President Siebert. First you say you want me to appear at your fund-raisers, but now you say you never want me to go anywhere near your fund-raisers. Forgive me, but that sounds like a mixed message. Here we go again. If thereês simply no talking to me, why did you call? Iêm sorry, someoneês on the other line. Why donêt you see if you can organize your thoughts, and weêll try again later. Cooper-Hofstadter residence. Go for Cooper."
Leonard,"Hello, Mrs. Latham. Yes, I live with him. I donêt, I, I really donêt know why. Tonight? Sure, thatêd be great. Okay, Iêll, Iêll see you then. Bye. She wants to have dinner and talk about my research."
Sheldon,"An entire dinner to talk about your research? Where you going, the drive-thru at Jack in the Box?"
Leonard,"Well, wherever weêre going, sheês sending a car to pick me up."
Sheldon,"Okay, I see whatês happening."
Sheldon,"My stature intimidates her, so sheês using you to get to me. Crafty old gal."
Leonard,"Excuse me, but you are not the only distinguished scientist in this apartment. Iêve been published in peer-reviewed journals, I received a Dissertation of the Year award for experimental particle physics."
Sheldon,"No, that canêt be it. And since you seem to have forgotten, the reason we live together is weêre best friends. And I got your back, Jack."
Leonard,That was a great meal.
Leonard,The only time I eat this well is when my momês in town and she takes me out to dinner.
Leonard,"You kind of remind me of her. She enjoys making people uncomfortable, too."
Leonard,No kidding.
Leonard,"Yeah, um, so, hey, speaking of money, how are you feeling about helping the physics department get a cryogenic centrifugal pump and molecular sieve?"
Leonard,"Oh, good, good."
Leonard,"Terrific. Great. What level is that?  Okay, now you donêt remind me of my mom."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, so, eventually, zombies are going to attack the rehab facility where Sandra Bullock is?"
Penny,"Yes, Sheldon. Keep watching."
Sheldon,"You know, itês a shame, all that work sheês doing to get sober, only to be torn apart and eaten alive."
Howard,Hey. How was dinner?
Leonard,Swell. I need a drink. Do we have any alcohol?
Sheldon,"But we have potatoes, I could make you vodka. Itêll take two weeks."
Penny,"Leonard, are you okay?"
Leonard,"Um, Iêm not sure."
Howard,Whatês going on?
Leonard,"Well, Mrs. Latham said she was seriously considering donating money so we could get a cryogenic centrifugal pump."
Sheldon,"Oh, wow!"
Leonard,Then she stuck her tongue down my throat.
Penny,"Okay, we canêt keep explaining everything. Read that book we got you."
Leonard,She hit on me.
Howard,Wait-wait-wait. Are you telling us that old lady wanted to have sex with you in exchange for giving your department millions of dollars?
Leonard,I think so.
Howard,You lucky duck.
Penny,"Youêre really a broken toy, arenêt you?"
Leonard,"I was able to get out of there before anything else happened, but she wants to see me again tomorrow night."
Sheldon,Excellent! What are you planning to wear?
Sheldon,"Penny, youêre an expert on trading sexual favours for material gain, walk him through this."
Leonard,"Well, n-no, hold on a second, Iêm not going to sleep with her."
Sheldon,But we need a cryogenic centrifugal pump.
Leonard,"Well, forget it! Itês not gonna happen."
Sheldon,"Well, come now, Leonard, this may be your only chance to make a real contribution to science!"
Leonard,"I repeat, not gonna happen."
Penny,What was all that about me trading sexual favours for material gain?
Sheldon,It was a compliment. I believe in giving credit where credit is due.
Sheldon,"Okay, fine. Iêll tell him. Leonard, Mrs. Lathamês car is here for you."
Leonard,I wonêt be too late. Iêm just gonna make a final pitch for the funding and then say good night.
Sheldon,"Hold on, I have something for you."
Leonard,Whatês this?
Sheldon,"Just a few things you may need tonight. Thereês, uh, baby oil, condoms and, uh, a little something I procured from the school of pharmacology. They say it is to Viagra as Viagra is to a green M&M."
Leonard,I am not going to have sex with her.
Sheldon,Maybe this will overcome your reluctance. I went on the Internet and found a photograph of a 25-year-old Mrs. Latham to get your libido humming. Check out those saddle shoes. Rar!
Leonard,Are you insane? Iêm not going to prostitute myself just so we can get some new equipment.
Sheldon,"Oh, come on! Why not?"
Leonard,"Good night, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Given how much time you spend engaging in pointless self-abuse, you might consider, just this once, using your genitalia to actually accomplish something!"
Penny,"He still wonêt shag the old lady, huh?"
Sheldon,But thank you for asking.
Leonard,Hey. Hi.
Leonard,"Iêm very hungry. For food, right?"
Leonard,"No, thatês okay."
Leonard,Oh. Then what was last night about?
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,"Oh, donêt say that. Youêre a very attractive woman."
Leonard,"No, itês true."
Leonard,"Iêm sure I would. But why, why, exactly?"
Leonard,I hadnêt really given it much thought.
Leonard,Do you mean?
Leonard,"Oh, what the hell."
Penny,"Good morning, slut."
Penny,"Oh, please, I recognize the walk of shame when I see it. All youêre missing is a little smeared mascara and a purse with panties wadded up in it."
Sheldon,Whatês going on?
Leonard,"Oh, nothingês going on. Excuse me."
Sheldon,Are you just getting home?
Sheldon,"Thatês a good sign, right?"
Penny,"Oh, yeah."
Sheldon,Iêm so proud of you! You sold yourself out like a common streetwalker!
Leonard,"No, I didnêt do it for the money."
Sheldon,She stiffed you?
Penny,I believe thatês what your roommate did to her.
Penny,"Again, read the book we gave you."
Leonard,"No, I mean, I, I, I got the money first."
Sheldon,"Smart. Get paid up front. Yeah, I think you have a real knack for gigolo work, Leonard."
Leonard,"Uh, Iêm gonna go lie down."
Sheldon,"Thatês a good idea, get your rest. There are a lot more rich old ladies out there, and Daddy needs a new linear accelerator. And I thought he didnêt learn anything from his relationship with you."
Sheldon,Another compliment! Learn to recognize them.
Leonard,I didnêt do it for the money!
Raj,"Cool, buddy! Thatês awesome!"
Howard,How was she?
Howard,Whatês so funny?
Bernadette,Nothing. Just thinking about the noises people make during sex.
Howard,"I do sometimes get a bit carried away, donêt I?"
Bernadette,Itês cute. You sound a little like a drunken monkey. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!
Howard,You know itês meant as a compliment.
Bernadette,Thatês how I take it.
Howard,This is perfect. I hope this moment never ends.
Bernadette,Me too.
Howard,"Well, gotta go."
Bernadette,Oh! Already? Why donêt you stay over?
Howard,"Well, Iêd love to, but you know my mother needs me in the morning."
Bernadette,"Please, I think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself."
Howard,"Itês not just the wig. Itês pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows. Itês a two-person job."
Bernadette,"Itês just, when you leave right after we make love, it makes me feel cheap."
Howard,"Oh, honey, Iêm sorry. What can I do?"
Howard,"Okay. Like, what, another five, ten minutes?"
Bernadette,Go home.
Howard,Your call.
Bernadette,"Howard, have you ever considered us living together?"
Howard,"Boy, I donêt know. You, me, Ma living under the same roof?"
Bernadette,"No, I mean just you and me. You can move in here, or we can find a place."
Howard,Iêve got a better solution.
Howard,"We wait for my momês heart to explode from all the salt she eats. Then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom."
Howard,Look at us planning a future together.
Howard,"Sex criminals donêt have keys, Ma."
Howard,I was out with Bernadette.
Howard,"Iêm not having this conversation with you, Ma!"
Howard,Nobody has a disease!
Howard,Thatês it. I donêt have to take this. Good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!
Howard,Iêm still leaving! I just forgot my Claritin.
Leonard,"Hey, whatês up?"
Howard,I need a place to crash.
Leonard,"Uh, sure. Why?"
Howard,Big fight with my mother.
Leonard,Still arguing over which CSI is the best?
Howard,"No, we agreed they all have their merits. This was about Bernadette."
Sheldon,Whatês going on?
Leonard,Howardês gonna sleep here tonight. He had a fight with his mother.
Sheldon,Did you offer him a hot beverage?
Sheldon,"Leonard, social protocol states when a friend is upset, you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea."
Howard,Tea does sound nice.
Sheldon,"You heard the man, Leonard. And while youêre at it, Iêm upset that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa. Point of inquiry, given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend, why didnêt you seek refuge under his roof?"
Howard,Thereês no room. His sister is staying with him.
Leonard,"Wait, wait. What?"
Sheldon,"Cocoa, Leonard. Focus. Iêm down in the dumps here."
Leonard,Priyaês in town?
Howard,"Yeah, some work thing. Anyway, my mother seems to think that BernadetteÑ"
Leonard,Hold on. When did Priya get here?
Howard,"I donêt know. A couple of days ago. The thing is, Bernadette doesnêt like that I have to take care of my mother, and my mother doesnêt trust Bernadette."
Leonard,"Yeah, thatês a real pickle. Bye."
Sheldon,"Donêt worry. As your tertiary friend, I am prepared to step in and comfort you."
Howard,Thatês not really necessary.
Sheldon,"No, no. Iêll finish making the tea, while you narcissistically ramble on about whateverês troubling you."
Sheldon,Thatês what tertiary friends are for.
Raj,Who is it?
Leonard,Itês Leonard.
Raj,You canêt come in.
Leonard,I just want to talk to her.
Raj,I forbid it.
Raj,You heard me. I forbidded it.
Raj,Forbaded it?
Leonard,What are you doing here?
Leonard,Why didnêt you call?
Raj,"Clearly, she was sending you a message to take a hike, Mike."
Leonard,I know. Last time I came on too strong. Can we talk in private?
Raj,"Itês completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch! All right, you may talk in the bedroom, but I want this door to remain open! All right, just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind Iêll be right out here monitoring the situation!  Priya, this is your brother. When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail."
Sheldon,Would you be sleeping over again this evening? Because youêre welcome to.
Howard,"Thatês very nice of you, but I made other plans."
Sheldon,"Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, I stand at the ready."
Raj,Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.
Raj,"Yeah, but you were just sleeping, because I forboded you to have sex."
Leonard,The word is forbade.
Raj,Are you sure? That doesnêt sound right.
Sheldon,"Actually, he can. The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a womanês father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard."
Raj,"There it is, Priya. Weêre Indian. We believe this stuff."
Raj,"Some of it makes sense, some of itês crazy. My point is, you canêt go out with Leonard."
Penny,Who canêt go out with Leonard?
Raj,My sister.
Leonard,"Penny, this is Rajês sister, Priya."
Penny,"Oh, yeah, you, too."
Sheldon,"Priya, if youêre experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to, if I may quote Howard, do the dance with no pants."
Howard,"Hey, Bernadette, can I talk to you for a second?"
Raj,"Penny, you became disenchanted with Leonard as a lover. Would you please tell my sister why?"
Howard,"Listen, my momês going to Palm Springs to visit her sister. Thatês two whole nights in a row I can sleep over with you all the way to morning. Unless the desert air dries out her sinuses, in which case Iêll have to schlep out there with the big humidifier."
Bernadette,"Thatês it? Thatês your big solution to all of our problems? If your momês nose holds up, we get two nights together?"
Howard,Isnêt that great?
Bernadette,"No, itês not great. You need to make a choice. Me or your mother."
Howard,"Oh, uhÑ"
Bernadette,Wrong answer.
Howard,"No, wait. You didnêt let me finish."
Bernadette,Iêm listening.
Amy,I came as quickly as I could.
Penny,Okay. Why?
Amy,"To comfort you, of course. Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajeshês sister. So I high-tailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart."
Penny,"Amy, Iêm fine."
Amy,"You donêt have to be strong for me. Now letês talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch."
Amy,"In situations like this, best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman. Rawr."
Penny,"Really, I am not upset about Leonard and Priya."
Amy,Oh. Then perhaps you donêt understand whatês going on. Your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate. Arguably much more suitable than you.
Penny,"Oh. Well, good for him. Hey, what do you mean, more suitable?"
Amy,"Well, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious. But Priya is highly educated, sheês an accomplished professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex. Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows."
Penny,"Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it. So, what is all that stuff?"
Amy,"This is a portable electroencephalogram. Iêm doing research on emotions and brain activity. So when you start crying, I can see which region of the brain is activated. Then Iêm going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries. Cool, huh?"
Howard,I choose you.
Howard,Yep. I moved out of my motherês house. Cord is cut. Iêm all yours.
Bernadette,What did she say when you told her?
Howard,I donêt know. She hasnêt responded to my email yet.
Bernadette,"This is so great. I love you, Howard."
Howard,"I love you, too. So whatês for dinner?"
Bernadette,"Well, I donêt really have much of anything in the house."
Howard,Thatês fine. Why donêt we go fool around in our bedroom? And then you can go shopping.
Leonard,"I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie."
Leonard,"I love the way you say, Iêd love that."
Raj,She says it the same way I do. Iêd love that. Everybody in India says it that way. Itês not a big deal.
Raj,"Iêm not being a child. Leonard, I swear to God, if your sister ever comes to town, I shall have my way with her."
Leonard,My sisterês 38 and married.
Raj,All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.
Penny,"Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza."
Sheldon,"Thatês remarkable. If pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace German shepherds at our nationês airports."
Penny,"Oh, yes. Hi, hi. Iêm sorry. I didnêt know you had company. I donêt want to impose."
Sheldon,"No, no. Itês not an imposition. At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please, fly into our open maw, and have at it."
Penny,"If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator, I wouldnêt have to take that."
Amy,"Hi, bestie."
Penny,"Hi. So, um, Priya, youêre a lawyer, right?"
Leonard,"Oh, come on. Itês not boring at all. Sheês currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. Hmm?"
Amy,"So, how you holding up?"
Penny,Iêm fine.
Amy,"Oh, who are you kidding? Sheês breathtaking."
Penny,"Oh, yeah, yeah. Itês real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn."
Sheldon,Did you get the part?
Penny,I didnêt do the audition.
Sheldon,"Given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?"
Leonard,"Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail."
Leonard,Whose tongue?
Leonard,with my tongue in your tail?
Amy,Iêm regretting my earlier cattiness. She is an absolute delight.
Howard,"Wow, indeed."
Bernadette,I canêt believe weêre finally living together.
Howard,Yeah. You know what would make this moment perfect?
Howard,A little snack. You got any string cheese?
Bernadette,"I, I might have some cheddar."
Howard,Not as good. You canêt make strings with it. Remind me to put it on your shopping list.
Howard,You have hypo-allergenic detergent?
Howard,"Better put it on the list. If you wash my underwear with regular soap, I get little red bumps on my tuchus."
Bernadette,Wait a second. Iêm doing your laundry?
Howard,"Well, honey, itês not gonna do itself. Oh, before I forget, tomorrow morning, youêre driving me to the dentist."
Bernadette,I have to take you?
Howard,You donêt have to take me. You get to take me.
Bernadette,Wait a minute. Are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?
Howard,Itês not weird. Thereês lots of kids there with their moms.
Bernadette,I canêt believe this.
Howard,"Itês fun. If I have no cavities, afterwards, we go out for a treat."
Bernadette,"All right, Howard, letês get something straight right now. Iêm not going to be your mother."
Howard,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where did that come from?"
Howard,"Nobody wants to do that to you, Ma."
Howard,Didnêt you read my email?
Howard,Thank you.
Penny,"Oh, hey. Whatês up?"
Amy,I just wanted to check in on you.
Amy,"It seems like the appropriate thing to do when oneês best friend finds herself replaced by a smart, beautiful woman with the smouldering sexuality of a crouched Bengal tiger."
Penny,"I already told you, Iêm okay with it. I mean, if anything, Iêm quite pleased  that makes him so happy."
Amy,"Itês okay, itês okay."
Penny,Thank you.
Amy,"Now, letês get these electrodes attached and see whatês going on in that pretty little noggin of yours."
Penny,I smell Chinese food.
Sheldon,Itês actually Thai. Youêre slipping.
Penny,Are Leonard and Priya here?
Sheldon,They went to Catalina for the weekend.
Penny,Oh. Whereês Raj?
Sheldon,"At home, forbidding it."
Penny,How about Howard?
Sheldon,Iêm given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.
Penny,"Oh, okay. Well, I guess itês just the two of us, huh?"
Sheldon,"Actually, itês the three of us."
Amy,"What up, bestie? Good news. Thanks to you, I was able to make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist."
Amy,"So, you feeling better?"
Penny,Not really.
Amy,"Sheldon, you have a guest whoês upset."
Sheldon,Right. Iêll make tea.
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, itês okay. I donêt want tea."
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. Itês not optional.
Sheldon,"Buona sera, Luigiês Pizza. Buona sera. It means good evening in Italian. May I say, having to explain that to you calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante?"
Leonard,"Okay, Iêm out of here."
Sheldon,"Un momento. Oh, for heavenês sake, now youêre being deliberately stupid.  Where are you going?"
Leonard,Iêm having dinner with Priya at Rajês. I think Howardês going to be there. You want to join us?
Sheldon,"But tonightês Thursday. On Thursdays, everybody comes over here and has pizza. Or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi, but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan."
Leonard,Canêt we make a one-time exception for tonight?
Sheldon,"We could. We could also stop using the letter M, but I think that idea is isguided and oronic."
Leonard,Just come with me to Rajês.
Sheldon,"Well, I donêt want to go to a party."
Leonard,"Itês not a party. Itês the same group of people who hang out here, hanging out over there."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party."
Leonard,How come itês not a party when we do it here?
Sheldon,Because we donêt throw parties.
Leonard,"I donêt know what to tell you, Sheldon. Iêm going to see Priya. Everyoneês over there. You coming or not?"
Sheldon,"Well, no, sir, and do you know why? In a word, tradition. Every Thursday night for the last eight years, you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you."
Leonard,I guess youêre right. See you later.
Sheldon,Wait! Leonard! Wait! What am I going to do for dinner?
Leonard,Come with me to Rajês and eat there.
Sheldon,I canêt do that. What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?
Leonard,I really doubt thatês what heêll serve.
Sheldon,"But what if he does? Iêll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheepês stomach. And frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing. I donêt know why heês serving both."
Leonard,"What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?"
Sheldon,"No, Iêll go to your haggis party. But Iêm telling you, this is adness. This is utter and coplete adness."
Sheldon,"Oh, dear!"
Sheldon,Rajês television. I just realized weêre about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.
Leonard,So donêt watch TV. Read a book.
Sheldon,"And be a social pariah? Oh, you know thatês not my style."
Sheldon,"The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?"
Sheldon,Is it about me or the dead pixels?
Raj,"Hey, youêre just in time. We made Tex-Mex."
Leonard,"Oh, sounds great."
Sheldon,"Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex. Might as well have had the Chinese pizza."
Howard,"Thatês got to be fun for you, huh? Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sisterês mouth?"
Sheldon,"Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit."
Sheldon,"Oh, what fun. Weêre like hippies at a love-in."
Leonard,Just sit here.
Sheldon,"Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, itês Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcererês Stone."
Raj,"Okay, weêve got fajitas with all the fixins, so you make your own."
Sheldon,"Wonderful. Dinner, some assembly required."
Sheldon,A margarita? Where are we? What is happening?
Penny,"Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What can I get ya?"
Sheldon,Water. Neat. With a little umbrella.
Penny,Where are all your friends?
Sheldon,"Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight, roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape, and a stern expression for my cowl."
Sheldon,Excuse me? Isnêt this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?
Penny,"Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right. Whatês troubling you, buddy?"
Sheldon,"I donêt think your heartês in it, but since you asked. Apparently, because Leonard is dating Rajês sister, weêre all forced to hang out at his apartment."
Penny,"Oh, the horror."
Sheldon,"Indeed. Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music, and his sister took off her shoes. It was like the last days of Caligula.  Oh, I have to get this. Umbrella?"
Sheldon,Wonder what sheês exasperated about. Hello?
Amy,"Sheldon, are you all right? When last we spoke, you were going to take a taxi home from Rajês, but according to Facebook, you just checked in at the Cheesecake Factory."
Sheldon,"Yes, I was in a taxi, but the driver didnêt look at all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran for it."
Penny,There you go. Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.
Amy,"Hi, bestie."
Penny,"Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been?"
Amy,"Fine. From this angle, I can see up your nose."
Penny,"Yeah, itês a great time to be alive, isnêt it?"
Sheldon,Donêt worry. My problems can wait while you two hens finish your clucking.
Penny,"Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya. She is staying with Raj. That means youêre all probably gonna be hanging out there more."
Amy,"Penny, Iêm sorry you got dragged into this. I know youêre devastated that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new lover with flawless, caramel-coloured skin."
Penny,"Okay, Iêm not upset about Leonard and Priya."
Amy,Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.
Amy,"Sheldon, look at me. I think itês time to face the fact that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group. Where he goes, the group goes."
Sheldon,Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. Iêm the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time.
Amy,Iêm not saying that youêre not fun. Youêre the most fun person I know.
Penny,A lot of people think Iêm fun to be around.
Amy,"Donêt be needy, bestie. Thatês probably part of what chased Leonard away. What I am saying, Sheldon, is that your group is Leonard-centric. If it were a town, it would be Leonardville. If it were an Islamic nation, Leonardstan. If it were the birthplace of motion pictures, weêd all be singing Hooray for Leonardwood."
Penny,"Ooh, I got one. If you guys were a band, youêd be called Leonard and the Leonards."
Amy,So needy.
Leonard,What you doing?
Sheldon,Iêm setting out snacks.
Leonard,You do realize everyoneês eating at Rajês again tonight?
Sheldon,"I didnêt say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?"
Leonard,Youêre having people over?
Sheldon,"Yes. Must be killing you wondering who. Fine, Iêll tell you. Stuart from the comic bookstore, Barry Kripke from the university, Pennyês ex-boyfriend Zack and TVês LeVar Burton."
Leonard,Really? LeVar Burtonês coming here?
Sheldon,Possibly. I Tweeted him.
Leonard,"Okay, well, tell him I loved him on Star Trek."
Sheldon,"Please, Leonard, stop trying to horn in on my new friends."
Leonard,Of course. Good night.
Sheldon,"We had a good run, you and I."
Sheldon,But change is a part of life.
Leonard,It certainly is.
Sheldon,Okay. I have guests coming. Iêm afraid Iêm going to have to ask you to leave now.
Leonard,I am leaving.
Sheldon,"Donêt make this harder than it is, Leonard."
Leonard,"Good-bye, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"And good-bye to you, sir. Heêll be back."
Leonard,Of course Iêll be back. I live here!
Sheldon,"Well, it would appear LeVar Burton wonêt be joining us so letês get started. Um, I thought weêd begin by going around the room, introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why weêre here. Okay. Iêm Sheldon. Uh, for regular readers of The New England Journal of High Energy Physics, I need no introduction. If youêre not familiar with that publication, thereês a free copy in your goody bag. Stuart?"
Sheldon,"Thatês very nice, Stuart. Zack?"
Sheldon,Of course. Barry?
Sheldon,"Patience, patience, Barry. The whaffleÑ the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly."
Sheldon,"Yes, you must be present to win."
Penny,"Oh, hey."
Amy,"Yo, P-dog."
Penny,Whatês up?
Bernadette,Weêre here to kidnap you for a girlsê night out.
Amy,"Parenthetical, the term kidnap is being used playfully."
Penny,I kind of figured that.
Amy,Good. Now put this pillowcase over your head.
Amy,"She used to be much more fun, until Leonard punched her in the heart."
Bernadette,"We just thought you might want to go out and have a good time, maybe go dancing."
Penny,"Oh. Gee, thanks, but Iêm not really in the mood."
Amy,You do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.
Penny,"Okay, look, if I agree to go out with you guys, will you promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?"
Penny,All right. Iêll go change. Come on in.
Amy,"If youêd have let me bring the chloroform, we wouldnêt have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber."
Sheldon,Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?
Sheldon,"Jacuzzi is a commercial brand. Hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis."
Sheldon,"Surprisingly, yes."
Sheldon,The water level rose.
Sheldon,"Of course it did. Itês said that Archimedes, the ancient Greek mathematician, discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath."
Sheldon,"Forgive me, but I think youêll find my story is more interesting."
Sheldon,"Better. It has a gold crown. You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. But, while bathing, Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose."
Sheldon,"When he finished, he shouted Eureka!"
Sheldon,"All right, that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening. Whoês ready to play some vintage video games? And tonightês selections include ColecoVisionês Smurf Rescue in Gargamelês Castle, Atariês Cookie Monster Munch, and for you text adventure aficionados, Zork. Pick me, pick me. Iêm fun."
Sheldon,Iêm unhappy.
Leonard,This is delicious. Whereêd you learn to make chili?
Leonard,I hope she wasnêt anything like my flatmate from Texas.
Howard,"Oh, please. That crazy bastardês looking at quirky in the rearview mirror."
Leonard,"Did you know that, per our roommate agreement, I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower? And not in the sink. We each have special buckets."
Howard,"Raj, did you ever tell your sister about the time Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?"
Raj,"Nope. Gates gave a speech at the university. Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said, maybe if you werenêt so distracted by sick children in Africa, you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista.î"
Leonard,Bam. Right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC.
Raj,Iêd like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful Sheldon-free evening.
Leonard,"Hear, hear."
Howard,Cheers. You realize thatês the first time weêve ever done that without having to listen to Sheldon tell us why itês called a toast?
Leonard,"Oh, the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls."
Raj,Sheldon tells it better.
Leonard,He kind of does.
Leonard,"Aw, hell, I miss him."
Penny,"So, where do you guys want to go dancing?"
Bernadette,We were hoping youêd know a place.
Amy,"Yes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly with young, beautiful bodies sweating and writhing against each other in a glorious orgy of the flesh."
Penny,"Oh, yeah, I know that place. What do you think?"
Amy,"That should display enough of your bosom to attract a new mate, or a hungry infant."
Penny,"Okay, letês go through this one more time. Just because Leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy."
Bernadette,"But you could if you wanted to, right?"
Penny,"Well, yeah, I guess."
Bernadette,"Pick out the hottest guy in the room, take him home, do unspeakable things to him, then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face and teeth marks on his heinie?"
Penny,More or less.
Amy,Whatês that like?
Penny,"I donêt know. Itês fun while youêre doing it. And then after, itês mostly embarrassment, self-loathing and regret."
Bernadette,I would take that deal all day long.
Penny,"Yeah, well, itês not gonna happen tonight. You know, for the first time in my life, I am not in a relationship, and Iêm totally okay with it."
Amy,"You know, if being on your own is new to you, Iêd be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques for ladies Iêve perfected over the years. For example, do you have an electric toothbrush?"
Penny,"Um, no."
Amy,You should get one.
Bernadette,Whatês that?
Amy,It appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic.
Penny,"Oh, itês a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year."
Bernadette,"Oh, God, that is so romantic."
Penny,"Yeah, it was."
Bernadette,Leonardês really one of a kind.
Amy,"Saying that while holding a snowflake is a little bit heavy-handed, donêt you think?"
Penny,"Let me see that. Oh, screw it. I can deal with a little self-loathing. Letês go find me a heinie to bite."
Amy,"Outstanding. And if we fail, we can always stop at CVS and pick you out a nice toothbrush. I call mine Gerard."
Bernadette,Thatês kind of creepy.
Leonard,He actually got pretty good. He made us all matching serapes.
Raj,I still wear mine when thereês a nip in the air.
Leonard,Long before the cats. I think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. I still have some of the currency.
Howard,I think itês like Beetlejuice. We said his name too many times.
Raj,Come on in.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Leonard,Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.
Sheldon,I had to leave. They were having fun wrong.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,Are there beans in it?
Sheldon,"Then itês not chili. Real chili has no beans in it, but youêre from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven."
Sheldon,"Yes, please. Your girlfriendês a little short-tempered."
Raj,"Iêd like to propose a toast to friends, no matter how quirky."
Sheldon,"Priya, do you know why this is called a toast?"
Sheldon,Sheês also a bit of a know-it-all. Mmm. This is good. Whatever it is.
Leonard,"Mm-hmm. Great. Hey, can I ask you something?"
Leonard,"Last night, me wanting to try that stuff out of the Kama Sutra, was that fun for you or kinda racially insensitive?"
Leonard,"Hey, if you can find a book called weird sex with white boys, Iêd be okay with that."
Leonard,I tried in the seventh grade. I could never get used to them.
Leonard,"Yeah, if I had contacts I would have been the coolest debate club president ever to be stuffed into his own cello case."
Leonard,Th-th-th-thatês okay. I can infer from context.
Howard,"Hey, Raj, wanna see a new magic trick Iêve been working on?"
Sheldon,"Howard, if I may interject here with a piece of friendly advice. Is working on magic tricks really how you want to spend your time? Granted, youêre just an engineer, but that doesnêt mean you might not someday build a geegaw or a thingamabob that may get you a thank you in someone elseês Nobel prize acceptance speech."
Raj,"Is the trick making him disappear? Sure, letês see it."
Howard,"Here, shuffle these."
Howard,"Now spread them out on the table face down. Pick one, look at it."
Howard,"Now remember your card, put it back in the deck."
Sheldon,Is it any wonder he doesnêt have a doctorate?
Howard,"Remind me, whatês your birthday?"
Raj,October sixth.
Howard,"Okay, October is the tenth month. So ten, one plus zero is one, plus six is seven. Turn over the seventh card."
Raj,How about that!
Howard,Is that your card?
Raj,"Yes, it is. Very cool!"
Sheldon,Itês not cool. Itês a childish trick designed to confuse and intrigue simpletons. Howêd you do it?
Howard,A magician never reveals his secrets. But surely a future Nobel prize winner can figure it out.
Sheldon,Fine. Give me a second.
Howard,"You ever notice when he thinks real hard, it smells like bacon?"
Leonard,Sorry! Oop!
Leonard,"Sorry! Pardon me! Oh, Iêm so sorry! My fault! Check it out. I just got contacts."
Penny,"One, two, three, four, five. No way."
Howard,"Thatês your card, right?"
Penny,Seven of clubs! That is amazing!
Sheldon,Itês not amazing. All magic tricks are merely a combination of manipulation and misdirection with the occasional dwarf in a box wiggling his feet.
Howard,"Oh, really? So how did I do it?"
Sheldon,"Well, I donêt care how you did it. I have more important things to think about. Clearly, the cards are marked."
Howard,I thought you had more important things to think about.
Sheldon,"I do. You just happen to have caught me on a break. Oh, let me see those cards."
Penny,"Oh, big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun."
Sheldon,Not knowing is part of the fun. Was that the motto of your community college?
Leonard,"Hey, guys, what do you think? Priya took me clothes shopping."
Penny,"Hey, you look great. Good for you, Priya. I could never get that stupid hoodie off him when we wereÑ well, you look great."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,"Yeah, good. New contacts. I should have done this years ago."
Howard,So you finally getting used to them doing it on a daily basis?
Penny,Iêm not going out with him. He can sleep with whoever he wants.
Howard,"Yeah, I was talking to Raj."
Sheldon,This deck is rigged in some fashion.
Howard,Fine. Get another deck and Iêll do the trick with that.
Sheldon,So youêre saying this is a regulation deck?
Howard,"Iêm saying believe in magic, you muggle."
Penny,"You know, well, Iêm happy Leonardês found someone. Not that anybody asked."
Leonard,Just two. Everyday and dress.
Leonard,"Oh, my god, youêre breaking up with me! Why would you take me out shopping and then break up with me? That is so cruel."
Leonard,"Oh, okay. So, whatês up?"
Leonard,"I know. I usually never see my ex-girlfriends, unless their hard drives crash."
Leonard,"Um, not great, I guess. But Penny and I are just friends."
Leonard,"No, no-no-no, Iêm ready! I gave up the gift of sight for you. If thatês not moving on, what is?"
Leonard,Oh. Okay.
Leonard,"No, no, Iêm confident. Itês not like Iêm unfamiliar with the get lost conversation. Although, this will be the first time Iêll be the one saying it."
Leonard,"Sure. Oh, god, you smell so good. Of course, that could just be my other senses getting stronger. Hypothetically, if I had access To a Lieutenant Uhura uniform, would you wear it?"
Leonard,"Iêm sorry. Iêm, never mind."
Howard,And was your card the jack of diamonds?
Penny,"Oh, unbelievable! Know how he did it yet?"
Penny,"Aw, he has the same look my little nephew gets when he canêt figure out how I got his nose."
Howard,"You know, I have some remedial magic tricks that might be more your speed. Like, ooh, look! The pencilês rubber!"
Penny,"Hey, I think I know how you did the card trick."
Sheldon,"Oh, oh, please, if I donêt know, you donêt know. Thatês axiomatic."
Penny,Come here. 
Howard,Youêre right.
Penny,Not too bad for someone who doesnêt know what axiomatic means.
Leonard,"Oh, hi."
Penny,"Hey, you. What happened with the contacts?"
Leonard,One of themês upstairs. The other one sort of slipped back into my skull.
Penny,"Hey, is that one of the new shirts Priya got you?"
Penny,You donêt wanna wash that.
Penny,"No, thatês silk. Seriously, what would you do without me?"
Penny,"You know, I gotta tell you, I think you got a real winner with Priya."
Leonard,"Yeah, me, too."
Penny,"She seems really sweet. Believe me, you do not want to take that for granted. There are a lot of bitches out there."
Leonard,"Yeah, bitches are the worst."
Penny,"All right, well Iêll see you later."
Leonard,"Uh, Penny, thereês something I have to tell you."
Leonard,"Okay, uh, how do I put this? Um, are you familiar with Darwinês observation of the finches in the Galapagos Islands?"
Penny,Did they make a movie about it?
Penny,Then no.
Leonard,"All right, well, anyway, Darwin observed that when two groups of finches competed over the same food source, eventually one of them would evolve a different beak shape so they could feed on something else."
Leonard,So what do you think we can learn from that behaviour that we can apply to our own lives?
Penny,"Uh, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?"
Leonard,"Sure, that has birds in it."
Penny,"Itês fun talking to you, Leonard, I always learn stuff."
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, but Iêm gonna count that."
Leonard,Yeah. The doctor didnêt want me to rub my eye during the night. It was either this or one of those giant neck cones.
Leonard,"Oh, yes. Indeed, I did."
Leonard,She completely understood everything I said. Case closed.
Leonard,"Maybe, but thatês not my problem. Sheês not my girlfriend, you are."
Leonard,"Is the autumn cruel for letting the flowers die, or is that just natureês way?"
Sheldon, Leonard?
Sheldon,"I think I figured out Wolowitzês magic trick, and I need you to pick a card."
Leonard,"I am not opening that door, Sheldon."
Sheldon,As you wish.  Did you pick one?
Sheldon, Is this your card?
Leonard, Nope.
Sheldon,Drat. Is this your card?
Sheldon,Iêll be right back.
Sheldon,"Pick a card, Sheldon. Now look at it, and put it back in the deck. Now do you remember your card? Of course I do, I have an eidetic memory. My apologies. Now shuffle the cards. Shuffling. Wait here. Processing image, cross-referencing."
Leonard,Whatcha doinê?
Sheldon,Iêm reverse engineering Wolowitzês magic trick.
Leonard,Whatês up with the infrared cameras?
Sheldon,"Iêm measuring residual heat levels on the playing cards to determine which oneês been touched. By the way, if you hope to have children, I suggest you switch from briefs to boxers. Your testicles look a tad warm."
Leonard,"Holy crap, are you connected to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory?"
Sheldon,Yes. Iêm using their Cray Supercomputer to analyze shuffling patterns.
Leonard,"Sheldon, that computer is used for National defence. Hacking into it is a Federal crime."
Sheldon,"Relax, weêre not under attack right now."
Leonard,"Okay, Iêm leaving before the black helicopters get here."
Sheldon,"And is this my card? Rats! I wonder if Howard used a radioactive tracer. Where am I going to find Uranium-235 this time of night? Come on, Craigslist."
Leonard,Is it racist that I took you to an Indian restaurant?
Leonard,"Or as you probably call it back home, food."
Leonard,"No, no, I do. Itês just I knew I was having curry tonight and I only want one part of my body to burn at a time."
Leonard,Does that mean youêd relocate here permanently?
Penny,Hi! Hi! Just hang on.
Leonard,Small world.
Leonard,"Of course, I did. I talked and talked and talked."
Penny,"Hey! Look at Leonard in his fancy-ass grownup clothes. Way to go, Priya. For once, he doesnêt look like a mannequin in the boysê department. Hey, did he tell you I saved the silk shirt?"
Penny,"He was gonna throw it in the washing machine with his Spiderman underwear. Thatês our Lenny, huh?"
Penny,"So, howês the food here? Oh, wow, that is really, really good. Oh, Iêm sorry. You guys are on a date. We can hang out anytime. Have fun."
Penny,"Oh, thatês, hot, hot, hot, hot! Whoo! It really sneaks up on ya, huh? All right, I gotta go."
Leonard,It is pretty spicy.
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêve been meaning to tell you, I figured out your magic trick."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. In fact, I improved upon it."
Howard,"Iêd love to see that. How about you, Raj?"
Raj,Beefaroni and a show? How do you turn that down?
Sheldon,All right. Pick a card.
Howard,Whatês with the wand and the beep?
Sheldon,"The wand is called showmanship, and the beep is none of your business. Oh! Excuse me, Iêm getting a text message completely unrelated to this magic trick. Oh, look, my dry cleaningês ready. And your card was the five of spades. Ta-da."
Raj,These cards have barcodes on them. The wand is a reader. Itês transmitting to your phone.
Sheldon,"I said, ta-da. Showês over."
Howard,"Thatês pathetic. Let me show you how a real magician does it. Raj, take a card. Donêt let me see it."
Howard,Three of clubs. 
Raj,"Son of a gun, youêre blowing my mind!"
Sheldon,That does it. Iêm getting uranium.
Raj,You ever gonna tell him?
Howard,Maybe. When it stops being fun.
Raj,So never.
Penny,"Oh, hey, I was just on my way to work."
Leonard,"Oh, okay, itês not important. It can wait."
Penny,"No, itês all right. Walk me down. So, whatês up?"
Leonard,"Uh, I kind of have a problem I was hoping you could help me with."
Penny,"Sure, anything."
Leonard,Move out.
Leonard,"Well, uh, not far. Hey, if you ever wanna start a family, La Ca_ada has some great schools."
Penny,"Okay, Iêm not moving anywhere. What the hell is this all about?"
Leonard,"Why does it have to be about anything? Canêt a fella ask his buddy to relocate, no questions asked?"
Penny,"Oh, for godês sake, Leonard, this is about Priya, isnêt it? She doesnêt want me hanging out with you."
Leonard,"Yes. There, I said it."
Penny,"Okay, look, I happen to like your girlfriend."
Leonard,And she likes you.
Penny,"No, she doesnêt."
Leonard,"Not really, no."
Penny,"It doesnêt matter. Look, I promise from now on I will keep my distance from you."
Leonard,"Well, now, hold on. What kind of distance are we talking about? Because we are neighbours. I mean, I can hear the toilet flush in your apartment."
Penny,You can hear my toilet flush?
Leonard,"I donêt listen for it, but itês nice to know everythingês okay with your plumbing. The buildingês plumbing."
Penny,"Leonard, I get it. Youêre in a new relationship now. And Iêm happy for you. So why donêt we just shake hands and part friends?"
Leonard,"Well, now hold on, how about this? How about we still hang out, but on the down-low?"
Penny,Are you really that kind of guy?
Leonard,I actually felt kinda silly just saying on the down-low.
Penny,"Good-bye, Leonard."
Leonard,"Penny, wait.  Damned contacts."
Raj,"Why so glum, chum?"
Sheldon,"Apparently, you canêt hack into a government supercomputer and then try to buy uranium without the Department of Homeland Security tattling to your mother."
Howard,"Oh, thatês too bad. Figure out the magic trick yet?"
Sheldon,Figure out the magic trick yet?
Howard,Want me to tell you how to do it?
Howard,Iêll show you one more time. Raj?
Sheldon,"Hang on. This time do it with me, so I can make sure thereês no monkey business."
Howard,All right. . Two of hearts.
Sheldon,I hate you.
Howard,"Yeah, heês gonna win the Nobel prize."
Sheldon,"Why hast thou forsaken me, O deity whose existence I doubt?"
Leonard,Whatês going on?
Sheldon,"They stole everything, Leonard, everything."
Leonard,"Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?"
Leonard,"Oh, my God, what did they get?"
Sheldon,"What didnêt they get? They got my enchanted weapons, my vicious gladiator armour, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold."
Leonard,You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?
Sheldon,"What choice did I have? The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf, hero of the Eastern kingdoms, has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun. Plus, the FBI hung up on me."
Sheldon,They took my battle ostrich.
Leonard,"Oh, no, not Glenn?"
Sheldon,"Yes, Glenn! The only bird I ever loved."
Leonard,"Thank you, officer."
Sheldon,Wait a minute! Youêre not going to do anything?
Sheldon,Doctor Cooper.
Leonard,Not the kind with access to drugs.
Sheldon,"Thatês from Avatar, World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth. Goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun? Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?"
Sheldon,"You know, one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules, and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?"
Leonard,"Thank you, officer."
Sheldon,Itês all gone. All gone.
Leonard,"Iêm really sorry, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"What kind of world do we live in, where a man would take another manês battle ostrich?"
Leonard,I donêt know.
Sheldon,"This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. It is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."
Leonard,"Iêm on it.  Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there? Okay, thanks. That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath."
Sheldon,See if Raj is done with Pilates.
Sheldon,"Three thousand hours. Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse, collecting weapons and gold. Itês almost as if it was a huge waste of time."
Howard,"Whoever did this knew what they were doing. He got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes, transferred all your stuff, and didnêt leave a digital fingerprint."
Sheldon,Oh! There isnêt enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart.
Raj,"Hold on. Iêm talking to an orc under the bridge in Thunder Bluff who says if we pay him, heêll help us track down your things."
Sheldon,Can we trust him?
Raj,"I should say so, he appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family."
Howard,Whoa! Somebodyês auctioning off a jewelled ostrich bridle!
Sheldon,"Glennês was leather. He was a simple ostrich. Is! Is, I havenêt given up hope."
Leonard,"Hey, Penny. Weêre kind of in the middle of a crisis, here."
Penny,"Oh, I know. Bernadette told me. Sorry, Sheldon. I know that game meant a lot to you."
Sheldon,"That game? Excuse me, Penny, but Doodle Jump is a game. Angry Birds is a game. World of Warcraft is a massively multi-player online role-playingÑ all right, technically itês a game."
Raj,"Bad news, the Nigerian prince may be a fraud."
Penny,"Okay, well, anyways, I brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!"
Sheldon,Stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich.
Penny,Just say thank you.
Sheldon,I thought I just did.
Penny,All right. See you later.
Penny,"Oh, hi! I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon. He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap thatês useful in a make-believe place."
Penny,"Yeah, well, sadly, I do."
Penny,Did you know last weekend Priya took Leonard rollerblading at the beach? Can you believe that?
Bernadette,"I feel like Iêm supposed to say that bitch, but I donêt have enough information."
Penny,"I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste, I had to carry him to the water."
Bernadette,I took Howard to the beach once. He almost burst into flames like a vampire.
Penny,So whatês the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material? I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.
Amy,I think youêre on.
Bernadette,Oh. That bitch!
Penny,Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?
Amy,"Ah, hereês the alcohol and drug peer pressure Mother warned me about. I was starting to think it was never going to happen. Yes, please."
Penny,"You guys shouldêve seen Leonard when I first met him. There was no eye contact. He was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes."
Amy,Iêm drunk.
Penny,"You know, for the first couple of months, whenever I would take off my bra, he would giggle and say, oh boy, my breast friends."
Bernadette,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, Iêm never speaking to Priya again."
Penny,"No, donêt do that. No reason to be mean to her."
Amy,"This may be the alcohol talking, but I believe there is. Are you familiar with the recent study of Tanzanian chimpanzees by Nishida and Hosaka out of Kyoto University?"
Penny,"No, but I can name all the Kardashians."
Amy,"Primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop. Bernadetteês urge to shun, scowl or fling her waste at Priya is hard-wired into her DNA."
Bernadette,I donêt have an urge to fling my waste.
Amy,"Believe me, itês there, we all have it. Hit me with some more booze, and Iêll show you."
Howard,"All right, here we are, this is the tavern where all the black-market weapon trades go down."
Raj,I donêt think my character should be in a place like this. Everyoneês undressing her with their eyes.
Howard,Maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up.
Leonard,"Okay, what exactly are we looking for?"
Howard,"Redheaded troll, goes by the name of Glumly. According to the message boards, if you want to move stolen goods and itês after school hours, heês your guy."
Leonard,"Uh, we are. In the meantime, youêre welcome to whip up a quick character and join us."
Leonard,"Well, you have to put in a credit card number, but itês fun."
Howard,Our troll just walked in! I got him!
Leonard,We got him. Weêre almost done.
Howard,"So, how do you guys want to play this?"
Sheldon,"Be ruthless. You tell him if he doesnêt start talking, weêll register a complaint with his Internet service provider."
Raj,"Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet from his cable company? He could lose his HBO and all their delightful original programming."
Sheldon,"I donêt care! Iêm losinê it, man!"
Leonard,"Why donêt we play this smart? Try a little good goblin, bad goblin."
Howard,"Nah, I think we have to be more subtle."
Raj,"Okay, I see where this is going. Fine, Iêll have sex with him."
Leonard,Thatês not where it was going.
Raj,"Good, because I would hate that."
Leonard,"Oh, wait. Hang on. Are you upset?"
Leonard,"Good, good. Iêll tell you what happens."
Sheldon,And people think I donêt get sarcasm.
Amy,"Well, well, well. Look who it is."
Penny,"Okay, be nice."
Penny,Hi. Weêre just heading out for a drink.
Amy,Because I do that now.
Bernadette,Count your blessings youêre not a Tanzanian chimp.
Penny,"Donêt listen to her, sheês had a lot of ice cream. Do you want to join us?"
Amy,"Four women walk down the stairs, how many reach the lobby?"
Leonard,Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?
Raj,"Oh, no, donêt put me in the middle of this. Iêm not going to be your go-between."
Leonard,"Come on, help me out. Am I in trouble?"
Raj,Thereês no reason to worry.
Leonard,Thatês a relief.
Raj,Iêm sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights skyping with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.
Howard,"Good news, gentlemen, I found our hacker."
Howard,"Yeah. No one can hide from me, not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego, not even topless Natalie Portman."
Sheldon,"Iêve never said these words before, but good job, Howard!"
Howard,"Thanks. Our culprit is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711 Ocean View Road, Carlsbad, California."
Sheldon,The name and the address drip with evil.
Raj,What else do we know about him?
Howard,"Well, quite a bit, actually."
Leonard,Iêll bet heês some loser who lives with his parents.
Howard,"Yes, he does live with his parents. Hereês a Google Earth shot of their house."
Sheldon,Excellent! Itês in a cul-de-sac. We can box him in.
Leonard,"Hold on, youêre thinking of going there?"
Sheldon,Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.
Leonard,"Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?"
Sheldon,"I donêt know if youêve been following the news, Leonard, but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture."
Leonard,No oneês getting tortured.
Sheldon,"Fine, weêll abide by the Geneva Convention. But ask yourself this, in the course of our lives, how much lunch money has been taken from us? How many kites? How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers?"
Raj,I totally had one of those.
Sheldon,"Of course you did. It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. But the bullies took it from us. Well, no more. Tonight, we take back our dignity, our birthright and our pride. What do you say? Whoês with me?"
Raj,"I have a hip-hop aerobics class at five, could we go after?"
Howard,"Also, tonightês the Sabbath and my mother and I have a tradition of lighting the candles and"
Sheldon,Fine. Leonard?
Leonard,"Oh, geez, I donêt know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row."
Raj,"Oh, come on, man. Bros beforeÑ my sister."
Leonard,"Aw, screw it. Iêm in."
Raj,"Me, too."
Howard,And me.
Sheldon,"One moment.  Iêm hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal, not the common cold."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, I thought this delay was so you could watch Wheel of Fortune with your mother."
Howard,"I am. Sheês just bleaching her moustache. Check it out. Hey, Ma! Before and After! Four words, 17 letters, two Nês, one V."
Leonard,Thatês incredible.
Howard,"Yeah, sheês kind of a Wheel savant."
Leonard,"Uh-oh, thatês Priya."
Raj,"Sitar music for her ringtone is not cool, dude."
Leonard,"Hit theÑ Hey, sweetie. Yeah, Iêm sorry. Iêm gonna be working late. I, I, I miss you, too. Okay, sure, Iêll call you when I get home. Okay, bye-bye."
Raj,Very nice. You lie to my sister.
Howard,Thatês the nicest thing he does to your sister.
Raj,"Oh, guess who."
Leonard,Cover for me.
Raj,"Hello, Priya. Whatês up? How would I know if Leonardês at work or not? Donêt be suspicious. Look, if you want your relationship with Leonard to continue, youêre going to have to believe whatever wild-eyed, cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you. Okay? Yeah, bye-bye. You owe me."
Howard,"New puzzle, Ma. Same name. One N, two Dês, three Oês."
Sheldon,Thatês uncanny.
Howard,"I know. Itês her superpower. Well, that and jiggling her arm fat."
Leonard,I canêt believe weêre going all the way to San Diego to confront this guy.
Howard,"Yeah, weêre kind of bad-asses, arenêt we?"
Raj,"Hey, how about we stay the night and hit Legoland in the morning?"
Sheldon,"Sea World is better. It has Shamu, who is literally tons of fun. But for the moment, letês stay focused on Todd Zarnecki."
Raj,"Yeah, weêre coming for you, Todd Zarnecki. And for the record, Legoland is more interactive."
Sheldon,"I almost feel sorry for the poor fool, sitting in his split-level suburban ranch, unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the San Diego Freeway at 71 miles an hour. Ease up there, lead foot. You trying to get us killed?"
Raj,I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.
Sheldon,This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix.
Raj,Itês a re-writable CD. Just put it in.
Howard,Beyonce? Really?
Raj,Sheês curvy and she owns it. I like that.
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, Iêm feeling it."
Sheldon,We are winged fury! Which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit.
Howard,"Next time we go to kick someoneês ass, we take the train."
Sheldon,I always prefer the train.
Leonard,"Sheldon, letês go."
Howard,Why did you bring that?
Sheldon,No weapon strikes more fear into a manês heart than a Klingon batêleth.
Leonard,"Okay, letês get clear on something. Weêre just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No oneês batêlething anybody."
Sheldon,So my blade shall not taste blood tonight?
Sheldon,"Well, now I just feel silly holding it."
Leonard,Come on.
Sheldon,Can I at least kick down the door?
Leonard,"Youêre welcome to try, but the other day, it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box. "
Sheldon,Your doom!
Raj,Donêt say your doom. Who opens the door for their doom?
Sheldon,Good point. Basket of puppies.
Leonard,"Uh, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,Are you Todd Zarnecki?
Sheldon,I am Sheldor of Azeroth. I want my things back.
Sheldon,Careful. Thatês a collectible.
Sheldon,"Well, heês even more cunning than we thought."
Sheldon,"You know, the jokeês on him. Without the certificate of authenticity, that batêleth is worthless."
Howard,"Yeah, he walked right into our trap."
Raj,Legoland seems like a hollow dream now.
Raj,Whatês the matter?
Leonard,"Somethingês wrong, Iêm not getting any gas. Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?"
Sheldon,Of course.
Raj,Very basic.
Howard,19th-century technology.
Leonard,Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?
Howard,"No, not a clue."
Leonard,"Well, weêd better call somebody to come pick us up."
Sheldon,Itêd be swell if they had a train.
Sheldon,"Thank you, Penny."
Penny,"No problem. So, Leonard, I think itês interesting you didnêt call your girlfriend to come get you."
Leonard,"Uh, I kind of told her I was working."
Penny,So you lied to her. Also interesting.
Leonard,"Yeah, she doesnêt really understand the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing."
Penny,"Well, doesnêt matter if she gets it, as long as sheês pretty."
Howard,"This oneês funny, Leonard. How come you couldnêt make it work with her?"
Penny,So did you at least get Sheldonês fake stuff back?
Sheldon,We failed in our noble quest.
Penny,How come?
Sheldon,Todd Zarnecki was mean.
Penny,All right. Hang on.
Leonard,What are you doing?
Penny,Iêm gonna show you how we finish a quest in Nebraska. Oh. Beyonce.  This ainêt no Beyonce.
Penny,Give my friend his stuff back.
Penny,"Well, then, good news. Todayês the day a girlês finally going to touch you in your little special place.  Now give him his stuff back."
Sheldon,"We did it! I said, we."
Penny,"Oh, hi."
Penny,Going to see Leonard?
Penny,Fine. You?
Penny,"Alright, well great seeing you."
Penny,Amyês right. I do want to fling my poop at her.
Amy,"Iêm glad you talked me into this. We work so hard, sometimes, itês nice to goof off and do something silly."
Sheldon,Agreed. Wait till you hear how he dumbs down Werner Heisenberg for the crowd. You may actually believe youêre in a comedy club.
Amy,"Say, I heard an interesting tidbit about Howard and Bernadette."
Sheldon,"Really, Amy? Gossip? Iêm disappointed in you."
Amy,"Now, now. Evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar has identified gossip as an aid to social bonding in large groups."
Sheldon,"Forgive my language, but poppycock."
Amy,"What if heês right? And by not participating in gossip, society breaks down into small feral bands of tattooed motorcycle riders fighting to the death over the last few cans of tuna fish?"
Sheldon,"Fine. In the parlance of the urban music scene, whatês the 4-1-1?"
Amy,Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard.
Sheldon,"I believe our nationês tuna cans are safe. Excuse me. Dr. Greene, question?"
Sheldon,Youêve dedicated your lifeês work to educating the general populace about complex scientific ideas.
Sheldon,"Have you ever considered trying to do something useful? Perhaps, reading to the elderly?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, but not your books. Something they might enjoy. I kid, of course. Big fan."
Leonard,Nice shot.
Sheldon,Thank you. My father taught me archery as a child. Itês odd how the activity brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.
Sheldon,"I know. What an elf I would have made. Whoo, what do you think youêre doing?"
Leonard,Shooting at a target?
Sheldon,With what?
Leonard,An arrow.
Sheldon,Really? I didnêt see you draw one from your quiver.
Leonard,"Iêm not going to do that, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Leonard, the people at Nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience. We have to do our part, too.  That was uncalled for, but Iêll play along. Ow! I had an unusual experience with Amy last night."
Leonard,Really? How could you tell?
Sheldon,She was attempting to engage me in gossip.
Leonard,You donêt say?
Sheldon,Yes. I think prolonged exposure to Penny has turned her into a bit of a Gabby Gertie.
Leonard,"So, whatês the gossip?"
Sheldon,"Oh, please, I was just pointing it out. I have no desire to engage in the activity."
Leonard,"Fine, donêt tell me."
Sheldon,"All right, get this. Bernadette is thinking about breaking up with Howard."
Leonard,Oh. Thatês too bad. I wonder what happened.
Sheldon,"Mm, itês hard to say. I can only speculate based on the data I collected watching my parentsê marriage implode. In that case, the woman dives into religion, while the man dives into a bottle-blonde bartender who tries to buy my love with action figures. Oop! Out of arrows."
Leonard,"Boy, you sure get your moneyês worth out of these games."
Leonard,"_ Priya, can I come in?"
Leonard,"Oh, God."
Leonard,Itês okay. You didnêt know. Iêll take care of it.
Leonard,Sheldon doesnêt allow flossing that close to the mirror.
Leonard,Itês a splatter thing. Thereês a little piece of tape on the floor youêre supposed to stand behind.
Leonard,"I know. Just do it. Thereês a big inspection coming up, and I donêt want to lose my TV privileges."
Leonard,"Mm, I donêt know. I get a lawyer, he gets a lawyer, itês just easier to stand behind the tape."
Leonard,"Yeah! Dodgers are baseball, right?"
Leonard,"Mm, itês complicated, but as I remember it, the essentials are, get chosen last, get hit by the ball, cry, go home."
Leonard,"Well, it might not be a great idea to invite those two."
Leonard,"Donêt tell anybody I told you, but I heard she might be breaking up with him."
Leonard,Really? Who?
Leonard,Youêre kidding!
Leonard,"Wow, thatês hard to believe."
Leonard,"Oh, that one doesnêt apply to you. You sit."
Penny,Hey! Howês it going?
Leonard,Not too bad. Did you hear about Howard and Bernadette?
Penny,‚Course I heard about it. How did you hear about it?
Leonard,I heard about it from Sheldon. He got it from Amy.
Penny,"Oh, damn it. I told Amy that in the strictest confidence. Boy, some people are such blabbermouths. Well, whatever, Iêm sure Bernadette can do better."
Leonard,Do you think a sexually ambivalent Indian astrophysicist with selective mutism and alcohol issues is better than a hundred-pound Jewish guy who lives with his mom?
Penny,You are kidding. Raj likes Bernadette?
Leonard,I didnêt say Raj. Who said Raj?
Penny,"Okay, give. How do you know? Did he tell you?"
Penny,"Well, then who?"
Leonard,I canêt say.
Penny,"Priya told you. What a little gossip. You know, not an attractive quality in a woman, Leonard. Not judging, just my opinion."
Leonard,"Well, The point is, if this got out, it would destroy Howard and Rajês friendship."
Penny,"You donêt have to worry. Unlike Amy and Priya, I know how to keep a secret."
Leonard,Youêre the one who told Amy in the first place.
Penny,In confidence!
Raj,"Hello, Mummy. Hello, Daddy. How are you?"
Raj,"I am making her comfortable. Besides, sheês not sleeping here half the time anyway."
Raj,"It, it doesnêt matter. Howard has a girlfriend."
Raj,What does that mean?
Raj,Is something going on with him and Bernadette?
Raj,"Donêt worry. Everything I have, I share with her. Including my friend LeonÑ"
Raj,"Oh, my God, I think you broke my toe!"
Raj,"Fair enough. Now, whatês up with Clarinet? Bernadette!"
Sheldon,Iêve been thinking about Dr. Greeneês efforts to make science palatable for the masses.
Leonard,"Oh, yeah? What about it?"
Sheldon,"Thatês all. Iêve just been thinking about it. Now, Iêm thinking about fractal equations. Now Iêm thinking about the origin of the phrase train of thought. Now Iêm thinking about trains."
Raj,Are you listening to this guy?
Howard,"Hmm? Oh, Iêm sorry. I was somewhere else."
Leonard,Lucky bastard.
Sheldon,Now Iêm thinking about Jell-O.
Raj,So whatês up?
Howard,Itês a Bernadette thing.
Raj,"Oh, no. I hope everythingês okay."
Leonard,"Whatever it is, weêre here for you. You can tell us anything."
Raj,Yeah. Good or devastating.
Howard,Iêm gonna ask her to marry me.
Leonard,Marry you?
Howard,Yeah. I just need to figure out the right time to pop the question.
Leonard,"Oh, Iêd wait."
Raj,"No rush, no rush."
Howard,"Oh, great. Itês my cousin David about the ring. Hey, David, whatêd you find? Oh, sure, a half a caratês fine. Her freakishly small hands make anything look big. Itês one of the reasons I love her."
Leonard,"Man, heês going to be blindsided."
Raj,I know. Itêll be awful.
Sheldon,Why are you smiling?
Leonard,"Yeah, Raj, why?"
Raj,"Uh, a smile means something different in my country. You know, tears of joy, smile of sadness. Indiaês a goofy place."
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm back to trains. Woo-woo."
Amy,Did I tell you our lab got a grant to study addiction?
Amy,Fascinating work. I recently trained a capuchin monkey to smoke cigarettes.
Sheldon,Have you learned anything?
Amy,Yes. He looks much cooler than the non-smoking monkeys. Although itês not much of a contest. The other monkeys just sit around and masturbate.
Sheldon,"If you donêt mind, Iêd like to stop listening to you and start talking."
Amy,By all means.
Sheldon,Howard has announced his intention to propose marriage to Bernadette.
Amy,I donêt understand. The original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup.
Sheldon,"I know. The group consensus is that his proposal will be met with an humiliating, soul-crushing rejection. Everyone was set a-twitter. Although oddly, no one tweeted."
Amy,Itês not surprising that the story has captured the attention of our little circle of friends. Are you familiar with meme theory?
Sheldon,"Iêm familiar with everything, but go on."
Amy,Meme theory suggests that items of gossip are like living things that seek to reproduce using humans as their host.
Sheldon,"Iêm no stranger to memetic epidemiology. At Johnson Elementary School, the phrase Shelly Cooperês a smelly pooper spread like wildfire."
Amy,I should think so. Thatês gold.
Sheldon,Your meme hypothesis does intrigue me. How might we examine this more closely?
Amy,Do you have any ethical qualms regarding human experimentation?
Sheldon,Itês one of the few forms of interaction with people that I donêt find repellent.
Amy,We need to fabricate a tantalizing piece of gossip.
Sheldon,And a second non-tantalizing piece to use as a control.
Amy,"Then weêll track its progress through our social group and interpret the results through the competing academic prisms of memetic theory, algebraic gossip and epidemiology."
Sheldon,"Look at you, getting me to engage in the social sciences. Youêre a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler."
Penny,"Oh, hey, Amy. Whatês up?"
Amy,"Sheldon and I engaged in sexual intercourse. In other news, Iêm thinking of starting an herb garden. Mumês the word. Gotta go."
Bernadette,"Oh, hey, Raj, what are you doing here?"
Raj,"I just felt like drinking alone, because Iêm deep and dark."
Bernadette,"Uh-huh. So, uh, Howardês not here?"
Raj,Itês just one of those times when itês just you and me. Like when the three of us went to the movies and you and I waited outside the bathroom while Howard threw up Red Vines and Cherry Coke. Do you remember that?
Raj,"Me, too. Good times."
Penny,"Hey, 16 wants to order appetizers."
Bernadette,"Oh, thanks."
Raj,This was nice.
Penny,"What the hell are you doing? Howard is your best friend, and that is his girlfriend. You should be ashamed of yourself."
Raj,"I was when I came in, but itês amazing what liquor does to guilt. Besides what you might not know is, Bernadette is planning on breaking up with Howard."
Penny,"Well, I know that. How do you know that?"
Raj,My sister told me.
Penny,"Oh, that gossipy bitch! No offense."
Raj,None taken. You should hear how she talks about you.
Penny,"Okay, listen, just because Howard and Bernadette are having problems, does not mean you should be here sniffing around."
Raj,What can I do? I canêt stop thinking about her.
Penny,"All right, try thinking about this. Sheldon and Amy had sex."
Raj,Shut your ass!
Penny,"Yeah, itês true. Amy told me."
Raj,How did that even happen? Did they know thatês what they were doing when they were doing it?
Penny,I-I guess they just figured it out at some point.
Raj,Wow. I canêt believe old Smelly Pooper finally got laid.
Leonard,Hope youêre hungry.
Sheldon,"Interesting. A friendly sentiment in this country, cruel taunt in the Sudan. Itês a lesson in context."
Leonard,Will Amy be joining us for dinner?
Sheldon,"Yes, I believe so."
Leonard,"Good, good. Everything okay between you two?"
Sheldon,Yes. Why do you ask?
Leonard,"No reason. I was just talking to Raj, and he mentioned what a lovely glow she has these days."
Sheldon,"Did he mean as if sheêd been out in the sun, tending an herb garden without wearing a hat or sunblock?"
Leonard,Thatês not what he meant.
Sheldon,"Well, we may never know. As my mother would say, the Asians are an inscrutable folk. Now, if youêll excuse me, I have work to do."
Leonard,"Yeah, you do. You dog, you."
Sheldon,Did you get that?
Amy,Every word. Our false gossip meme appears to have reached node lambda.
Sheldon,This is moving faster than we thought.
Amy,Agreed. It appears the rate of gossip transmission is proportional to the number of nodes squared.
Sheldon,"I must say, Amy, pretending to have intercourse with you is giving me a great deal of satisfaction."
Amy,"Slow down, Sheldon. Iêm not quite there yet."
Leonard,Pass the soy sauce.
Amy,Bernadette just asked about my sexual encounter with you. The meme has reached full penetration.
Sheldon,Pun intended?
Amy,Happy accident.
Sheldon,This is remarkable. Took less than 24 hours.
Amy,I should let you know that she asked for details about our dalliance.
Sheldon,"Interesting. So it went beyond the mere fact of coitus to a blow by blow, as it were."
Amy,Pun intended?
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. What pun?
Amy,"Not important. I described your lovemaking as aloof, but effective."
Sheldon,"I wish you hadnêt done that. Thatês going to make me a chick magnet, and Iêm so busy as it is."
Howard,"Hey, everybody, I got something I want to ask Bernadette, and I canêt think of a better time than when Iêm with all my friends."
Leonard,"Oh, hold on, Howard. Thereês lots of better times."
Raj,"Leonard, please. The man is talking. Let him get it out, and let the chips fall where they may."
Howard,Thank you. Bernadette Maryann RostenkowskiÑ
Bernadette,"Oh, God. Whatês happening?"
Howard,"I know things havenêt been perfect with us, and weêve had our problems, but I just have to tell you, from the moment IÑ"
Bernadette,"Howard, let me just stop you right here."
Raj,This is it.
Howard,"Yes, what?"
Bernadette,"Yes, I will marry you."
Howard,You will?
Raj,You will?
Bernadette,I will. I will!
Howard,"Oh, I love you so much."
Bernadette,"Oh, I love you, too."
Amy,I wonder what changed her mind.
Sheldon,Perhaps your talk of my sexual prowess renewed her faith in love.
Amy,As good an explanation as any.
Leonard,Thatês great.
Penny,"Oh, hey, Amy. Bernadette just texted me. Howard proposed?"
Amy,"Yes, not important. Just stopped by to let you know Iêm getting orthotics. Also, Iêm carrying Sheldonês baby. Mumês the word."
Leonard,Youêre pregnant?
Amy,Wow. Is there anything on there about orthotics?
Sheldon,"Leonard, are you in the shower?"
Leonard,"I canêt hear you, Iêm in the shower."
Sheldon,"I asked if you were in the shower, but thatês moot now."
Sheldon,Moot. Rendered unimportant by recent events.
Leonard,"I canêt hear you, Iêm in the shower."
Sheldon,I have to skip the chitchat. Emergency.
Leonard,What kind of emergency?
Sheldon,"Mathematical. 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce bladder."
Leonard,You might not want to do that.
Sheldon,I assure you I do.
Leonard,"Sheldon, Iêm not alone in here."
Sheldon,What are you doing in there? She canêt be in here.
Leonard,"We were in here first, you canêt be in here."
Sheldon,"According to the roommate agreement, paragraph nine, subsection B, the right to bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force majeure. And believe me, I am experiencing a very majeure force."
Sheldon,"Come on, you canêt wait two minutes?"
Sheldon, Penny?
Sheldon,Move. Move. Move!
Sheldon,"Dr. Leonard Hofstadter, you are officially charged with two violations of the roommate agreement. Do you waive reading of the charges?"
Leonard,"Yeah, fine."
Leonard,Oh. Cool. Iêve got a lawyer. And Iêve seen her naked.
Sheldon,"Very well. Count the first, on or about the 28th day of April, the accused did knowingly and with malice aforethought deny access to the shared bathroom in a time of emergency, to wit, my back teeth were floating. Count the second, the accused exceeded the agreed upon occupancy of the shower, to wit, one, unless we are under attack by water-soluble aliens."
Sheldon,"Um, itês fairly technical."
Leonard,"Top of her class, Cambridge University. Licensed to practice law in three countries. And your face."
Sheldon,"Do so, do so."
Sheldon,"Oh, thatês ridiculous. A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory."
Sheldon,Irrelevant. Leonard doesnêt trim his nose hair. He thinks because heês short nobody can see up there.
Sheldon,This isnêt over.
Leonard,"No offence, but shower sex with you is now the second best thing thatês happened today."
Raj,"Mmm, Greek food on pizza night? This is the most delightfully cruel thing weêve done to Sheldon since we left that fake message from Stephen Hawking on his voice mail."
Howard,I wish to discuss your theories of black holes. Meet me at the Randyês Donut by the airport at 2:00 a.m.
Sheldon,What is that youêre eating? Tonight is pizza night.
Leonard,Iêd like to refer that to my attorney.
Sheldon,"Yes, and when Franconiês went out of business, we switched to Grazianoês."
Howard,"Thatês interesting. Can you just switch restaurants like that, Priya?"
Sheldon,"This is Greek food? Leonard, you hate Greek food."
Leonard,Not as much as you.
Sheldon,Fine. Iêm nothing if not adaptable.
Leonard,I got you the lamb kabob.
Sheldon,"Thank you. If you think about it, Greek food isnêt that far from italian food. They share a spice palette. And what a civilization is the Greeks. They gave us science, democracy, and little cubes of charred meat that taste like sweat."
Sheldon, Penny?
Penny,Hey. Whatês up?
Sheldon,The mean Indian lady tried to make me eat lamb. Congratulations. Pizza night will now be at your apartment. Order one.
Penny,"Oh, Iêm sorry, honey, Iêm meeting Amy and Bernadette for dinner. But youêre welcome to tag along."
Sheldon,"A girls night? Oh, I donêt know if Iêm up for an evening talking about rainbows, unicorns and menstrual cramps."
Penny,"Okay, suit yourself. Weêll probably be trashing Priya a little."
Penny,"Okay, Iêd like to propose a toast to a wonderful girls night out."
Amy,"Fair warning, we can get ker-razy."
Bernadette,Yeah. Last week we smoked cigars and pretended to be dragons.
Sheldon,"Really, Amy? Tobacco and alcohol? Need I remind you not a lot of scientific discoveries were made by people having a good time?"
Amy,Why did you bring him? Heês harshing my buzz.
Penny,I felt sorry for him. Priyaês giving him a hard time.
Bernadette,"Ooh, the Priya bashingês starting early. Yay! Okay, whatês up with those pantsuits?"
Amy,I need some context.
Penny,Pantsuits suck.
Amy,"And that opens her up To justifiable ridicule for wearing them. Good one, Bernadette. See? Ker-razy."
Amy,You smell like baby powder.
Sheldon,"Itês talc. But as thatês a primary ingredient of baby powder, I understand your confusion."
Amy,"Oh, Iêm not confused at all. Youêre like a sexy toddler."
Sheldon,I donêt know how to process that.
Bernadette,I do. Amy and Sheldon sitting in a tree. K-I-S-S-S-S-I-N-G.
Penny,Thatês too many Sês for kissing.
Bernadette,Not if theyêre doing it for a long time.
Penny,"Sheldon, have you ever kissed a girl?"
Sheldon,"Other than my mother, my sister and my mee-maw, no. But in the interest of full disclosure, I was once on a bus and had to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an elderly nun who passed out from heat exhaustion. Every year I get a Christmas card from her, signed with far too many Xês and Oês."
Bernadette,That doesnêt count. Arenêt you even a little curious?
Penny,"Yeah, youêre a scientist, where is the curiosity?"
Amy,Iêm available for experimentation.
Sheldon,Thank you. Not necessary. We know everything there is to know about kissing. It requires 34 facial muscles and 112 postural muscles.
Amy,"Oh, blah, blah, blah. Give me some sugar, bestie ."
Sheldon,Iêm certainly glad no one said they were curious about Aztec human sacrifice.
Penny,"Hey, I know, letês take Sheldon dancing."
Bernadette,"Oh, I totally want to see Sheldon dance. I bet he looks like a spider on a hot plate."
Sheldon,"No, thank you, but for the record, Iêm an excellent dancer. Proficient in the rumba, waltz and cha-cha."
Sheldon,I donêt see why thatês surprising. I excel at so many things. Youêve had my sourdough bread.
Penny,Did you take dance lessons?
Sheldon,"Against my will. In the South, pre-adolescent children are forced through a process called cotillion, which indoctrinates them with all the social graces and dance skills needed to function in 18th century Vienna."
Penny,"Oh, we are so taking you dancing."
Sheldon,"No, you most certainly are not."
Bernadette,"Well, what does your cotillion training say is expected of a gentleman when three ladies ask him to escort them to a dance soiree?"
Sheldon,I saved a nunês life. Why am I being punished?
Penny,Take us to a place we can waltz.
Sheldon,"Waltz. Itês a social dance from Austria, choreographed to a three-four time signature. "
Amy,"I kissed a girl and I liked it, I hope my boyfriend donêt mind it."
Sheldon,What happened to you?
Penny,"Shake it baby, shake it!"
Bernadette,"Muy caliente, Sheldon!"
Bernadette,"Oh, Iêm sorry, Iêm engaged."
Penny,"Oh, what the hell. Ooh!"
Amy,"How come if weêre the smart people, we donêt do this every night?"
Sheldon,Whatês 16 times 14?
Amy,My burps taste like cranberry juice.
Sheldon,And thereês your answer.
Amy,Would you like to come in for a nightcap?
Sheldon,"If youêre referring to the beverage, you know I donêt drink. If youêre referring to the hat you don while wearing a nightshirt and holding a candle, I have one."
Amy,I have yoo-hoo.
Sheldon,Itês hard to say no to yoo-hoo. The name literally beckons.
Amy,Make yourself comfortable.
Sheldon,Thank you. Is someone smoking?
Amy,"Oh, thatês just Ricky."
Sheldon,You own a smoking monkey?
Amy,Donêt be silly. Heês one of the animals in my departmentês nicotine addiction study.
Sheldon,Whatês he doing here?
Amy,Iêm giving him emphysema. The least I can do is let him hang out and watch cable.
Sheldon,Remarkable. Arenêt you worried about secondhand smoke?
Amy,A little. The real danger is him biting my face off while Iêm sleeping.
Sheldon,is he deliberately blowing smoke at me?
Amy,Yeah. Heês kind of an ass.
Sheldon,Thank you. May I share something with you thatês troubling me?
Amy,Of course. Whatês rattling around that big bulbous brain of yours?
Sheldon,"Priya has essentially nullified my roommate agreement with Leonard, making life in the apartment very uncomfortable for me."
Amy,And you want me to kill her? Done.
Sheldon,"No, of course not."
Amy,I trained Ricky how to smoke. I can train him to shoot a poison dart. No jury would convict us êcause people love monkeys.
Sheldon,"I understand the alcohol has stirred up whatever it is that makes girls go wild, but I really need to talk to smart Amy now."
Amy,Excuse me. Have you considered that your intelligence might be the very thing causing your dilemma?
Amy,What do you think Ricky over here would do if an interloper encroached on his territory?
Sheldon,"Well, when challenged, monkeys generally assert their dominance through chasing, assault and a stylized penile display. Thatês a little outside my comfort zone."
Amy,"Youêre being too literal. My point is, he would not meekly surrender to the rules, and neither should you."
Sheldon,Are you suggesting I play dirty?
Amy,"Yes, dirty. Dirty, dirty, dirty. Which brings me to our next order of business. "
Amy,I hope you donêt take what Iêm about to do as a comment on what we just did. 
Sheldon,Whoês to say you shouldnêt be dissecting our brains? You really are an ass.
Leonard,"Morning, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Oh, good, youêre up. Iêve written a new and improved roommate agreement that benefits me greatly. Iêd like you to sign it."
Leonard,Why would I want to do that?
Sheldon,"Excellent question. Do you remember what happened to the alien, played by talented character actor Frank Gorshin, in the Star Trek episode Let That Be Your Last Battlefield?"
Leonard,"Uh, Captain Kirk activated the self-destruct sequence and threatened to blow up the Enterpriseand kill them both unless he gave in?"
Sheldon,"Affirmative. Computer, this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Activate self-destruct sequence. Code 1-1-A-2-B."
Leonard,"What are you gonna do, Sheldon, blow up the apartment?"
Sheldon,"That was my first thought, but all my cool stuff is here."
Sheldon,"Unless Leonard signs the new agreement in the next 41 seconds, this computer will send an e-mail to your parents in India saying that youêre in a secret relationship with the whiter-than-marshmallow-fluff Leonard Hofstadter."
Leonard,Whatês the big deal?
Leonard,"Theyêre gonna find out about me eventually, right?"
Sheldon,20 seconds.
Leonard,Are you ashamed of me?
Leonard,Then why canêt we tell your parents?
Sheldon,"He does that all the time, doesnêt he? 15."
Leonard,"No, heês bluffing."
Sheldon,I never bluff. Ten.
Leonard,Itês blackmail!
Leonard,This is ridiculous. 
Sheldon,"Itês a laptop with a full charge. Honestly, what do you see in him?"
Leonard,"Okay, Iêll sign it!"
Sheldon,"You may have gone to Cambridge, but Iêm an honorary graduate of Starfleet academy."
Sheldon,"Good morning, Amy."
Amy,It most assuredly is not.
Sheldon,"Are you experiencing dehydration, headache, nausea and shame?"
Amy,Yes. I also found a Korean manês business card tucked into my cleavage. What happened last night?
Sheldon,"Ah, memory impairment, the free prize at the bottom of every vodka bottle."
Sheldon,"All right. Last night you gave me some excellent advice regarding my problem here at home, you kissed me and then vomited on and off for 40 minutes, following which you passed out on your bathroom floor. I then folded a towel under your head as a pillow, set your oven clock to the correct time because it was driving me crazy, and I left."
Amy,Okay. Donêt really know where we go from here.
Sheldon,I suggest we treat our relationship as if it were a crashed computer and restore it to the last point we both agree it worked.
Amy,Terrific. Thank you.  They were out of menthols! Get off my back! Not easy living with a temperamental little primate.
Leonard,"Come on, Priya, just admit I embarrass you!"
Sheldon,"Youêre preaching to the choir, sister."
Amy,"I must say, Penny, this is great fun."
Penny,Glad youêre enjoying yourself.
Amy,"Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination. Now they have a delightful social aspect."
Bernadette,"Amy, you mustêve been in the bathroom with other women before."
Amy,Of course I have. But they were strangers and seemed off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.
Bernadette,Some women donêt like to get chummy when their panties are down.
Amy,"You okay in there, bestie?"
Penny,Iêm fine.
Amy,"The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine"
Penny,"Yeah, I said Iêm fine. Stop talking to me."
Amy,She always this crabby when she urinates?
Bernadette,Weêre really not that close.
Penny,Screw it. Iêll go later.
Amy,And Iêll be right by your side.
Bernadette,Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?
Penny,"Oh, thatês nice."
Amy,"No, itês not. Itês a strategic manoeuvre. Leonardês new girlfriend is testing Bernadetteês loyalty to you and the group. That bitch is crafty."
Bernadette,You think?
Amy,Of course. How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? By going after its weakest member.
Bernadette,"Well, what makes me the weakest member?"
Amy,Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldnêt last a minute on the Serengeti.
Penny,"Okay, Amy, youêre being silly. I am not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly donêt have a problem with Leonardês new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, Iêll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple."
Bernadette,It doesnêt matter. Iêm going to tell her we canêt make it.
Amy,"Oh, no. You have to go."
Bernadette,I donêt understand. I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.
Amy,"You are, with hair that smells like strawberries. And weêre going to use that to our advantage."
Penny,Wait. What are you talking about?
Amy,"By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp. She could ferret out Priyaês tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as, Leonardês no stranger to back-alley cockfights."
Bernadette,I donêt know. Iêm not a very good liar. They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.
Amy,Donêt worry. Iêll teach you. I did two years of Cub Scouts before they found out I was a girl.
Penny,"Okay, I donêt know you people. Iêm just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card."
Amy,How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?
Bernadette,I donêt want anything in my ample bosom.
Amy,"Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team."
Leonard,"Okay, see you later."
Sheldon,Good news. I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.
Leonard,That is good news. Bye.
Sheldon,"Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? Five words, transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation."
Leonard,"That, thatês brilliant."
Sheldon,"Itês what I do. But wait, thereês more. I also invented two new chess pieces. The serpent, and the old woman."
Leonard,"Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?"
Sheldon,"When the serpent slithers to an opposing playerês piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. Ugh."
Leonard,All right.
Sheldon,"Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent."
Sheldon,Thatês because itês simple.
Leonard,"Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you."
Leonard,And what?
Sheldon,"And a third person. Itês three-person chess. I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge. You should reflect on that."
Leonard,"Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life."
Sheldon,"Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadnêt been such a hound dog, weêd all have time machines."
Leonard,Got it. Bye.
Sheldon,You know Iêm right.
Leonard,I think heês getting worse.
Amy,"Oh, my metatarsal are barking."
Leonard,You okay?
Amy,"Yeah, yeah. Iêm just breaking in some new shoes."
Leonard,Very pretty.
Amy,Thank you. Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?
Leonard,Hadnêt really thought about it.
Leonard,"Uh, sure. VeryÑ prominent."
Amy,"Please, Leonard, donêt leer, you have a girlfriend."
Amy,"So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?"
Leonard,Yeah. How did you know?
Amy,"I heard it at the mall, when I was shopping with my girlfriends, êcause, you know, thatês kind of my life now. Have a good night. Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away."
Leonard,"Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?"
Raj,The lonely guy and the two happy couples? Iêd rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.
Raj,I have to feel sorry for myself. Iêm the only one who cares. Just like Iêm the only one whoêll have sex with me.
Leonard,Really? In front of your sister?
Raj,"Excuse me. Iêm going to go wander the streets alone. Invisible, unwanted and unloved, a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart.  I forgot my windbreaker. Itês chilly."
Amy,I donêt understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?
Penny,"Once these puppies touch the ground theyêre mine, and Iêll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off. Pretty, pretty, pretty."
Amy,Good news: the wildebeest is in the curry.
Penny,The what?
Amy,Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard. Message received. Commence operation _Priya Wouldnêt Wanna Be-ya.î
Penny,Hey. Seriously? Didnêt you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?
Amy,I wish. A clique requires friends. I didnêt have any.
Amy,I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop. Hang on. Itês the wildebeest. Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.
Penny,WhÑ What the hell did she say?
Amy,"She thinks itês cool youêre following your dream, no matter what."
Penny,That bitch!
Amy,How do you want to handle it?
Penny,"Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that Iêm on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie."
Amy,Got it. Is it going to be in 3-D?
Penny,I donêt know. It doesnêt matter.
Amy,Iêm gonna say 3-D. Thatêll let her know the studio has faith in it.
Leonard,Youêre kidding. 3-D?
Bernadette,Thatês what I hear.
Howard,Then the studio must have real faith in it.
Leonard,Wonder why she didnêt tell me.
Leonard,"Well, itês not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing."
Leonard,"Well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, I donêt, oh, whatês the word Iêm looking for?"
Howard,Iêm not going to help you. This is hilarious.
Bernadette,Sheês also dating an astronaut.
Bernadette,"Yeah. But Leonardês impressive, too."
Leonard,Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was befuddled.
Sheldon,Knight to old woman six-and-a-third. Brilliant move. Thank you.  Will the two of you excuse me?
Raj,I need a hug.
Sheldon,"Sorry, I have company."
Raj,"Come on, Sheldon, open the door."
Sheldon,I donêt want to hug you.
Raj,"I donêt want to hug you, either. I was just feeling blue."
Sheldon,"Blue, as in depressed."
Raj,"Well, not so much depressed as lonely."
Sheldon,I donêt know what colour lonely is.
Sheldon,"Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely."
Raj,Nothing rhymes with orange. Itês probably lonely.
Sheldon,"All right. Come in. You look positively orange with loneliness. No, I donêt see that catching on at all."
Raj,What are you doing?
Sheldon,Iêm working on my three-person chess game.
Raj,"Oh, cool. Can I play?"
Sheldon,Itês three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?
Sheldon,"Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us canêt play three-person chess. Can you believe this guy? Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need."
Raj,"No, thank you. Iêm fine."
Sheldon,Itês not optional. Weêre out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.
Raj,"I, uh, I guess youêre probably wondering whatês got me down."
Sheldon,"Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece. How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey, the kingês feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?"
Raj,"Iêm going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me. Iêm such a basket case, I canêt even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body."
Sheldon,"The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, thereês a one-in-five chance heêll kill himself."
Raj,"Sheldon, listen to me. I have a big decision to make, and Iêm scared."
Sheldon,Yellow. Go ahead.
Raj,A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills theyêre testing. He says itês the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.
Sheldon,Fascinating. Whatês in it?
Raj,Iêm not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.
Sheldon,I like cows.
Raj,Thatês not the point.
Sheldon,It was its own point. Go on.
Raj,"Iêm a scientist. My ability to think is my bread and butter. Iêm afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field."
Sheldon,"Rajesh, Iêve had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs."
Howard,"Okay, Iêm still trying to work this out. How did Penny meet an astronaut?"
Bernadette,I donêt know. The regular way people meet astronauts.
Howard,Most of those guys live in Texas.
Bernadette,"Obviously, this one doesnêt."
Bernadette,"Leonard lives here. Priyaês from India. People meet, Howard. God!"
Bernadette,"Youêve met lots of astronauts, and Iêve never grilled you about that. Iêd thank you to extend me the same courtesy."
Howard,"Iêm not grilling you, I was just curious."
Leonard,"I still canêt get over the fact that she got a big movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriendês up to, êcause I donêt."
Bernadette,"Maybe thatês where she met the astronaut, all right?"
Bernadette,Heês a consultant.
Leonard,I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?
Bernadette,"He canêt have a hobby? Excuse me, I have to pee. Or is that implausible, as well?"
Howard,"Itês nice to have another couple to hang with, isnêt it?"
Penny,"All right, guys, you have to go back. I canêt afford you. _No, donêt send"
Amy,"Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless.  What do you got for me, wildebeest?"
Bernadette,I think theyêre on to me. The storyês starting to fall apart.
Amy,"Calm down. Everythingês going to be okay.  We may have to kill her. Bernadette, Iêm putting you on speakerphone. Where are you now?"
Bernadette,In the bathroom.
Amy,"Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests. Whatês the problem?"
Bernadette,Theyêre just asking me all sorts of questions I canêt answer.
Amy,Just change the subject.
Bernadette,I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priyaês parents.
Bernadette,They said something about going there this summer.
Penny,are they getting engaged?
Bernadette,I donêt know. I was too busy covering my heinie on Amyês stupid astronaut story!
Amy,What astronaut story?
Bernadette,You texted me Pennyês dating an astronaut.
Amy,I texted architect. Thatês amusing. Auto-correct mustêve changed it.
Bernadette,"Yeah, itês hysterical."
Penny,"All right, look, just forget about the astronaut."
Amy,Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?
Penny,"Look, just find out whatês up with this trip to India."
Bernadette,I donêt want to do this anymore!
Penny,Donêt you quit on us!
Howard,"Bernie, you okay?"
Bernadette,It was an architect!
Raj,"Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon. Youêre a good friend."
Sheldon,Iêm glad you think so. Thatês what I strive to emulate.
Raj,"Okay, letês see if this drug works."
Raj,"Forgive me for staring, but youêre very beautiful."
Raj,Itês a beautiful country. Youêd love it. May I join you?
Raj,"My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
Sheldon,"Oh, thereês no need to interact with me. Iêm just here to observe."
Raj,"Weêre scientists. We observe everything. Here, go buy yourself a scone."
Sheldon,All right.
Raj,And what is your name?
Raj,"Oh, derived from the word angel. Appropriate."
Sheldon,Iêd like to buy a scone.
Sheldon,"They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones."
Raj,"Oh, just getting comfortable. So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?"
Sheldon,They were out of scones.
Raj,"Sheldon, Iêm talking to someone. Youêre being rude. Iêll bet youêre an actress. If not, you should be. You have a very expressive face."
Raj,"Wait, where are you going? We were doing so well. She never even got to see my penis. Ta-da!"
Leonard,"Thanks, yeah."
Bernadette,Let me help you.
Howard,Nice to see that the gals are getting along.
Leonard,"Gals? Who are you, Fred Flintstone?"
Bernadette,This trip to India sounds fun.
Bernadette,Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?
Bernadette,"Well, I wouldnêt worry about it. Itês not like you guys are getting engaged, right?"
Bernadette,Not engaged. Very interesting. I have to tinkle.
Bernadette,Yes. Are you writing a book?
Bernadette,Iêm not upset. Maybe youêre upset.
Bernadette,I canêt do this anymore! Iêm a good girl! I went to Catholic school! 
Howard,"Okay, well, itês getting late. This was terrific. You win. Bernie?"
Leonard,I think the word youêre looking for is befuddled.
Sheldon,My catapult flings my bishop to Howardês Queenês Gorilla two.
Howard,"Nice. Okay, rook to transporter pad. And he comes out at Leonardês Queenês Bishop"
Leonard,Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?
Sheldon,When itês done charging. Or you land on the time machine. Obviously.
Leonard,"Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon."
Sheldon,I knew I should have given my Pope the jet pack.
Raj,"Hey, Iêve got winners."
Penny,"Hey, do me a favour and take table seven."
Bernadette,You mean the one with my one hundred and eighteen-pound rock-hard stud of a fianc_ whoês prone to canker sores and pinkeye?
Penny,"Nah, I prefer to look at it as the one with my ex-boyfriend and his gorgeous, successful and sophisticated girlfriend, who makes me feel like a toothless Okie."
Bernadette,Do you want me to spill hot soup on her?
Penny,"Oh, please, youêre not that kind of person."
Bernadette,I know. But if she orders something low-fat Iêll totally give her the full-fat version.
Leonard,"Uh, thatês my water."
Leonard,My water. Youêre drinking it.
Sheldon,Dear Lord! Have you been drinking it?
Leonard,Yes. Itês my water.
Sheldon,"Well, thatês it then. Iêm dead."
Leonard,Here we go.
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, do I really need to connect the dots for you? The backwash into this glass is every pathogen that calls your mouth home, sweet home. Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue of your subtropical girlfriend."
Raj,"Hey! Thatês my sister and my country youêre talking about. Leonard may have defiled one, but I wonêt have you talking smack about the other."
Bernadette,You guys ready to order?
Sheldon,"Yes, Iêd like a seven-day course of penicillin, some, uh, syrup of ipecac, to induce vomiting, and a mint."
Bernadette,I donêt understand.
Howard,He drank from Leonardês glass.
Sheldon,He drank from Leonardês glass. Words theyêll be carving into my tombstone.
Leonard,Thatês actually my napkin.
Sheldon,"Oh, this is a nightmare!"
Howard,Where are you going?
Sheldon,"To the bar, to sterilize my mouth with alcohol. Gang way! Dead man walking!"
Bernadette,"All right. Here you go. Two lemonades, one iced tea and a root beer for Priya."
Bernadette,Thatês what you ordered.
Bernadette,Yeah. Weêre thinking of having it on a cliff overlooking the ocean.
Howard,Nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters like the thought of falling and drowning.
Leonard,What did your mother say when you told her you were getting married?
Bernadette,He hasnêt told her yet. Heês waiting for the right time.
Howard,I was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy.
Howard,"Hey, have you told your parents youêre dating this short glass of skim milk here?"
Howard,"Right, right, whereas Jewish mothers take a casual, la-di-da approach to their sons."
Sheldon,I gargled with tequila and may have swallowed a teeny bit.
Leonard,You all right?
Sheldon,Fine. Thank you for asking. I love you so much.
Sheldon,Fire demon.
Raj,"Ooh, fire demon. Sheldonês turning up the heat."
Howard,Troll master.
Raj,Check it! Howard pulls one out from under the bridge. Nice!
Leonard,Water nymph.
Raj,"Oh, yeah, sheês got puddles in all the right places."
Sheldon,Could you please play the game without commenting on every card?
Raj,Sorry. Walking tree.
Sheldon,Last one.
Raj,Iêm taking a stroll and Iêm sporting wood.
Howard,"Okay, the Eagle has landed."
Leonard,Whatês going on?
Howard,Bernadette and my mother are having a get-to-know-you lunch at the Old Town Deli.
Raj,"Oh, that sounds lovely."
Howard,"Hope so. Of course, if history is any indication, my mother will swallow her whole and spit out her bones like an owl."
Leonard,Have you met Bernadetteês parents?
Howard,You mean Adolf and Eva? Not yet. One goose step at a time.
Raj,"Sheldon, thatês my water."
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord!"
Leonard,Thatês not your water.
Raj,I know.
Sheldon,Whereês the mouthwash?
Raj,Where indeed.
Howard,"Ma, Iêm home! Where are you?"
Howard,"So, howêd it go?"
Howard,"No, I mean lunch, today, with Bernadette."
Howard,"Besides food, did you get along? Did you talk?"
Howard,"No, she never mentioned it."
Howard,"Yeah, thatês probably it. So, what do you think? Do you like her? Sheês great, huh?"
Howard,"Thatês good to hear, êcause Iêve got some news."
Howard,"Bernadette and I are getting married. Ma? You too busy bearing down? Ma?  Son of a bitch! Ma, help!"
Penny,Havenêt seen you in a while. Howês it going?
Sheldon,"Oh, other than waiting out the exponential growth period of the virulent organisms trooping through my microvilli into my circulatory system, hunky-dory.  Did I say something amusing?"
Penny,"I donêt know, maybe, I have no idea what you said."
Sheldon,So your mirth is merely a discharge of nervous energy with no semantic content at all?
Penny,My mirth. Classic.
Sheldon,Is there a station coming up where I can board your giggling train of thought?
Penny,"Itês not a big deal, Sheldon. Itês just, ever since Leonardês been dating Rajês sister, Iêve had to keep my distance. I donêt get to hear all your jibber-jabber."
Sheldon,Jibber-jabber? I donêt jibber-jabber.
Penny,What are you doing at work these days?
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm working on time-dependent backgrounds in string theory, specifically quantum field theory in D-dimensional de Sitter space."
Penny,"Alright, come on, even you have to admit thatês jibber-jabber."
Sheldon,"Interesting, do you know where the phrase jibber-jabber comes from?"
Penny,"Oh, my God, youêre about to jibber-jabber about jibber-jabber."
Leonard,"Howard and his mother are at the hospital. Come on, we gotta go."
Penny,"Oh, my God! What happened?"
Leonard,"I donêt know, I just got a text. Come on, hurry."
Leonard,"Sheldon, letês go!"
Sheldon,"To a hospital? Full of sick people? Oh, I donêt think so."
Penny,"Okay, well, your friend and his mother are there, weêre going."
Sheldon,I canêt.
Penny,"Oh, donêt tell me youêre afraid of germs."
Sheldon,"Not all germs. Just the ones that will kill me. Itês the same way Iêm not afraid of all steak knives, just the ones that might be plunged in my thorax."
Leonard,"Right, fine. Iêll tell Howard you didnêt come because youêre more concerned about your own well-being than his."
Sheldon,I would think he would know that.
Penny,"Okay, you know what? You are unbelievable. You buy all these superhero T-shirts, but when itês time for you to step up and do the right thing, you just hide in the laundry room."
Sheldon,"Fine, Iêll go. Just for the record, my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital. She went in to visit my Uncle Roger, caught something and bit the dust a week later. The two of them now share a coffee can on my motherês mantel."
Howard,"So I knocked down the bathroom door, picked up my poor unconscious mother, carried her to the car, and drove like a madman to the emergency room."
Bernadette,"Youêre a real hero, Howard."
Howard,"No, I did what any son would do."
Penny,"Hang on a second, you picked up your mother? Her own legs are barely able to do that."
Howard,I was filled with adrenaline. It happens to be how women lift cars off babies.
Penny,"Yeah, Iêm saying, itêd be easier to lift a car."
Howard,"What can I tell you? After I found the courage to put her pants back on, I was unstoppable."
Leonard,"So, how is she?"
Howard,Theyêre running tests. I donêt know. It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event.
Penny,Whatês the difference?
Sheldon,A heart-attack-like event is an event thatês like a heart attack.
Penny,Thanks for clearing that up.
Sheldon,"Regardless, coronary problems are eminently treatable. Whatês more likely going to kill Howardês mother are the antibiotic-resistant super-bugs festering in every nook and cranny of this hospital."
Penny,"Okay, youêre not helping."
Leonard,Go sit over there.
Sheldon,"Iêll sit over there, it looks cleaner."
Leonard,Is there a history of heart disease in your family?
Howard,My family is the history of heart disease. Thereês a cave painting in France of one of my ancestors doing this .
Bernadette,So itês probably genetic.
Howard,"Well, maybe. Mom also had just gotten some news that might have upset her."
Howard,Itês not important.
Bernadette,"Come on, Howard, Iêm going to be your wife. You can share anything with me."
Howard,Youêd think that. But no.
Bernadette,You told her we were going to get married and she had a heart attack?
Howard,You canêt take that personally.
Penny,How else is she supposed to take it?
Howard,"What youêve got to keep in mind is that ever since my dad left, Iêve been the whole world to my mother. I mean, sheêd be threatened by any woman who can give me what she canêt."
Bernadette,You mean sexual intercourse?
Howard,"Well, when you say it like that you make it sound creepy."
Bernadette,Howardês mother had a heart attack because I have sex with him and she canêt.
Howard,"Bernie, wait!"
Sheldon,"Iêll give you $1,000 if youêll drive me home."
Penny,"Well, heês my friend. Itês what you do. "
Penny,"Itês just so weird. Howard Wolowitz is my friend. You know, once he tried to stick his tongue down my throat and I broke his nose."
Penny,"Yeah, tell me about it."
Penny,You mean when he was little.
Penny,"You know, this stuff is horrible. You want to see if we can find the cafeteria and get real coffee?"
Leonard,Iêm fine. Thatês nice that theyêre getting along.
Raj,"Your girlfriend and your ex-girlfriend are hanging out together? Oh, yeah, that can only be good for you."
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Raj,One of them broke up with you. Do you really want her telling the other one why?
Leonard,I donêt care. I donêt have anything to hide.
Raj,"Good, good. Then you have nothing to worry about."
Leonard,"No, I do not. You are a mean little man."
Raj,"Youêd think itêd be because my parents didnêt love me, but actually they loved me a great deal."
Howard,"Bernie, itês not you. Sheês just set in her ways."
Bernadette,How can we be together if the thought of us getting married might kill your mother?
Howard,"Itês the circle of life, sweetie. One day our son will marry someone and it will kill you."
Sheldon,"Howard, I have to go to the bathroom and no one will take me home."
Howard,Whatês wrong with the bathroom here?
Sheldon,"Pneumococcus, streptococcus, staphylococcus and other assorted coccuses."
Howard,"Sheldon, my mother is on her deathbed and my fianc_e is grief-stricken over putting her there. Iêm not taking you home."
Sheldon,"Will you at least go with me to the restroom here, so you can open the door and flush the urinal?"
Sheldon,"This might be a good time to point out, Howard, that friendship requires a certain give and take. Hold the door!"
Howard,Is she okay?
Howard,Can I see her?
Bernadette,Me? Why me?
Howard,Jews have been asking that for centuries. Thereês no real good answer.
Bernadette,"Okay, well, wish me luck."
Howard,"Donêt worry, youêll be fine. Letês just hide Mr. Cross. If it touches her, it burns."
Sheldon,"No, I havenêt. Itês all good."
Penny,"You want to talk about crazy mothers, Leonardês mom wouldnêt give him any sort of approval growing up."
Penny,It makes him desperate to please women. Thatês why the foreplay goes on and on.
Penny,"Itês like heês trying to win a prize. A word of advice, donêt doze off. You will never hear the end of it."
Sheldon,Help me! Come back! Penny!
Leonard,"There are a couple of things I did with Penny that might be a little silly, butÑ"
Raj,Like what?
Leonard,"Every once in a while, before weêd go to bed, Iêd put on a little show for her."
Raj,"What do you mean, a show?"
Leonard,"Well, you know, the way I took my clothes off."
Raj,"Like, to music?"
Leonard,Iêd look pretty stupid if there was no music.
Raj,So youêd do a striptease?
Leonard,I wasnêt swinging around a pole.
Raj,"Good, good."
Leonard,There was one time I put body glitter on.
Raj,"Well, I donêt think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that."
Leonard,"No, she wouldnêt."
Raj,Your big problem is me telling her.
Leonard,You really are a mean little man.
Penny,"Yeah, I know, right?"
Leonard,"Hey, what took you guys so long?"
Leonard,Thatês nice. What about?
Penny,We were just comparing notes about how you are in the sack.
Leonard,Thatês funny.
Raj,What if she wasnêt kidding?
Leonard,It doesnêt matter. Iêm the king of foreplay.
Howard,"Hey, howêd it go?"
Bernadette,Youêre a putz. You know what that means?
Howard,Yeah. Do you?
Bernadette,Your mother just taught it to me. She thinks she got food poisoning from that deli and she just wanted to make sure I was okay.
Howard,And are you?
Bernadette,"No, because Iêm engaged to a putz. You let me believe I was the reason she had a heart attack."
Howard,"Well, based on the available evidÑ"
Bernadette,Shut up! She said Iêm a wonderful girl and that youêre lucky to have me.
Howard,Where are you going?
Bernadette,To the toilet! Is that okay with you?
Howard,"Is it just me, or does she sound sexy when sheês angry?"
Sheldon,Mountain Elf.
Raj,He takes the elf from off the shelf.
Leonard,Hell Hounds.
Raj,Hell Hounds. Who let the Satanic dogs out? Who? Who-who?
Howard,Colossal Serpent.
Raj,I got a colossal serpent right here.
Sheldon,Must you?
Raj,"Sorry, Iêm just trying to cheer my buddy up. Rotting Zombie. Sheldonês new Facebook photo."
Sheldon,"Zandor, Wizard of the North. Ha! I win."
Howard,"If you skip the part about being under a two-week quarantine because you were exposed to a deadly disease, absolutely."
Penny,"Hey, you guys ready to order?"
Penny,"Okay, Priya?"
Leonard,"Oh, no, no, no, he doesnêt."
Leonard,"Well, you have milk in the taters, milk in the gravy, parmesan crust. Your lactose-intolerant boyfriend will turn into a gas-filled Macyês Day balloon."
Sheldon,"Not quite accurate. The Macyês balloons are filled with helium, whereas Leonard produces copious amounts of methane."
Leonard,"So, no, on the Shepherdês Pie. Can we move on?"
Penny,"Yeah, a little tip: he says he can eat frozen yoghurt. Do not believe it."
Leonard,Sea bass. Iêll have the sea bass.
Howard,"You gotta like this, the girlfriend and the ex-girlfriend bonding over your rooty-tooty stinky booty."
Leonard,Kill me.
Sheldon,It wouldnêhelp. The human body is capable of being flatulent for hours after death.
Bernadette,"Guys, sorry Iêm late. I have amazing news."
Sheldon,"Bernadette, before you change the subject, does anyone have any final comments on Leonardês faulty digestive system?"
Leonard,"So, whatês your news, Bernadette?"
Bernadette,The thesis committee accepted my doctoral dissertation. Iêm getting my PhD.
Sheldon,"Oh, congratulations."
Penny,"Wow, so that means youêre a doctor, youêre a doctor, youêre a doctor, youêre a doctor, and Howard, you know a lot of doctors."
Howard,"Congratulations, honey."
Bernadette,Thank you.
Leonard,"So, Howard, tell us, howês it feel knowing that when you two get married, youêll be referred to as Mr. and Dr. Wolowitz?"
Sheldon,"Unless he takes Bernadetteês last name. And considering her advanced status, that could open some doors for him."
Howard,"Please, this isnêt about me. Iêm proud of you."
Bernadette,"Well, youêll be really be proud of this. I was headhunted by a big pharmaceutical company. Theyêre gonna pay me a buttload of money!"
Leonard,"Bernadette, thatês great. Howard, do you make a buttload?"
Howard,Better than what youêve got a buttload of.
Leonard,"Hey, if I roll down the windows in the car, everythingês peachy. If you do it, youêre still not a doctor."
Penny,"Yeah, just a heads-up on the car window deal. It helps, but everything is not peachy."
Leonard,"You look beautiful, Lieutenant Uhura. Now prepare for inspection."
Leonard,"Relax, heês got headphones on. And weêre ten miles above Earth in a starship."
Raj,"Really, ten miles? Youêre orbiting inside the atmosphere? Moron."
Leonard,"I canêt believe you think he only wears it on Halloween. Open the landing bay doors, shuttle craft approaching."
Raj,"Okay, gotta go."
Howard,"Hey, whatês up?"
Howard,"No, Ma! Itês Raj!"
Howard,"Sheldon, yes! Everybodyês a doctor but me!"
Howard,Whatês up?
Raj,Leonardês putting disgusting memories in my memory foam mattress. Can I stay here tonight?
Howard,"Sure, but Iêm going out with Bernadette. Itêll just be you and my mother."
Raj,I guess thatês okay.
Howard,"Ma, can Rajesh sleep over?!"
Raj,"Sheês kidding, right?"
Howard,"I donêt know, sheês pretty feisty since they put her on hormone-replacement therapy."
Sheldon,"I must say, Amy, I was very impressed to see that Bernadette got her PhD."
Amy,"Itês indeed admirable. Although, it is microbiology."
Sheldon,Your doctorate is in neurobiology. I fail to see the distinction.
Amy,"Iêll make it simple for you. I study the brain, the organ responsible for Beethovenês Fifth Symphony. Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Lite. Is there something wrong with your neck?"
Sheldon,Itês a little stiff. What a remarkably fragile structure to support such a valuable payload. Not unlike balancing a Faberge egg on a Pixie Stick.
Amy,Have you considered massage?
Sheldon,"Iêd like to respond to that sarcastically. Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it."
Amy,I was proposing you massage your muscles with your own hands.
Sheldon,Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.
Amy,"Trust me. With your right hand, locate the spot where the scapula meets the acromion process."
Sheldon,All right.
Amy,"Now push your third finger along the ridge of the shoulder blade, making a small rotation as you do so."
Amy,You should feel a small node-like object rolling back and forth along the bone.
Sheldon,You mean the myofascial point?
Amy,Obviously. Now bear down on it like the seventh grade noogies we all know too well.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, yes, yes, oh, yes! Amy, Iêve never been touched like this before! Oh! Oh, my hands are magic!"
Amy,Donêt flatter yourself. Your hands are blunt tools guided by my knowledge of the nervous system. I could just as easily have paralyzed you.
Sheldon,Thereês someone at my door.
Amy,That doesnêt interest me. Goodbye.
Raj,Can I sleep here tonight?
Raj,Leonardês having astronomically inaccurate Star Trek sex with my sister.
Sheldon,I can see how that would be upsetting. Come in. Iêll get the sheets and blankets for the couch.
Raj,"Oh, donêt bother. Iêll just sleep in Leonardês room."
Sheldon,"No, I canêt authorize that."
Raj,"Well, heês in my bed. Why canêt I be in his?"
Sheldon,"The Hammurabic Code is an eye for an eye, not a bed for a bed."
Raj,"Come on, dude, Iêm exhausted, and Tyra Banks says the most important item in your makeup bag is a good nightês sleep."
Sheldon,"All right. This is a form indemnifying me from your use of Leonardês bedroom. Sign here, indicating that I tried to stop you and did so using a stern facial expression."
Raj,"Good night, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Wait. Not yet. We still have to go over safety procedures. Now, the apartment has three emergency exits located here, here, and here. In the event of a power outage, luminous paint will guide you to the nearest exit."
Raj,Youêre kidding.
Sheldon,I never kid about safety.
Leonard,What are you doing here?
Raj,I was sleeping.
Leonard,In my bed?
Raj,"Well, I wouldêve slept in my own bed, but it was being used to bring shame to my family. And the memory of Gene Roddenberry."
Leonard,"Oh, you heard?"
Raj,"Scotty, I need more power."
Leonard,Sorry. Does Sheldon know youêre sleeping in here?
Raj,"Are you kidding? He made me sign a waiver, participate in an emergency fire drill and take a refresher course in CPR. Thank God he had a dummy."
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. Mouth-to-Mouth Mona. You know, she used to date Howard?"
Raj,"Oh, my God, sheês that Mona? Why canêt you and my sister spend your nights here?"
Leonard,We tried. She doesnêt get along with Sheldon.
Raj,Sheldon doesnêt get along with Sheldon. Itês still no reason for me to have to listen to you arm your photon torpedoes every night.
Leonard,"Okay, well, how about this. Until Priya gets her own place, you stay here and Iêll stay at your apartment."
Raj,Can I bring girls here?
Leonard,You? Sure. Bring as many as you want.
Raj,"Okay, deal."
Leonard,Just not against their will.
Leonard,Do you really think you should be eating that cake?
Leonard,"If youêre gonna be a trophy husband for a rich wife, you might want to watch your waistline."
Raj,"Heês right. A minute on the lips, a lifetime on the hips."
Howard,"Yeah, ha-ha. First of all, Iêm not threatened by my fianc_eês success. Iêm proud of her. And secondly, I have my own career."
Leonard,Until you have kids.
Sheldon,"Good news, Raj. I got the blood work back from the lab. Youêre okay to stay for a while."
Raj,When did you take my blood?
Sheldon,"Not important. Your sugar was a little high. Iêd follow up with your regular physician. In the meantime, I have some paperwork here for you to go over."
Raj,What the hell is this?
Sheldon,Boilerplate stuff. A modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest. And a living will and durable power of attorney.
Raj,This says you can make end of life decisions for me.
Sheldon,"As your friend, letês hope it doesnêt come to that. Please sign."
Raj,Did you sign this?
Leonard,"Thereês a reciprocity clause. You get to pull the plug on him, too."
Raj,"Well, that seems fair."
Sheldon,"Congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard. Hereês your I.D. Card, your key and your lapel pin. Which Leonard was too cool to wear. FYI, part of your responsibilities as roommate pro tem will be to drive me to and from work, the comic book store, the barbershop and the park for one hour every other Sunday for fresh air."
Leonard,"Bring a ball or a Frisbee, you know, something he can chase."
Sheldon,"Also, youêre tasked with bringing home all takeout dinners. Tonight is Thai food. Youêll find the standard order in appendix B or downloadable from my FTP server. If you have any questions, hereês the FAQ sheet, or if you prefer the human touch, I do a live web chat called Apartment Talk on Tuesday nights."
Leonard,No backsies.
Raj,"Sheldon, dinner!"
Sheldon,What is this?
Raj,This is the difference between eating and dining.
Sheldon,Remarkable. Iêm just realizing how much Leonardês been skating by all these years.
Raj,Itês not a big thing. Just think of me as a brown Martha Stewart.
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon, did you change your Wi-Fi password again?"
Sheldon,"Yes, itês _Penny, get your own Wi-Fi.î No spaces."
Penny,Thanks. Wow! Whatês with the fancy spread?
Sheldon,"My new roommate is bending over backwards to ingratiate himself to me.  Uh, nice touch, by the way."
Penny,"What do you mean, new roommate? What happened to Leonard?"
Sheldon,The same thing that happened to Homo Erectus. He was replaced by a superior species.
Raj,Iêm the new Homo in town. That came out wrong.
Penny,"All right, let me try this again. Whereês Leonard?"
Raj,"Heês living at my place, so Iêm living here."
Sheldon,Youêre living here provisionally. But I must say itês looking good.
Penny,"Woah, Leonard and Priya are living together? Thatês big."
Sheldon,"Origami napkin swans, thatês the headline."
Raj,Itês a good thing.
Howard,So do you know what kind of research youêll be doing at this pharmaceutical company?
Bernadette,"Well, there are a couple of opportunities available, but I volunteered for the premature ejaculation project. I mean, itês not like either one of us has heart disease. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a little present."
Howard,"Oh, Bernie, no. You didnêt have to."
Bernadette,"I wanted to. Come on, open it."
Howard,You bought me a Rolex? How much did this cost?
Bernadette,"Oh, you let me worry about the money. I just want my baby to have pretty things."
Raj,More wine?
Penny,"Oh, no, no, no. Iêve had way too much already."
Sheldon,Hereês an interesting fact about alcohol.
Penny,Hit me.
Sheldon,"Man is not the only species that ferments fruit in order to become intoxicated. Can you guess what the other is? Hint, sometimes they pack the alcohol in their trunks."
Sheldon,When does a monkey have a trunk?
Penny,When a suitcase just wonêt do.
Sheldon,"Mmm, all right. It would appear as if alcohol is playing keep-away with your intelligence. Good night. Please note, it is now past ten p.m. Per our roommate agreement, kindly refrain from raucous laughter, clinking of glasses, and celebratory gunfire."
Penny,"Okay, explain something to me. You watch Leonard put up with that guy for years and years. What has to break inside your brain for you to think, Oh, Krishna, Iêve got to get me some of that?"
Raj,"Well, itês a lot better than having to wear noise-cancelling headphones in my own apartment."
Penny,"Oh, God, yeah. Yeah. Leonardês a noisy little dude in the sack."
Raj,Every night.
Penny,"Really? Even during allergy season, when he has to alternate between kissing and breathing?"
Raj,Itês my sister. Can we not talk about this any more?
Penny,"Yeah. Sorry, sorry. Can I tell you a secret?"
Penny,I screwed up. Leonardês a great guy. Never should have broken up with him.
Raj,"Well, uh, to paraphrase Shakespeare, Itês better to have loved and lost than to stay home every night and download increasingly shameful pornography."
Penny,"Oh, you poor baby."
Raj,"Whatês wrong with me, Penny?"
Penny,"Nothing, nothing. You know, if we werenêt friends, and you hadnêt brought up that creepy pornography story, Iêd be on you like the speed of light squared on matter to make energy."
Raj,"Hey, you totally got that right! E equals M C squared."
Penny,"I listen. I have no idea what it means, but I listen. To friendship."
Raj,To friendship.
Sheldon,Would you booze hounds please stop that infernal clinking? And the answer was elephant!
Leonard,Mmm. Mmm.
Leonard,"Oh, come on! Why donêt we just tell them that weêre dating?"
Leonard,When is the time?
Leonard,Youêre moving back to India?
Leonard,When were you going to tell me about this?
Leonard,Sheês lying because she doesnêt want you to know weêre dating.
Leonard,"Well, what difference does it make? If youêre moving back to India, weêre obviously breaking up."
Leonard,So. Hot in India?
Leonard,Uh. That is a beautiful tapestry.
Sheldon,What are you doing here?
Sheldon,"I said, what are you doing here?"
Leonard,I live here.
Sheldon,I have paperwork that says differently.
Leonard,Priyaês going back to India.
Sheldon,Irrelevant. Rajesh and I have a good thing going and youêre not going to ruin it.  What are you doing here?
Howard,Iêve been up all night. I had a fight with Bernadette.
Howard,She gave me a beautiful watch.
Sheldon,"Leonard, do you understand this?"
Sheldon,Talk to him.
Leonard,Whatês going on?
Penny,"Oh. Itês, itês not what it looks like."
Sheldon,What does it look like?
Sheldon,Itês not what it looks like. Itês not what it looks like.
Leonard,What are you grinding about?
Sheldon,"Pennyês brain teaser this morning. She and Koothrappali emerge from your bedroom. She is dishevelled, and Raj is dressed only in a sheet. The sole clue, itês not what it looks like."
Leonard,"Just let it go, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"If I could, I would, but I canêt, so I shanêt. Now, knowing Penny, the obvious answer is, they engaged in coitus. But, since thatês what it looked like, we can rule that out. Letês put on our thinking cap, shall we?  Yes, just like that. Penny could have been inspecting Rajês anal region for parasites. Oh, boy. Thatês a true blue friend."
Leonard,"They slept together, Sherlock."
Sheldon,"No, you werenêt listening. She said, itês not what it looks like."
Leonard,She lied.
Sheldon,Oh. Well donêt I look silly sitting here wearing this?
Sheldon,"Hey. Leonard, is it awkward for you knowing that one of your dear friends had sexual intercourse with a woman you used to love in the very place you lay your head?"
Leonard,"No, Iêm fine with it."
Sheldon,"That sounds like sarcasm, but Iêm going to disregard it, because I have an agenda. Paintball. Specifically, the interdepartmental tournament this weekend. Now, in order to function better as a fighting unit, I thought we should establish a chain of command. Now, it goes without saying that I would outrank the three of you, but the question remains, by how much? Now, I donêt see me as some four-star general, back at HQ riding a desk and playing golf with the Secretary of Defence. But I also canêt be Sergeant Cooper, because that might lead you to think of me as just a regular Joe. This might take some thought. As you were."
Leonard,What the hell is wrong with you?
Howard,"Yeah, how could you do that?"
Raj,What is it to you?
Howard,I got his back.
Raj,"Yeah, right. Youêre just jealous because it turns out Iêm Pennyês number two choice after Leonard."
Howard,"Hey, if I wasnêt engaged to Bernadette, that totally could have been me."
Leonard,"Please. Sheldon would have been before you, and he might not even have genitals."
Raj,"Why do you care so much? Youêre dating my sister, and Penny and I are in love."
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, if I may interject, Iêve decided my rank will be captain. If itês good enough for Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo, itês good enough for me."
Howard,Youêre not in love with Penny.
Raj,"Yes, I am. The god Kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love."
Raj,"Heês the Hindu version of Cupid, but way better, because he rides a giant parrot."
Leonard,"Raj, come on. You fall in love with any girl who smiles at you. A month ago, you were writing poems about his fiancee."
Howard,Iêm sorry. What?
Raj,Rubbish. Heês talking rubbish.
Leonard,"Oh, Bernadette, please play my clarinet."
Raj,"That could have been about anyone. Besides, you have nothing to worry about, because now Iêm the dusky half of Koothrapenny."
Sheldon,"For the record, I do have genitals. Theyêre functional and aesthetically pleasing."
Penny,"Coming. Yup, thatês good. Wine glasses should have handles."
Amy,Keeping accurate track of your alcohol intake. Smart idea considering how trampy you get when youêve had a few.
Penny,You heard what I did?
Amy,"Well, I heard who you did."
Penny,"Oh, my God, I screwed up everything. I hurt Leonard, I hurt Raj, I mean, what is wrong with me? I feel like two totally different people, Dr. Jekyll and Mrs. Whore."
Amy,Donêt be so hard on yourself. Do you know the story of Catherine the Great?
Amy,"She ruled Russia in the late seventeen hundreds, and one night, when she was feeling particularly randy, she used an intricate system of pulleys to have intimate relations with a horse."
Penny,IêmÑ Iêm sorry. What does this have to do with me?
Amy,"She engaged in interspecies hanky-panky, and people still call her great. Iêm sure your reputation can survive you shagging a little Indian boy."
Bernadette,You jerk face! What did you tell Howard? Did you say there was something going on between us? Because he thinks there is. Heês completely freaking out!
Raj,"Please, come in."
Bernadette,What the hell is wrong with you?
Raj,"Well, you were always so nice to me, I thought maybe you liked me."
Bernadette,Iêm nice to everyone.
Raj,Iêm sorry.
Bernadette,"Damn right, youêre sorry. And you tell Howard thereês never been anything between us."
Raj,"I will. Hey, Bernadette?"
Raj,Do you think I have a shot with Penny?
Bernadette,Of course you do. Youêre a cutie pie. Any girl would be lucky to have you.
Penny,"You know, Iêve done this before. In kindergarten, I was supposed to marry Jason Sorensen at recess, but by the time my class got out there, he was already engaged to Chelsea Himmelfarb. So what did I do? Hung upside down from the monkey bars, let all the boys see my underpants."
Amy,"You canêt blame yourself. When your prefrontal cortex fails to make you happy, promiscuity rewards you with the needed flood of dopamine. We neurobiologists refer to this as the skank reflex."
Penny,You know what? Letês get out of here.
Amy,Where are we going?
Penny,Somewhere where no oneês seen me naked. We may have to drive awhile. 
Sheldon,"Subtlety isnêt her strong suit, is it?"
Penny,Can I stay at your place for a few nights?
Amy,Really? A best friend sleepover? Yay.
Penny,"Yeah, sure. Yay!"
Amy,"Weêll make popcorn, stay up all night and Iêll teach you my secret language, Op."
Penny,Sounds great.
Amy,Nope. Sounds Gop Rop E A Top.
Penny,"Yeah, Iêm gonna go pack a bag."
Amy,"No, youêre not. Youêre gonna Pop A Cop Kop A Bop A Gop."
Leonard,Do we really have to wear this camouflage crap to play paintball?
Sheldon,"Who said that? Leonard, I can hear your voice, but I canêt see you."
Leonard,"Iêm not in the mood, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Oh, there you are. Leonard, I know youêre upset about recent events, and I have someone here to help. "
Leonard,I donêt want to talk to Amy.
Sheldon,"No, itês not Amy."
Leonard,You called my mother?
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, is it really necessary to caption the obvious?"
Leonard,Whatês going on? What do you want?
Leonard,Thatês so nice.
Leonard,"Well, uh, okay, um, I donêt want to get back together with Penny. We tried it, it was crazy, it didnêt work, but I canêt deal with the fact that she slept with my friend Raj. And then I find out that Rajês sister Priya, who Iêve been going out with for eight months, is moving back to India. So Iêm just completely confused and alone."
Leonard,Got any advice?
Leonard,"Excuse me. Youêre a world-renowned expert in parenting and child development, and all youêve got is buck up?"
Leonard,"Thanks, Mother. I feel much better."
Amy,"Ninety-nine, one hundred. Itês like a waterfall of liquid gold. My turn."
Penny,"You know, I donêt even know what the point of me staying in L.A. is. I havenêt gotten a single acting job since I moved out here. The closest I came was last month, I got a callback for a hemorrhoid commercial."
Amy,"Oh, I could so see you being the face of haemorrhoids."
Penny,"I know, right? Maybe I should just move back to Nebraska."
Amy,"No, I canêt let you do that."
Penny,Why not? 
Amy,"For the first time ever, I have a thriving social life. And no pressure, but it kind of lives and dies with you."
Raj,"Hi, Amy. Can I talk to Penny?"
Amy,A guest in my trundle bed and a boy at my door? I wish I could tell 13-year-old me it does get better.
Penny,How did you know I was here?
Raj,Itês all over her Facebook page.
Amy,Iêll take your stuff to the bedroom and clear out a drawer.
Amy,"No problem. Try and keep it in your pants, okay?"
Penny,"So, hi. Whatês up?"
Raj,"I was wondering if youêre free Friday. Theyêre having a Totally ê80s Night at the Greek. Hall & Oates, Katrina and the Waves and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo."
Penny,"Oh. Gee, thatês really sweet, but the thing isÑ"
Raj,"Aw, thereês a thing."
Penny,"Look, honey, I was really drunk and made a huge mistake last night. We shouldêve never slept together. Itês what ruins friendships."
Raj,You canêt ruin a friendship with sex. Thatês like trying to ruin ice cream with chocolate sprinkles.
Penny,"Come here. Just listen to me. I want to go back to the way we were before. You know, friends. No sprinkles."
Raj,Oh. All right.
Penny,Thank you.
Raj,"Well, uh, as your friend, you might like to know that, um, we didnêt have sex in the conventional sense."
Penny,"Oh, God. Did you pull some weird Indian crap on me?"
Raj,"No, no. After we got undressed and jumped in bed, you, you asked if I had protection."
Penny,"Oh, you did, didnêt you?"
Raj,"Of course. Iêm always packing. Anyway, um, I had trouble putting it on and you tried to help and, that was all she wrote."
Penny,"So, we didnêt actuallyÑ"
Raj,I did. It was beautiful.
Raj,"Penny, please, please promise me you wonêt tell anybody about this."
Penny,"Of course I wonêt. No, I wonêt."
Raj,"Oh, good. Um, can I tell people that our love burned too bright and too quickly? Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?"
Raj,"Cool. Can I say it fell apart because you were all, I want to have your babies, and I was like, Iêm too rock and roll to be tied down?"
Raj,Can I say I ruined you for white men?
Penny,Also no.
Raj,"Okay, just the candle thing."
Raj,Cool. All right friend.
Raj,Iêll see you around.
Penny,"Okay. Raj, wait. Thank you for being my friend. "
Raj,Itês getting beautiful again.
Sheldon,"All right, this is a Google Earth view of the field of battle."
Howard,I donêt see anything.
Sheldon,"Give it a second to load. Whenever youêre ready, AT&T! Okay, here we go. This is us here. To the south is Professor Loomis and the Geology Department. According to their Twitter feed, theyêre out of sunblock, which means theyêll have to hug the tree line or risk melanoma. Thatês our edge. All we have to do is move quickly over this ridge, the rock-worshipping pasty-faced bastards wonêt know what hit them. All right, letês move out."
Leonard,"Hang on, Sheldon. How could you not tell me your sister was moving back to India?"
Howard,Maybe he was too busy writing clumsy penis metaphors about my fiancee.
Raj,Screw you. That was a beautifully written penis metaphor.
Leonard,"You know what, guys, Iêm not in the mood for paintball. What do you say we just bag it?"
Howard,Fine with me.
Raj,"Sure, whatever."
Sheldon,You canêt quit. Thatês a court-martial offence. Thatês punishable byÑ You canêt quit.
Leonard,"Sorry, Sheldon, itês just not a good time for playing games."
Sheldon,"This is a game to you? Uh, was the Battle of Antietam a game? Huh? Was the sack of Rome a game?"
Leonard,"Yes, no and no."
Sheldon,"Wait. I just want you all to know that I forgive you. This mutiny isnêt your fault, itês mine. I havenêt earned these bars. Although what I lack in leadership, apparently I more than make up for in sewing."
Howard,"Let it go, Sheldon. Iêll get you a Jamba Juice on the way home."
Sheldon,Jamba Juice is for heroes. And thatês what weêre going to be.
Leonard,What are you doing?
Sheldon,"Following in the footsteps of Kirk, Crunch and Kangaroo. "
Howard,Damn those sons of bitches!
Leonard,Letês get êem!
Sheldon,"If thereês ever a Church of Sheldon, this will be when it started. Ow!"
Leonard,"Iêd like to propose a toast to the man whose noble sacrifice inspired our victory, Captain Sheldon Cooper."
Sheldon,"Excuse me. Itês Major Sheldon Cooper. With my last breath, I awarded myself a battlefield promotion. Itês kind of a big deal."
Penny,Hi. You guys have a minute?
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, sure."
Penny,"Okay. Um. Well, I already talked to Raj, but I wanted to apologize to the rest of you for, you know, everything."
Raj,"Please, Penny, let me. Weêve decided to let our crazy, wonderful night together be just one of those memories you have and can call to mind when youêre feeling blue or youêre in the shower."
Penny,"Hey, what you doing, Quick Draw?"
Raj,Sorry. Go on.
Penny,"Anyways, I wanted you guys all to know that Iêve been taking a really hard look at things and come to the conclusion I have to stop kidding myself. I suck at acting. Itês time for me to move back to Nebraska."
Leonard,Youêre leaving?
Howard,What are you going to do in Nebraska?
Penny,"I donêt know, maybe teach acting.  Oh, sorry. Hold on. Hello?"
Leonard,"Penny, Penny, listen, I hope youêre not doing this êcause of you and me, because I have a girlfriend, and youêre a single woman."
Penny,"Shh! Itês my agent, itês my agent. Youêre kidding. Oh, my gosh. I canêt believe it! Really? Oh, Iêm so excited, thank you, thank you so much. Okay, bye. I got the haemorrhoid commercial! I start Monday."
Sheldon,What about Nebraska?
Penny,"Oh, hell with Nebraska. Iêm gonna be a star!"
Sheldon,Have you ever thought of teaching physics?
Penny,"I donêt think so, Mom. Not today."
Penny,You donêt know the half of it.
Penny,Rose-scented Preparation-H for women?
Leonard,Iêm proud of you.
Penny,Shh! Here comes my joke.
Penny,Sittinê pretty.
Sheldon,What are you doing?
Leonard,"Oh, uh, Priyaês calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date."
Sheldon,Itês eight oêclock in the morning in Mumbai. How can she have dinner?
Leonard,"Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast."
Sheldon,"All right, so technically itês not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, youêd open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?"
Leonard,That doesnêt sound like mocking.
Sheldon,You didnêt let me finish. Dinfast . Are those soy-based candles?
Leonard,I donêt know. Why?
Sheldon,Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast .
Leonard,"Listen, I donêt want to be rude, but Priyaês gonna be calling any minute, soÑ"
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs."
Leonard,"Yes, Iêve always admired that about you."
Sheldon,As well you should. But Iêm going to make an exception here.
Leonard,"Oh, good."
Sheldon,"Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby."
Leonard,A hobby?
Sheldon,Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money.
Leonard,"You know, some people might say that itês great that weêre trying to make things work long distance. Theyêd say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you."
Sheldon,"When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized."
Leonard,You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?
Sheldon,Donêt you like Amy?
Leonard,Of course I like Amy.
Sheldon,"Well, thereês the difference. "
Leonard,"Excuse me, thatês Priya."
Leonard,"Hey, honey."
Leonard,"Oh, I miss you, too."
Sheldon,I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.
Sheldon,Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.
Penny,"Oh, itês no problem. Itês actually kind of nice. You reading, me reading. Weêre like an old married couple."
Sheldon,"If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles."
Penny,I donêt have iced tea and snickerdoodles.
Sheldon,A good wife would go to the store.
Penny,I want a divorce.
Sheldon,"Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair."
Penny,"Itês great, isnêt it?"
Sheldon,"It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name."
Penny,What name?
Penny,"Oh, all right, well, Iêm glad you like it. I mean, I still canêt get over the fact someone just threw it away."
Penny,"Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here."
Penny,What is wrong?
Sheldon,Iêve been sitting in garbage!
Penny,"Sheldon, take it easy."
Sheldon,You take it easy! I need to use your shower.
Penny,I went into this marriage with so much hope.
Sheldon,Thereês a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor. .
Raj,This is fun. Iêve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.
Howard,"Pretty sweet, huh? This little baby set the university back 175 grand."
Leonard,Thatês three minutes. Should we see what we got?
Howard,Hang on.
Raj,"Oh, yeah. This is one good-looking panini."
Howard,Hand me the tuna melt.
Howard,Thank you. Howês it going with the long-distance love affair?
Leonard,"Not easy, but weêre making it work."
Howard,"When you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?"
Howard,"You know, the virtual pickle tickle. The digital bow-chicka-bow-bow."
Raj,"Come on, dude. This is my sister youêre talking about."
Howard,"Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it."
Leonard,Thereês no junk jiggling. We just talk.
Howard,"Are you insane? With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex since the invention of the washcloth."
Leonard,I canêt do that.
Howard,"Well, if you donêt, youêre gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books."
Raj,How can you be so racist?
Howard,"Oh, come on, tell me Iêm wrong."
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, good. There you are. I need you to check my head for chair lice."
Leonard,"I did it last night, Iêm not doing it again."
Howard,"Just his head, right?"
Leonard,I donêt want to talk about it. You didnêt catch bugs from Pennyês chair.
Sheldon,"Yes, I did. And now theyêre cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest."
Leonard,"Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion."
Sheldon,Name one time Iêve ever done that.
Leonard,How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced youêd started growing again.
Sheldon,"I said, name one. You really need to work on your listening skills."
Sheldon, Penny.
Sheldon,You need to remove that chair from the building. Itês a health hazard.
Penny,"Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions."
Penny,Yeah. Itês cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.
Sheldon,It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical smell. Thatês reassuring.
Penny,"Why donêt you give it a try, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,All right. It is a comfortable chair.
Penny,Why donêt you just admit you overreacted?
Sheldon,"No, thank you. (Sees insect. More appear and swarm all over him. He jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. Jumps up and runs out to Pennyês apartment."
Leonard,Itês like living with a Chihuahua.
Penny,"Whatês up, buttercup?"
Sheldon,You have to get rid of the chair.
Penny,Nope.  
Sheldon, Penny.
Penny,"Whatês the word, hummingbird?"
Sheldon,"For your safety, please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death."
Sheldon, Penny.
Penny,"Whatês the gist, physicist?"
Sheldon,"Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned.  Penny."
Leonard,"So, here we are. Back in bed together."
Leonard,"Okay, so I, I, I guess Iêll just jump right in."
Leonard,"Uh, youêre a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to punish you with my love?"
Leonard,Not good?
Leonard,"Okay. Uh, uh, youêre not naughty. Uh, youêre, youêre, youêre dirty. Youêre, youêre a, a dirty girl?"
Leonard,"Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay. Youêre a, youêre a, youêre a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. Ugh!"
Leonard,Why donêt you just give me five minutes? Iêll Google how to do this. Iêll call you right back.
Leonard,"Okay, like usual. Good."
Leonard,All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.
Leonard,"Yes, maêam."
Leonard,"Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!"
Leonard,Cool.  Uh-oh!
Leonard,"Oh, damn it!"
Leonard,"No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. Itês probably just buffering, just give it a second."
Leonard,"So, how are your mom and dad?"
Leonard,"Yeah. Sure, sure."
Sheldon,"If your videoês frozen, try resetting the TCP/IP stack."
Leonard,Oh! I didnêt even think of that. Thanks.
Sheldon,Youêre welcome. Please let me know when you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your self-abuse. Iêm trying to stream a movie on Netflix in here.
Amy,"Five, six, seven, eight. Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she passes, each one she passes goesÑ"
Sheldon, Amy.
Amy,OhÑ You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?
Sheldon,"Is not. Is not, is not."
Amy,"Denial. Denial, denial. Come in."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Amy,Would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?
Amy,How about the theme song to the classic television show Diffêrent Strokes? Now the world donêt move to the beatÑ
Amy,"Well, thatês every song I know. Whatês up?"
Sheldon,"Youêre good friends with Penny, right?"
Amy,"Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. Go on."
Sheldon,I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.
Amy,"For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?"
Sheldon,Cholera is water-borne. Youêre mocking me.
Amy,"Yes, I am."
Sheldon,Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.
Amy,"Sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesnêt mean I have to participate."
Sheldon,"All right, name your price."
Amy,Kiss me where Iêve never been kissed before.
Sheldon,You mean like Salt Lake City?
Amy,Never mind. Iêll talk to Penny.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Amy,Will you listen to me play my harp now?
Sheldon,"I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think Iêm going to experience an episode from my past.  Iêm sorry, Mommy. Donêt be mad at me. Donêt do that!"
Leonard,"I donêt know about this, Howard."
Howard,"Youêre having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking. This is your answer. There are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth. You have one, Priya has one in India. When you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits exactly what youêre doing to hers. See? Internet kissing.  Give it a try."
Leonard,I donêt think so.
Raj,Iêll try it. Like this?
Howard,"Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor."
Raj,Like this?
Howard,Close. Really French it.
Howard,"Yeah, you got it, you got it."
Raj,Iêm impressed. This is very lifelike.
Howard,Whoa! You just bit my tongue!
Raj,"I, I nibbled. I was being playful."
Howard,Why do you have to make everything weird?
Raj,Sorry. Better?
Howard,"Oh, yeah."
Penny,"Pretty cool, huh? Probably would cost, like, two hundred bucks in a store."
Amy,I do appreciate a bargain. This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.
Penny,Youêre kidding.
Amy,Everything except bra and panties. And theyêre a leopard-spotted secret I share with Victoria.
Penny,And now me.
Amy,I just have one question about the chair.
Penny,And whatês that?
Amy,Arenêt you worried about it being unhygienic?
Penny,"No, itês completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this."
Amy,"No, he didnêt."
Amy,"Yes, he did. He absolutely did."
Penny,"My God, Amy, thatês really crappy of you."
Amy,It is?
Penny,Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me? I thought you were my friend.
Amy,"No, I am your friend. Please donêt be mad at me."
Penny,"I canêt even believe this. You know, maybe you should just go."
Amy,"No, no, Iêm sorry, Iêm so sorry. I take it all back. Look. Iêm, uh, Iêm sitting in your chair. Thereês nothing wrong with it. Itês a great chair. Please let me continue to be part of your world. Ow!"
Penny,Whatês wrong?
Amy,Something in the chairês biting my tushy. Itês not important. Ow!
Penny,"Wait. Get up, get up!  Swear you wonêt tell Sheldon what happened!"
Amy,I swear! Can I tell my doctor? Iêm probably gonna need shots!
Penny,"Yeah, sure!"
Leonard,"Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out."
Leonard,"No, you listen. Youêre my woman, and Iêm gonna make you feel things you have never felt before."
Leonard,"Thatês right, say my name, and beg me for more, êcause, Iêm gonna give it to you."
Howard,Check it out. Free chair.
Raj,"Yeah. Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonardês apartment, I wouldnêt wind up sitting on the floor all the time."
Howard,On three?
Raj,What kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?
Leonard,Who wants the last dumpling?
Penny,"Ooh, me."
Sheldon,"Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group."
Penny,Thank you all for this high honour.
Sheldon,"Iêve seen pictures of your mother, keep eating."
Howard,"All right, honey, if weêre gonna make the movie, we should go.  Yeah, well, now it means her."
Bernadette,Itês okay if he wants to come.
Howard,"Fine. But next time, we get a sitter."
Penny,"All right, I got to go to work. Iêll walk down with you."
Sheldon,"Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?"
Howard,Neither of them are close.
Sheldon,"Oh, well, then I guess it doesnêt matter which one of you drives me. Letês play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a printerês type size or a compulsion to eat dirt."
Penny,"Okay, Iêm not driving him."
Sheldon,"No, Penny, donêt give up, you can get this."
Leonard,Arenêt you going with Sheldon?
Amy,"No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele."
Leonard,"Oh. Well, I have some work to do, soÑ"
Amy,I canêt imagine that would disturb me. Carry on.
Leonard,Okay. Wouldnêt you be more comfortable at home?
Amy,"Not really, no."
Leonard,All righty then. Guess Iêll just get started.
Amy,"Leonard, please. I donêt need the running commentary."
Leonard,You okay?
Amy,"Oh, sure."
Leonard,I thought you were reading.
Amy,"I was. Now Iêm thinking about what I read. You all right, Leonard? You seem very uncomfortable."
Leonard,"I, Iêm fine."
Amy,Should I go? Iêve been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.
Leonard,who told you that?
Amy,"Well, most recently my gynaecologist."
Leonard,"Well, you stay as long as youêd like."
Amy,"Iêm glad to hear you say that, because Iêm having a wonderful time. Hmm, I said the same thing to my gynaecologist."
Bernadette,"What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm not buying anything. Theyêre having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic."
Howard,Which side do you come down on?
Sheldon,"Iêll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people, Iêm going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know itês O-gauge or no gauge."
Howard,Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?
Bernadette,Thatês pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his motherês house.
Howard,"First of all, theyêre not tricks, theyêre illusions. And, secondly, when we get married, theyêre all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes."
Bernadette,Why would I keep clothes at your motherês house?
Howard,"Well, donêt think of it that way. Once we move in, itêll be our house."
Bernadette,Is she moving out?
Howard,Why would she move out? Itês her house.
Bernadette,Hang on. You seriously think Iêm going to live with your mother?
Sheldon,"Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, thatês exactly what he thinks."
Howard,"Why not? Itês a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Momês there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin."
Bernadette,"Iêm not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not ever."
Howard,"Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues."
Bernadette,"Raj, take me home."
Howard,Donêt listen to her. Go to the movie theatre.
Bernadette,Take me home now.
Howard,Movie theatre.
Sheldon,"Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I donêt care what you people do."
Amy,How was your shower?
Leonard,"It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?"
Amy,"Oh, Iêm up all night. Iêm like a possum. Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?"
Leonard,Not really. Is that my yearbook?
Amy,"Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, youêre really good at science. Maybe one day youêll come up with a cure for being a dork."
Leonard,"Well, it wasnêt spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that."
Amy,"If it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother."
Amy,"Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom."
Sheldon,"Well, you can add Jerryês Junction to the list of train stores Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in again."
Leonard,"Rough night, Casey Jones?"
Sheldon,You donêt know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.
Leonard,Whatês in the bag?
Sheldon,"I donêt want to talk about it. But itês not a spine,Iêll tell you that."
Amy,"Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard. We should do this again sometime."
Leonard,"Ah, sure. Thatêd be nice."
Amy,Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. Theyêre kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department.
Leonard,Wouldnêt you rather bring Sheldon?
Amy,"I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time."
Sheldon,Not my fault. You said thereêd be other scientists there my age.
Amy,"Doesnêt matter. Youêre out, heês in. No date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change."
Sheldon,"Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding."
Howard,Iêll get it!
Howard,I said Iêm getting it!
Howard,"I got it! Oh, hi."
Bernadette,Hey. I donêt want to fight. I was just surprised when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.
Howard,"Yeah, well, Iêm sorry I didnêt run it by you first."
Howard,"The bugs only come here because youêre their queen! Listen, how about this. Before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. Stay here for a weekend, see what itês like."
Bernadette,And your mom would be okay with that?
Howard,"Sure she would. Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend?"
Howard,See? Sheês good with it.
Sheldon,"All this years, Iêve been so wrong. The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun."
Penny,Youêre a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?
Amy,"Not without cutting his head open, no. How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?"
Penny,Really? For a wedding?
Amy,Perhaps youêre right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.
Penny,Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.
Sheldon,"Better than James Bond, because heês tinier."
Amy,I got you this to give to me.
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, guests donêt normally wear corsages to a wedding. Thatês more of a prom thing."
Amy,"I never went to my prom. My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs."
Penny,Put the corsage on her.
Leonard,"Amy, this is for you."
Amy,"When youêre done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist."
Sheldon,All aboard! Woo-woo! Itês official. Iêm an H-O trainiac.
Howard,"So, dinner went nice."
Bernadette,"Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your meat for you?"
Howard,"Only when itês fatty. Well, donêt be jealous, babe. Someday youêll get to cut it for me."
Bernadette,"Iêm okay, Mrs. Wolowitz."
Howard,"Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?"
Bernadette,"Oh, God."
Howard,"Relax, itêll be fine."
Amy,Would you like to dance?
Leonard,"No, thank you. Iêm really not much of a dancer."
Amy,"Youêre not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either."
Leonard,Iêm sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.
Amy,"Why shouldnêt they be? They have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. In some cultures, weêd stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm."
Leonard,"That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, soÑ"
Amy,"Leonard, you may not have noticed, but I am being a delight here. And youêre not holding up your end of the evening."
Leonard,"Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away."
Amy,"I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend whoês playing with a model train right now, you donêt hear me bitching about it. Leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you."
Leonard,Iêm not moody. Iêm fun.
Amy,You have any evidence to support that statement?
Leonard,"Well, hey, Iêm just as much fun as you are."
Amy,Really? Are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? I am.
Leonard,"Okay, fine, what do you suggest?"
Amy,"We just had a lovely meal, the band is on fire, and youêre sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup. Why donêt we head outon the dance floor and see if I can sweat through these dress shields."
Leonard,"Once again, I, Iêm really not much of a dancer."
Amy,"Donêt worry, Iêll lead. "
Howard,Ready for bed?
Bernadette,"I need to brush my teeth, but your motherês been in the bathroom for, like, an hour."
Howard,"Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on. Ma, give up! Tonightês not your night!"
Howard,"Come on, take a break! Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!"
Howard,Problem solved.
Bernadette,"No, itês not. Iêm not going in there."
Howard,"Oh, come on, honey. Sheês just sitting in there reading a magazine. You canêt see anything. I go in all the time."
Howard,"And we have splashdown. Wait here, Iêm gonna go light a candle. And then we make passionate love."
Amy,"There we go, last floor."
Leonard,"I just canêt figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped."
Amy,The hokey pokey is a young manês game.
Leonard,I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me itês okay to have fun once in a while.
Amy,Youêre welcome.
Leonard,And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.
Amy,"I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely."
Leonard,"Well, okay. Again, thank you."
Amy,"And again, youêre welcome."
Leonard,"Want to come in, have a cup of tea?"
Amy,"No, thanks. Iêm gonna head home."
Leonard,"Okay. Well, good night."
Amy,Good night. 
Penny,"Ames, hi. How was the wedding?"
Amy,Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.
Penny,"Come in, letês talk. Do you want a glass of wine?"
Amy,Wine is one of the reasons Iêm in this fix. That and this dang pelvis.
Penny,"Okay, Iêm sorry, what exactly happened?"
Amy,"The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, letês face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore."
Penny,"Oh, God, did he make a move on you?"
Amy,"No, but itês only a matter of time. How could I have not seen this coming? Now Iêm gonna have to break the little sad sackês heart."
Penny,"Yeah, Iêm sure heêll be okay."
Amy,"Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, Leonard just doesnêt get my motor running."
Penny,"So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?"
Amy,"Iêll let him have tonight. Then in the morning, Iêll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland. I mean, frankly, youêve got a better shot than he does."
Sheldon,"Leonard. Check it out. I bought an N-gauge locomotive. Half the size of H-O. Look, it fits in my mouth."
Leonard,Sounds like you had a great night.
Sheldon,I did. How was yours?
Leonard,Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.
Sheldon,What exactly do you mean by that?
Leonard,"Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groinês a little worse for wear.  Ow! Why did you do that?"
Sheldon,To send a message. She is not for you.
Sheldon,Not for you!
Bernadette,"Good morning, handsome."
Howard,"Morning, Mom."
Bernadette,Itês me.
Howard,"Yes, it is, and youêre so pretty in the morning."
Bernadette,Your mom and I made you breakfast.
Howard,"Oh, wow. So you guys are getting along?"
Bernadette,"Yeah, I guess. Weêre very different people, Howard, so communicationês a little tricky."
Bernadette,He didnêt try them yet!
Howard,Is there any butter?
Bernadette,Itês butter-flavoured syrup.
Bernadette,He wants butter!
Bernadette,I just told him that!
Howard,I donêt need any butter.
Bernadette,"If you want butter, Iêll get you butter."
Howard,"Well, I guess Iêll cut these by myself."
Sheldon,"The entrance to the dungeon is a moss covered door. You manage to open it only to find yourself face-to-face with a hideous, foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre. What do you do?"
Howard,"I say, hey Ma, whatês for dinner?î"
Sheldon,"Seventeen. The ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass. By the by, I liked it, too."
Leonard,"Hey, how go the wedding plans, Howard?"
Howard,Great. We spent five hours last night at Macyês registering for gifts. Looks like Iêm finally going to have that darling little earthenware asparagus dish Iêve always wanted.
Leonard,"See, this is the good thing about having a girlfriend 9,000 miles away. I can spend my nights doing whatever I want."
Howard,You mean like playing nerd games with us and then taking a suspiciously long shower?
Leonard,Maybe. We enter the dungeon.
Sheldon,You see a dragon.
Howard,"Really? So weêre playing Dungeons and Dragons, and we walk into a dungeon and see a dragon? Isnêt that a little on the nose?"
Sheldon,"When you play Chutes and Ladders, do you complain about all the chutes and all the ladders?"
Leonard,Are you gonna eat that whole pie?
Raj,Maybe. Why not? Who do I have in my life to watch my figure for?
Leonard,"Oh, God, did you watch Bridget Jones again?"
Raj,"No, itês just that everybodyês got someone. Sheldonês with Amy, Howardês getting married, youêre dating my sister."
Leonard,"Now that Howardês getting married, maybe heêll inflate one of his old girlfriends for you."
Raj,You know who I blame for my loneliness? The United States of America. Your movies and your TV shows promised streets paved with beautiful blonde women with big bazongas.
Howard,"Eat another pie, youêll have your own bazongas."
Raj,Thatês cruel. You know it goes straight to my hips.
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, please focus. Youêre facing a fire-breathing dragon."
Raj,I donêt know if I want to play anymore.
Sheldon,"Because you donêt have a girlfriend? Well, good Lord, if that becomes a reason not to play Dungeons and Dragons, this gameês in serious trouble."
Amy,"Now, I assume we use this same wax later on to neaten up each otherês bikini regions."
Penny,"Yeah, my bikini region is fine."
Amy,"Whoês shocked? Iêm not. So, Bernadette, howês the wedding planning going? And Iêm not asking as a prospective bridesmaid. Pick me! Pick me!"
Bernadette,We went cake-tasting yesterday. Raj came along. He cried and ate half the samples.
Penny,"Oh, the poor guyês so lonely. We should set him up with someone."
Bernadette,"You know, I met a really cute girl at work. Sheês married to a guy in one of our drug trials."
Penny,"Well, hello? Sheês married."
Bernadette,"Yeah, but her husband is in serious congestive heart failure, and a little birdie told me heês in the placebo group."
Penny,"Okay, so future grief-stricken widow is the one to beat."
Leonard,Are we ready to order?
Sheldon,One moment. Iêm conducting an experiment.
Howard,With Dungeons and Dragons dice?
Sheldon,"Yes. From here on in, Iêve decided to make all trivial decisions with a throw of the dice, thus freeing up my mind to do what it does best, enlighten and amaze. Page 14, item seven."
Howard,"So, whatês for dinner?"
Sheldon,A side of corn succotash. Hmm. Interesting.
Penny,"Um, Howard, can I see you for a minute, please?"
Howard,"Uh, I donêt want to show any more of your friends how I can fit in the booster seats."
Penny,"Uh, no, thatês not it. Just come with me, please."
Sheldon,Letês see what Iêll be washing that succotash down with. A pitcher of margaritas.
Leonard,Do you really want that?
Sheldon,Thatês the great thing. It doesnêt matter. My mind is freed up to think about more important things.
Raj,Whatês it thinking about now?
Sheldon,Hamburgers and lemonade.
Penny,"Um, Raj, thereês someone I want you to meet. This is my friend Emily. I know her from my spin class. Raj, relax. She canêt hear you. Sheês deaf."
Howard,"Emily, this is our friend Raj."
Penny,Oh! Look at you guys just hitting it off. I am so good.
Howard,She says itês nice to meet you.
Raj,Does she really mean that or was she signing it sarcastically?
Howard,"Raj says itês nice to meet you, too. She says she has to go back to her family, but Penny has her number if you want to text her and get together."
Raj,"Okay, Iêm going to play it cool. Tell her, maybe. Whatever, babe."
Howard,Heêll text you.
Raj,"Ah, look at that. I have a date. I love America again."
Sheldon,"And now for dessert, come on, hot fudge sundae, come on, hot fudge sundae. Bam! Thatês what Iêm talking about!"
Raj,"Okay, as soon as she gets here, so she knows Iêm cool with it, Iêm going to make a joke about her being deaf. I was thinking, hey, did you hear the one aboutÑ? Oh, no, I bet you didnêt."
Howard,Maybe we should revisit your lonely fat guy plan.
Raj,"Oh, sheês here."
Howard,"No joke. Oh, she says sheês sorry sheês late."
Raj,"Tell her it doesnêt matter. Tell her, her eyes shimmer like opalescent lilies in the lake of the palace of the celestial maidens."
Howard,Really? Thatês the first thing you want to say?
Raj,I worked on it all night. Use it.
Howard,"Look, I donêt know the sign for opalescent."
Raj,Then spell it.
Howard,I donêt know how to spell it.
Raj,Youêre blowing this for me!
Howard,He likes your eyes.
Raj,Youêre making me sound like a caveman.
Howard,"She says, thank you, you have nice eyes, too.î"
Raj,"Really? Ask her how many children she wants, and whatever number she says, say, me too."
Raj,"Fine. Tell her I have a deep, sexy voice like James Earl Jones."
Howard,She doesnêt know what James Earl Jones sounds like.
Raj,Great. Then she wonêt know Iêm lying.
Raj,"Letês see, what else can I tell you about me that would make you like me? Ooh, I love music. Do you love music?"
Howard,You really want to ask her that?
Raj,Youêre right. Everyone loves music.
Howard,"She says, do you play an instrument?"
Raj,"No, but when I was six years old, I tried to start a boy band called Frankie Goes to Bollywood. But I couldnêt get any other boys to join, so my parents asked the servants to be my backup dancers. Wait, when you sign servants, donêt sign it like Iêm bragging. Sign it in a way that I sound humble with just a hint of, thatês right, I had servants."
Howard,Do you hear yourself
Raj,"Yes, but she doesnêt. So get signing, hand monkey."
Howard,"I think I wrote a letter to Santa Claus every day. And then on Christmas morning, under the tree is a little puppy with a red ribbon."
Raj,What are you doing?
Howard,Texting Bernadette that Iêm gonna be late.
Raj,"Dude, what is she saying?"
Howard,"Itês a funny story about a puppy. Just smile and laugh. Quick, quick, stop smiling."
Raj,Why?
Howard,"The puppy died, it choked on a doll head. Sad face, sad face!"
Raj,"Itês a little hard to see with the city lights, but that W-shaped constellation is Cassiopeia. And she was the mother of Andromeda whoês over there."
Howard,"Look, pretty stars. This is her car. She hopes she can see you again sometime."
Raj,"Good, good. Oh, boy, help me out here. Does she want me to kiss her or not?"
Howard,"I speak sign language, I donêt read minds."
Raj,"If you were me, would you kiss her?"
Howard,"Yeah, but Iêm a make out king. "
Raj,I was so smooth on that date.
Howard,You? I made you smooth. You were an idiot.
Raj,"Whatever, dude. She kissed me."
Howard,"It mightêve been on your lips, but it was my kiss."
Raj,"Oh, fine. Letês agree she kissed both of us."
Penny,"Mustache is looking good there, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Donêt thank me. Thank the dice. They told me what percentage of my face to shave.
Howard,Why are you still doing this?
Sheldon,"Because itês working. In the past few weeks, unburdened by trivial decisions, Iêve co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals, and Iêm close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the Higgs boson particle."
Leonard,"You left out, got chafed testicles because you no longer wear underpants."
Sheldon,The dice giveth and the dice taketh away.
Penny,Is Raj out with Emily again?
Leonard,"Yeah, every night for the last month."
Penny,"Wow, canêt believe he has a girlfriend."
Sheldon,Me neither.
Howard,Hereês some other fun news on the Raj/Emily front. He gave her a pair of diamond earrings and leased her a car.
Penny,Youêre kidding.
Leonard,You think sheês taking advantage of him?
Penny,"Oh, of course not. She wouldnêt do something like that. Sheês deaf."
Leonard,Deaf women canêt be gold diggers?
Penny,"Handicapped people are nice, Leonard. Everyone knows that."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I actually have information about Raj that would be helpful with this discussion."
Leonard,Could you tell us?
Sheldon,"Letês see.  Snake eyes. Sorry, bud."
Penny,"Wait, hang on. Doubles. Roll again."
Sheldon,"Okay, get this. It doesnêt matter if heês showering her with gifts, because the Koothrappalis are vastly wealthy."
Penny,"What do you mean, vastly wealthy?"
Sheldon,"Well, wealthy means a lot of money, and vastly means even more. Iêm not sure whatês tripping you up."
Leonard,"Look, I know they have money. I donêt think itês that much."
Sheldon,"No, youêre wrong. See, as you know, a few years ago, I achieved one of my lesser dreams and became a notary public. Well, from time to time, I notarize banking documents for Raj. The Koothrappalis arenêt just rich, theyêre Richie Rich rich."
Penny,"Well, so how much is that?"
Sheldon,About halfway between Bruce Wayne and Scrooge McDuck.
Howard,"What the hell? The last time we went to the zoo, that son of a bitch made me buy him a churro."
Leonard,"Listen, guys, Iêm sorry, I donêt mean to be rude, but I need to go call Rajês sister, who I love so much. So vastly much."
Penny,"Okay, so heês got money, and itês a few gifts and a car."
Howard,And she got him to pay off all her credit cards.
Penny,"He paid off her credit cards? Damn it, I couldêve dated Raj for a couple months. But I, I wouldnêt have, because Iêm not that kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj."
Howard,"Heês not going to listen, heês in love."
Sheldon,"Canêt figure out what to do? I remember those days. Now, if youêll excuse me, I have toÑ  stay right here."
Howard,"Yeah, this is a bad idea. We should go."
Penny,Iêm the one that introduced him to her. Iêve got to say something.
Penny,Youêre engaged to my friend.
Howard,"Hey, Bernadette doesnêt mind where I get my motor running, as long as I park in the right garage."
Penny,"I canêt believe youêre engaged to my friend. Oh, here she comes."
Howard,Smart. Whisper so the deaf chick canêt hear you.
Howard,"Oh, hey, hi. Nice to see you."
Penny,"Um, can we talk to you about Raj?"
Howard,"She says, sure, what about him?"
Penny,"Okay, um, gosh, how do I start? Um, see, Raj is kind of naive. I mean, he hasnêt dated a whole lot of women. And Iêm concerned that, without meaning to, you might be taking advantage of him. You know, by letting him buy you a bunch of expensive things.And I.. IÑ Howard, focus. Tell her what Iêm saying."
Howard,"Right. Are you a gold digger or not? Oh, uh, something, something, who the something do you think you are? Mind your own something business and go something yourself. Oh, wait, I got this now."
Raj,Iêm so mad at you!
Penny,"Okay, waitÑ"
Raj,How dare you ambush my girlfriend at the gym!
Penny,"We didnêt mean for it to be an ambush. Just, itês kind of impossible not to sneak up on deaf people. And hey, since when are you so chatty?"
Raj,Iêm hammered.
Penny,"Raj, come here. This girl is trouble. I mean, what kind of relationship is it where you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?"
Raj,The best one I ever had!
Penny,"Okay, come on. You know you can do better."
Raj,"Aha. I see whatês going on here. You and I had our crazy night together, and now you canêt stand to see me with another woman."
Penny,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!"
Raj,Itês okay. I canêt get mad at your feelings.
Penny,I donêt have feelings.
Raj,"Yeah, thatês good. Keep telling yourself that. "
Penny,He is cuter now that I know heês rich.
Raj,"I have a surprise for you. Cover your eyes. Open them. Itês a real ruby. It was a little expensive, but no one can put a price on love. Although, the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it.  Oh, Mummy, Daddy. What a nice surprise."
Raj,"I just got her a couple of things. She gives me things, too."
Raj,Youêre going to make me choose between the woman I love and the money I have very strong feelings for?
Raj,"Well, I choose love."
Raj,"My parents are making me choose between money and you. I choose you.  And that necklace, yeah, that, too. But none of those things matter, because we have something better. We have love."
Raj,"Oh, Penny, I hurt so bad."
Penny,"I know, I know."
Raj,Sometimes I put the TV on mute just to pretend sheês still with me. But I canêt watch the closed captioning without crying.
Penny,"Oh, Iêm so sorry. I wish I could make you feel better."
Raj,Seriously? Iêm heartbroken and youêre hitting on me?
Penny,No!
Raj,"Look, Penny, youêre great, but I had a long talk with my parents, and they said if I date an Indian girl, I get a Maserati."
Raj,"Mmm. Oh, cheesecake, youêre just as good as a woman, even though I canêt have sex with you."
Howard,Try throwing it in the microwave for a few seconds.
Sheldon,"Should I use the rest room or wait until we get home? Come on, papa needs to void his bladder. Oh, thatês not what you want to see after three buttermilks."
Penny,"Here you go, boys. Iêll pick it up when youêre ready."
Howard,"Thanks for dinner, buddy."
Leonard,"Yeah, real big of you."
Sheldon,"Hurry, hurry, hurry."
Penny,"Oh, and donêt cheap out on the tip. We all know youêre loaded now."
Leonard,Itês from Game of Thrones. What do you think?
Sheldon,"I donêt know. If weêre going to start a fantasy sword collection, and Iêve long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?"
Leonard,What did you have in mind?
Sheldon,"Well, off the top of my head, Iêd have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England."
Leonard,It would be a replica of a movie prop.
Sheldon,Fair enough. Itêd give you the right to rule a replica of England.
Leonard,"Well, they donêt have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?"
Sheldon,"Mm. Tough decision. Thereês no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?"
Leonard,Just Bilbo Bagginsê sword over there.
Sheldon,"Two grown men with a hobbitês dagger; wouldnêt we look silly? Okay, letês go for it."
Leonard,"Yeah. Itês okay, I guess."
Sheldon,Okay? Itês magnificent.
Leonard,Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?
Leonard,"Oh, thatês pretty steep."
Sheldon,"Only 8,000? Weêre wasting precious time. Buy it."
Leonard,Hang on. Can you do any better?
Sheldon,"Oh, did you hear that? Weêre getting the friends and family discount. We are honoured and we will take it."
Leonard,Slow down. Two hundred.
Sheldon,What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.
Leonard,Will you shut up?
Leonard,Nope. Maybe another time.
Sheldon,"Take it, take it."
Leonard,Two hundred.
Sheldon,Killing you? I canêt breathe.
Sheldon,"Oh, now, we canêt let him lose money, Leonard. Iêm so sorry."
Leonard,Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.
Leonard,"Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten."
Leonard,See that? I just saved us forty bucks.
Sheldon,"Iêve long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts."
Leonard,"No, itês okay. Iêm gonna stab my friend in the chest."
Sheldon,"Hello, Wil Wheaton."
Sheldon,Itês part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?
Sheldon,Iêm not surprised.
Sheldon,Sucker. Didnêt even ask for the friends and family discount.
Leonard,Thank you.
Sheldon,"I see what youêre doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone weêre going to be there, and when we donêt show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever."
Leonard,I was actually thinking about going.
Sheldon,"And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it."
Leonard,"No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time."
Leonard,"Sheldon, can you grab me a water?"
Leonard,Can you or canêt you?
Sheldon,"Itês not that simple, Leonard."
Leonard,"It never is, is it?"
Sheldon,"At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheatonês party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. Iêm characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodingerês Friendship."
Leonard,Got it. Can I have my water?
Sheldon,"Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor."
Penny,"Wait, what is going on?"
Sheldon,"In case you have forgotten, Schrodingerês cat is a thought experimentÑ"
Penny,"No, no, no, no, I didnêt forget. Um, thereês this cat in a box and until you open it, itês either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brotherês camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there."
Amy,"Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. Youêre the whole package, arenêt you?"
Howard,"Sorry Iêm late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my teamês design for the deep field space telescope thatês going on the International Space Station this spring."
Bernadette,"Howie, thatês wonderful! Congratulations!"
Howard,"It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is."
Sheldon,Mohammed Lee.
Howard,Whoês Mohammed Lee?
Sheldon,"Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didnêt know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge."
Howard,"Itês me, Sheldon. Itês me. Iêm going up in space! Technically, Iêm an astronaut."
Bernadette,Hang on a second. NASA doesnêt have a shuttle any more. How are you going to get up there?
Howard,"Oh, well, itês really cool. You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market."
Bernadette,Are those Russian rockets safe?
Howard,"Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl."
Leonard,"Iêd like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howardês making that a reality. Weêre all very proud of you."
Sheldon,That was a lovely toast. Kudos.
Leonard,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clich_s. You sicken me."
Howard,Youêre really quiet. Is everything okay?
Bernadette,Fine. Just a little tired.
Howard,"I hope not too tired, because Iêm feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift."
Bernadette,I always catch your drift.
Howard,"All right, well, somethingês obviously bugging you. What is it?"
Bernadette,I just canêt believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me.
Howard,"Oh, I get it. Youêre worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, thereês a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home."
Bernadette,"Just stop talking, Howard."
Howard,This isnêt the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.
Bernadette,What did you think was going to happen?
Howard,Honestly? Sex.
Howard,Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honour it is to be chosen to go into space?
Bernadette,"Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. Weêre supposed to be partners. Weêre supposed to be a team."
Howard,"Iêm sorry. Youêre right. Okay, letês try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and Iêd like to discuss it."
Howard,Iêve been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?
Bernadette,"Well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process."
Howard,"Hey, weêre a team. So, what do you think?"
Howard,Well why not?
Bernadette,"Howard, my father was a police officer. We never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive. It was horrible. And I donêt want to live that way with you."
Howard,"Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11. We never saw him again."
Bernadette,"Oh, boo-hoo, youêre not going to space!"
Leonard,"Pretty cool about Howard, huh?"
Sheldon,"Donêt talk to me as if nothingês happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy."
Leonard,"For Godês sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff."
Sheldon,"Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenbergês uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?"
Leonard,"You never stop talking, do you?"
Amy,I donêt understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheatonês party?
Penny,Wil Wheaton is Sheldonês mortal enemy.
Amy,Mortal enemy?
Amy,"Sheldon, I know youêre a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?"
Sheldon,"In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?"
Penny,"Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no."
Sheldon,You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? Thisêll just take a moment. Itês on a five and a quarter inch floppy.
Amy,A floppy disk?
Sheldon,"Well, I started the list when I was nine."
Amy,How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?
Sheldon,"As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheatonês character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list."
Howard,"Change your mind about sex? Iêm still mad, but Iêll do it."
Bernadette,"No, Iêve just been thinking. It doesnêt matter if Iêm afraid for your safety. I donêt want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams."
Bernadette,"Really. If going into space means that much to you, I will never say another word about it."
Howard,Thank you.
Bernadette,I love you.
Howard,"I love you, too. So, sex now?"
Bernadette,Okay. I just forgot to brush my teeth. Iêll be right back. 
Bernadette,Iêm ready.
Leonard,"Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?"
Howard,What choice did I have? She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me.
Raj,Wow. Youêre not only our first astronaut. Youêre also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. Youêre like a rock star.
Howard,Little bit.
Leonard,"I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you."
Sheldon,"Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself."
Leonard,Going to Wheatonês party is not betraying you.
Sheldon,"Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks itês doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids youêre looking for."
Leonard,Iêm going to a party. Iêm not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!
Sheldon,Not yet.
Raj,"So, whatês gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?"
Howard,"I donêt know. If weêre going to get back together, sheês going to have to apologize and accept that Iêm a grown man who can make his own decisions."
Raj,Then sheês going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.
Bernadette,I had no choice. I had to tell his mother. He canêt go to space. Heês like a baby bird. Do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?
Amy,Youêre kidding.
Penny,"No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book."
Bernadette,I donêt know what Iêm going to do. I donêt want to break up over this.
Penny,"Okay, why donêt you just tell him you made a mistake?"
Bernadette,Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I the bad guy in this?
Amy,Itês not for us to judge. Weêre just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing youêve done.
Bernadette,"Oh, God, youêre right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize."
Penny,"Well, that, thatês good. Iêm glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question."
Penny,Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?
Bernadette,"I do, with all my heart."
Penny,Got it. Just had to check.
Amy,Heês great.
Leonard,"All right, Sheldon, weêre going to Wilês. This is your last chance."
Sheldon,"No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And youêre going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers."
Leonard,You want to drive?
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,"Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me."
Leonard,"No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party."
Sheldon,Brent Spiner?
Sheldon,I donêt care.
Leonard,"Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him."
Sheldon,"I did, but I think Iêve kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey."
Leonard,"Iêm going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Yeah, even that. You look like a dork."
Howard,Tell her Iêm not home!
Bernadette,Can we talk?
Howard,You can. I have nothing to say.
Bernadette,All right. I just wanted to tell you Iêm sorry I said something to your mother.
Howard,"I was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back."
Bernadette,I know. Iêm sorry. I got scared.
Howard,"If youêre gonna love me, youêre gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil."
Bernadette,I know.
Howard,"Well, donêt say it if youêre not gonna mean it, êcause Iêm not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I want to go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars. I want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean."
Bernadette,Really? You got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean.
Howard,"Well, those big kids were rocking it."
Bernadette,"I just did what I did because I love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle."
Bernadette,Youêre my soul mate. This is where you kiss me.
Howard,"Right, right."
Raj,"Hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays the Borg Queen in First Contact?"
Raj,"Well, I just met her gynaecologist!"
Leonard,What are you doing here?
Sheldon,"Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be, youêre still my little buddy. Iêm not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, letês meet Brent Spiner and go home."
Sheldon,What Iêd like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely.
Sheldon,An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.
Sheldon,"To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton."
Sheldon,"Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!"
Sheldon,"Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, Wil Wheaton."
Sheldon,"Youêve already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy."
Sheldon,"Come on, buddy. Letês not waste another second on this loser. Love your house."
Leonard,Can we get autographed dolls?
Leonard,Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.
Leonard,So what kind of cruise is this youêre going on?
Sheldon,"Well, Mom, if I did, it would be conclusive proof that your God can work miracles."
Leonard,Whatês Gunning with God? Iêm afraid to ask.
Sheldon,"Frankly, Mom, Iêm encouraged to see how advanced your group has become, willing to sail out into the ocean without fear of falling off the edge."
Sheldon,"The Lord giveth and the Lord bloweth away. Well, Mom, according to my itinerary for our weekend together, the fun begins with fried chicken."
Sheldon,"Good, êcause I got you everything you need to make it. You are in for a treat. My motherês fried chicken is why we had to buy my dad the extra large coffin."
Leonard,"Sheldon, she just got off the plane. She doesnêt want to cook."
Sheldon,Of course she does. Making me food is her way of saying I love you. Making me food when sheês too tired to cook is her way of saying I really love you.
Sheldon,Wonêt that spoil our appetites for the chicken youêre going to make me?
Leonard,"All right, that settles it, weêre going out. Do you like sushi? Thereês a great little place down the street."
Sheldon,Thereês a lot of harm in trying something new. Thatês why we test out drugs and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.
Leonard,"Sheldon, youêre talking like a crazy person."
Sheldon,Told you.
Sheldon,Stop yelling! Iêm not happy about this.
Leonard,Whatês the last thing you were ever happy about?
Sheldon,The prospect of fried chicken.
Leonard,"Uh, kung fu letters might not be politically correct."
Leonard,"Yeah, yeah, that, too."
Sheldon,"Well, thereês actually big news on the Amy front. Sheês been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals. She is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine."
Leonard,"Itês kind of like the Loch Ness monster. Maybe thereês something there, maybe there isnêt. Weêll probably never know. But sometimes itês fun to creep yourself out thinking about it."
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, itês Rajês sister. Itês kind of tough. Sheês in India. Also, her parents arenêt happy sheês dating someone white."
Sheldon,"And that reminds me of another saying. You can lead a chicken to Crisco, but you canêtmake your mother fry it."
Leonard,"Please pester her. Please, for me."
Leonard,"So, Mrs. Cooper, what did you think of the sushi?"
Sheldon,I donêt know. Lately weêve been talking about converting it into a missile silo.
Leonard,Your son seems to think we need to launch a pre-emptive strike on Burbank.
Sheldon,Get them before they get us.
Raj,"Hey, look who decided to show up."
Leonard,"Raj, what are you doing?"
Raj,"I couldnêt find you guys so I bought six new friends. Three, sadly, are dead."
Sheldon,"Mom, you remember Rajesh? Rajesh, my mother."
Raj,Of course. Mrs. Cooper. So nice to see you again.
Leonard,"We donêt say that, either. Iêll make you a list."
Raj,"Nothing, Iêm fine."
Raj,Iêm so lonely.
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, born alone, die alone. Itês a tragic human condition. Now, Raj, if youêll excuse my mother, sheês about to make a pecan pie thatêll be so good Iêll almost forget how she blew it with the fried chicken."
Sheldon,Offer them a hot beverage.
Raj,"I didnêt get a lot of that because of your accent, but the general tone was soothing and somehow I feel better."
Sheldon,"Iêm not going to get my pecan pie, am I?"
Leonard,You want some Oreos?
Sheldon,Double Stuf?
Leonard,"No, regular."
Sheldon,Nice. Kick a man when heês down.
Sheldon,"Iêm glad weêre finally getting to do something together, just the two of us."
Sheldon,"Careful, youêre using too much Downey. You know if my clothes get too soft it makes me sleepy."
Sheldon,"It is nice, isnêt it?"
Penny,Mrs. Cooper. Hi!
Penny,"Sheldon, you didnêt tell me your mom was coming."
Sheldon,"It was in my weekly e-mail blast. Right between beet season is finally here, and uh-oh, red stool from beets leads to cancer scare."
Penny,"Good, good."
Penny,"Oh, fine. You know, itês been a while. Iêm getting back out there."
Penny,"Well, itês super cute on. That top has paid for itself in free drinks like ten times what it cost."
Sheldon,"Yes, Penny has a lot of her money tied up in promiscuity futures."
Penny,"Oh, they donêt always get to ride the roller coaster. Sometimes they only get to spin the teacups. Now Iêm going out tonight. Would it be crazy to ask you to look at the outfit Iêm going to wear?"
Sheldon,Now that will not be in this weekês e-mail blast.
Howard,"So, this spring, I get to go to the International Space Station."
Howard,"Thanks, but I watch the Charlie Brown Christmas special every year, so I get the gist."
Howard,"Nope. She says if I donêt back out sheês going to go on a hunger strike. It would take years before sheêd be in any kind of danger, but still."
Sheldon,"Iêve got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. Iêm taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, Iêve worked up a couple of Qês that will stump his sorry A."
Sheldon,What sight is better than your little boy embarrassing a Nobel laureate?
Penny,"Ooh, maybe a little Rodeo Drive."
Howard,What do you say?
Sheldon,"What do I say? I say you people need to stop ruining my momês visit with your sushi, and your sadness and your slutty shirts. Stop it."
Howard,Heês not talking about your shirt. Your shirt is fine.
Leonard,These are delicious.
Leonard,Everything? Arenêt you worried about your health?
Sheldon,"Mom, I want to apologize for my behaviour last night."
Sheldon,"Great. Now, youêre going to love the Perlmutter lecture. Look, he will be stating that the universe is older than 6,000 years, but I thought you could stick your fingers in your ears and hum Amazing Grace during those parts."
Sheldon,But I apologized. And that was hard for me because I didnêt do anything wrong.
Sheldon,"Iêm not going, and you canêt make me."
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm going to stand here until you change your mind."
Leonard,Iêm just gonna take my bacon grease and slide over there.
Sheldon,I canêt believe my own mother is abandoning me.
Sheldon,"We appear to be at a crossroads in our relationship, Mother."
Leonard,Sorry. Syrup.
Sheldon,"All right, Mom. When youêre at the Ripleyês Believe It Or Not Museum, if they have an exhibit about a mother who threw away a chance to spend the day with the worldês most wonderful son, believe it, because itês true. "
Leonard,I hadnêtÑ
Sheldon,That lecture was a waste of time. I made more accurate diagrams of the expansion of the early universe on the nursery wall with the contents of my diaper. 
Amy,Are you getting sick?
Sheldon,"No, Iêm just allergic to people who get Nobel Prizes for no good reason."
Amy,"Sheldon, is it possible that your foul mood, or, to use the clinical term, bitchiness, is because your mother isnêt making you a priority?"
Sheldon,"Or to use the clinical term, nuh-uh."
Amy,Are you sure? The infant-mother pair-bond is the building block of primate psychology.
Sheldon,"Oh, there it is. It always comes back to monkeys with you. Just monkeys, monkeys, monkeys."
Amy,"Sheldon, weêre all animals. And granted, there are aspects of you that are extraordinary, but when it comes to emotions and relationships, youêre just like everybody else."
Sheldon,Are you trying to suggest that my emotional problems are no different than those of a stupid person?
Amy,"Actually, some research indicates that by not over-thinking, the less intelligent handle emotions better.  Sure youêre not coming down with a cold?"
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, the common cold. Just like everyone else. Youêd love that, wouldnêt you?"
Leonard,"Mrs. Cooper, we say Catholics, not rosary rattlers."
Penny,This is like the worst Hollywood tour ever.
Leonard,What are you gonna do? She wanted to see churches.
Penny,"Hey, they have wine here, donêt they?"
Raj,"Hey, none of our gods have abs like that."
Howard,"Yep, thatês the last Jew who did sit-ups. And look where it got him."
Leonard,"Oh, Iêm not sure we should."
Penny,"Okay, um, hey, God. Whatês up? Um, Iêm good, but, uh, it would be a big help to my family if you could get my brother to stop cooking meth. But no cops. Be cool."
Leonard,"Okay. I donêt know, itês probably a little late to ask you to make me taller. Oh, um, if you could help out with me and my girlfriend. Sheês all the way in India. That would be great."
Howard,"Oh, me? Thanks, Iêm good. Iêm really just trying not to burst into flames."
Howard,He says heês having trouble dropping those last five pounds.
Howard,"No, you only get one wish."
Sheldon,"Look at the two of us. Me, a highly regarded physicist. The kind of mind that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. You, the common man, tired from your labours as a stockbroker, or vacuum cleaner salesman, or bootblack. But deep down inside, apparently weêre just two peas in a pod. A regular pea, and the kind of pea that comes along once, maybe twice in a generation. Rain. Another great equalizer. Falling on the head of the brilliant and the unremarkable alike.  Smarty-pants."
Penny,"Oh, Mrs. Cooper, it smells so good."
Sheldon,I need a tissue.This one got wet.
Sheldon,"Thank you. Yeah, Iêve learned something today. You and I, in so many ways, other than intelligence and what counts, weêre the same. "
Sheldon,"I hope so, because if this is well, life isnêt worth living."
Sheldon,"And just to be clear, only her baby and not these other people."
Sheldon,Can I have tea with honey and toast with the crust cut off?
Sheldon,"Thanks, Mom.Youêre the best."
Sheldon,"I know, it filled in last year. I didnêt get to spend a lot of time with you on this visit."
Sheldon,"No, we donêt. The one we have works great."
Sheldon,"Or maybe Iêm part of a new species, that lives for hundreds of years, which means Iêm still basically a toddler."
Sheldon,Does this mean youêre not going to sing Soft Kitty?
Leonard,"Mrs. Cooper, were we supposed to take that pie out of the oven?"
Sheldon,Get out!
Sheldon,"Well, I know, but he means well. Sing."
Sheldon,"What are you trying to pull, Mom? From the top."
Sheldon,"And reverse the spin on the antiproton, and gamma becomes alpha, multiplied by a matrix of negative I comma zero, and there we have it. Conclusive proof that I am absolutely worthless after nine oêclock."
Sheldon,"Hmm.  All right, all right. I see whatês going on. A little pre-Halloween hijinkery. A ghostly moan, a rattling of chains, a witchês cackle. The trifecta of haunted house clich_s. Instead of eek, I say yawn."
Sheldon,"Oh, the walls are dripping blood, which looks nothing like a phenolphthalein indicator exposed to a sodium carbonate solution.  Ah. Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow."
Raj,You shouldêve seen your face.
Sheldon,"Yes, thereês nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled."
Howard,"Come on, admit it. We got you, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Please, fright depends on an element of surprise. The simple fact is, because I am much smarter than you, and able to anticipate your actions, it is highly unlikely that you two rubes could ever surprise me. "
Raj,Heês probably right.
Howard,We canêt beat him. Heês just too smart.
Sheldon,Gentlemen. .
Howard,Who had money on faints?
Raj,I had pee his pants.
Leonard,Hang on. Looks like everyoneês a winner.
Leonard,"Oh. Watch out, Sheldon. This little boy Casper is a g-g-g-ghost!"
Leonard,That was pretty droll. With a hint of ammonia.
Sheldon,"Yes, enjoy your japes, gentlemen. You think youêve poked fun at a milquetoast academic. Well, youêve forgotten one thing. I am also a son of the Lone Star state. Iêm Texas through and through. And we know how to settle scores down there. If you doubt me, ask Mexico."
Raj,What is she doing in a comic book store?
Leonard,"Uh, yeah. Itês issue number 21. First appearance of Hellboy."
Leonard,"Yes, but youêd be using your superpowers for evil."
Leonard,"Thanks. You, too. You know, go ahead and take it."
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, I guess."
Leonard,"Sorry, palmês a little sweaty. Whatês that word?"
Leonard,"Oh, right, your name. That makes more sense than penis."
Howard,Did we just see you pick up a girl in a comic book store?
Leonard,"No, I donêt think I picked her up. Besides, I have a girlfriend."
Sheldon,Be sure to check the mail.
Leonard,How many times are you gonna tell me? Whatês with you?
Sheldon,Nothing. Itês not suspicious that Iêm fixating. Itês consistent with my personality.
Penny,"Hey, guys."
Leonard,More Halloween candy? Didnêt you just buy a bunch of it yesterday?
Penny,Oh. Yeah. Thatês gone. Itês a rough month when Halloween and PMS hit at the same time.
Sheldon,"Leonard doesnêt have time to chat, he has to get the mail."
Leonard,"Will you relax? Iêll get it in a minute. Hey, how was work?"
Sheldon,Open the mail!
Leonard,"Excuse me.  A couple of circulars, nothing important."
Penny,Whatês with him?
Leonard,"Hang on.  You might be from Texas, but Iêm from New Jersey."
Leonard,Check it out. Jim Lee drew this of me two years ago at Comic Con.
Leonard,"Well, you know, itês Comic Con. Iêm Lion-O from ThunderCats."
Leonard,But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.
Leonard,Youêre kidding. You have your own book?
Leonard,"Cool. Oh, look. Thatês you having sex with a guy in the top half of a Chewbacca costume. Comic Con?"
Leonard,Youêre very talented. This is really good. Did you doÑ 
Leonard,You can have my car.
Raj,"Good morning, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"It is, isnêt it? Oh, bother. Isnêt that just always the way? You go to staple something, and youêre out of staples. Gosh, I wish Iêd known that earlier today when I was at Staples."
Raj,You have a thing of paper clips right there.
Sheldon,"well, no, no, I need something more permanent to join these papers. Say, donêt you keep staples in your top desk drawer?"
Raj,I donêt know. Maybe.
Sheldon,Be a lamb and check.
Raj,All right.  Who do we have here?
Sheldon,Itês a snake. A terrifying snake.
Raj,"Oh, did some bad man put us in a drawer?"
Sheldon,Stop talking like that. Youêve been rendered speechless by fear.
Raj,Letês go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice.
Sheldon,"I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. Youêre better than this."
Penny,Itês open.
Leonard,"Hey, you got a minute?"
Penny,"Yeah, sure, come on in."
Penny,Want some mac and cheese?
Leonard,Lactose. Gas.
Penny,Glass of wine?
Leonard,Sulfites. Migraines.
Penny,"Okay, well, Iêd offer you Halloween candy, but thatês gone. So, whatês up?"
Leonard,"Okay, we used to go out, right?"
Penny,"Oh, my God, thatês where I know you from."
Leonard,"Iêm dealing with a situation and itês kind of about my love life, so I know that might be weird for us to talk about, but in this area, as you know, all my other friends are just so stupid."
Penny,"All right, whatês going on?"
Leonard,"So, youêre okay talking about this?"
Leonard,Youêre sure itês not weird.
Penny,Itês okay.
Leonard,"You know what, if you ever want to talk to me about a problem in your life with a guy, then I would be fine with that."
Penny,"Okay, good, because thereês this one guy I used to date whoês about to be force-fed wine and cheese if he doesnêt get to the point."
Leonard,"Okay, uh, here it is. Is it cheating if a guy has a girlfriendÑ"
Penny,"Yeah, probably."
Leonard,Come on.
Penny,"Iêm sorry, go ahead."
Leonard,"I met this girl, and sheês great. We have a lot in common."
Penny,Did you guys do it?
Leonard,We just made out a little.
Penny,"Oh, look at you, you bad boy. Did you tell her about Priya?"
Leonard,"Well, I was gonna, but there were too many tongues in my mouth."
Penny,Thatês gross.
Leonard,"Hereês the thing, I, Iêm not one of those guys who sneaks around and sleeps with more than one woman."
Penny,"Well, good for you."
Leonard,"The problem is, I want to be one of those guys."
Penny,So sleep with the new girl and lie to Priya.
Leonard,"Oh, thatês not who I am."
Penny,"All right, then break it off with the new girl."
Leonard,"Now, letês not do anything rash. Sheês really hot."
Penny,"If you like this girl so much, why donêt you just end things with Priya?"
Leonard,Priya and I are in love. I think we could get married someday.
Penny,"Leonard, youêre looking for a way to sleep with both women and have everybody be happy about it."
Leonard,Now weêre getting somewhere.
Penny,What does your gut tell you?
Leonard,Go ask Penny; sheêll know what to do.
Sheldon,"Hello, Howard. Iêve realized that you scaring me was all in jest. Allow me to say, job well done.  Perfect."
Leonard,What are you doing?
Sheldon,Science. You wouldnêt understand.
Leonard,"Hey, well, see you. Iêm going out. "
Sheldon,I thought you were leaving the apartment.
Leonard,"Yeah, me, too. I canêt make up my mind."
Sheldon,Are you concerned because the world is filled with big dogs and bullies?
Leonard,Iêm having a moral crisis.
Sheldon,"Well, if itês of any help, Iêve read all the great moral philosophers, including Dr. Seuss."
Leonard,"Oh, what the hell. Iêm supposed to go see that girl from the comic book store, Alice, but I donêt know if I should, because Iêm going out with Priya, but sheês in India."
Sheldon,"All right. So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity. Probably wonêt be relying on Seuss here. Although One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish might be surprisingly applicable. Go on."
Leonard,"Well, they say at the end of your life, you regret the stuff you didnêt do more than the stuff that you did, and Iêm pretty sure Alice is the stuff I want to do."
Sheldon,"You know, the German philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, believed that morality is just a fiction used by the herd of inferior human beings to hold back the few superior men."
Leonard,That actually does help.
Sheldon,Itês worth noting that he died of syphilis.
Leonard,"Screw it, Iêm going."
Sheldon,"On your way home, will you pick up some orange juice?"
Leonard,Do you mind? Iêm questioning a lot of things in my life right now.
Sheldon,Is one of those things your fondness for orange juice?
Sheldon,"Great. Tropicana, no pulp."
Howard,"Hey, Sheldon."
Bernadette,Who is it?
Sheldon,"Itês me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz."
Howard,"Thatês not my mom, itês Bernadette."
Sheldon,Really? Thatês very unsettling.
Bernadette,"Hi, Sheldon."
Howard,Whatês up?
Sheldon,"It just occurred to me that I never formally congratulated you on your pending nuptials. So I hopped on the first bus and hightailed it down here to shake your hand. Put ‚er there, you old so-and-so."
Howard,"Well, I, Iêm gonna see you at work in 12 hours, donêt you think it could have waited until then?"
Sheldon,"Holy smoke, why didnêt I think of that? Youêre a better man than I, Howard Wolowitz. You put ‚er there, you son of a gun!"
Howard,Whatever. 
Bernadette,"Oh, my God, Howard! What did you do?"
Sheldon,It was a harmless Halloween prank. Look.
Bernadette,Howard has a heart condition! You know that!
Sheldon,"Well, I thought he made that up. Isnêt hypochondria a common idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?"
Bernadette,"This is adrenaline, weêre gonna have to inject it into his heart."
Sheldon,We are?
Bernadette,"You are. Iêm not strong enough to get it through his chest plate, and weêve only got one shot."
Sheldon,"Oh, no! I canêt!"
Bernadette,Hurry! Weêre running out of time!
Bernadette,Just do it!
Sheldon,"Oh, God! One, two, three!"
Howard,"Trick or treat, bubbeleh."
Sheldon,"You mean this was all a ruse? Oh, how could I be so stuÑ ."
Leonard,"Damn it, I canêt. I canêt, I canêt do this."
Leonard,"No, no, no. I, I canêt do this. Believe me, I really want to."
Leonard,But I kind of have a girlfriend.
Leonard,"Youêre cool with you and me just being friends, right?"
Leonard,"Wait, I donêt, which part?"
Leonard,"Oh, no, no, you have it wrong. I, I was going to be a jackass, but I stopped myself. I stayed a good guy, so, Iêm gonna pass on the sex. But you should know, thatês not a comment on your hotness but on my goodness. Thatês kind of my superpower. Iêm, like, Captain Good Guy."
Leonard,Itês okay. Did the right thing. You idiot!
Leonard,"Hey, Priya."
Leonard,"Uh, not so good. We have to talk."
Leonard,"Okay, uh, here it is. I met this girl and I kissed her, and I feel terrible about it. But itês done, itês never gonna happen again. And I am so, so sorry."
Leonard,It is?
Leonard,"Oh, my God, you are amazing. I mean, I donêt deserve you. Wh, what do, what do you mean everybody?"
Leonard,"Uh, kind of?"
Leonard,"No, no, I messed up a little. You messed up a lot."
Leonard,"Oh yeah, it is, and you won. I, I, Iêm, Iêm sorry, I have to go. I donêt believe this."
Sheldon,"Bazinga, punk. Now weêre even."
Penny,"So, Bernadette, how goes the hunt for bridesmaid dresses?"
Bernadette,"Well, if you donêt mind looking like an orange traffic cone, great."
Amy,"Girlfriends, I have the answer to our dress problems."
Amy,"Twelve years ago, my cousin Irene and her entire family died in a horrific carbon monoxide accident the night before her wedding."
Bernadette,Thatês horrible.
Amy,"Yes and no. All those bridesmaids dresses remain unused and available to us for free. So it seems that cloud of odourless deadly gas had a silver lining after all. Check it out, still in the bags. The gowns, not the bridesmaids."
Bernadette,I donêt know. Dead peopleês dresses?
Penny,"Yeah, and cap sleeves? U-u-uh."
Amy,"Uh, I was hoping you wouldnêt notice. Irene was always a slave to a good bargain when it came to clothes, and sadly as it turned out, space heaters."
Sheldon,"Ladies, please. These four walls once housed an intellectual salon where the mind received nourishment as well as the stomach. But through no oneês fault, Penny, the quality of dinner conversation in this apartment has declined. And again, Iêm looking at no one in particular, Penny."
Leonard,"Fine. What would you like to talk about, Sheldon?"
Howard,"What would you like to talk about, Sheldon? Why do you hate us?"
Sheldon,Iêve prepared a number of topics that should appeal to both the advanced and novice conversationalists.
Penny,"Okay, that time you looked at me."
Amy,Who didnêt? Your skin is like alabaster. Do you even have pores?
Sheldon,"Topic one. Faster-than-light particles at CERN, paradigm-shifting discovery or another Swiss export as full of holes as their cheese? And converse."
Penny,"All right, who wants to go to my apartment and look at bridal magazines?"
Bernadette,"Oh, me."
Penny,"Through no oneês fault, Sheldon, weêre leaving."
Amy,Wait for moi.
Sheldon,Youêre leaving?
Amy,"Sheldon, sometimes you forget, Iêm a lady. And with that comes an oestrogen fuelled need to page through thick glossy magazines that make me hate my body."
Sheldon,"Ah. New topic. Women, delightfully mysterious or bat-crap crazy?"
Raj,"Totally. Whatês wrong with cap sleeves? If you have the right figure for it, theyêre adorable."
Leonard,"Hey, Amy, what brings you to our neck of the woods?"
Amy,Your neurology department loaned me a culture of prions for my research on bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
Sheldon,She popped by to borrow a cup of mad cow disease.
Amy,"Itês hard to make degenerative brain maladies hilarious, and yet somehow you do it."
Howard,Thatês fun to have in a lunchroom.
Amy,"The real fun starts when you get to pick the rat youêre going to feed it to, and maybe you choose the beady-eyed little mother whoês been biting you all week."
Howard,"Please, weêre eating. Can we get that off the table and change the subject?"
Sheldon,Can we? Stand back while I turn this conversation into a conver-sensation.
Leonard,"This time, itês your fault."
Sheldon,"I have 100 alphabetized topics from artichoke, come on, people, itês just a giant thistle, to zzz, the onamona-poetry of sleep."
Leonard,"Amy, how long would it take for that mad cow disease to kill me?"
Amy,"I donêt know, four or five years."
Leonard,"No, itês not gonna do it."
Howard,Oy. Bernadette keeps texting me pictures of Penny in bridesmaid dresses.
Amy,Theyêre out shopping right now?
Amy,Just the two of them?
Howard,I guess.
Amy,"Thatês cool, thatês cool."
Howard,Why are they asking me about this stuff? What guy knows what a sweetheart neckline is? 
Leonard,"Leonardês coming down the home stretch! Come on, horsey, you can do this! Damn. Come on, thigh muscles, you can do this! Yes! First place. I would have been a great jockey if I werenêt too tall. And scared of horses. Sheldon, youêre up."
Leonard,"Come on, itês your turn. We said weêd get more fresh air."
Sheldon,"Sorry. Iêm a little distracted. I canêt seem to get in touch with Amy. I tried e-mail, video chat, tweeting her, posting on her Facebook wall, texting her, nothing."
Leonard,Did you try calling her on the telephone?
Sheldon,"The telephone. You know, Leonard, in your own simple way, you may be the wisest of us all. Voice mail. Curiouser and curiouser."
Leonard,"If youêre worried, we can go over there and see if sheês all right."
Sheldon,"Okay. You know, I heard in the news a bobcat has been spotted in her neighbourhood."
Leonard,I donêt think Amy was eaten by a bobcat.
Sheldon,Who thinks Amy was eaten by a bobcat?
Leonard,You do?
Sheldon,"Leonard, I was just mentioning an interesting local news item. Now, thanks to you, Iêm worried Amyês been eaten by a bobcat."
Leonard,Forget about the bobcat.
Sheldon,How can I? You wonêt stop talking about it.
Amy,"Everybody hurts, sometimes everybody cries. Everybody hurts, sometimes."
Sheldon,She sounds weepy. I donêt like weepy. Letês go.
Leonard,"Uh, sheês your friend. Step up."
Leonard, Amy. Bye.
Sheldon,Where are you going?
Leonard,"Iêm single, I donêt need this crap."
Amy,"Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
Sheldon,You didnêt respond to any of my electronic communications.
Amy,I wanted to be alone.
Sheldon,Would you like to talk about it? And keep in mind that no is a perfectly viable answer.
Amy,"Sheldon, my world is crumbling around me."
Sheldon,"Point of order. As youêre in distress, it would be customary for me to offer you a hot beverage. But Iêm a guest in your home, so it would be customary for you to offer me a beverage. How do you want to proceed vis-a-vis beverages?"
Amy,It doesnêt matter. Nothing matters.
Sheldon,"If youêd like to take your mind off whatês troubling you, uh, word on the street is a bobcat has been spotted."
Amy,Penny and Bernadette went shopping for bridesmaids dresses without me.
Sheldon,And that made you feel sad?
Sheldon,"I knew it. Just keep going, I guess Iêm good at this."
Amy,"Itês just, I thought they liked hanging out with me, but I guess I was fooling myself."
Sheldon,"When they were over here, did you fail to offer them a beverage? ‚Cause I can see how that could stick in someoneês craw."
Amy,"Sheldon, Iêm going to ask you something, and Iêd like you to keep an open mind."
Amy,"At this moment, I find myself craving human intimacy and physical contact."
Sheldon,"Oh, boy. You know ours is a relationship of the mind."
Amy,Proposal. One wild night of torrid lovemaking that soothes my soul and inflames my loins.
Sheldon,"Counterproposal. I will gently stroke your head and repeat, aw, whoês a good Amy."
Amy,"How about this? French kissing, seven minutes in heaven culminating in second base."
Sheldon,"Neck massage, then you get me that beverage."
Amy,We cuddle. Final offer.
Sheldon,"Very well. Oh, boy. "
Amy,"Iêm just saying, second base is right there."
Raj,"Mm, Iêm thinking about adopting some quirky affectation, like a pipe or a monocle or a handlebar moustache."
Leonard,For all those girls out there looking for the Indian Monopoly man?
Raj,This is not a safe place. You canêt share anything here.
Sheldon,The two of you need to get your women in line!
Sheldon,"Last night I was strong-armed into an evening of harp music and spooning with an emotional Amy Farrah Fowler. This on a night that I had originally designated for solving the space-time geometry in higher-spin gravity and building my Lego Death Star. And why? Your gal pals, Penny and Bernadette, went out shopping for some wedding nonsense without Amy, an action they took with no thought or regard as to how it would affect me, the future of string theory or my Lego fun time."
Howard,What do you want us to do about it?
Sheldon,"You clearly werenêt listening to my topic sentence, get your women in line! You make them apologize to Amy and set things right. I am a man of science, not someoneês snuggle bunny!"
Leonard,Why do I have to talk to Penny? Sheês not my girlfriend.
Sheldon,"You invited her to lunch four years ago. Everything about her is on you, you make it so!"
Leonard,Moo-shu is Penny.
Penny,Thank you. Whereês Sheldon?
Leonard,"Oh, he was up late last night, so I gave him an early dinner and put him to bed."
Bernadette,Thatês so sweet.
Leonard,"Yeah, but now heês gonna be up at dawn and want to play."
Howard,"So, listen, guys, the reason he was up late is because he was taking care of Amy. Sheês kind of upset."
Leonard,Her feelings got hurt because you guys went dress shopping without her.
Bernadette,I told you that would happen.
Penny,"Okay, look, this is her first time being a bridesmaid and sheês just getting a little crazy with it."
Bernadette,"She keeps on telling us stories about bridesmaid traditions in other cultures, and theyêre all about getting naked and washing each other."
Penny,"Yeah, and she keeps trying to figure out if our cycles have synced up so we can call ourselves the Three Menstra-teers"
Bernadette,We thought it would be easier to look at dresses one time without her. I feel terrible.
Penny,"I know. Me, too. Weêll talk to her. Hey, wait, how did she find out?"
Howard,"Raj did it. And he says he would do it again. Okay, Iêm sorry. You sent me the picture, I wasnêt thinking."
Bernadette,"Oh, Howie."
Howard,"Well, hey, Iêm usually pretty good at not blabbing. You tell me tons of stuff about these guys, and I never repeat it."
Penny,What do you tell him?
Bernadette,"Oh, you know, just pillow talk. You guys have nothing to worry about."
Leonard,"Hold on, did you talk about us when we were dating?"
Penny,All your little secrets are fine.
Bernadette,"Yes, absolutely fine."
Howard,Iêll tell you later.
Amy,"Come on, tumour. Come on, tumour, Mama needs an aggressive little glioblastoma. Yay, brain tumour! Probably not the same reaction you had when you got the news."
Amy,What are you doing here?
Penny,"Well, look, we just wanted to apologize for not bringing you with us the other day."
Amy,"Thatês not necessary, itês like Sesame Street says, one of these things is not like the other, one of these things should die alone."
Penny,"Look, come on, Amy, look, let us make it up to you. Weêll have a girlês night, weêll do whatever you want."
Bernadette,We can go down to the Korean baths and do that thing you were talking about where we wash each other.
Penny,"With-with loofah mitts, no hands."
Amy,Itês okay. Iêm glad this happened. I can stop pretending that some beautiful girl and her cute-in-
Bernadette,"Amy, weêre really sorry."
Penny,"Yeah, we feel awful."
Amy,"Donêt. Iêll be okay. Youêre not the first girls I thought were friends with me who ended up shunning me. Itês like elementary school, junior high, high school, undergrad, grad school, and that semester abroad in Norway all over again."
Penny,"Oh, come on, Amy."
Amy,You donêt get it. Look at this brain.
Penny,I donêt really want to.
Amy,"This is us. Bernadette, you are the analytical, scientific left hemisphere. Penny, youêre the creative, spontaneous right hemisphere. And whereês Amy? Sheês right here, the sad little tumour no one wants to go dress shopping with."
Bernadette,"Amy, youêre not a tumour. Penny, tell her sheês not a tumour. . "
Sheldon,"Did you know that when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he proposed answering it with ahoy? Ahoy. I like it. Amy? Is that you? Have you been drinking? Iêm sorry, I bet my sweet what? Well, all right. Weêre on our way."
Leonard,Whatês going on?
Sheldon,It would seem Amy is drunk in a liquor store parking lot.
Leonard,Really? Amy?
Sheldon,"Leonard, be glad you canêt keep a woman. They are a handful."
Amy,"Oh, look. Itês Sheldon and little Leonard. Hi, little Leonard."
Leonard,"Hi, Amy."
Amy,"Hey, Cuddles."
Sheldon,"Yes, Cuddles. We cuddled. Grow up, Leonard."
Leonard,"Amy, what are you doing here?"
Amy,"Well, I came here to get a bottle of wine like Penny taught me to do when youêre sad."
Leonard,"Yeah, but why didnêt you go back to your apartment?"
Amy,"Didnêt you go to high school, Leonard? Parking lots are where all the cool kids hang out. Not that the rat bastards ever invited me."
Leonard,Maybe we should get you home.
Amy,"Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on. Sheldon, what would it take for you to go into that liquor store, buy a bottle of hooch, take me across the street to that motel, and have your way with me?"
Leonard,"Yeah, Sheldon, what would it take?"
Sheldon,"Iêm begging both of you, please, letês go."
Leonard,Okay. Come on. Upsy-daisy.
Amy,"Whee! Ooh, finally someone found second base."
Amy,"I know how you feel. I got a knife slicing through my frontal lobe, too."
Amy,What do you want? Do you want me to give the friendship bracelet back?
Penny,I never gave you a friendship bracelet.
Amy,"When we first met, I made one and pretended you gave it to me. You can have it back if you want."
Penny,"No, you made that for you, I want you to have it."
Bernadette,"We know youêre upset, and you have every right to be, but if itês okay with you, weêd like a second chance to make things right."
Penny,"We are really sorry, and we were trying to think of some way to show you how much we care about you."
Bernadette,Which is why it would mean so much if you would agree to be the maid of honour at my wedding.
Amy,"Wait, is this some kind of practical joke? Like in Norway, when my friends trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?"
Bernadette,"I, I want you to be the maid of honour."
Amy,"Oh, my gosh. No oneês every asked me to be the maid of honour before. Well, thatês not true. Once, but then they all died."
Bernadette,So is that a yes?
Amy,"Yes. Yes. Oh, my gosh, I, I have so much to do. Thereês the bridal shower and the bachelorette party. What should we do for the bachelorette party? Oh, I know, weêll go to a Native American sweat lodge, weêll take peyote, roll around in the mud, and paint fertility symbols on Bernadetteês naked body. So thatês happening."
Penny,"Yeah, sure, sure. Vegas is fun, too."
Amy,"I feel like crying. Of course, I could just be hormonal. Oh, wait. Maybe our menses are finally syncing up. Bernadette? No? Penny?"
Penny,"Okay, yeah."
Amy,"Maid of honour Amy Farrah Fowlerês amazing behind-the-scenes wedding video, take one."
Bernadette,"Weêre just trying on dresses, do we really need to record this?"
Amy,"Iêm sorry, are you the maid of honour?"
Bernadette,I am the bride.
Amy,So no. And action.
Penny,What do you think?
Bernadette,I love it!
Amy,"What are you, a nun? Come on, bestie, letês see some skin."
Bernadette,"Oh, Amy! Looking sexy!"
Amy,You think they donêt have mirrors in there? I know how I look.
Penny,"Oh! Bernadette, you look beautiful!"
Amy,You do.
Bernadette,Thank you.
Amy,"Not Penny beautiful, but beautiful."
Amy,"Come on, bestie, youêre up."
Penny,Give me a minute.
Amy,What is taking you so long? 
Penny,"Oh, Amy! Get the hell out of here!"
Amy,"_ Sorry, sorry. "
Penny,"Oh, God. Amy!"
Leonard,"Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?"
Penny,Yeah. Iêve got eight pounds of salmon thatês about to go bad. Do you know how to cook it?
Leonard,Not really.
Penny,Damn it. Should have liberated the iffy chicken. What are you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?
Leonard,Star Wars on Blu-ray.
Penny,"Havenêt you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?"
Leonard,Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray.
Penny,"Oh, Leonard."
Leonard,"I know, itês high-resolution sadness."
Penny,"Well, Iêm going to take myself out to a movie tonight. You want to go?"
Leonard,Really? Do we do that?
Penny,What do you mean?
Leonard,"You know, we havenêt spent time alone together since we broke up."
Penny,"Oh, itês not a date, Leonard. Itês just a man and a woman hanging out, and not having sex at the end of the night."
Leonard,Sounds like most of my dates.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!"
Penny,What is that about?
Leonard,"Well, heês smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster. "
Sheldon,"Shoo, shoo! Be gone!"
Leonard,What the hell is going on?
Sheldon,"Thereês a bird outside the window, and he wonêt go away. That is the hell that is going on. We have no worms or seeds here. Shoo, shoo."
Penny,"Really? On top of everything else, youêre afraid of birds?"
Sheldon,"Itês called ornithophobia. And someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is unfortunate, because I have a fear of nets."
Penny,"So movies, yes or no?"
Leonard,"Movies, yes."
Penny,"Great. Iêll see you later. And remember, heês more afraid of you than you are of him."
Sheldon,That doesnêt help.
Penny,"No, I was talking to the bird."
Sheldon," Go away, bird."
Leonard,"Sheldon, just ignore him."
Sheldon,"Good idea. Attention is what birds want.  Make a pot of tea, Leonard. Itês going to be a long night."
Leonard,The birdês still there?
Sheldon,"Quick, what does a hawk sound like?"
Leonard,I donêt know. Scree-scree.
Sheldon,"Please, thatês a seagull. If youêre not going to help, donêt help."
Leonard,Sorry. Do you think Iêm overdressed?
Sheldon,"It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam, yes. If youêre playing Vegas, Iêd add sequins."
Leonard,Iêm going to the movies with Penny. I donêt want her to think that I think itês a date.
Sheldon,Do you think itês a date?
Leonard,"No, but she might think I think itês a date even though I donêt."
Sheldon,Or you might think she thinks you think itês a date even though she doesnêt.
Leonard,Are we overthinking this?
Sheldon,Not at all.
Leonard,Youêre right. Iêm fine. Iêm wearing this.
Sheldon,"Really? A blazer? All right.  Yes, hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, Iêm at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah, Iêd like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. Iêm sorry, this is Animal Control. I donêt understand the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that youêre frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because youêre stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Donêt you think I tried making cat noises?"
Leonard,Too casual?
Sheldon,"For an audience with the queen, yes. For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can, you look great.  What am I thinking? Whiskers!"
Penny,"Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie."
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, sure. Thereês also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America."
Penny,"Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston, and sheês not building a dam."
Leonard,Canêt argue with that. Iêll get the tickets.
Leonard,"Actually, you know what? I think itês about time I pick a movie we see."
Penny,You pick plenty of movies.
Leonard,"You always picked, and it was always the same. An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along."
Penny,"But come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes."
Leonard,I hate those movies.
Penny,"No, you donêt."
Leonard,"Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I canêt see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused."
Penny,"Okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?"
Leonard,All the time.
Penny,Youêre kidding.
Leonard,"Does this sound familiar? Iêd love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? Itês great. Itês two a.m., of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldnêt?"
Penny,"Okay, we were going out. You were going to get sex anyway."
Leonard,Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?
Penny,No woman would.
Leonard,"See? Now, thatês the great thing. Weêre out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So, letês go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert."
Penny,"All right, fine."
Leonard,Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date.
Raj,"Come on, Sheldon, Star Wars."
Howard,Iêm pushing play.
Sheldon,A minute.
Howard,"If we donêt start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again."
Sheldon,This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.
Howard,I have a Masters degree from M.I.T.
Sheldon,"Yeah, but youêve got a can-do attitude and thatês whatês important."
Raj,I really donêt get your problem with birds.
Sheldon,"The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me? My first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup."
Raj,Hummingbirds are pretty.
Sheldon,Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.
Raj,"Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. Or a dolphin, I go back and forth."
Sheldon,"Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. Age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. Age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. Need I go on?"
Raj,"Yes, please. This is way better than the movie."
Howard,"All right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready."
Sheldon,"Itês not a death ray. Itês just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. Trust me, if I had a death ray, I wouldnêt be living here. Iêd be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All right, and in three, two, one. "
Raj,That is one tough birdie.
Leonard,"Come on, you enjoyed the movie. I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate."
Penny,"No, I was thinking how come they get to leave and I canêt."
Leonard,Iêm going to get some fries. You want anything?
Penny,"Uh, no, thanks."
Leonard,"Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries."
Penny,I just eat the little crispy ones you donêt like.
Leonard,"No, I love them. I save them for the end, but theyêre gone because you ate them. And why did I let you eat them?"
Penny,To get sex.
Leonard,"Exactly. But this is not a date. So I ask again, would you like anything?"
Penny,"All right, Iêd like an order of fries."
Leonard,Great. Thatêll be five dollars. I am having the best time. Iêm so glad you suggested we do this.
Penny,"Oh, sorry."
Penny,What you writing there?
Penny,I Hope Alex Gets Crabs: The Movie.
Penny,Oh. Penny. Nice to meet you.
Penny,"Oh, no, no. This isnêt a date, no. Right?"
Leonard,"Uh, right."
Penny,So have you written anything I might have seen?
Sheldon,This is ridiculous. Iêm a grown man from Texas. This isnêt a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. Itês just a blue jay.  No!
Penny,"So it is an amazing documentary. They need the electricity from the dam, but at the same time they want to preserve the environment."
Leonard,"Youêre kidding me. Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?"
Penny,"Oh, yeah. Sure. Just one sec?"
Penny,Whatês up?
Leonard,I know what youêre doing.
Penny,What am I doing?
Leonard,Youêre going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we werenêt on a date.
Penny,"No, Iêm talking to him because heês cute."
Leonard,"Come on, heês not that cute."
Penny,"Yes, he is. With his dorky T-shirt and his little hipster glasses."
Leonard,I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.
Penny,"Yes, but when youêre tall and have great cheekbones, youêre doing it ironically."
Leonard,"If thatês so, what if I start talking to a girl?"
Penny,You should.
Leonard,Iêm serious. Iêll do it.
Penny,Good! Go! There are some girls right over there. What are you waiting for?
Leonard,Theyêre in a group. Iêm scared.
Amy,"Sheldon, what do you expect us to do?"
Sheldon,"Youêre biologists. Biology is the study of living things. Thatês a living thing, get cracking."
Bernadette,"I specialize in microorganisms, and Amy studies brains."
Amy,"Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing."
Sheldon,"Oh, come now. Your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class."
Bernadette,"Come back in, Sheldon, heês not going to hurt you. He looks friendly. I think he might be someoneês pet."
Sheldon,"No, Bernadette, donêt be a hero!"
Bernadette,"Oh, heês a sweetie."
Sheldon,"Yes. Itês very sweet. Now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet."
Amy,"Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. Just like you did with the mailman."
Sheldon,Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. Iêm not going to be another statistic.
Bernadette,"Look how sweet he is. Come over and say hi. Come on. You can do it. Donêt be scared. Come on. Oh, just pet the bird, you big baby!"
Sheldon,"I did it! I actually did it. Okay, now flush him."
Leonard,"Um, letês see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any Jennifer Aniston movie."
Penny,Hey. Sorry I ditched you.
Leonard,"No, itês fine. You can ditch away."
Penny,"Oh, no, no. We said we were going to hang out, letês hang out."
Leonard,Itês cool. Go back to Kevin.
Penny,"Oh, he had to leave."
Leonard,"Interesting. So now that heês gone, you want to hang out with me."
Penny,"Huh? Iêm sorry, get what?"
Leonard,"Donêt worry about it. You know, thereês some guys over there. You should go talk to them."
Penny,"No, no. I want to know what you told her."
Leonard,Thatês kind of between me andÑ
Penny,"Oh. Okay, I see. So while he was telling you things, did he mention he owns not one, but two Star Trek uniforms?"
Penny,Yeah. Wears them. Not just for Halloween.
Leonard,"Hey, pal. You didnêt see me telling Kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter."
Penny,"Okay. Then Iêll return the favour, and I wonêt tellÑ"
Penny,Laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated.
Leonard,"When you were telling Kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?"
Penny,Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?
Leonard,"Oh, yeah? Spell asthma."
Penny,AÑ SÑ Take me home.
Leonard,"Maybe Iêm not done hanging out withÑ  Youêre right, itês getting late."
Sheldon,"Itês remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? Heês magnificent. Oh, dear. I just realized I havenêt offered you a beverage."
Bernadette,"Oh, itês just like my grandma with her parrot. And after she lost her marbles with her remote control."
Sheldon,"My phoneês on the desk over there. Take a picture of us together. Make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar. If you were a dove, Iêd call you Lovey-Dovey. Oh. Who am I kidding? This isnêt a moment for strict adherence to the literal. Youêre just my little Lovey-Dovey, arenêt you?"
Amy,Guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here.
Bernadette,I still think he looks like someoneês pet. Maybe we should put up posters.
Sheldon,"Yes. It should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? Not anymore. Weêre going to have so much fun together. You can carry messages to all my enemies. I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite."
Amy,"If youêre keeping him, Iêve got a cage you can borrow. One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. It was both tragic and hysterical."
Sheldon,"Nonsense. Lovey-Dovey doesnêt sleep in a cage. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which Iêm going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. Isnêt that right, LD?  Where are you going? Come back, Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! Heês gone."
Amy,"Iêm sorry, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"How could he do this to me? Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!"
Leonard,"Okay. So, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in all, a pretty magical night."
Penny,"Okay, Iêm not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass."
Leonard,"I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And Iêm sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And itês not like when we were going out, Iêd just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table Iêm sorry."
Penny,"All right. Thank you. Iêm sorry, too."
Leonard,"Just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?"
Penny,Way off.
Leonard,Maybe weêre not ready to hang out as friends.
Penny,"I donêt know. Up until the last part, I was kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard with a little backbone. Picking the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky."
Leonard,"Well, then, Iêm putting sex back on the table. What do you think about that?"
Penny,Ooh. Maybe I like it.
Leonard,"You do? Because if thatês what you like, I can be that guy. I swear, Iêll be anything you want me to be."
Penny,"Good night, Leonard."
Leonard,I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night.
Sheldon,Mine was great. Iêm going to be a mommy. 
Howard,Itês amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.
Leonard,"Itês probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets."
Howard,"Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay."
Sheldon,"Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic, huh?"
Amy,"Sheldon, Iêm disappointed. As a brilliant man, youêre entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o."
Sheldon,"Well, A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp. Like thatês cool."
Amy,A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom canêt be used as a floatation device.
Raj,"Hey, look, the new Warlords of Kaêa expansion pack is out."
Howard,"A new one? Unbelievable. They just keep making up more cheesy monsters, slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. Itês like a secret tax on guys who canêt get laid."
Raj,"Theyêre not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Why, absurd. What was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?"
Howard,Wild West and Witches? What kind of loser cares about a showdown between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North?
Raj,A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.
Leonard,"Well, ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kidês cowboy hat?"
Howard,"Please! This is Billy the Kid weêre talking about. I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words, what the hell is Billy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Kaêa?"
Leonard,Couple of weirdos. Why?
Howard,You interested in Amy?
Leonard,Sure. I guess.
Raj,"Stuart, settle an argument for us. Who would win, Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?"
Raj,Iêll take one.
Howard,"Mmm, make it two."
Leonard,I hate all of you and myself. Three.
Leonard,"Hey, can I talk to you about something? Itês a little awkward."
Sheldon,"I know what this is about. Given the professional standstill youêre at, youêre wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines. Yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you donêt have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that."
Leonard,"Yeah, thatês not it. Stuartês kind of interested in Amy."
Sheldon,"Oh, of course he is. Sheês very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?"
Leonard,He wanted me to find out if youêd have a problem with him asking her out.
Sheldon,"Iêm not sure how to respond, Leonard. I donêt own Amy. Canêt own a person. At least not since? 1863. President Lincoln freed the? Slaves! Come on Leonard, if youêre going to teach history, these are the kind of facts youêll have to know."
Leonard,You know what? Never mind. Iêm going to tell him itês okay to ask her out.
Sheldon,"The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia."
Leonard,"All right, but just for the record, I checked in with you to see how youêd feel about it."
Sheldon,"Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist."
Leonard,I am not washed-up.
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard. Lots of people love you and want to help you, but they canêt until you admit the problem."
Penny,"Well, ladies, we killed the bottle."
Amy,I had half a glass.
Bernadette,I didnêt have any.
Penny,"Okay, donêt judge me. So, what do you want to do, go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?"
Amy,Or we play Travel Twister.
Bernadette,"Amy, really? Twister?"
Amy,"Excuse me. Iêve passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game. And Iêm sure itês a lot more exciting when you play with other people. What do you say, bestie? We can do shirts and skins. Iêm shirts. Called it."
Bernadette,"Iêm too small for Twister. And roller coasters. And sitting with my feet on the floor. Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom."
Penny,"Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine. Hey, look, I have peach schnapps. Thank God."
Amy,"Guys, something happened."
Penny,Whatês wrong?
Amy,I think a boy likes me.
Bernadette,Hi. Itês Stuart. We met at the comic book store. I was wondering if youêd like to get coffee sometime. Itês okay if you say no. It might be the kick in the pants I need to start taking Zoloft.
Penny,"Amy, little vixen. Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester."
Bernadette,What are you going to do? Doesnêt he know you have a boyfriend?
Penny,"Oh, she doesnêt have a boyfriend, she has a Sheldon. So do you like Stuart?"
Amy,"I donêt know. Heês nice. Heês funny. He has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland. Thatês kind of hot."
Penny,"Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but youêve been with him over a year now. If itês not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?"
Bernadette,"Well, yeah, I guess theyêre not engaged like me and Howie."
Penny,"Yeah, for what itês worth, engaged people can look around, too. Lot of options out there."
Sheldon,Whereês Stuart?
Sheldon,Who are you?
Leonard,I want to return this Wild West and Witches Kaêa expansion pack.
Leonard,"Sure, sure. Uh, when will Stuart be back?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I guess I was wrong."
Leonard,You okay?
Sheldon,"Am I okay? Leonard, Iêm on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?"
Raj,Wild Bill Witchcock.
Leonard,A tribe of Abra-Comanches.
Sheldon,"Flaming Spittoon. And for the record, Iêm very disappointed in you cowpokes. Weêre playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches, and Iêm the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion.  Patooie."
Howard,"Weêre not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon. It looks ridiculous."
Sheldon,"And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?"
Raj,Incredibly so.
Sheldon,Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?
Raj,Incredibly so.
Sheldon,"All right, fine. Letês just play."
Leonard,We should go easy on him. Amyês out with Stuart tonight.
Howard,Wait a minute. Are you telling me that Sheldonês patented blend of condescension and no sex isnêt enough to hold on to a woman?
Sheldon,"Cluck, cluck, cluck. What are we, ladies at a quilting bee? Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?"
Howard,Sorry. Creepy Tepee.
Raj,Annie Ogly.
Leonard,Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.
Sheldon,"And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me. I think you need to ask yourselves whoês really being ridiculous here. "
Leonard,Itês you.
Howard,You are.
Raj,Totally you.
Raj,"Hey, guys, check it out. The deluxe limited edition Wild West and Witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collectorês tin."
Leonard,"Oh come on, no! We just bought the regular pack."
Howard,"Ooh, a sheriffês badge."
Raj,"Yeah, itês also a wand."
Leonard,"With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?"
Sheldon,"Iêm in the matrix, Leonard, I see everything."
Leonard,Youêve got to be kidding me. You friended Stuart on Facebook?
Howard,I thought you didnêt like Facebook anymore.
Sheldon,Donêt be silly. Iêm a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.
Raj,Please. Youêre looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.
Sheldon,"Really? You think I care if a man, what, shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady?"
Raj,Youêre so full of it.
Sheldon,You are free to believe whatever you like. And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.
Raj,You unfriended me? Seriously?
Howard,"Oh, yeah. Now heês gonna miss all those great updates like, I canêt believe I waited this long to make my own potpourri."
Leonard,"Sheldon, why donêt you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you donêt want her going out with other men?"
Sheldon,And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.
Howard,"Hereês a radical thought. Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight. I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed."
Sheldon,And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.
Leonard,Thatês all of us. Can I use the laptop?
Leonard,I have to buy that stupid collectorês tin.
Penny,Who do we love?
Sheldon,Penny. 
Penny,Who do we love?
Sheldon,Penny. 
Penny,Who do we love?
Penny,"Hello, Sheldon. Come on in."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Penny,Whatês up?
Sheldon,I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.
Penny,"Iêm sorry, what?"
Sheldon,"A date. You and me. Dining, dancing, perhaps youêd like to take in a prizefight."
Penny,"God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?"
Sheldon,Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart? And whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.
Penny,"Okay, listen to me. Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back."
Sheldon,"I am not trying to get her back. But, out of curiosity, what is a way?"
Penny,"All right, honey, let me tell you a story. There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt. Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it. Do you see where Iêm going with this?"
Sheldon,I believe I do.
Sheldon,Iêm the guy.
Penny,Youêre not the guy.
Sheldon,"Are you sure? That would explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time."
Penny,I call everyone sweetie.
Sheldon,You tramp.
Penny,"Look, Sheldon, all Iêm saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy."
Sheldon,"Strap on a pair? Of what, skates?"
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy."
Amy,"No, Iêm having a nice time."
Sheldon,"Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hi, Stuart."
Sheldon,Pardon me. Excuse me.
Amy,"Sheldon, what are you doing here?"
Sheldon,"The thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like Stuart is repellent. No offence, Stuart."
Amy,"Iêm sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, I can put myself in any repellent situation I want."
Sheldon,"Stuart, please. Youêre being rude."
Amy,Anything else?
Sheldon,I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.
Amy,Iêm listening.
Sheldon,"With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise, I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend."
Amy,Interesting. Now try it without the quadruple negative.
Sheldon,Youêre being impossible.
Amy,"Hi, Stuart."
Sheldon,"Fine. Amy, will you be my girlfriend?"
Sheldon,"Well, thatês enough of that. Sorry to interrupt. You two enjoy your date. Hereês a dollar for your troubles. Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids."
Amy,"Yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door."
Amy,"Um, good night, Stuart."
Sheldon,"Take the hint, Stuart. The lady said good night."
Amy,How did you get into my apartment?
Sheldon,Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that youêre my girlfriend? Good thing I drew this up.
Amy,Whatês that?
Sheldon,"I present to you the relationship agreement. A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper, here and after known as the boyfriend, and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and after known as the girlfriend."
Amy,Itês so romantic.
Sheldon,Mutual indemnification always is. Why donêt you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp.
Amy,"Section 5: Hand-holding. Hand-holding is only allowed under the following circumstances. A: Either party is in danger of falling off a cliff, precipice or ledge. B: Either party is deserving of a hearty handshake after winning a Nobel Prize. C: Moral support during flu shots. Seems a bit restrictive."
Sheldon,Feel free to retain a lawyer.
Amy,"Penny, I said right hand red."
Penny,"Yeah, I heard you. I got red."
Amy,"Bernadette, left foot yellow."
Bernadette,We should play limbo next. No one beats me at limbo.
Sheldon, Bernadette.
Amy,Thatês my boyfriend. Itês open!
Sheldon,I got a splinter.
Amy,What do you want me to do about it?
Sheldon,"Relationship agreement Section 4, Boo-boos and Ouchies. You have to take care of it."
Amy,I shouldêve gotten a lawyer.
Bernadette,"Looks like itês just us playing.  Penny, weêre out of wine!"
Penny,You should probably drive.
Penny,Hi. Did Sheldon change the Wi-Fi password again?
Leonard,"Yeah, itês _Penny already eats our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi.î No spaces."
Penny,"Okay. If you canêt get me to stop eating your food, what makes you think you can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?"
Sheldon,I believe that youêre capable of great change. Like when I finally got you to stop saying Valentimes Day.
Leonard,You want to hear something weird?
Sheldon,"In the year 2000, Pope John Paul II was named an honorary Harlem Globetrotter."
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Sheldon,You asked Penny if she wanted to hear something weird.
Leonard,"Yeah, because I have something weird to tell her."
Sheldon,Oh. I thought it was a game.
Penny,Whatês yours?
Leonard,"Thereês this guy, Jimmy Speckerman, who used to torment me in high school. He sent me a message through Facebook. Heês in town and wants to have drinks."
Sheldon,"Okay, Penny, if it were a game, here are your choices. An e-mail from an old acquaintance, or the head of one of the largest religious institutions in the world slam dunking to Sweet Georgia Brown. Pick."
Leonard,"Just do it, êcause heês not gonna let it go."
Penny,Basketball Pope.
Sheldon,And thatês how itês done.
Penny,What are you gonna do about your bully? Are you gonna see him?
Leonard,I donêt know.
Sheldon,Is this the fellow who peed in your Hawaiian Punch?
Leonard,"No, that was a different guy."
Sheldon,"Was he the one who wedgied you so hard, your testicle reascended, and you spent your whole Christmas break waiting for it to come back down?"
Leonard,"No, that was a different, different guy."
Sheldon,Was he the one who used your head to open a nut?
Sheldon,"Oh, oh, oh. Was he the one who made you eat your arm hair?"
Leonard,"No, but, actually, that was this guyês sister."
Penny,"All right, well, what do you think he wants?"
Leonard,I donêt know.
Sheldon,"You know, the holidays are just around the corner. Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge the other testicle up there."
Leonard,I told you. That was a different guy.
Penny,Hmm. Thatês too bad. We could have spent New Yearês Eve waiting for the ball to drop.
Leonard,Itês two a.m. What are you doing up?
Sheldon,Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony streaming live from Stockholm.
Leonard,Sure. You want to see what all the scientists are wearing this year.
Sheldon,"Look at these men. Theyêve managed to win the top science prize in the world with no more understanding of the quantum underpinnings of the expansion of the early universe than God gave a goose. You should pay attention, Leonard. Someday this could be you up there."
Sheldon,"So, whatês got you up? Did you have a bad clam?"
Leonard,I didnêt have clams.
Sheldon,I donêt watch you 24 hours a day. I donêt know what you do.
Leonard,"Itês this Jimmy Speckerman thing. I canêt decide if I should agree to see him or not. Of course that might be because the last time I ran into him, he made me floss with my own shoelaces."
Sheldon,"Wear loafers. Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel Prize. Whatês the matter, Saul? You afraid someoneês going to steal it? Like you stole Einsteinês cosmological constant?"
Leonard,"You know what? I am tired of living in fear of this guy. Iêm gonna go see him and finally say all the things I should have said in high school. You know, pick on someone your own size, you did not have sex with my mother, and yes, I do know why Iêm hitting myself.î"
Sheldon,"Oh, now Perlmutterês shaking the Kingês hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf. He might have lifted it."
Bernadette,I love this dress. How come I never see you wear it?
Penny,"‚Cause when I wear it, itês a shirt. So, whatês Howard doing tonight?"
Bernadette,"Oh, they all went with Leonard to confront his childhood bully."
Penny,"Oh, terrific. High school quarterback against four mathletes."
Amy,"When Leonard gets back, Iêd love to check his serotonin levels. Do you think heêd let me draw a syringe full of his blood?"
Penny,"Hmm, heês not crazy about needles, but if you get him to go jogging, itêll just pour out of his nose."
Bernadette,"I donêt think I can meet the girl who was always mean to me. Tammy Bodnick. One time while I was in gym class, she stole all my clothes and left an elf costume in my locker."
Penny,"Oh, thatês awful."
Bernadette,"Worst part was, it was too big."
Amy,"Thatês nothing. In ninth grade, the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion. Within six months, the nicknames began to fly. I think the one that hurt the most was Gorilla Fingers Fowler."
Penny,Wow. You poor thing.
Bernadette,What about you?
Penny,Oh. I donêt know. I guess my school was a nice place. We didnêt really have bullies.
Amy,"Come on, no one ever gave anyone mean nicknames or picked on them or put gum in their hairy knuckles so the school nurse had to use peanut butter to get it out?"
Penny,"No, we werenêt really like that. I mean, look, we played pranks on each other, but it was never mean. Like, okay, this one girl, Kathy Geiger, got really good grades, so we blindfolded her, tied her up and left her in a cornfield overnight."
Bernadette,"Oh, my God, thatês awful."
Penny,"No, it was funny. Everyone laughed."
Amy,Did Kathy Geiger laugh?
Penny,"Uh, probably. Itês hard to say. She kind of had an ear of corn in her mouth."
Amy,Who would have thought Fuzzy Fingers Fowler is best friends with a bully?
Penny,I was not a bully.
Bernadette,Kind of sounds like you were. And maybe a felon.
Amy,Shh. Thatês how you wind up in a cornfield.
Raj,Is that him over there?
Raj,How about that guy? He looks like heêd hate you.
Leonard,"You know, I can really do this by myself."
Howard,"Hey, weêre here to support you, buddy."
Leonard,"No, youêre not. Youêre here to see if I get my underwear pulled over my head."
Howard,You wore underwear? You fool.
Raj,"So, have you figured out what youêre going to say to him?"
Leonard,You bet. I am going to make him apologize for all the crap he pulled on me in school.
Howard,"Thatês quite a list. I canêt read your handwriting, whatês that word?"
Raj,Whatês that one?
Leonard,"Uh, stapled."
Leonard,"Oh, hi."
Leonard,"Yeah. You, too. Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon and Raj and Howard."
Sheldon,And thereês the first zinger. Ouch.
Leonard,"Iêm doing okay, I guess."
Leonard,The Newcomb medal.
Sheldon,"Congratulations? The Newcomb medal? Oh, please. Thatês the scientific equivalent of a smiley face sticker on your homework."
Sheldon,"Oh, good Lord, are we going to stand here and listen to him tear Leonard apart like this?"
Raj,"Hey, I won a Newcomb medal, too."
Sheldon,My point.
Leonard,"Oh, I canêt take all the credit. You helped a lot."
Howard,Like the Black Death and Europe.
Leonard,"Jimmy, Iêm kind of curious why you wanted to see me."
Sheldon,"Technically, Howardês the gear head. Leonardês just a dime store laser jockey."
Leonard,Whatês the idea?
Raj,"That sounds amazing. First movie Iêm watching, Annie."
Howard,How exactly would these glasses work?
Leonard,I donêt think something like thatês even possible.
Sheldon,"The smartest? All right, you know, I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm, but even I know that was a doozy. Leonard, you canêt live in fear of this man forever."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I got this."
Sheldon,"You clearly donêt. What my spineless friend lacks the courage to say is youêre a terrible person who took advantage of his tiny size, his uncoordinated nature and his congenital lack of masculinity."
Sheldon,"Leonard, I platonically love you, man, but face it, youêre a mess."
Leonard,I think what heês trying to say is that maybe in high school you picked on me a little bit.
Sheldon,A little bit? The man Super Glued Hersheyês Kisses to your nipples.
Raj,Thatês funny because those arenêt the kind of kisses you want on your nipples.
Sheldon,This is a list of your heinous acts against Leonard. One of which is certainly the cause of him wetting his bed well into his teens.
Leonard,"14 is not, oh , yeah, never mind."
Leonard,Nancy. You called me Nancy for three years.
Sheldon,You really need to work on your penmanship.
Leonard,It wasnêt fun for me.
Sheldon,"Youêre being too kind, Leonard. You ruined him."
Leonard,"Come on, guys."
Raj,"That was pretty badass, dude."
Sheldon,I help the weak. Itês yet another way Iêm exactly like Batman.
Leonard,"Hey, for the record, Jimmy wasnêt the reason I wet the bed. That one has my mother written all over it."
Penny,"Anyway, Iêm really sorry I made fun of your stutter in high school."
Bernadette,Youêre doing great.
Penny,"Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, God, just finish the sentence. Okay, well, Iêm sorry you feel that way. Bye. No one wants to hear my apologies."
Amy,"I think your mistake is doing it over the phone. If they could look into your eyes, theyêd melt."
Bernadette,"Penny, it doesnêt matter what you did in the past. Youêre a good person now."
Penny,Thatês easy for you to say. You werenêt just called a b-b-b-b-bitch.
Amy,Perhaps you could assuage your guilt through altruism. Which wordês tripping you up? Assuage or altruism?
Bernadette,Youêll feel better by doing something nice for someone.
Penny,I actually knew that.
Amy,I never doubted you.
Bernadette,Every other week I serve at a soup kitchen downtown.
Penny,"Ooh, I canêt do that. If I stand over a steaming pot, my hair just goes boing! What else could I do?"
Amy,"Thereês Habitat for Humanity, building houses for the poor."
Penny,"Okay, come on, I donêt even have my own house, Iêm going to build one for someone else?"
Amy,How about donating some of your clothes?
Penny,"Oh, my God, thatês perfect. ‚Cause I have so many clothes I donêt wear, and theyêre just taking up space, and I go shopping to buy more stuff and I have no place to put it. This will totally fix that."
Bernadette,What about helping people?
Penny,And helping people.
Leonard,Hereês your cocoa.
Sheldon,"Oh, half and half instead of whole milk?"
Sheldon,Heated to precisely 183 degrees?
Sheldon,"Seven little marshmallows, no more no less?"
Leonard,You got one for good luck.  Iêll get it.
Sheldon,One for good luck. Must be the kind of math they do at Princeton.
Leonard,What are you doing here?
Leonard,"Uh, yeah. Sure, I guess."
Leonard,"Well, yeah, thanks, Jimmy."
Leonard,Are you okay to drive?
Leonard,"No, no, no, come on in. Iêll make you a cup of coffee."
Leonard,"Sheldon, we canêt let him drive."
Sheldon,Then take away his keys and make him wander the streets with the other drunks.
Leonard,You remember Sheldon and Raj and Howard.
Sheldon,Youêd think a winner could make a decent cup of cocoa.
Leonard,"Yeah, just back there."
Howard,"How about that? After all these years, your big bad high school bully finally apologizes."
Leonard,Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith in the basic goodness of people.
Sheldon,You know what would be nice?
Raj,Whatês that?
Sheldon,"As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies whoêve tormented us for years, we open our home to Jimmy and once heês asleep we kill him. I said it would be nice, I didnêt say we should do it."
Penny,"Ah, I feel just like Mother Teresa. Except for the virgin part. That ship sailed a long time ago."
Bernadette,I think Mother Teresa would have washed the clothes first.
Penny,"Yeah, well, I bet her laundry room wasnêt down five flights of stairs. You know, giving really is better than receiving. I used to think it was such a cliche, but it seems to be theÑ oh, look at these cute jeans someone just threw away."
Penny,"Yes, to a poor waitress who loves a boot cut."
Penny,"Come on, they would be so cute on me, and, ah, they go great with this sweater!"
Amy,"I donêt think Mother TeresaÑ Oh, that is adorable."
Sheldon,"In case it comes up again, this right here is an imposition."
Leonard,What was I supposed to do? He needed a place to sleep it off.
Sheldon,Youêre soft. This worldês going to chew you up and spit you out.
Leonard,"Morning, Jimmy."
Sheldon,"Oh, there it is, tacos."
Leonard,"Yeah, you did. So, uh, listen, it was great to see you again. And , and, and thanks for the apology."
Leonard,For all the crappy stuff you did to me in high school.
Leonard,Thatês my French toast.
Sheldon,"Iêm not going to say I told you so, but we could have killed him."
Leonard,I might kill him right now.
Sheldon,"The Dark Knight has your back. Heês scared, but he has your back."
Leonard,"Okay, Jimmy, itês time for you to go."
Leonard,"No, youêre done. I want you out of my apartment right now."
Sheldon,"Well said, Boy Wonder."
Sheldon,Donêt answer that. Itês a trick question. I speak from experience.
Leonard,"Iêm not afraid of you any more, Jimmy. Now get out!  Uh-oh."
Sheldon,"You did it, Leonard, you stood up to your bully."
Leonard,"Yeah, I feel pretty good about myself. You think we can outrun him?"
Sheldon,"I donêt need to outrun him, I just need to outrun you."
Bernadette,I donêt feel good about this.
Penny,Then sit in the car and keep it running.
Amy,"You were right, a whole new load."
Penny,"Come on, yoga top. Mama needs a new yoga top."
Amy,"Check it out, Bernadette, suede boots, your size."
Bernadette,"God, theyêre cute. Oh, why did they have to be cute?"
Penny,"Wait, wait, wait, guys, just hang on."
Amy,"What is it, the fuzz?"
Penny,Look at us. What are we doing?
Amy,"I was gleefully following you to a life of crime, looking forward to the day we might be cell mates. I donêt know about Bernadette."
Penny,"You know, this is wrong. Letês put everything back. Here."
Bernadette,"Itês okay, I serve soup to poor people!"
Howard,Completely empty box. If youêd like to examine it?
Leonard,Mm-hmm. Yep. I see nothing in this box but a wasted childhood.
Howard,"Little snarky there, cello lessons. And we have this completely ordinary cylinder. If youêd like to examine it?"
Raj,"Ordinary, yet I sense it is dripping with magical potential."
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord. A man pops out for a moment to evacuate his bowels and catch up on the adventures of the Caped Crusader, only to emerge and discover his apartment has been transformed into a cabaret."
Leonard,"Sheldon, heês just practising for his cousinês birthday party."
Howard,"As I was saying, empty box, empty cylinder, and, ooh, voila. "
Raj,"Iêm telling you, dude, thereês a seat on the Hogwarts Express with your name on it."
Sheldon,This is how youêre going to entertain your little cousin and his friends? By lying to them?
Howard,How is this lying?
Sheldon,A magic show is an inherently deceitful proposition. This is an ordinary top hat. Youêve chosen that card freely. I do not have a set of lock picks lodged in my keister.
Raj,"Canêt you just enjoy the wonder, Sheldon? Why must you peek behind the curtain? Or up the butt?"
Sheldon,"If we poison the critical thinking faculties of children by telling them that rabbits come out of hats, then we create adults who believe in astrology and homeopathy and that Ryan Reynolds was a better choice for Green Lantern than lovable rogue Nathan Fillion."
Leonard,"Sheldon, heês just gonna do a few magic tricks for some kids. I really donêt think theyêre gonna end up liking the Green Lantern movie."
Howard,Donêt be so hard on him. Itês natural to be a little cranky when you have a quarter in your ear!
Sheldon,"Coins lodged in body parts is not a source of amusement. When I was five, Billy Sparks put a Mexican peso up my nose."
Howard,How is that not amusing?
Sheldon,Itês still there. Takes me 45 minutes to get through airport security. 
Howard,"Look, I made Sheldon disappear. Ta-da."
Leonard,"Next time, you should open with that."
Penny,"Ooh, look whoês out on a date. Pasadenaês favourite power couple, Shamy."
Sheldon,"And that is the answer to the question, what is wrong with eating at The Cheesecake Factory?"
Penny,"So, are we celebrating anything special tonight?"
Amy,"Oh, yes. Our relationship agreement specifies that the second Thursday of every month, or the third Thursday in a month with five Thursdays, is date night."
Penny,That is so hot.
Sheldon,"All right, without objection, the minutes of the previous date are considered read and agreed to. Any new business?"
Amy,How was your day?
Sheldon,"Superb. This morning I made a palindrome with my Alpha-Bits. Nice hat, Bob Tahecin."
Amy,Sounds like you hit the ground running. I have a bit of good news myself. My most recent paper on how a cooperative long-term potentiation can map memory sequences in dendritic branches made the cover of Neuron.
Sheldon,"Ooh! Speaking of good news, somebody just hit 100 Twitter followers."
Amy,"Thatês nice. Anyway, Iêve been dreaming of this day for a long time."
Sheldon,"Yeah, me, too. Triple digits, Iêm not gonna lie, feels pretty good."
Amy,"Sheldon, Iêm the sole author on a paper being published in a distinguished journal that may change the course of my field."
Sheldon,"Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ooh, 101! Airês getting a bit thin up here."
Penny,"So, are we ready to order?"
Amy,Give me a minute. Iêm gonna go wash up.
Sheldon,"Well, thatês odd. We both washed up when we came in. Itês probably a euphemism for urination."
Penny,"Sheldon, what is wrong with you?"
Sheldon,"Not much. Although, I can be faulted for being overly fond of koala bears. I donêt know what it is, when they smart munching on eucalyptus, I just melt inside."
Penny,"Okay, Amy just told you some exciting news, and you acted like it was no big deal."
Sheldon,"Oh, I see why youêre confused. No, her news sounded important, but what youêre forgetting is, it was an achievement in the field of biology. Thatês all about yucky, squishy things."
Penny,"Honey, sheês upset. Youêre her boyfriend. You have to at least try to be excited by the things sheês excited by."
Sheldon,What if they simply donêt excite me?
Penny,"Well, just smile and think about koalas."
Sheldon,"Sheêd see right through that. We go to the zoo all the time. She knows my koala face. And for future reference, itês this."
Bernadette,"Oh, you have a lot of magic stuff."
Howard,Yeah. I started when I was a teenager. I thought I could show a girl a few tricks and invite her up to my bedroom to see the rest of the act.
Bernadette,Did it work?
Howard,"Ah, letês just say the only wand that ever saw any action was this one. Oh, look what my mom made us for the act."
Bernadette,Ooh. I like the fabric. Whereêd she get it?
Howard,"Well, she cut up one of her old bathing suits. She made these two vests and half a dozen napkins."
Howard,I just gave it to her!
Howard,"Sheês not stacked like you, Ma! She never steps on hers!"
Bernadette,"Listen, Howie, maybe Iêm not the best choice to be a magicianês assistant."
Howard,Youêll do fine. Hand me those rings? See? You nailed it.
Bernadette,"You know, i-itês just that Iêm not that comfortable with little kids."
Howard,"Well, thatês because you havenêt been around them much. This is good practice. I mean, you are gonna be a mom someday, right?"
Bernadette,"Mmm, yeah, sure."
Howard,"Oh-ho-ho! I havenêt seen this trick in years. Itês called the dove pan. You let everyone see the pan is empty, but thereês a secret compartment in the lid. And then you open it and produce a liveÑ Donêt look in there."
Leonard,"Oh, a little Red Dead Redemption, huh?"
Leonard,How come youêre not doing a mission? Youêre just wandering around.
Sheldon,Had a rough night. I thought Iêd go for a walk and clear my head.
Leonard,Some people go outside and do that.
Sheldon,"Itês after nine oêclock, at this hour the streets of Pasadena are teeming with drunken sailors and alley cats."
Leonard,You want to talk about it?
Sheldon,I think Iêll just go in this saloon and drink my troubles away.
Leonard,You know digital alcohol is never a solution. Whatês going on?
Sheldon,"Hard as this may be to believe, itês possible that Iêm not boyfriend material."
Leonard,Glad I was sitting down for that. Did you and Amy get in a fight?
Sheldon,Amy had a fight. I was being perfectly reasonable. Iêm gonna have a whiskey. Do you want anything?
Leonard,"No, I canêt. Iêm playing Grand Theft Auto later. Look, Iêm no expert in women."
Sheldon,Iêll say.
Leonard,Thatês not necessary when someoneês trying to help you.
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. Itês the alcohol talking. Go on.
Leonard,Sometimes with women you want to listen to what upsets them and then show them that you can grow and change.
Sheldon,Nuts to that. What else you got?
Leonard,I donêt know what to tell you. Buy her something.
Sheldon,How does that work?
Leonard,"Well, you skip over any attempt to repair your emotional connection and you win back her affection with an empty financial gesture."
Sheldon,"Well, that approach has Sheldon Cooper written all over it."
Leonard,Glad I could help.
Sheldon,"Itês appreciated. And if you ever manage to find a woman again, Iêll be glad to return the favour."
Howard,"And now, all the rings are magically linked together. My fianceeês wearing a magic ring, too. It made all my money disappear."
Bernadette,"Oh, ah, right.  And now, the great Howdiniês next miraculous illusion."
Bernadette,After youêve been thoroughly amazed.
Bernadette,"Well, youêre not getting cake right now, capisce?"
Howard,"Okay. Okay. Now, my lovely assistant is going to bring me an ordinary pitcher of milk."
Bernadette,Do you know how to pipe down?
Howard,"Okay, weêre going to roll up this newspaper."
Bernadette,You got wax in your ears? The man said itês an ordinary pitcher. Howdini.
Howard,"Okay, weêre going to stick this in here  and then Iêm going to pour in the milk. I hope this works, because I didnêt bring a change of pants."
Bernadette,Thatês it. No cake for you. Anyone else want to join the No Cake Club?
Howard,"Sheês just kidding, boys and girls. Everyone gets cake."
Bernadette,Not him.
Howard,Just give me the pitcher. Behold! Wrong pitcher.
Bernadette,I told you Iêm not good with kids.
Howard,"Yes, you did. Oh, I think my crotch is starting to curdle."
Bernadette,"The thing is, my mother worked full-time. I had to take care of my brothers and sisters."
Howard,"Yeah, so?"
Bernadette,"Ugh, it was horrible. With their snotty noses and their poopy diapers and their little shrieky voices, always complaining. I donêt want to get dressed. Joey keeps spitting in my mouth. This isnêt the way Mom makes waffles. Well, okay, put your hand in here. Letês see how you like this waffle!"
Howard,"All right, settle down. Red light. Red light, red light! Okay, weêre fine."
Bernadette,"Iêm sorry. I know it makes me sound like a bad person, but I just donêt like children."
Howard,"Yeah, no, we all got that. But donêt you think itêll be different when the child is ours?"
Bernadette,"Right, when itês our kid thatês ruined my body and kept me up all night and Iêve got no career and no future and nothing to be happy about for the next 20 years, sure, thatêll be completely different."
Howard,"Well, yeah."
Sheldon,I donêt think thereês anything in this jewellery store that Amy would appreciate more than the humidifier we were just looking at at Sears.
Penny,"Oh, my God, now I know what I sound like to you when I say stupid stuff."
Sheldon,"Ooh, a pocket watch."
Penny,"Okay, I donêt think Amy wants a pocket watch."
Sheldon,"No, but maybe she wants a man with a pocket watch."
Penny,"Still saying stupid stuff. Ooh, does she like bracelets?"
Sheldon,"Well, sheês very fond of her silver one that says allergic to penicillin. Maybe they have a dressier version of that?"
Penny," Trust me, we are not a couple."
Sheldon,Excuse me. I donêt see why you get to snort derisively and point that out. Youêd be lucky to land a fella like me.
Penny,"Fine, go ahead."
Sheldon," Trust me, we are not a couple."
Penny,Heês in trouble with his girlfriend and needs to buy her a present.
Penny,"Ooh, are these real diamonds?"
Sheldon,"Remarkable. Diamonds, crystallized carbon. Every day, people go to the grocery store and come home with sacks full of carbon in the form of charcoal briquettes that they toss in their barbeques and set on fire. But just because youêve got some carbon with the atoms stacked neatly, you expect me to plunk down thousands of dollars."
Sheldon,Really. Talk to me about that pocket watch.
Howard,Iêm still trying to wrap my mind around it. I always thought Iêd be a dad someday.
Raj,"Oh, me, too. Youêre so caring. Iêve often pictured you guiding a young boy into manhood."
Leonard,"There you go, Howard. Sounds like Rajêll have your babies, problem solved."
Raj,"Hey, just because a man shows caring for another man doesnêt mean heês displaying the love that dare not speak its name. Did she definitely say she didnêt want kids?"
Howard,"Yeah, she doesnêt like them. And from what I saw, the feeling was mutual."
Leonard,What are you gonna do?
Howard,"I donêt know. I canêt see a life where I donêt have kids. I mean, people have kids. I mean, even Donkey Kong had Donkey Kong Jr. So he could teach someone how to kidnap princesses and throw barrels at Italian plumbers."
Leonard,"You know, thereês no guarantee even if you have kids that youêre going to like them."
Raj,"Wow, thatês rough. Whereêd you get that?"
Leonard,Itês right off the dust jacket of my momês last book.
Howard,Maybe me and Bernadette arenêt right for each other.
Leonard,"Look, Howard, Iêd say thereês a lot of fish in the sea, but I watched you dangle your hook in the water for years. Do not throw her back."
Howard,"I donêt want to, but this is kind of a deal breaker."
Raj,Whatês your mom going to say if you call off the wedding?
Howard,"Huh, itêll kill her. On the other hand, if I donêt give her grandchildren, thatêll kill her, too. So, either way, on the Mom front, Iêm golden."
Sheldon,What time did you tell Amy to be here?
Penny,"Eight oêclock.  Sheldon, that pocket watch is ridiculous."
Sheldon,Nonsense. I look like a train conductor. Under what pretext did you lure her here?
Penny,"I said, hey, want to come over and hang out?"
Sheldon,"Good, good, if you had said something clever, she mightêve gotten suspicious."
Amy,Whatês he doing here?
Penny,"Okay, he wants to talk to you."
Amy,"Well, I donêt want to talk to him. And Iêm pretty disappointed in you, too. Although we both know that wonêt last."
Penny,"Sheldon, youêre up."
Sheldon,"Thank you. Amy, Iêd like to apologize. Your accomplishment was impressive. And Iêm proud of you."
Amy,We both know thatês your koala face.
Sheldon,I told you.
Penny,"Okay, look, he bought you this."
Amy,"Jewellery? Seriously? Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centred person I have ever met. Do you really think another transparently manip..oh! Itês a tiara! A tiara! I have a tiara! Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me."
Penny,You look beautiful.
Amy,"Of course I do, Iêm a princess, and this is my tiara!"
Sheldon,"Youêre right, the tiara was too much."
Bernadette,Hereês your vest back.
Howard,You should keep it. You could wear it again sometime.
Howard,"I donêt know, hunting?"
Howard,"Donêt worry, Ma. I will, as soon as I can figure out a way to bring up such a sensitive issue!"
Bernadette,"I guess you talked to your mom, huh?"
Howard,"I was upset. My mom can be a pretty good shoulder to cry on, if the smell of Bengay doesnêt burn your eyes."
Bernadette,"Look, itês obvious having kids is really important to you, and I think I came up with a solution."
Howard,Really? Thatês great. What?
Bernadette,"Well, seeing as how I make way more money than you anyway, what if I work and you stay home with the kids?"
Bernadette,"Yeah. You know, youêll watch Barney and pull Cheerios out of their noses and go on play dates, and Iêll work and have conversations with people my own age and enjoy my life."
Bernadette,"Yay, so weêre good."
Howard,"Yeah, weêre good."
Bernadette,"You know, I donêt know if this counted as a fight, but how about some make-up sex?"
Howard,"I would love that. But what is that behind your ear? Oh, look, itês a condom."
Leonard,"You feel like trying something new for dinner? Maybe Indian, Tex-Mex?"
Sheldon,You ever wonder how humans would be different if they evolved from lizards instead of mammals?
Leonard,"Okay, letês talk about that."
Sheldon,"As you know, lizards, cold-blooded animals, lack the ability to sense temperature. But they do move more sluggishly when itês cold. So, lizard weathermen would say things like, bring a sweater, itês slow outside. I love my mind."
Leonard,"We all do. Now, how about dinner?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I would assume weêd enjoy insects or smaller lizards. We could also pull each otherês tails off and grill them, theyêll just grow back. Oh! My life-size cardboard Mr. Spock is here! I know he wouldnêt care for an outburst of human emotion, but, oh goodie, oh goodie, oh goodie. Commander Spock requesting permission to be unfolded."
Leonard,Excuse me.
Sheldon,"Permission granted, Commander."
Amy,"Which is why the more intelligent the monkey, the more faeces they fling."
Leonard,"Excuse me, Amy. Penny, do you have plans for dinner tonight?"
Penny,"Why, you guys going somewhere?"
Leonard,"No, I mean just you and me."
Penny,"You mean, like a date?"
Leonard,"Not like a date, a date."
Penny,"Um, o-okay. Sure."
Sheldon,"Oh, no! They sent the wrong Spock! Live long and suck it, Zachary Quinto."
Bernadette,"This is so exciting. If Leonard and Penny get back together, Howard and I can go on double dates with them."
Amy,How come you never invite Sheldon and me on a double date?
Bernadette,"Mm, uhÑ Howês it going in there, Penny?"
Penny,Just a sec.  Too much?
Penny,"Okay, just hang on."
Amy,"You just canêt handle her raw sexuality, can you?"
Bernadette,When did you and Leonard break up?
Penny,"Uh, about two years ago."
Bernadette,Why do you think he asked you out again?
Penny,I donêt know.
Amy,Maybe heês dying. That would be so romantic.
Penny,Heês not dying.
Amy,"Too bad. If he were, she could just throw him in bed and ride him right up until he flatlines."
Penny,How about this?
Amy,Come on.
Penny,"Yeah, okay, no."
Bernadette,Do you think youêll sleep with him tonight?
Penny,"Absolutely not. Look, weêre just gonna have dinner and, you know, see how it goes."
Amy,"If he were dying, would you sleep with him?"
Amy,"Assuming he were dying of something that couldnêt be sexually transmitted. You know, like a spear wound to the head."
Penny,"Okay, he is not dying."
Amy,How do you know? Are you a doctor?
Bernadette,"You can make-believe, though. Sometimes Howard and I pretend that his arrhythmia is acting up and Iêm a sexy cardiologist. And the naughty part is Iêm not in his HMO network."
Penny,Screw it. Iêm not gonna make a big deal out of this. Itês just dinner.
Amy,With a dead man.
Penny,"Amy, stop it. Oh, God, Iêm so nervous."
Bernadette,Relax. You know Leonardês always been crazy about you. Itês gonna be great.
Penny,"I know, but weêve finally gotten to a place where we can hang out without it being weird. And what if something goes wrong? Then what?"
Amy,Guess itêll just be Sheldon and me going on a double date with Howard and Bernadette.
Bernadette,"Sure, weêd love that. Change your clothes, we got a lot riding on this."
Sheldon,"Mm. I want to build a road, but I need wood. Do either of you fellows have wood?  I donêt understand the laughter. The object of Settlers of Catan is to build roads and settlements. To do so requires wood. Now, I have sheep; I need wood. Who has wood for my sheep?"
Leonard,"Okay, how do I look?"
Howard,"Well, more to the point, why are you doing this?"
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Raj,Did you forget what Penny did to you? It took you two years and defiling my sister to turn that frown upside down.
Leonard,"I didnêt defile your sister, we had a relationship."
Raj,"I heard you call her Brown Sugar. In my book, thatês defilement."
Sheldon,You want to know my opinion?
Leonard,"Oh, boy, do I?"
Sheldon,"All right, then. The reason youêre fixated on a good-natured simpleton like Penny is that sheês the exact opposite of your first romantic attachment, your brilliant yet intimidating mother."
Leonard,Where on earth did you get that from?
Sheldon,"Itês in her book, Needy Baby, Greedy Baby."
Leonard,That doesnêt make it true.
Sheldon,"Itês called non-fiction for a reason, Leonard."
Leonard,See you later.
Raj,"If they ever make a movie version of that book, you know who should play Leonardês mother? Sandra Bullock."
Raj,Because sheês great in everything.
Sheldon,"Now, where were we? Oh, yes. Does anyone have any wood? Oh, come on! I just want wood. Why are you making it so hard?"
Leonard,"So, do they have a name for a first date with someone you used to go out with?"
Penny,"Oh, thatês a good question. How about awkward?"
Leonard,"Yeah, that sounds right."
Leonard,"Hey, how about if we pretend weêre actually on a first date? See how that goes."
Leonard,"So, Polly, tell me about yourself."
Penny,Itês Penny.
Leonard,"Oh, sorry, yeah. Awkward."
Penny,"Okay, uh, letês see. Iêm from Nebraska, and ever since I was a little girl, I dreamed of moving to L.A. and becoming a movie star. Anyway, after four years of acting lessons and waiting tables, Iêve done a haemorrhoid commercial and a production of Anne Frank above a bowling alley. So, you know, dreams do come true. Your turn."
Leonard,"Uh, letês see. Uh, I am an experimental physicist at Cal-Tech, most of my research is with high-powered lasers, and, oh, Iêve just gotten a big government grant to see if they can be used to knock out incoming ballistic missiles."
Penny,Wow. Can they?
Leonard,"Oh, God, no. The moneyês pretty good. And I used the equipment to make my own Bat-signal."
Penny,"Bat-signal? What are you, some kind of nerd?"
Leonard,"Not some kind of nerd, I am the king of the nerds."
Penny,What does that mean?
Leonard,"Uh, it means if anyone displeases me, I donêt help them set up their printer."
Penny,You are so funny.
Leonard,Good. Remember that when I take my shirt off.
Penny,"Leonard, this is nice. Iêm so glad we did this."
Leonard,"Me, too. So what do you think? Are we gonna get back together?"
Penny,Whoa. Not so fast.
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, what did I say?"
Penny,"Leonard, you know I will always have feelings for you."
Leonard,"Oh, God."
Leonard,You said always. Youêll always have feelings for me.
Leonard,"So, that sounds more like something youêd say if you didnêt want a relationship with someone. This isnêt working out, but Iêll always have feelings for you. Iêm sorry I slept with your best friend, but Iêll always have feelings for you. Hereês the thing, Lisa, Iêm into dudes now, but Iêll always have feelings for you."
Penny,How would you say it?
Leonard,I have feelings for you.
Penny,Itês the same thing.
Leonard,"No, itês not. Always made it worse."
Penny,Youêre overthinking this.
Leonard,"No, Iêm not."
Penny,"Yes, you are. You always overthink things."
Leonard,Ah now th-th-there you go. Always made it worse.
Penny,"See, this is where everything goes wrong, when we talk."
Leonard,"Well, I donêt know how you have a relationship without talking."
Penny,"Hey, I went out with this guy TJ for eight months, we never talked. To this day, I donêt even know what TJ stands for."
Leonard,"Wait, if you guys didnêt talk, what did youÑ never mind, stupid question."
Sheldon,"And now that I have some wood, Iêm going to begin the erection of my settlement."
Raj,Heês got to be doing this on purpose.
Howard,"Ooh, eight thirty. You and Penny decide to go out and paint the town beige?"
Leonard,Youêre thirty years old and you live with your mother.
Raj,I guess it didnêt go well.
Sheldon,We donêt know that. Not to a certainty. All we know is that Leonard is home.
Howard,How about now?
Sheldon,"Again, not enough evidence. For all we know, heês being murdered. Now, back to our game."
Raj,You were in the middle of an erection.
Sheldon,"Oh, of course. Itês right here in my hand."
Leonard,What does she want from me now?  Whatês up?
Penny,Do not overthink this.  
Leonard,I donêt understand.
Leonard,"Okay, but earlier it seemed likeÑ"
Penny,No talking.
Leonard,Even during? ‚Cause sometimes I have questions.
Penny,"Well, that was fun."
Leonard,"Yeah, except for when I got the foot cramp."
Penny,"You hung in there, though."
Leonard,"Well, there was a lot at stake."
Penny,So what do you want to do now?
Leonard,"Well, I want to go get my asthma inhaler, but it might ruin the moment. Just, just help me out here. How does a miserable date end in sex?"
Penny,"I donêt know, itês complicated."
Leonard,"Well, Iêm a pretty smart guy, and right now my brain has dibs on the blood supply, so give it a go."
Penny,"Okay, itês just, at the restaurant when you said you wanted us to be together again, it got very real very fast and I panicked."
Leonard,Why? What are you afraid of?
Penny,"Well, what if we do go out and I do something stupid and dump you again?"
Leonard,What if I dump you?
Penny,"Come on, be serious."
Leonard,"Well, how about if we donêt think about this as a relationship? It could be more like a new version of software. Penny and Leonard 2.0. We can test it internally, shake out the bugs, and if we both feel itês solid, then weêll roll it out to the public."
Penny,So we donêt tell people weêre back together?
Leonard,Exactly. We pretend like our date went badly.
Penny,"Well, we donêt really have to pretend."
Leonard,And we let them think that we decided to just be friends and that everythingês cool.
Penny,"Okay, great. Hey, I just remembered. I still got one of your inhalers."
Leonard,I canêt believe you kept this.
Penny,"Yeah, I was gonna throw it away, but I just couldnêt."
Leonard,That is so sweet. In 25 to 30 minutes Iêm gonna show you how much this means to me.
Leonard,"Yeah, hi, hi. Howês it going?"
Sheldon,"Uh, canêt complain. Thanks for asking. Well, what were you doing out at three oêclock in the morning?"
Leonard,"Well, uh, uh, what are you doing up?"
Sheldon,I was using the bathroom.
Leonard,"Yeah, well, so was I."
Sheldon,Really? I didnêt see you in there.
Leonard,"Obviously, when I saw that you were in ours, I went and used another one."
Leonard,"The, the gas station across the street."
Sheldon,In your pyjamas?
Sheldon,Without shoes?
Sheldon,On a cold winterês night?
Sheldon,Seems unlikely. Did you bring your asthma inhaler?
Leonard,"Uh, uh, uh, yes, I did."
Sheldon,"Well, then, I guess itês plausible. Hang on a second, mister."
Sheldon,"After you used the facilities at the gas station, did you make a purchase?"
Sheldon,"Itês customary, when using the rest room at a retail establishment, to make a small purchase. Did you?"
Sheldon,Hereês two dollars. Go buy some beef jerky.
Leonard,I donêt want beef jerky.
Sheldon,Itês not about you. Itês about a poor immigrant from Pakistan trying to make his way in America by working the graveyard shift at the Colorado Boulevard Chevron.
Sheldon,"Needy Baby, Greedy Baby indeed."
Sheldon,Leonard will be here in a moment. Heês looking for a different parking space.
Sheldon,"We were next to a car with an ask me about my grandchildren bumper sticker, and I was afraid if we ran into them on the way out, Iêd be obligated to do so."
Bernadette,Iêm so disappointed it didnêt work with him and Penny.
Amy,"Me, too. Out of deference to them, letês not flaunt our happy relationship."
Sheldon,"You have a keen insight into the human heart, Amy Farrah Fowler."
Leonard,We are next to a Suburu with a Gore/Lieberman bumper sticker.
Sheldon,"Well, I doubt theyêd want to talk about that, so weêre fine."
Howard,Iêm surprised to see you here after it went so badly with Penny.
Leonard,"Well, hey, weêre grown-ups. We can still be friends."
Bernadette,"Boy, I donêt know if I could be friends with Howie if we broke up."
Howard,Why not?
Bernadette,Iêm a very vengeful person.
Bernadette,With access to weaponised smallpox.
Penny,"Here you go, guys, let me get you going with some water. You need menus or you know what you want?"
Howard,"Leonard knows what he wants, but it looks like heês not gonna get it from you."
Penny,"No, thatês okay, Bernadette. Sometimes these things just donêt work out."
Leonard,"Yeah, itês all good. We-Weêll always have feelings for each other."
Bernadette,"Oh, thatês nice."
Leonard,"See, she knew what always meant."
Penny,"Wow, youêre like a dog with a bone, arenêt you?"
Leonard,Iêm just making a point.
Penny,Is the point that you donêt know when to let something go?
Sheldon,"People, people, please, before you say something you both regret, Iêd like to place my order."
Penny,"Yeah, just hang on, Sheldon. You know why we canêt be together? Because you always have to be right."
Leonard,"Oh, that is not true."
Sheldon,Iêve got to go with Leonard on this. He is wrong more than anyone I know.
Penny,You know what? I just realized Iêm on a break. Iêll get someone else.
Sheldon,"Leonard, promise me that when our new waitress comes over, you will not start a complicated on-again, off-again relationship with her, because I am very, very hungry."
Leonard,Unbelievable. 
Penny,Mind explaining to me why you were being such a jerk at the restaurant?
Leonard,"Well, I was trying to act like we werenêt seeing each other. That was the plan, right?"
Penny,"No, the plan was to tell people we decided to stay friends. Thatês a little hard to do when youêre always being such a tool bag."
Leonard,You know what? I donêt have to stand here and take this crap. 
Penny,The hell do you think youêre going?
Leonard,Isnêt sex after fighting kind of what we do now?
Penny,"Yeah, kind of, yeah."
Leonard,What are we doing?
Penny,What do you mean?
Leonard,Every scenario I play out for you and me ends badly.
Penny,Thatês because you overthink everything.
Leonard,Yeah.
Sheldon,This is a disaster. I distinctly ordered the Leonard Nimoy Mr. Spock cardboard standee. Why would I feel safer with Zachary Quinto at the foot of my bed?
Leonard,"I donêt know, he was pretty badass on Heroes."
Sheldon,"Youêre right, Iêll give him a shot."
Leonard,"Hang on. Penny, do you have plans for dinner?"
Penny,"Why, you guys going somewhere?"
Leonard,"No, I mean just you and me."
Penny,"Uh, have you thought this through?"
Leonard,"Yes, and I think we should go anyway."
Sheldon,"No, canêt do it. Sorry, Quinto, youêre going back."
Amy,"If you and Leonard get back together, Sheldon and I will finally have someone to go on double dates with."
Bernadette,What about me and Howard?
Amy,"Fine, we can double with you, too. So insecure."
Bernadette,Where are you guys going to eat?
Penny,"Well, itês a little late for me to start saying no, isnêt it?"
Penny,"Sorry, just remembered Iêve got to stop by the drugstore."
Sheldon,"Hello. Iêm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology."
Amy,"Hang on, Dr. C. Whatês vexillology?"
Sheldon,Vexillology is the study of flags.
Amy,Cool. I think I just learned something.
Sheldon,Did you have fun doing it?
Amy,Iêll say.
Sheldon,"Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast, not unlike the only two-sided state flag, Oregon. Oh, look. Hello, Mr. Beaver. In future episodes, weêll answer some burning questions. Whatês the only non-rectangular flag? What animal appears most often on flags? What animal appears second most often on flags? And more."
Sheldon,Why are you waving a white flag?
Amy,Iêm surrendering to fun.
Sheldon,"Now, todayês episode of Fun with Flags is not fun, but it is important. Flags: you gotta know how to hold êem, you gotta know how to fold êem. Letês start by identifying the parts of our flag. This edge is the hoist, and itês used toÑ"
Leonard,"Excuse me, sorry, excuse me."
Sheldon,Cut. Did you not see we are rolling?
Leonard,Sorry. Iêm having dinner with Penny. I have to get out of here.
Sheldon,And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here!
Amy,You okay?
Sheldon,"No, Iêm a little rattled. But like the flag over Fort Sumter, Iêm still here. And, take two. Hello. Iêm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology."
Amy,"Hang on, Dr. Cooper. Whatês vexillology?"
Sheldon,Vexillology isÑ why is there a face on that flag?
Amy,Itês Ferdinand T. Flag. I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.
Sheldon,"Confound it! Youêre right, itês brilliant. Letês take it from the top."
Penny,That was a really nice dinner. Iêm glad you asked me out again.
Leonard,"Me, too, I missed you."
Penny,You see me all the time. You sure you just donêt miss the sex?
Leonard,"Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried it?"
Penny,"I have. You are not wrong. I just think if weêre gonna try dating again, we should take things slow."
Leonard,"Oh, I can take it slow. Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school, Karen Berberick? To this day she doesnêt know we were going out. Made it easier on her when I broke things off."
Penny,"Okay, well, maybe not that slow."
Leonard,"How about this, are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?"
Penny,"You know, just for fun, letês say Iêm not."
Leonard,"Before an application is released, they give it a trial run. W-We could do that. And if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad, just say, hey, we found a bug, and we report it so it can be fixed."
Penny,You mean like a beta test?
Leonard,"Well, technically, this would be an alpha test. A beta test requires people that werenêt involved in the development of the appliÑ"
Penny,"Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?"
Leonard,"No, you should. Absolutely. That was me being pedantic. Thatês our first bug. You reported it. I can fix that. See? This is good."
Penny,All right. Letês give it a shot.
Leonard,"Great. You keep a list, Iêll keep a list. At some point, weêll exchange."
Penny,"Okay. Good night, Leonard."
Leonard,"Night. Attaboy, Hofstadter. Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. Hey, Iêm back."
Sheldon,Cut! Take 47.
Sheldon,Hereês an interesting fact about flags.
Raj,I will take that action.
Sheldon,"The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti were identical by coincidence, a fact that wasnêt discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 Olympics. And thankfully, their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of Fascism."
Howard,Letês see the new phone.
Raj,"I stopped on the way to work. Hey, do you want to peel the plastic off with me?"
Howard,"Really? Me? Thatês, like, the best part."
Raj,"Grab a corner. Whoa, whatês your hurry, cowboy? Savour the moment."
Howard,"Oh, yeah."
Sheldon,"Speaking of cowboys, do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag? The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra. Oh, the next classic episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags is writing itself."
Howard,"Oh, let me try the voice recognition."
Raj,"Hey, I let you peel the plastic, donêt get greedy.  Hello?"
Raj,Whatês your name?
Howard,Look at that. Thereês finally a woman in your life you can talk to.
Raj,Are you single?
Raj,"Yeah, youêre right, thatês too personal. We hardly know each other. How about a cup of coffee?"
Raj,I will see you gentlemen later.
Howard,She is gonna break his heart.
Amy,"For someone who has a machine that can travel anywhere in time and space, Doctor Who sure does have a thing for modern-day London."
Sheldon,"Careful, itês that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this yearês Who Con."
Penny,"Uh, weêre not counting this as a date, are we?"
Leonard,"Um, Iêm not sure, but I think the right answer here is no."
Penny,"Bug report: When a guy asks me to spend time with him, maybe he plans something a little more interesting than hanging out at home, watching TV."
Leonard,Even Doctor Who?
Penny,Even Doctor Who.
Sheldon,"All right, thatês it. Who Con, youêre out."
Leonard,"Okay, bug report taken. Next time I will have a better plan for our eveningês activity."
Penny,"Well, thank you. Iêll see you tomorrow."
Leonard,"Oh, wait, here, almost forgot. Here."
Penny,Whatês this?
Leonard,My bug report to you.
Penny,"Well, thatês quite a list you got there."
Leonard,Itês colour coded.
Leonard,"Uh, red means fix right away. Yellow is eh, whenever you get a chance. And green is I could probably learn to live with it. Thereês a key down here at the bottom. Itês neat, huh?"
Leonard,"So, have a good night."
Leonard,"Look at that. Some day, we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard."
Amy,Whatês baffling me is what you couldêve possibly put on the list. Hair too golden? Laugh too musical? World too much a better place for her mere presence in it?
Sheldon,How about constantly talks with food in her mouth?
Amy,"Her heartês full of love, no one cares whatês in her mouth."
Raj,"So, Siri, whatês happening? How are you?"
Raj,What are you doing right now?
Raj,You have a beautiful voice.
Raj,I bet it is. Why donêt women like me?
Raj,"No need. Iêve already done that. Siri, do you have a last name?"
Raj,"Ah, one name. Like, uh, Cher, Madonna, Adele. All the women who rock me. My name is Rajesh, but you can call me Raj."
Raj,Iêd like you to call me sexy.
Raj,"Thank you, darling."
Sheldon,"Well done, Dr. Koothrappali."
Raj,Iêm sorry?
Sheldon,Youêve taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine. Kudos.
Raj,I havenêt bonded with it.
Sheldon,"Oh, no, of course. I understand. Youêre afraid the world isnêt ready for your taboo love. Your secretês safe with me."
Raj,Itês just a phone.
Raj,"Thanks, Barry. Siri, remind me Friday morning to make my famous popovers."
Raj,"Hey, donêt talk to her like that. Sheês a lady."
Penny,Itês open.
Leonard,Hey. You ready to go?
Penny,"Yeah, hang on. Let me just finish this chapter."
Leonard,Can you finish it later?
Penny,"No, I canêt. Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know, weêd have more fun things to talk about if I read more."
Leonard,Great. Good. Great. What are you reading?
Penny,Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.
Leonard,"They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, donêt they? All right. Look, just remember how this works. We donêt get mad about these things. Uh, speaking of which, Iêve addressed your bug report on my date planning. Got a really fun evening for you. Itês kind of a surprise."
Penny,"All right. Terrific. Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that arenêt so tall. We wouldnêt want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy."
Leonard,Thank you.
Penny,"Yeah. Oh. Hereês my list for you, right there."
Leonard,"All right, fair enough. I certainly can be quieter when we kiss. I thought it was an expression of passion, but if itês coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? Uh, uh, Iêm sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? Nah, never mind, itês right here."
Raj,Good timing. Dinnerês almost ready.
Bernadette,"Oh, smells amazing in here."
Howard,"Yeah, what are we eating?"
Raj,"Oh, an exotic little treat. I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck, and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers, two of which were fairly close to me. Her spontaneity is contagious."
Bernadette,Whoês Siri? Is he dating somebody new?
Howard,Yes. His phone.
Bernadette,Oh. Is that cute or creepy?
Raj,"Can I pour you some wine? I think youêll enjoy it. The traditional choice with Peking duck is a Sauvignon Blanc, but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling. I wasnêt sure, but I didnêt want to have an argument with her in the middle of Trader Joeês. Now, what should we put Siri in for dinner? Leopard, sparkles, or to paraphrase Coco Chanel, you can never go wrong with a little black case. Siri, play some smooth jazz."
Raj,"Oh, my God, Kenny G? This woman can read me like a book. I canêt believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria."
Bernadette,I donêt know if I want to stay.
Penny,This is amazing. How did you even get this idea?
Leonard,I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.
Penny,"Okay, youêre kind of really great."
Leonard,You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?
Penny,"Okay, bug report. I just complimented you. You should take it and shut up."
Leonard,"Right. Sorry, sorry."
Penny,And stop apologizing all the time.
Leonard,Right. Sorry.
Penny,"All right, letês shoot stuff. You want me to show you what to do?"
Leonard,I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto. I think I know how to handle a gat.
Penny,Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta. 
Leonard,"So, Iêve got a gunshot wound. Thatês pretty badass."
Penny,"No, youêve got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinkie toe."
Leonard,Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid. Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless it is medically necessary. That is the law.
Penny,"Well, thank you for a really cool evening."
Leonard,Thank you for hiding my Star Wars socks at the emergency room. Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand?
Penny,Things are looking good.
Leonard,"So, are we still taking things slow? Because a gunshot wound today, last week, I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer. We donêt know how much time I have."
Penny,"Good night, you."
Sheldon,"Guten Tag, das YouTube. Ich bin ein Bavarian."
Amy,Und ich bin eine pretzel!
Sheldon,Und dis is Sheldon Cooper Presents FunÑ
Raj,Thank you.  
Leonard,Aaargh. What the hell?
Sheldon,Emergency preparedness drill.
Leonard,"Oh, no, come on!"
Sheldon,"Yeah, you know how it works. Once a quarter, keep our readiness up. Now, rise and shine, sleepy head. Half the town is probably dead."
Leonard,I have to get a lock for my door.
Sheldon,"I think youêll like the drill tonight. Iêve tried to make it fun. Each of these cards contains a detailed scenario of a possible apocalyptic event. Everything from wild fires to a surprise invasion by Canada. Pick a catastrophe, any catastrophe."
Leonard,"Sheldon, Canada is not going to invade California."
Sheldon,"Yeah, really? You think those hippies in Washington and Oregon can stop them?"
Sheldon,"All righty! An 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates Pasadena, reducing mighty edifices to dust, engulfing the city in flames. The streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded. Oh, excellent choice. Now, put on your hard hat and safety vest."
Leonard,"Oh, fun. I get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the Village People."
Sheldon,"You make that joke every three months. I still donêt get it. Leonard, wait. What are you doing?"
Leonard,"I donêt know, what am I doing?"
Sheldon,"Look around you, thereês hypothetical broken glass everywhere. Really? Youêre going to face Armageddon without your orthotics? All right, your choice.  Uh-oh, hypothetical aftershock!"
Sheldon,And thatês why we wear hard hats.
Howard,"Check it out, press release from NASA."
Raj,"Um, Expedition 31 will launch this spring to the International Space Station. Crew members will include Commander Tom ‚Tomboê Johnson, astronaut Mike ‚Supernovaê Novacelik and Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz."
Howard,This is going right into my synagogueês newsletter.
Raj,"Dude, if youêre going to be an astronaut, you need to pick a cool nickname."
Howard,I donêt get to pick it. The other guys have to give it to me.
Raj,"Oh. If I had one, it would be Brown Dynamite."
Howard,Are you not listening to me? The other astronauts have to give you your nickname.
Raj,Are you not looking at me? I am Brown Dynamite. Why do you put six sugars in your coffee?
Leonard,Because the cafeteria doesnêt offer little packets of methamphetamine.
Howard,"Emergency drill night last night, huh?"
Raj,Howêd you do?
Sheldon,"Iêll tell you exactly how he did. Readiness: unsatisfactory. Follows direction: barely. Attitude: a little too much. Overall: not only will he probably die in a fiery inferno, his incessant whining would most certainly spoil everyone elseês day."
Leonard,"You know what, Iêm so tired I canêt even think straight. Iêm going home. Will one of you guys give this nutbag a ride back later?"
Sheldon,You canêt go home. You have to take me to the dentist at four oêclock.
Leonard,"Oh, canêt you take the bus to the dentist?"
Sheldon,"Of course I can. Itês coming back under the residual effects of the anaesthesia, thatês the problem. Two years ago after a deep gum cleaning, I thought I got on a bus but somehow wound up on a booze cruise to Mexico."
Raj,They put you under for a cleaning?
Sheldon,"Yeah, they have to, Iêm a biter."
Leonard,"Whatever, Sheldon. Iêm exhausted. Iêm not taking you to the dentist."
Sheldon,"Wrong, sir. Wrong. Under section 37B of the roommate agreement, miscellaneous duties, you are obligated to take me to the dentist. See? Itês right here after providing a confirmation sniff on questionable dairy products.î"
Leonard,"You know what, I am sick of the roommate agreement. Itês ridiculous. Iêm your roommate, not your chauffeur. You know, I had better things to do yesterday than drive you all the way to the good model train store in Garden Grove because the one in Pasadena has gotten too big for its britches."
Sheldon,"Well, it has. Ask anybody."
Leonard,I donêt care. Iêm done.
Sheldon,Hold on. Are you saying that you want to invoke Clause 209?
Leonard,"I donêt know what that is, but if it means I can go home and sleep, then yes."
Sheldon,"Think carefully here. Clause 209 suspends our friendship, and strips down the roommate agreement to its bare essentials. Our responsibilities toward each other would only be rent, utilities and a perfunctory chin jut of recognition as we pass in the hall.  ‚Sup?"
Leonard,Where do I sign?
Sheldon,Right here. Use your finger.
Leonard,There. Done.
Sheldon,"All right. Thatês it. We are now no longer companions, boon or otherwise. We are now merely acquaintances. To amend the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me."
Leonard,Iêm gonna go home and take a nap.
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, tell it to someone who cares."
Howard,I got pretty exciting NASA news today. Next week I fly to Houston for orientation and zero-gravity elimination drills.
Penny,What does that mean?
Bernadette,Heês gonna learn to poop in space.
Howard,"Open the pod bay doors, HAL."
Raj,Maybe your nickname should be Brown Dynamite.
Sheldon,"Hello, dear friends. And Dr. Hofstadter."
Sheldon,"‚Sup? My apologies. I wouldêve been here sooner, but the bus kept stopping for other people to get on it."
Amy,I saved you a dumpling.
Sheldon,"Oh, your concern for me is touching. It will serve you well when you take me to the dentist tomorrow."
Amy,"Iêm sorry, Sheldon, Iêm busy. Iêm right in the middle of my addiction study. Iêve got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys, and tomorrowês the day we switch them to OêDoulês."
Sheldon,"Youêre my girlfriend and youêre not going to cater to my every need? Oh, whereêd the magic go?"
Penny,"Sheldon, thatês not what girlfriends are for. Although, you donêt use them for what theyêre for, so what do I know?"
Bernadette,"Howard doesnêt make me do his shopping, or take him to the dentist, or pick up his dry cleaning, right?"
Howard,"Absolutely. But when Maês hips give out, youêre up, kid."
Sheldon,"Well, if Amyês too busy, that gives the rest of you an opportunity to make my life easier, thus assuring yourselves a footnote in my memoirs, tentatively entitled Youêre Welcome, Mankind. All right, then, just shout when you hear the task you want to undertake. Uh, dentist. Okay, we can circle back to that one. Um, well, who wants to take me Wednesday morning to get new heels put on my dress shoes? Anyone? Oh. That one had hoot written all over it. Um, all right, uh, dermatologist? Allergist? Podiatrist? Supercuts? Okay, okay, hereês a fun one. Um, I need a new picture frame and I have a hankering for Swedish meatballs. Who wants to spend the day with me at IKEA?"
Raj,Their meatballs are pretty good.
Sheldon,Whatês that?
Raj,"Nothing, nothing."
Sheldon,"Hello, Stuart."
Sheldon,"No, no. I was just sitting at home thinking about how it might be nice to catch up with my ninth favourite person."
Sheldon,"You moved up one. My pen pal in Somalia was kidnapped by pirates. So, uh, how are you?"
Sheldon,"Great. Great. So, whatês new with your family? Howês your mother? Is she alive?"
Sheldon,And your father? Alive?
Sheldon,"How about your grandparents, they alive?"
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm so sorry for your loss. On a cheerier note, I have a teeth-cleaning appointment this afternoon. What do you say you take me over there, buddy boy?"
Sheldon,"Yes. And now, I canêt make any promises, but thatês the sort of thing that gets a fella on the short list for the number eight friend slot."
Sheldon,"Canêt help a friend out in a time of need, huh? I see where your therapist was coming from."
Raj,"Ooh, ooh! What about we make your astronaut nickname Howard _Buzzî Wolowitz?"
Howard,You canêt do Buzz. Buzz is taken.
Raj,Buzz Lightyear is not real.
Howard,"No, thatês not what Iêm talking about."
Raj,"Well, are you talking about when he thought he was real?"
Raj,"Okay, um, how about Crashî? Howard _Crashî Wolowitz."
Howard,"Yeah, terrific. The other astronauts would love to go hurtling through space with a guy named Crash."
Raj,"All right, um, how about, oh, how about Rocket Man?"
Leonard,"Thatês not bad, Howard _Rocket Manî Wolowitz."
Howard,"Yeah, itês great, but I told you, I donêt get to pick my nickname. It has to come from the other astronauts."
Raj,Maybe thereês a way to get them to come up with it.
Howard,Like how?
Leonard,"Once I tried carrying around a Duncan yo-yo, hoping the other kids would start calling me Duncan."
Howard,Did it work?
Leonard,"No, they ended up calling me Sock Mouth. Because they took away my yo-yo and stuffed their socks in my mouth."
Raj,"Okay, uh, what if we make Rocket Man your ringtone, and the next time you talk to those guys, Iêll call you and theyêll hear it. Plant the seed."
Howard,Thatês actually not a terrible plan.
Raj,They donêt call me Brown Dynamite for nothing.
Leonard,"Hey, did you ever make it to the dentist?"
Sheldon,"Not necessary. I found a service thatêll send a van to your house for a teeth cleaning. Mostly they cater to dogs, but the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind."
Leonard,"All right, Sheldon, if you need me to take you to the dentist, I will take you to the dentist."
Sheldon,Are you suggesting that youêve come to your senses and wish to re-establish the mutual benefits that stem from full participation in the roommate agreement?
Leonard,Absolutely. If you admit that youêre a 30-year-old man whoês incapable of functioning on his own.
Raj,"Ooh, Sock Mouthês got him on the ropes."
Sheldon,"I will admit nothing of the sort. And now if youêll excuse me, I have to call my dentist and see if I can also get my hair shampooed and my nails clipped."
Penny,"Oh, good, your powerês out, too."
Leonard,Why is that good?
Penny,"Because last month, I sent the electric company a Starbucks gift card, an apology note, and a few snapshots of me in a bra."
Sheldon,Power failure. Implementing power-failure protocol.
Leonard,What happened to all your glow-in-the-dark-emergency-exit stuff you had painted on the floor?
Sheldon,"Oh, that was wildly carcinogenic. Anyway, itês too bad youêre no longer entitled to the full benefits of my friendship, because I happen to be extremely prepared for such an emergency. Please try not to see anything by this light. Itês not for you."
Leonard,"Itês just a blackout, Iêm sure the power will be back on soon."
Sheldon,And Iêm sure some fool in the Donner party said the snow would stop any day now. I like to think they ate him first.
Penny,"You know, I got some candles in my apartment."
Sheldon,"But candles? During a blackout? Are you mad? Thatês a fire hazard. No, Pasadena Water and Power recommends the far safer glow stick."
Leonard,"You call that a glow stick? That is a glow stick. Come on, letês go."
Sheldon,"Before you go, consider this. Not only do I have a deep-cycle marine battery power source which is more than capable of running our entertainment system, I also have all 61 episodes of the BBC series Red Dwarf and Fiddle-Faddle. All yours if youêre willing to reinstate the roommate agreement."
Penny,Iêve got wine at my place and some bubble wrap we could pop.
Sheldon,"Oh, heêll be back. Wine and a girl in the dark, heês gonna be bored out of his mind."
Leonard,To wine and bubble wrap. And to not having to watch Sheldon demonstrate his reverse osmosis machine that converts urine into drinking water.
Penny,"You know, in Girl Scouts, Tammie Dinisha said you could do that with panty hose. Boy, was she wrong. Anyway, you want to make out?"
Leonard,"I thought because our relationshipês in a beta test, you wanted to take things slow."
Penny,Okay. Do you want to make out slow?
Leonard,I can go so slow itêll be like thereês a snail in your mouth.
Penny,"Ugh. Well, lucky for you, thereês nothing else to do right now."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, Leonard."
Leonard,Since when donêt you knock? Itês like the only good thing about you.
Sheldon,"Social niceties have been suspended, Leonard. Weêre in a state of a emergency. The world has descended into darkened turmoil. Lawlessness and savagery are the order of the day."
Leonard,"Fine, what is it?"
Sheldon,Iêm making sêmores. I wanted to alert you in case you smelled caramelizing marshmallows and thought a nearby candy factory was on fire.
Leonard,"Sêmores, huh? Good for you."
Sheldon,"Yes, or good for us if you sign here and reinstate the full roommate agreement."
Leonard,"No, thanks. Iêm good."
Sheldon,"Really? Huh! Okay. In that case, I will have a sêmore by myself. And then Iêm gonna have sêmore. By myself."
Leonard,"No, donêt aw him. He brought this all on himself."
Penny,But heês sad.
Leonard,"No, heês crazy. Sometimes crazy looks like sad so itêll suck you back in."
Penny,I think he misses his little buddy.
Leonard,"Fine. But mark my words, this frustrating, bogus teenage make-out session is not over."
Leonard,I thought you said candles were dangerous.
Sheldon,"This is a Bunsen burner. Iêm a scientist, I know what Iêm doing. Oh, drat.  Aw. It took me a gallon of urine to make that water."
Leonard,"Listen, Sheldon, this is stupid. I donêt see why we canêt be friends. And Iêm willing to drive you around and help you out with stuff. I just donêt want to do it because of some silly roommate agreement."
Sheldon,What are you proposing?
Leonard,"That we go back to the way things were. But when I do something for you, you show a little appreciation."
Sheldon,And how would I do that?
Leonard,You say thank you.
Sheldon,Every time?
Leonard,Itês not crazy.
Sheldon,"Counter-proposal. We reinstate the full roommate agreement with the following addendum, in the spirit of Motherês Day or Fatherês Day, once a year, we set aside day to celebrate all your contributions to my life, both actual and imagined by you. We could call it Leonardês Day."
Leonard,I kind of like the sound of that.
Sheldon,"Of course you do. Itês about you, like everything else.  Oh, thank goodness. I donêt think I had it in me to make another glass of water."
Leonard,"So, do I get breakfast in bed on Leonardês Day?"
Leonard,Can I sit in your spot?
Leonard,Can I control the thermostat?
Leonard,Do I get a card?
Sheldon,Of course you get a card. Itês Leonardês Day.
Penny,"Hey, guys, the building manager said the reason the power went out is someone went down into the basement and just pulled the main breaker switch."
Leonard,"Really. Who do you think did that, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I donêt know. But whoever that mystery man was, you should be eternally grateful, for without him, there would be no Leonardês Day."
Penny,Leonardês Day?
Sheldon,"Oh, no pressure. Just get him a crummy card, youêre good."
Howard,"All right, test my ring tone. That really is a good song."
Raj,"Oh, yeah. Thereês a reason heês Sir Elton John. They donêt make you a knight for writing Wake Me Up Before You Go Go."
Howard,"Ma, I told you I have a video conference with NASA. I said donêt bother me!"
Howard,"Yes, please listen to Mr. Big Shot Astronaut. Hey, good morning."
Howard,"No problem, Dr. Massimino."
Howard,Mass. Thatês a cool nickname. ‚Cause force equals mass times acceleration.
Howard,Sorry. My phone.
Howard,"Yeah, my ring tone. Kind of my favourite song, Rocket Man."
Howard,Not now!
Howard,My mom. Sorry.
Howard,"No problem, Fruit Loops."
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I think Iêve come up with a fun way to get young people interested in science. Physics Mad-Libs. Now, give me a number."
Sheldon,Uh-huh. And an irrational constant.
Sheldon,And a funny Greek letter.
Sheldon,I said funny.
Sheldon,Good one. And an electrical charge.
Sheldon,Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a 
Howard,I havenêt seen him laugh that hard since the day Leonard made that multiplication error.
Sheldon,"Oh, Oh, Lord, that multiplication error! He thought he carried the one. But he didnêt."
Leonard,Itês not funny. That mistake got published.
Sheldon,Stop! Iêm going to wet myself!
Raj,"Hey, guys, guys, President Siebert is headed this way."
Howard,I wonder what he wants.
Leonard,"Doesnêt look happy, so Iêm guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon."
Leonard,Told ya.
Sheldon,"Oh, President Siebert, I assume youêd like to respond to one of the suggestions I put in the box by your office."
Sheldon,"You donêt like written suggestions. You donêt like when I give them to you while weêre urinating in the menês room. If I didnêt know any better, Iêd say that youêre one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions."
Sheldon,I donêt need a vacation.
Sheldon,"But if I donêt come into work, what am I supposed to do with myself?"
Howard,You should go.
Leonard,"That tonightês gonna be a good night, and tonightês gonna be a good night, and tonightês gonna be a good, good night! Tonightês the night, uh, uh, letês live it up, uh, I got my money, letês spend it upÑ"
Sheldon,Good Lord! Would you stop that caterwauling!
Leonard,What the hell are you doing?
Sheldon,Bleeding from my ears.
Leonard,What are you doing hiding back there?
Sheldon,"Iêm sneaking into work. Now, if the guard at the university asks whatês under the blanket, you tell him itês some lobster traps."
Leonard,Lobster traps?
Sheldon,Yes. Thatês how Velma and Scooby smuggled Shaggy into the old lighthouse.
Leonard,What are you going to do when you get to the university? People are going to recognize you.
Sheldon,"Will they, Leonard? "
Leonard,"Fine. Just get back under your blanket, and Iêll drive you there."
Sheldon,And no more singing.
Sheldon,I have GPS on my phone. I know you turned around.
Penny,Iêm so glad you talked Howard out of having your wedding invitations in Klingon.
Bernadette,Turn it over. Iêm hoping my relatives think itês Hebrew.
Amy,"This is really happening. Iêm gonna be a maid of honour. Iêm gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle and, finally, I will have my special day."
Bernadette,You mean my special day?
Amy,Theyêre gonna need an extra-large veil for somebodyês head.
Bernadette,If I ever actually ever get married.
Penny,Why wouldnêt you?
Bernadette,"My dad. Because I make a lot more money than Howie, heês putting a lot of pressure on me to get a pre-nup."
Bernadette,Yeah. Howieês gonna freak out.
Amy,"Parental pressure can be daunting. I remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs. Last year, I finally gave in and let her do it."
Bernadette,I just donêt know how Iêm gonna break it to him.
Penny,"You know, Iêm a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when youêre in bed with him. Thatês how I told my high school boyfriend I slept with his brother. Thatês how I told his brother the same thing."
Bernadette,"I donêt know, I donêt want to manipulate him with sex."
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, thatês what sex is for."
Amy,"You know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new. In fact, the term wed referred to the money and livestock that the groom paid the brideês father. For example, youêre adorable, intelligent and a good earner. I could conservatively see you going for at least two oxen and a goose.  You would fetch a unicorn."
Leonard,"Sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take. What about Hawaii?"
Sheldon,"Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii."
Howard,"How about Florida? Theyêve got Cape Canaveral, theyêve got Disney, theyêve got my Aunt Ida and the worldês largest collection of diabetic candy. Plus, if you get sweaty enough, her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride."
Sheldon,My family took a trip to Florida when I was a child. A seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach. I got the message.
Raj,"You know, if I had a week off, Iêd go back to the Two Bunch Palms Resort and Spa in the desert. I tell you, an hour on the massage table with Trevor, and youêll feel like you were born without bones."
Howard,I donêt think I could ever let a guy give me a massage.
Raj,Really? What was I doing to your neck last night while you were playing X-Box?
Sheldon,"Itês like Iêm living in a dictatorship. You must take a vacation, you must have fun, you must enjoy life."
Howard,I donêt think you have a good handle on dictatorships.
Leonard,"Sheldon, everybody takes vacations."
Sheldon,"One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation, but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new. He went to work in his friendês biology lab. Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist, part of the Manhattan Project."
Howard,Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was.
Sheldon,"Now you do, too. Oh! I have a brilliant idea. Amyês a biologist. Iêll go work in her lab."
Howard,Isnêt that just Feynmanês idea?
Sheldon,"Ten seconds ago, you never heard of him. Now youêre an expert."
Penny,"Hey, you."
Leonard,"Is that your laundry? You only have, like, six things in there."
Penny,"Yeah, I didnêt have any quarters, so Iêve been sneaking stuff into other peopleês loads all day. Hey, if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell anybody?"
Leonard,"It doesnêt matter what I say, youêre gonna tell me anyway."
Penny,That is not true. Bernadette wants a pre-nup.
Leonard,Wow. Thatês rough.
Penny,"So youêre saying if I became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldnêt sign a pre-nup?"
Leonard,"Absolutely not. If Iêm gonna be stuck at home with the kids while youêre on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling, then Leonard gots to get paid. So, you think about us getting married?"
Penny,"I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once in a while, I think about how I didnêt leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes."
Leonard,"Joke all you want, but you think about it."
Penny,"Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations."
Leonard,Good luck catching a man with that attitude.
Sheldon,"Boy, oh, boy. This vacation is off to a wonderful start. The smell of formaldehyde, the whir of the centrifuge, the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection. Mm, I can already feel my cares just melting away."
Amy,Iêm excited to work with my boyfriend. Itês gonna be romantic.
Sheldon,Way to kill the mood.
Amy,"Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. Screw Beauty and the Beast, thatês the love story Disney should tell."
Sheldon,"Okay, what do we start with? Maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep, perhaps grow a human ear on a mouseês back? Ha-ha, Iêm a freak!"
Amy,"Oh, Iêm gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers."
Sheldon,"Wash those beaÑ Oh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella. Yeah, Iêd better keep and eye out for, what, shoe polish on the microscope, or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?"
Amy,"No, I just need those beakers washed. Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, you have Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab. Youêre gonna make him do the dishes? Thatês like asking the Incredible Hulk to open a pickle jar."
Amy,"Sheldon, youêve never worked in a lab like this before. You have no experience in the field of biology."
Sheldon,I have plenty of experience in biology. I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998. And itês still alive. Letês do this.
Leonard,Whereês Howard?
Raj,"No hi, Raj? No how are you, Raj? Just straight to whereês the other white guy?"
Leonard,"Iêm sorry. So, listen, I heard something about him. Can you keep it between us?"
Raj,"Ooh, gossip. When I first got here, I thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler. So I hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler."
Leonard,Bernadette wants to get a pre-nup.
Raj,"Oh, thatês a shame, heês gonna be devastated."
Leonard,I never know what to do in these situations. Should I give him a heads-up?
Raj,Hmm. Iêm gonna give you the same advice I yell at the TV when the Bachelorês handing out roses. Follow your heart.
Howard,Check it out. Look at the size of that Rice Krispie Treat. Same price.
Leonard,"Hey, Howard, I need to tell you something."
Howard,"I know, itês not on my wedding diet. I donêt care."
Leonard,"Uh, listen, I heard that Bernadetteês thinking about asking you for a pre-nup."
Howard,A pre-nup? Wow.
Leonard,What are you gonna do?
Howard,I donêt know.
Raj,Follow your heart.
Howard,"You know what, itês not a big deal. She makes more money than me. She wants to protect her financial interests. Itês completely reasonable."
Howard,"Yeah, actually, itês good for both of us. I have assets to protect, too."
Raj,Like what?
Howard,Iêve got some rare comic books. The Vespaês almost paid off. And Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai right near the guy who played Mr. Roper on Threeês Company.
Raj,Mr. Roperês dead? You canêt just spring that on a guy.
Sheldon,Here you go. This is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan.
Amy,Soap spots. Wash êem again.
Sheldon,Y-youêre being ridiculous. Those are perfectly clean.
Amy,"Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis. If itês, in fact, perfectly clean, drink from it."
Sheldon,Biologists are mean.
Amy,"All right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley. I need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes."
Sheldon,There was something wrong with that detergent. That was way too bubbly.
Amy,Iêm sure it was.
Sheldon,I intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter.
Amy,"Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting."
Sheldon,You know what this place needs? A suggestion box.
Sheldon,366Ñ 367Ñ
Amy,Howês it going?
Sheldon,"Howês counting going? When I was in kindergarten, I recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show. I think I got this."
Sheldon,"Aw, nuts! OneÑ"
Sheldon,"This is preposterous. I think youêre giving me these tasks because youêre afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do, Iêll show you up."
Amy,Really? Is that what you think?
Sheldon,"Yes, thatês what I think. And Iêm super smart, so itês probably true."
Amy,"Hey, Iêve been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. Youêve been here for three hours, and youêve spent one of them in the bathroom."
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.
Amy,"Sheldon, Iêve given you the simplest things to do, and you havenêt done one of them right."
Sheldon,Maybe thatês because Iêm not being challenged. Itês the same reason Einstein failed math.
Amy,Maybe the math was too bubbly for him.
Sheldon,"You think youêre doing science by cutting up that brain? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos. And theyêd offer to toast it for me, too."
Amy,"Okay, smart guy. Iêm about to remove the locus coeruleus, which is incredibly delicate work. Have at it."
Sheldon,All right. Iêm no stranger to a little gray matter. Locus coeruleus. Locus coeruleus.
Amy,"Youêre getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain. Hope your hands are steady. Itês the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so Iêm sure itês no problem for a genius like you."
Sheldon,"Itês not. Iêll have you know, in the field of physics, we work with particles so small, they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus, i.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house, it sits around the house."
Amy,"Oh, are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?"
Sheldon,What you see is a man trembling with confidence. Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?
Amy,But your thumb does.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear. "
Amy,"Yeah, youêre a biologist."
Howard,What are you doing here?
Sheldon,Iêm on vacation. Social convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole. Social convention is stupid.
Howard,What happened to your thumb?
Sheldon,"You know, I have ten fingers and ten toes. If I tell you a story about each one of them, weêll be here all day, letês just move on."
Sheldon,"Ah, seeing as Iêm on vacation, a pina colada seems appropriate. Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum. Donêt let me have too many of those."
Penny,"Hey, what are you guys doing here?"
Howard,"Weêre grown men, we drink at bars."
Penny,No and no. Everything okay with you and Bernadette?
Howard,"Oh, yeah, sure."
Penny,You and Amy? Good?
Sheldon,"Oh, better than good."
Penny,You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.
Howard,Iêm not signing a pre-nup.
Penny,"All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up. You sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women, it is not gonna happen, we had a meeting. And you, a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, this is a fairly substantial wound. "
Sheldon, Amy?
Amy,What do you want?
Sheldon,"I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory. After all, I did book the whole week."
Amy,Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?
Sheldon,I was not myself. I had lost a lot of thumb blood.
Amy,Thatês not an apology.
Sheldon,That is your opinion.
Amy,I want a real apology.
Sheldon,Iêm sorry that you werenêt able toÑ
Sheldon,That my geniusÑ
Sheldon,That the soap wasÑ
Sheldon,Fine. Sorry.
Amy,"Youêre forgiven. Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers. Theyêre still dirty from yesterday."
Sheldon,Next year Iêm going to Epcot.
Bernadette,Are you mad at me?
Howard,"Iêm not mad at you. I just wish you would have come to me, so I didnêt have to hear it through the nerd-vine."
Bernadette,"So, what are we gonna do?"
Howard,You really want me to sign a pre-nup?
Bernadette,"I donêt know. My dadês pretty insistent on it, though."
Howard,"Why donêt I talk to your dad, man-to-man?"
Bernadette,"Really? Oh, thatêd be so great."
Bernadette,"I should probably give you a heads-up about a couple of things. Even though heês retired from the police force, he still carries his gun. But donêt worry, he wonêt shoot it. Itês more of a fashion statement."
Bernadette,"And just to be safe, when you talk to him, donêt bring up Jimmy Carter, gardeners, foreign people, homosexuals, Sean Penn, Vatican II, gun control, organic food, the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact that youêre Jewish."
Howard,"Got it, got it. Will you e-mail me that list?"
Bernadette,"So the thing to watch for, if heês shouting at you, youêre okay, but if he starts to get real quiet, leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact. Not in a straight line, throw some zigs and zigs in there."
Howard,"You know, this isnêt that pressing. Why donêt I talk to him about it in May."
Bernadette,In May youêre gonna be on the International Space Station.
Howard,Theyêve got a phone.
Raj,It was a nice retirement party.
Howard,"I guess. Still, itês a shame Professor Rothman was forced to step down."
Leonard,What choice did the university have? He snapped. It happens to theoretical physicists all the time.
Howard,I wonder how long Sheldonês got.
Sheldon,These shrimp are all the same size. Thereês no the logical order to eat them in.
Leonard,Canêt be very long.
Raj,"Hey, look, thereês Rothmanês empty office. Sad."
Sheldon,"Mm, indeed."
Howard,So sad.
Sheldon,"What are you doing here, Kripke?"
Sheldon,This is not your office. It hasnêt been assigned yet.
Sheldon,"Dibs? This is a university, not a playground. Offices are not assigned because someone called dibs."
Leonard,You just called dibs.
Sheldon,Shut it. Offices are assigned by seniority. I arrived at the university first.
Raj,Iêm glad that men are wearing hats again. Theyêre so distinguished.
Amy,I got you a little something.
Penny,"A little something? Oh, itÑ what, this is huge."
Amy,Whatês huge is what youêve done for me.
Penny,"Oh, no, Amy, I havenêt done anything."
Amy,"No, no, before I met you, I was a mousy wallflower. But look at me now. Iêm like some kind of downtown hipster party girl. With a posse, a boyfriend and a new lace bra that hooks in the front, of all things. Open it. Open it."
Penny,Okay. 
Amy,I wanted to get you something you didnêt have.
Penny,Wow. I-I donêt know what to sÑ Wow.
Amy,Do you like it?
Penny,Do I like it? Wow.
Amy,"So, uh, where are you gonna hang it?"
Penny,"Oh, my God. Hang it. Wow. Um, you know, Iêd have to go get a hook and nails and a hammer andÑ"
Amy,No problem.
Penny,"Oh, look. You, huh, you just, you got it all right there. Wow."
Sheldon,I found him. Heês in the bathroom. President Siebert?
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. We just need a word.
Sheldon,We tried. His assistant said he was on sabbatical. Although we distinctly heard his office window open and shut.
Sheldon,"Oh, my. President Siebert, I donêt mean to be an alarmist, but difficulty initiating a urine stream could be a symptom of benign prostatic hyperplasia. If youêre interested, I can send you a link to a YouTube video thatêll show you how to perform your own rectal exam. Yeah, uh, helpful hint, trim your nails first."
Sheldon,"Oh, heês just trying to butter you up. And for the record, butter is an excellent lubricant for your rectal exam."
Sheldon,Youêre in my spot.
Bernadette,That is big.
Penny,So big.
Bernadette,And ugly.
Penny,So ugly. What am I gonna do?
Bernadette,"I donêt know. You canêt take it down. Youêll break her heart. Look at that face. That enormous, unsettling, crazy face."
Penny,Is there any chance Iêll learn to love it?
Bernadette,That depends. Do you like pictures of yourself where you look like a man?
Penny,"All right, itês got to go."
Bernadette,What will you tell Amy?
Penny,How about I tell her the painting makes you feel jealous because youêre not in it?
Bernadette,Nuh-uh. What if she gets me one? I already have a picture of me and Howardês mom getting our hair cornrowed in Venice Beach. Iêve suffered enough.
Penny,"Well, I guess I could take it down and put it up when she comes over, but itês kind of heavy."
Bernadette,"Mmm, too bad youêre not as strong as the dude in the painting."
Raj,"Would you look at this? I paid twenty five dollars to some kid on eBay for a handcrafted Harry Potter wand. He sent me a stick. He went into his backyard, he picked up a stick."
Howard,Itês numbered.
Raj,"Ooh, limited edition. Nice."
Sheldon,"Oh, thatêll be Kripke."
Leonard,Whatês he doing here?
Sheldon,"Weêre going to work this office situation out like gentlemen. And if that doesnêt work, Iêm going to poison his tea."
Sheldon,Kripke. Come in. Iêm making tea. Would you like a cup?
Sheldon,Fine. In the interest of preserving our friendshipÑ
Sheldon,"Well, thatês a little hard to hear, but all right. As you know, the essence of diplomacy is compromise. With that in mind, I propose the following. I will take Rothmanês office, and you will find a way to be okay with that."
Sheldon,You sure I canêt get you that cup of tea?
Raj,How about you decide this with Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?
Sheldon,Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was created by Internet pioneer Sam Kass as an improvement on the classic game Rock-Paper-Scissors. All hail Sam Kass.
Sheldon,"Oh, itês very simple. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
Sheldon,"Well, of course. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
Sheldon,"Surely. Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rockÑ"
Howard,"Sheldon, stop. Heês screwing with you."
Sheldon,"Is he? Well, then, it seems we have reached an impasse. I see no other option than to challenge you to a duel. Iêd smack you with a glove, but just last week I packed away my winter things."
Howard,Itês the 21st century. You canêt have a duel.
Leonard,"H-h-h-hang on, Howard. Barry, how good of a shot are you?"
Sheldon,"Not pistols. Minds. A trivia contest, and you may choose the field of battle. Star Trek trivia, Star Trek: Next Generation trivia, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine trivia, Star Trek: Voyager trivia, or model trains."
Leonard,Itês gonna be hard to find something youêre both equally good at.
Raj,Is there anything youêre both equally bad at?
Leonard,"All right, this is one-on-one. First person to five wins the office. Any questions? Yes, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,Five what?
Leonard,Balls in the basket. 
Leonard,You know all those terrible things bullies used to do to us?
Leonard,I get it.
Sheldon,"Hey! He did that on purpose,"
Leonard,"No, he didnêt. Nothing thatês happening here is being done on purpose. Okay, uh, forget one-on-one. Letês try a free throw contest. First person who makes a basket wins the office."
Leonard,"No, Iêm not."
Sheldon,"Use the force, Sheldon. Use the force.  Iêm gonna need more force."
Leonard,"All right, we gave it 45 minutes. Itês no longer funny. Letês try something else."
Sheldon,What do you propose?
Leonard,"Uh, on the count of three, both of you bounce the balls as hard as you can. The highest bounce wins the office."
Sheldon,"I donêt think so, Kripke. Iêve bounced many a rubber ball in my day."
Leonard,"All right, thatês enough trash talk. One, two, three."
Howard,Sheldon was higher.
Leonard,"Congratulations, Sheldon. You win office."
Sheldon,Whoês unsatisfactory in P.E. now?
Amy,"Oh, what a great movie."
Penny,I cannot believe youêve never seen Grease.
Amy,My mother didnêt allow me to watch it. She was afraid it might encourage me to join a gang.
Bernadette,"Iêve got to go. Iêve got to get up early. My companyês testing a new steroid that supposedly doesnêt shrink testicles, and the last one there has to do the measuring."
Amy,"I guess I should get going, too. Good night, painting Penny. Good night, real Penny."
Penny,"Good night, real Amy."
Amy,"You donêt have to say good night to painting Amy, êcause sheês never leaving."
Bernadette,"Good night, real Penny."
Bernadette,"Good night, transvestite Penny."
Penny,"Ah, okay. Let us take you off the wall. Out of sight, out of mind. I wish."
Amy,"You know, can I borrow that movie? Those singing hooligans really got my motor running."
Penny,"Sure, sure. Enjoy. I mean, get it back to me when you can, or, you know what, actually, you keep it. Itês just going to be my gift to you. Bye."
Amy,Thank you. Wait. Whereêd the painting go?
Penny,Itês right over there.
Penny,I have no idea. That is weird.
Amy,You hate it.
Penny,"No, no. Itês just, itês a little big."
Amy,I feel like an idiot.
Penny,"No, come on, youêre not an idiot. Look, just help me put it back up."
Amy,Why? So you can just take it down when I leave? I donêt need your pity.
Penny,"Oh, Amy, come on."
Amy,Iêm just glad I didnêt go for the sculpture.
Sheldon,"Ah, the spoils. I see why victors love them."
Raj,"Iêm happy for you, Sheldon. But I have to admit Iêm going to miss sharing an office with you."
Sheldon,"Oh, of course you are. Feel free to drop by any time."
Raj,Thank you.
Sheldon,Yeah. Call first. 
Sheldon,Professor Rothman. This isnêt your office any more. Youêre retired.
Penny,I came to say Iêm sorry.
Amy,Donêt bother.
Penny,"Oh, Amy, please."
Amy,"Iêm so humiliated. I sat there the whole time that we were watching Grease, thinking you liked the painting."
Penny,I know.
Amy,I was a fool from Summer Lovinê to the very last rama lama lama ke ding a de dinga a dong.
Penny,Youêre right. Youêre absolutely right. I should have been honest with you and told you the gift was too much.
Amy,"Yes, too much. Because our friendship is fundamentally asymmetrical. I clearly like you more than you like me."
Penny,I donêt think you can put a number on how much one person likes another.
Amy,I bought you a painting thatês 12 square feet in area. Thereês a number.
Penny,"Amy, come onÑ"
Amy,"If you donêt like feet, you can try dollars. The painting set me back three grand."
Penny,"Three grÑ Oh, my God! Look, look, Amy, all you need to know is, you are my friend and I donêt want to lose you out of my life."
Amy,"Iêm sorry, Iêm just having trouble believing you right now."
Penny,Grab your hammer.
Amy,Damage is done.
Penny,"Okay, look, I didnêt want to say this, but the real reason I took the painting down was because it made Bernadette very jealous."
Amy,"Oh, my goodness, how could I have not seen that? The painting is a constant reminder that of the three of us, she is the least cool."
Penny,"Yeah, th-th-th-thatês what it is, soÑ"
Amy,You have such a good heart.
Penny,"Huh, I try."
Amy,Come on.
Penny,Well where are we going?
Amy,Weêre going to go put this painting back up in your apartment.
Penny,"Well, what about Bernadette?"
Amy,"Oh, screw her. Sheês just lucky we let her hang out with us."
Leonard,What are you doing?
Sheldon,Iêm trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.
Howard,Why donêt you just turn up the thermostat?
Sheldon,"Aha! Good question. It turns out the thermostat for my new office isnêt in my new office. Itês next door, in Professor Davenportês office, who is currently enjoying the hot flashes associated with menopause."
Leonard,Why is there a hole here?
Sheldon,"Why is there a hole in my new office? Iêve narrowed it down to two possibilities: There was something in the wall that someone outside the wall wanted, or the more disturbing, there was something in the wall that wanted out."
Raj,"Well, at least you finally got a window that opens. Thatês nice."
Sheldon,Is it? Listen.
Raj,you donêt like wind chimes?
Sheldon,"No, I hate them, but it gets worse. There it is."
Howard,The bird?
Sheldon,"Yeah, Itês completely out of tune with the wind chimes."
Sheldon,"You donêt get it, do you? Thatês a mockingbird. Mockingbirds can change their song, which means heês out of tune on purpose. Heês mocking me. Oh dear. There it is again. Do you feel it?"
Howard,The growing realization that you are one wacky bastard? Yep.
Sheldon,"The vibration. We are directly underneath the geology lab, and theyêre running their confounded sieve shakers again. Hey, gravel monkeys, if you need to shake rocks, try jiggling your heads around!"
Leonard,"Sheldon, relax."
Sheldon,How can I relax? My nervous system is being stretched out like the strings of a harp and plucked by holes and birds and wind and the low-hanging scrotum of the difficult-to-evict Professor Rothman.
Leonard,"If youêre not happy, why donêt you just let Kripke have the office?"
Sheldon,"and let him win? Do I look crazy to you? Weêre trying to think down here, you geode-loving feldspar jockeys!  And you, the notes are C, D, E, G and A. You pick one or I am chopping down that tree!"
Penny,Howês that?
Amy,Little higher on the right.
Amy,Little more. Thatês got it.
Penny,"Yeah, okay. Thatês, uh, thatês good."
Amy,Iêll let you in on a little secret.
Amy,"Originally we were painted nude. But I had him add clothes, êcause I thought it was an unnecessary challenge to our heterosexuality."
Penny,"Yeah, good call."
Amy,"But if you ever change your mind, all it would take is some warm, soapy water and a couple of sponges."
Penny,"Youêre talking about the painting, right?"
Sheldon,Help! Somebody help!
Leonard,What happened?
Sheldon,I was trying to see what was in here and my head got stuck.
Leonard,Why would you do that?
Sheldon,Itês called scientific curiosity. Now go get butter.
Leonard,Hang in there. Iêll be right back. 
Leonard,Iêm just gonna run to the store and get a few things. Iêll pick you up when youêre done.
Sheldon,"Okay. I like it a little better when you stay, but all right."
Sheldon,Hello. Iêm here for my haircut with Mr. DêOnofrio.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear, Mr. DêOnofrioês in the hospital. Why do these things always happen to me?"
Sheldon,Youêre not Mr. DêOnofrio. I get my hair cut by Mr. DêOnofrio. You believe this guy?
Leonard,"Excuse us for a second. Sheldon, itês okay, he can do it. Heês a barber."
Sheldon,"Heês not a barber, heês the nephew. Heês an example of the kind of nepotism that runs rampant in the barbering industry. Besides, Mr. DêOnofrio knows exactly how I like my hair done because he has all my haircut records from my barber in Texas."
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Sheldon,"When I first moved here I was nervous about finding a new barber, so my mother had all my haircut records sent here to Mr. DêOnofrio."
Leonard,Thereês no such thing as haircut records.
Sheldon,"Yes, there are."
Leonard,Have you ever seen them?
Sheldon,"No, but my mother assured me they were sent here, and Iêll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this one doesnêt have them. Uh, excuse me. Do you have access to my haircut records?"
Sheldon,"To paraphrase T.S. Eliot, this is the way the world ends, not with a bang but with a nephew."
Leonard,"Sheldon, youêre a grown man, heês a professional, and your haircut is number three on that poster from 1946. Just sit down and let him do it."
Sheldon,"Fine, but if I come out of this looking like a dork, itês on you. "
Sheldon,Nope. 
Leonard,"When you tell this story later, the word we usually use is quirky."
Sheldon,Can you pass the Parmesan cheese?
Leonard,Sure. What are you doing?
Sheldon,Iêm trying to get the hair out of my eyes.
Leonard,"Sheldon, you are one day late for your haircut."
Sheldon,Thank you for captioning my nightmare.
Howard,"Lookie here, I got my travel orders."
Raj,"Payload Specialist Howard Wolowitz is requested to report to the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, for astronaut training Monday eight a.m."
Howard,"Yeah, but itês from NASA, so itês oh eight hundred."
Raj,But it says eight a.m.
Howard,You read it as oh eight hundred.
Raj,It doesnêt have an oh in front of it.
Howard,"You know what does have an oh in front of it? Oh, my God, Iêm an astronaut, and youêre dying of jealousy."
Leonard,"So, what kind of things are theyÑ  will you stop that?"
Sheldon,"I canêt help it, I feel like a teen heartthrob."
Penny,"You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brotherês hair. I could do it for you."
Sheldon,"Penny, I know you mean well, offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um, here in town we donêt churn our own butter, we donêt, uh, make dresses out of gunny sacks, and, uh, we sure as shootinê donêt get our hair cut by bottle-blondeÑ"
Leonard,"Sheldon, be nice."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, itês the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair."
Raj,"You could go to my guy. Heês at Juan-Juan in Beverly Hills. They bring you a cup of tea, theyêll massage your scalp. Itês about two hundred dollars, but sometimes you look in the next chair and you see a superstar like Tony Danza."
Howard,"Quick question here, have we actually changed the conversation from Iêm going"
Raj,"Now whoês dying of jealousy? Oh, itês you."
Amy,"Iêm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride. Iêm wantedÑ Iêm wantedÑ wanted, dead or alive. Sheldon, youêre ruining girlfriend-boyfriend sing-along night."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry. Iêm looking for a barber and Iêm running out of time. My hair is growing at the rate of 4.6 yoctometers per femtosecond. I mean, if youêre quiet, you can hear it."
Amy,What about Supercuts?
Sheldon,I tried once. They do menês and womenês hair in the same room at the same time. Itês like Sodom and Gomorrah with mousse.
Amy,"Well, this isnêt a crisis. Why donêt you just let your hair grow out a little?"
Sheldon,"Why donêt I let my hair grow out? Um, why donêt I start wearing Birkenstocks and, uh, uh, seeking validation of my opinions by asking can you dig it?"
Amy,"Well, I donêt know. I think you might look sexy with long hair. The kind that flows down to your shoulders and blows back while riding on a horse, bareback and bare-chested. Iêm gonna go brush my teeth, it might take a while."
Bernadette,"Hi, sweetie."
Howard,I miss you.
Bernadette,"I miss you, too. So tell me all about your first day."
Howard,"Oh, wow, where do I even start? I got to experience zero gravity."
Bernadette,Cool. How do they do that?
Howard,"Itês pretty neat. You get in this plane that goes almost straight up for, like, 20 seconds, and then straight back down like itês going to crash, and they do it over and over again, you know, no matter how many times you throw up."
Bernadette,You threw up?
Howard,"Yeah, and the craziest part is, because thereês no gravity, the throw-up kind of floats there, in a little ball, and if your mouth is open because youêre screaming, sometimes it just floats right back in. Boy, does everyone laugh at you when that happens."
Bernadette,That sounds mean.
Howard,"Yeah, I would have laughed, too, but I didnêt want the vomit to come back out. Anyway, oh, could you do me a favour and overnight me some more underwear?"
Bernadette,"Sure, why?"
Howard,"I got a look at the centrifuge theyêre going to spin me around in tomorrow, and I have a hunch I packed a little light."
Sheldon,"Mr. DêOnofrio? Itês Sheldon. They didnêt have anything barber-themed in the gift shop, so I got you this. I donêt know if you can read his little T-shirt. It says, um, get well bear-y soon. Trust me, if you were even a little conscious right now, youêd be laughing. Anyway, thereês new studies that show, people in comas are aware of everything going on around them. With that in mind, if you can hear me, move away from the light and toward the sound of these scissors."
Sheldon,Yes. Do you have something I could use as a cape?
Sheldon,"Oh, no, no, Iêm just here to get my hair cut."
Sheldon,"I got to run. But not with scissors, that would be unsafe."
Penny,"So, if I move my horsey here, isnêt that checkmate and I win?"
Penny,"Well, is it or isnêt it?"
Leonard,"You know, I think this is a good stopping point. Uh, itês your first real game. I threw a lot of information at you."
Penny,"Well, no, I mean, your king is trapped. He canêt go here because of my lighthouse, and he canêt go here because of my pointy-head guy."
Leonard,"Like I said, complicated game."
Penny,So did I win or not?
Leonard,"Did you have fun? Because if you had fun, then you are, you are a winner. Now thatês, that-thatês what chess is all about."
Penny,"Oh, hey. Sorry, Sheldon, Iêll move."
Sheldon,"Eh, why? My spot, your spot, what difference does it make?"
Penny,"Okay, what just happened?"
Leonard,"I donêt know. Between you playing chess like Bobby Fischer and Sheldon being okay with you in his spot, Iêm guessing someone went back in time, stepped on a bug, and changed the course of human events."
Penny,"Uh, sweetie, are you all right?"
Sheldon,"No, Iêm not all right. Itês been six days since I was supposed to get a haircut and nothing horrible has happened."
Penny,"Okay, Iêm sorry, I donêt understand."
Sheldon,"Leonard, explain it to her."
Leonard,"Oh, uh, heês crazy."
Sheldon,"I have spent my whole life trying to bring order to the universe by carefully planning every moment of every day. But all my efforts, our dinner schedule, my pyjama rotation, my bowel movement spreadsheet, itês clear now, Iêve been wasting my time."
Leonard,Good. Iêm taking that disgusting chart off the fridge.
Penny,"You know, Sh-Sheldon, sometimes itês nice not knowing whatês coming. I mean, look at me and Leonard. We went out, we broke up, now weêre trying again. We donêt know whatês gonna happen."
Sheldon,"Oh, please, everyone knows whatês going to happen. But I see your point."
Leonard,I think this could be good for you. Maybe itês time for you to shake things up a bit.
Sheldon,Youêre right. I should embrace the chaos.
Leonard,Great. What are you going to do first?
Sheldon,I donêt know. I could do anything. All bets are off. The world is my oyster. I got it. Iêm going to put on my Tuesday pyjamas tonight.
Leonard,"I got to tell you, Iêm a little worried about him."
Penny,"If I were you, Iêd be worried that a girl whoês never played chess in her life just kicked your ass."
Bernadette,"Howie, what happened to you?"
Howard,"We did overnight survival training in the wilderness. Big fun. Big, big fun. I was gonna freshen up for you but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom."
Bernadette,Survival training? Is that like camping?
Howard,"Uh-huh. Except you donêt have food or water, and they donêt have a sunset Sabbath service like they do at Camp Hess-Kramer."
Bernadette,Do you sleep in tents?
Howard,"I slept in a hole I dug in the ground with my bare hands. And at some point during the night, an armadillo crawled in and spooned me."
Bernadette,Poor baby.
Howard,"But I did it. I survived. I wasnêt sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit. I just pulled my turtleneck up over my head and waited for death. But somehow as I sat there, wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck-sweat, I found that primal part of the human spirit that just wants to keep on living, no matter what the cost."
Bernadette,Youêre so brave. Iêm proud of you.
Howard,"I ate a butterfly. It was so small and beautiful, but I was so hungry."
Bernadette,Are you crying?
Howard,"No, I donêt think itês possible. Iêm severely dehydrated. My pee is like toothpaste."
Bernadette,"Howie, if youêre not able to do this, come home. It wonêt change how I feel about you."
Howard,"Thanks, honey, but I canêt quit. If I do, Iêll just be a guy who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up."
Bernadette,"Well, is there anything I could do to help?"
Howard,Wait. Send more underwear.
Leonard,Donêt let this be Sheldon playing bongos. Please donêt let this be Sheldon playing bongos.
Sheldon,"Hello, Leonard, do you like my bongos? Bet you didnêt know that I had bongos."
Leonard,"Sheldon, itês three oêclock in the morning."
Sheldon,Three in the morning is a good time for bongos.
Leonard,I was sleeping.
Sheldon,Leonard sleeps while I play bongos.
Leonard,"No, he doesnêt."
Sheldon,Leonard no sleep while I play bongos. Bongo solo.
Leonard,Stop! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop it!
Penny,What the hell?!
Leonard,"Oh, hi, Penny, guess what? Sheldon got bongos."
Penny,Why did you get bongos?
Sheldon,Richard Feynman played the bongos. I thought Iêd give that a try.
Leonard,Richard Feynman was a famous physicist.
Penny,"Oh, Leonard, itês three oêclock in the morning. I donêt care if Richard Feynman was a purple leprechaun who lived in my butt."
Sheldon,Penny meant if he were a purple leprechaun. Penny forgot to use the subjunctive.
Leonard,"Sheldon, go to bed. You have work in the morning."
Sheldon,"Maybe, maybe not. Maybe tomorrow I start a bongo band and tour the world."
Leonard,"W-w-wuh, no, no, hang on,uh, uh, roommate agreement. No hootenannies, sing-a-longs, or barbershop quartets after ten p.m."
Sheldon,Roommate agreement? Are you kidding? We are living in a world of chaos. Roommate agreement.
Penny,Where are you going?
Sheldon,"Wherever the music takes me, kitten. I play bongos walking down the stairs.  Oh! Oh! Never play bongos walking down the stairs."
Howard,What are you doing here?
Bernadette,"Iêm here to help you get through this. You canêt do it on your own, you need someone to take care of you."
Howard,"Oh, I love you so much."
Bernadette,"Oh, I love you."
Howard,"Donêt worry, once she falls asleep, Iêll spoon you like an armadillo."
Amy,He showed up in the middle of the night with his bongos. I foolishly thought it was some sort of musical booty call.
Leonard,Poor guy. He must have been exhausted. Sheldon like to sleep while Leonard play the bongo!
Amy,That was kind of uncalled for.
Leonard,"No, it was called for."
Sheldon,Whatês going on?
Penny,"All right, Sheldon, this craziness has gone on long enough. Please come home so I can cut your hair."
Sheldon,"Penny, youêre not trained. Youêre not licensed. Most importantly, you donêt have access to my haircut records."
Penny,"All right, honey, look, weêve known each other for a long time now, right? Iêve taken you to Disneyland, I kicked a bully in the nuts for you, I sing you Soft Kitty when youêre sick, youêve even saw me naked once."
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, duh, what?"
Penny,"It was a long story. Anyway, Sheldon, I promise I know what Iêm doing. Please let me cut your hair."
Sheldon,"Amy, what do you think?"
Amy,Thereês not a hair on my body I wouldnêt let this woman trim.
Sheldon,"Fine, letês go. Thank you for letting me sleep on your couch."
Amy,Thereês only so many times a woman can say how about the bed?
Leonard,Whatês this about Sheldon seeing you naked?
Sheldon,"Oh, relax. It was just her bottom and her breasts."
Penny,Almost done.
Sheldon,"At the end of the haircut, Mr. DêOnofrio would tell me a dirty joke."
Penny,"Well, sorry, I donêt know any dirty jokes."
Sheldon,"Thatês okay, I never understood them anyway."
Penny,"Okay, what do you think?"
Sheldon,"Hmm, well, itês a little Hollywood. But I think I can pull it off. Well done, Penny."
Penny,"Ha, told you. Okay, Iêm just gonna clean up your neck a little and then you are good to go."
Sheldon,"Fun time. Hah. Sorry, sometimes the clippers tickle me."
Penny,"Okay.  Okay, yep, weêre all done now. Itês just, itês good. Let me just take that away from you. Okay."
Penny,"You are welcome. Yeah, Iêm gonna have to move."
Raj,"Hey, want to spend some time playing the new Star Wars game this weekend?"
Leonard,"Oh, I donêt know. I kind of promised myself Iêd get off the computer, be more physically active. Get some exercise."
Howard,Youêre about to walk up three flights of stairs.
Leonard,"Good point, Iêm in."
Raj,You know what would be great? Letês do it like the old days.
Leonard,"You mean, are you talking gaming marathon?"
Raj,"Yeah. Start Saturday morning, go 48 hours, sleeping bags, junk food."
Howard,Turn off our phones so our moms canêt call.
Leonard,It would be like our World Of Warcraft a few years ago when the neighbours called the cops on us.
Howard,They called the cops because of the smell. They thought we were dead.
Raj,We were badass back in the day.
Leonard,"All right, letês do it."
Howard,48 hours of Star Wars gaming.
Raj,Itês on like Alderaan.
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, clear your weekend. Starting Saturday morning, Star Wars< marathon"
Sheldon,Movies or video games? Or board game? Or trading card games? Or Legoês? Or dress up? Or comic books? Or dramatic readings of novelizations? Yes to all!
Leonard,We are going to play the online game.
Sheldon,The online game? Bully!
Amy,"Gentlemen, as much as Iêm sure Sheldon would enjoy playing intergalactic make-believe, he and I have other plans. We are attending my Aunt Floraês 93rd birthday party."
Sheldon,Just tell her I canêt come.
Amy,Sheêll be disappointed if we donêt show up.
Sheldon,Sheês 93. She wonêt be disappointed for very long.
Amy,"No, hang on. I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement. I made a written record request 72 hours in advance. I checked the tyre pressure on the car. I even contacted the Centres For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County. FYI, itês none."
Sheldon,"Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way."
Amy,You use it to get your way.
Sheldon,I use it to get the right way. The fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence.
Amy,You gave me your word. Youêre coming with me.
Leonard,"Weêll miss you, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, who wants to spend the whole weekend, running around a bunch of pretend planets battling made up monsters. Thatês for babies."
Howard,"Yeah, but itês got lightsabres."
Sheldon,"Yeah, please, Amy! Itês got lightsabres!"
Sheldon,Hello Stuart.
Sheldon,"Yes. Iêm attending a party this weekend, for a 93-year-old woman. Can you recommend a gift?"
Sheldon,Do you supply the the tennis ball?
Sheldon,Then no. What else?
Sheldon,"Well, sheêd just look silly wearing that without the rest of the costume."
Sheldon,"Oh, itês not your fault. Iêve been to the model train store. Iêve been to Radio Shack. This woman is impossible to shop for."
Leonard,Iêd make fun of Sheldon for having girl problems if I wasnêt in shock that Sheldon has girl problems.
Sheldon,"No, Leonard, go ahead and mock. Like my daddy always said, Shelly, women arenêt anything but flippinê pains in the bottom."
Leonard,Thatês what your father used to say?
Sheldon,"Well, I took out the bad words and the yeehaw, but you get the gist."
Howard,"Look, if you donêt want to go to the party, just donêt go. Youêre a grown man. Act like one. Tell Amy you want to spend the weekend having a sleepover and playing video games with your friends. Maybe sheêll dig it. Women like a firm hand on the tiller."
Raj,I can never find the tiller. I got a book; it didnêt help.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I always thought if I were ever enslaved, it would be by an advanced species from another planet, not some hotsy-totsy from Glendale."
Howard,"Now, I downloaded an app that might be helpful in this situation. "
Sheldon,Youêre right. Iêm smart as a whip. I should be able to figure this out.
Leonard,"Hey, listen, I kind of made plans with the guys this weekend, but then I wondered, because weêre in this relationship-beta-test, if I should have asked you first. Then I thought if I did check with you first, youêd think that I was taking things to seriously. And then, then I got a nosebleed."
Penny,You donêt have to check with me. Do whatever you want.
Leonard,"Oh. I guess I was hoping for a different reaction, but okay."
Penny,"Really, what were you hoping for?"
Leonard,"I donêt know, maybe that youêd be a little upset, and then youêd realize that Iêm a stallion that has to run free. And that would turn you on a little."
Penny,"Okay, Iêm an actress. Ask me again."
Leonard,Do you mind if I spend the weekend playing video games with the guys?
Penny,"WhuÑ the entire weekend? You mean I wouldnêt see you at all? But I juÑ No, no, I knew what I was getting into. You canêt put a saddle on Leonard Hofstadter. Oh, my, is it getting hot in here? Ay, papi."
Leonard,Ay papi? What is that?
Penny,An acting choice.
Leonard,"Oh. So you chose that when you become turned on, you turn into Speedy Gonzalez?"
Penny,"Choo got a problem with that, papi?"
Sheldon, Penny!
Penny,"Sorry, Stallion. Your weird friend Giraffe is here."
Sheldon,"Hello, Penny. I just stopped by to bring you this gift."
Penny,Gummy bears? Thank you.
Sheldon,"Now that youêre in my debt, please manipulate Amy into releasing me from my commitment to attend her auntês tedious birthday party."
Penny,Not a chance.
Sheldon,"All right. I thought the candy might not be enough so let me up the ante. These are Cooper Coupons. These are for various things I can do for you. Um, oh, this one is for one free grammar check. Uh, you could use it for emails, letters, tattoos, what have you. Um, oh, this is fun one. This is an afternoon with me at the California Science Center, where I point out their mistakes."
Leonard,"Keep an eye on those expiration dates, Iêve been burned more than once."
Penny,"All right, sweetie, Iêm not going to get involved in your relationship."
Sheldon,"Oh, come on. Itês just a simple favour. Now, whenês the last time I asked you to do something for me?"
Penny,Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
Sheldon,When is the last time I asked you to do something that wasnêt a medical emergency?
Penny,Yesterday. You made me look in your ear to see if there was a ladybug in it.
Sheldon,"All right, then, I have no choice but to go on to plan B."
Penny,Whatês that?
Sheldon,Iêm going to run around outside with a wet head and try to catch a cold.
Amy,Good morning.
Amy,"I think youêre really going to enjoy yourself today. Not only do you get to meet my relatives, but since my auntês nursing home is catering the party, all of the food is incredibly soft. Itês like a vacation for your teeth."
Sheldon,All right.
Amy,You sure youêre okay with this?
Sheldon,Yes. I decided to find a way that I could have this experience and enjoy it.
Amy,Thank you. That means a lot to me.
Sheldon,"Oh, donêt thank me. Thank wireless technology. I realized, I can go to your auntês awful party and still spend the whole day gaming with my friends."
Amy,"Sheldon, my relatives are going to want to talk to you, and youêre going to be sitting there playing a game? Isnêt that a little rude?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I got that covered. Headset. I wonêt hear a word the old geezers are saying."
Amy,"You know, if playing that game is more important to you than honouring your commitment to me, and you donêt mind me showing up at a party all by myself after Iêve already told everybody Iêll be bringing somebody, then, fine. Go home and play your game."
Sheldon,"Thanks. Ooh, listen, I wouldnêt mind a piece of birthday cake, provided the old galês candle blow is clean and dry."
Raj,"Here you go. Iêve got everything weêll need for the big game. Low fat turkey jerky, low-carb beer, 100-calorie snack packs."
Leonard,You pick up a Y chromosome while you were there? You might be short one.
Raj,"Hey, I plan on levelling up in the game, not my swimsuit size, thank you very much."
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, the game offers us a choice between playing for the Republic and the light side, or the Sith Empire and the dark side."
Leonard,"Well, weêre always the good guys. In D&D, weêre lawful good, in City Of Heroes, weêre the heroes, in Grand Theft Auto, we pay the prostitutes promptly and never hit them with a bat."
Sheldon,Those women are prostitutes? You said they were raising money for stem cell research.
Howard,"Hey, guys, I got a surprise."
Leonard,"Uh, if itês yoghurt that helps ladies poop, I think Raj beat you to it."
Howard,"Bernadetteês going to be playing with us. So, thatês pretty cool, huh? Right? Sure it is, yeah."
Raj,you invited your girlfriend? This is supposed to be our weekend.
Howard,"I had no choice. Last night, she said, why donêt we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum. And I said, well, no, I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend. And she said, that sounds like fun, can I come, too? And then I didnêt answer for a second, and then she said, well, do you not want me to come? And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and sheês parking the car right now."
Sheldon,Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?
Leonard,"Uh, it is, but I think you mightêve waited too long for it to be funny.  I was wrong, itês still funny."
Sheldon,"Oh, good. Hah-hah!"
Penny,"Amy, whatês wrong?"
Amy,My boyfriendês a jerk.
Penny,"Well, I know he didnêt cheat on you, so what happened?"
Amy,"I had to go to my auntês party all by myself, and everybody was like, whereês this boyfriend youêre always talking about? Is he real, or did you make him up like Armin the miniature horse breeder?"
Penny,Whoês Armin the miniature horse breeder?
Amy,The pretend boyfriend I invented to get my family off my back. It unravelled quickly when I couldnêt answer the question howêd you two meet?
Penny,I would have thought at a miniature horse show.
Amy,"Oh, thatês good."
Amy,I panicked and said Woodstock. I just wanted to show Sheldon off to my family.
Penny,"Sure, I get that. I mean, heês your first boyfriend and all."
Amy,"Not just my first boyfriend, heês the best boyfriend. I mean, think about it. Iêm dating Sheldon Cooper."
Penny,Yes. On purpose.
Amy,"Heês handsome, heês lanky, heês brilliant, and his skin has that pale, waxy quality."
Penny,"Well, sickly is the new sexy."
Penny,"Mm. You know, Amy, sometimes when youêre in a relationship with someone you really care about, the sucky part is, it leaves you open to getting hurt."
Amy,Do you ever worry about Leonard doing that to you?
Penny,Thatês hilarious. No.
Bernadette,Get that guy! Get that guy! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!
Sheldon,"Dr. Rostenkowski, it may interest you to know that saying pew, pew, pew isnêt as effective as pressing your blaster key. In the same way that saying whee doesnêt make the land speeder go."
Leonard,"Raj, Imperial Troopers on your tail."
Raj,"Got him. When Gandhi advocated his philosophy of non-violence, I bet he didnêt know how much fun it was killing stuff."
Leonard,"All right, I think we got them all. Letês divide up the loot."
Bernadette,"Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got. You should put on yours and then weêll match."
Howard,But I worked hard to get this armour.
Bernadette,"Sorry, I just thought itêd be nice if people knew we were a couple."
Howard,"Fine, Iêll change.  "
Amy,I donêt think I want to play a game.
Penny,"Oh, come on. Theyêre playing one across the hall, we should, too. Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink. Then you get to go againÑ"
Amy,Like that?
Penny,"Wow. Yeah, b-beginnerês luck. So, now I will drink this entire cup of beer, and you will go again and we canÑ uhÑ all right. So, yeah, okay, now Iêm gonna drink this entire cup and then Iêm going to drink another oneÑ Okay, seriously, stop. What the hell?"
Amy,"Spent a lot of my childhood throwing coins into wishing wells hoping for friends. At a certain point, you start doing trick shots just to keep things interesting."
Penny,"Whoa, whoa, give me a second to catch up here. Hold on. "
Amy,Thatêd be my boyfriend. Happier playing his dopey Star Trek game with his friends than hanging out with me.
Penny,Star Wars. They get all cranky when you mix the two up.
Amy,Whatês the difference?
Penny,Thereês absolutely no difference.
Amy,How do I get him to treat me better?
Penny,"All right. Let me give you a little girlfriend 101. Usually the first move out of the gate is you withhold sex, but that will work better after Sheldon hits puberty. So, Iêd say give him the silent treatment."
Amy,"No, he loves that."
Amy,Our record for sitting in a room together and not speaking to each other is six-and-a half hours. He said it was a magical evening.
Penny,"All right, then weêre gonna have to go with an oldie but goodie, making a scene."
Amy,I donêt think Iêd be good at that.
Penny,"Thatês why youêre lucky to have me. Back in Omaha, there are two different restaurants Iêm not allowed into. Both Chiliês."
Raj,"Bernadette, remember, your characterês the healer in our group. Youêre in charge of healing all of us, not just Howard."
Bernadette,I canêt help it. My Howie Wowie has an owie.
Sheldon,That is the most sickeningly sweet thing I have ever experienced. And I am sipping Kool-Aid through a Red Vine.
Amy,"Sheldon Cooper, Iêve got a bone to pick with you, and Iêm about to do it in front of all your friends."
Penny,"Yeah, you pick that bone. You pick that bone clean!"
Amy,"Iêm gonna publicly shame you, and then sit back as societal pressure compels you to modify your behaviour."
Penny,"Ooh, burn!"
Amy,"And if you donêt start treating me better, Iêm leaving you for a miniature horse breeder named Armin."
Sheldon,Armin who?
Amy,ArminÑ damn it.
Penny,"Sheldon, she wanted to show you off to her family, and you stood her up, okay? Look at this adorable, smushy face. Smush, smush, smush, smush."
Amy,Youêre hurting me.
Penny,"No, Sheldon hurt you."
Amy,Before; now itês you.
Sheldon,"I think I understand. Youêre the one person who can say Sheldon Cooper is your boyfriend, but that rings hollow if you canêt lord him over others in the flesh. I forget what I bring to the party and what I take away when I leave. Please accept these valuable Cooper Coupons as restitution."
Penny,"Sheldon, she doesnêt want your stupidÑ"
Amy,"Ooh, Science Center. Redeeming. Letês go."
Sheldon,"Well played, Amy Farrah Fowler. Let me get my coat.  Oh, grow up, Leonard."
Raj,"But e-excuse me, I have something to say. None of you may realize it, but I was very much looking forward to this weekend. It was gonna be like the old days, the four of us hanging out playing video games before you guys all got girlfriends. Do you have any idea what itês like to be the only one without a girlfriend? Even if I get one someday, Iêll still be the guy who got a girl after Sheldon Cooper!"
Penny,"And thatês how a girl makes a scene. Iêm sorry, sweetie. Youêre right. You deserve your weekend. Come on, Amy, letês go."
Amy,What about the Science Center?
Penny,Iêll let you hold my hair while I throw up.
Amy,Rain check.
Bernadette,"Iêm gonna go, too."
Howard,Iêll miss you.
Bernadette,Iêll miss you.
Howard,Iêll miss you more.
Bernadette,"No, IêllÑ"
Raj,"Just leave! Okay, now. This is the way itês supposed to be. Men together, fighting the forces of evil."
Raj,I canêt believe this is only 64 calories.
Howard,"Thatês my ride, got to go. "
Penny,"Oh my God, I love this chicken."
Sheldon,"Oh, you know what they say, the best things in life are free."
Penny,"Okay, youêre right, I eat your food a lot. How about this, you can raid my fridge any time you want."
Sheldon,"Oh, thatês very kind of you. Next time I have a hankering to wash down a D cell battery with a jar of old pickle juice, Iêll come a-knocking."
Howard,"Hey, Raj, you didnêt send your RSVP in. Iêm supposed to ask you if youêre bringing someone to the wedding."
Raj,Iêll let you know.
Howard,"Well, can you make it soon. Thereês a battle royale going on over the seating charts. In one corner, Bernadetteês mom, and the other three, mine."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I hate wedding receptions. I wish the bride and groom would take a cue from Bilbo Baggins, slip on the ring, disappear and everyone goes home."
Leonard,"Mmm, you liked Professor Guysterês wedding."
Sheldon,"They had a make your own sundae bar. Ooh, that was a night to remember. Do you know, on the one trip, I just had a bowl of nuts."
Howard,"Anyway, you gotta let me know if you have a plus one, because if not my momês trying to sneak in the doctor who sucked the fat out of her neck."
Raj,"Alright, uh, fine, Iêm coming and Iêm bringing somebody. Uh, Koothrappali plus one."
Leonard,Who you bringing?
Raj,Who are you bringing?
Penny,Heês bringing me. Who are you bringing?
Raj,"Wow, what a bunch of Nosey OêDonnells."
Howard,"Come on, who is it?"
Raj,Iêm not telling. Iêm from Asia. Iêm mysterious. Deal with it.
Sheldon,"Howard, are you having a make your own sundae bar?"
Howard,"No, uh, I donêt think so."
Sheldon,"Well you should. 50% of marriages end in divorce, but 100% of make your own sundae bars end in happiness."
Raj,"Hello Mummy, Daddy, how are you?"
Raj,"Listen, uh, thereês something I want to talk to you about. I, I wasnêt ready until now, but I think itês time."
Raj,"No, Iêm not gay. If anything, Iêm metrosexual."
Raj,It means I like women as well as their skincare products.
Raj,"‚Cause I, Iêm tired of trying to meet someone and, I think Iêd like you to help me find uh, a wife."
Sheldon,Quantum physics makes me so happy.
Leonard,"Yeah, Iêm glad."
Sheldon,Itês like looking at the universe naked.  
Penny,"Hi, you guys got a minute?"
Leonard,"Sure, whatês up?"
Penny,"Well, I was thinking about Sheldonês little joke the other night about me eating all your food."
Sheldon,"Oh, that was no joke. But I understand your confusion as I am our groupês resident cut-up."
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, you are our resident cut-up?"
Leonard,Prove it.
Sheldon,"Knock, knock."
Leonard,Whoês there?
Sheldon,Interrupting physicist.
Leonard,Interrupting physiÑ
Penny,"Anyway, I got a little residual cheque from my commercial and I thought, hey, how about I get the guys a little thankyou to pay them back. So, Sheldon, ta-da!"
Sheldon,"Ah! A vintage, mint in box, 1975 Mego Star Trek transporter with real transporter action. Hot-darn!"
Leonard,Where did you get that?
Penny,"Uh, from Stuart at the comic-book store."
Leonard,You went to the comic-book store by yourself?
Penny,"Yeah, it was fun, I walked in and two different guys got asthma attacks. Felt pretty good."
Sheldon,Well this calls for an expression of gratitude.
Penny,"Ooh, am I about to get a rare Sheldon Cooper hug?"
Sheldon,Not this time. Then they wouldnêt be special. Thanks Penny.
Penny,"Youêre welcome. Donêt worry, I didnêt forget about you. Leonard, I got you a label maker."
Leonard,"Wow. No, itês great. Also, uh, mint in box."
Penny,"Mmm. And, I got you a transporter too!"
Sheldon,"Look, it was actually designed for my vintage Mr Spock action figure."
Penny,"Oh, thatês great. Letês open it up and put him in there."
Sheldon,Oh dear Lord. No!
Penny,"Why, theyêre just toys?"
Sheldon,Theyêre mint in box.
Leonard,Theyêre Collectables.
Penny,Cêmon canêt we just open one up and take aÑ
Leonard,Once you open the box it loses its value.
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, my mom gave me the same lecture about my virginity. Gotta tell you, it was a lot more fun taking it out and playing with it."
Bernadette,Are you sure you want us here when you meet this woman?
Raj,"Oh yes. In my culture itês expected to have a chaparone to oversee a first date. Plus I want to make a good impression and, no offence, but with you guys here I look like six two."
Bernadette,The nuns always chaparoned the dances at my high school. They used to make us leave room between us for the holy spirit.
Howard,Hindus do the same thing. Except they leave room for a cow.
Raj,"Listen, I love your charming racist humour, but any chance you could not knock my religion while sheês here."
Howard,Yesterday you made fun of me for eating lox.
Raj,Itês different. Youêre people donêt worship lox.
Howard,Well clearly youêve never been to brunch with my cousins.
Bernadette,"So, arranged marriages. The parents just decide, and then you have to get married?"
Raj,"Oh, no, no, I get a say in it. But Iêm sure whoever shows up will be better company than a threesome Iêve been having with Aunt Jemima and Mrs Butterworth."
Raj,"Oh, yes. You must be Lakshmi. Uh, nice to meet you."
Raj,"Oh, uh, these are my, my friends. This is Bernadette."
Raj,And this is Howard.
Howard,Nice to meet you.
Raj,Please have a seat.  Iêm thinking double wedding!
Sheldon,Is someone there?
Sheldon,Fascinating. The only logical explanation is that this is a dream.
Sheldon,Was I hit on the head by a coconut.
Sheldon,But itês mint in box.
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm not going to dignify that with a response."
Sheldon,To be played with.
Sheldon,"Illogical. Oh, damn it Spock, youêre right. Iêll do it."
Sheldon,"Oh, of course. Set phasers to dumb, right?  Itês only logical."
Raj,"Well, I hope you saved room for chocolate lava cake."
Raj,"Well, you start off by trying to make chocolate souffle, and when it falls you panic, quickly change the name, and voila! Lava cake."
Raj,"Well, letês see. Yup, three missed calls."
Raj,Iêd like to tell them things are going well.
Raj,"Okay, what page are you on?"
Raj,Say again.
Raj,"Like, dude on dude, but with women?"
Raj,"Why me, of all people?"
Raj,Iêm not gay.
Raj,"Thatês Unbreakable by Khloe and Lamar. And for your information, itês unisex."
Raj,I like to boogie.
Raj,W-w-with women. I like to boogie with women.
Raj,"Thankyou. And once again, my baloney likes girls. Wait-wait. You donêt want to put a bit of that in your mouth without trying my homemade chantilly cream. Yeah, okay, that time I heard it."
Sheldon,Oh dear. Two suns and no sunscreen.
Sheldon,"What is it now, tiny Spock?"
Sheldon,Youêre the one who told me to play with it.
Sheldon,"If I got on the bridge of the Enterprise, I would never, ever leave."
Sheldon,"Why? I got away with it. Leonard has his toy, and heês never going to open it, so he wonêt know itês broken. And I have a toy that isnêt broken. Everybodyês happy."
Sheldon,I thought where you come from they donêt have emotions.
Sheldon,"You know what you are? Well, youêre a green blooded buzzkill. Perhaps itês time you beam on out of here."
Sheldon,"Very well. Cooper to Enterprise, one to beam up. Energise.  Ah. Tiny Spock. Help."
Raj,Ready for lunch?
Howard,"Yep, one sec.  Ah, good. Ma would have killed me if sheêd found out Iêd broke my retainer."
Raj,"Hey, uh, can I run something by you? Itês about Lakshmi."
Howard,Yeah. Sure. How are things going?
Raj,"We hit a couple of bumps. She lives over on Manhattan Beach, so it takes over an hour to get there. And sheês a lesbian."
Howard,"What do you mean, sheês a lesbian?"
Raj,"Well, you know whenever you and I would try to hit on women in bars, and theyêd blow us off, and then weêd tell each other they were probably gay. Itês like that. Except this time itês true."
Howard,Then why did she even go out with you?
Raj,"She was looking for a husband so she can appear to be straight. And you know, it sounded crazy to me at first, but Iêm actually thinking about doing it."
Howard,"Okay, well, so the reason that might sound crazy, is êcause itês crazy."
Raj,"Look, Howard, youêre in a relationship. You know you have to make compromises."
Howard,"Well, yes. But my compromises are about which bedspread to buy, or whose turn it is to do the laundry, Bernadetteês or my momês."
Raj,"Itês a great deal. We both get our parents off our backs. I donêt have to come home to an empty apartment every night, plus, once Iêm married, I can finally eat carbs again and let myself go."
Howard,"Why donêt you tell your parents you want to try and find someone else, you know, maybe one who hasnêt slept with more women than you."
Raj,Because this one wants to marry me. I might never find another one who does.
Howard,So youêre seriously thinking about marrying someone youêre never going to have sex with.
Raj,I canêt believe your attitude. I thought you were in favour of gay people getting married.
Howard,"Yes, to other gay people."
Raj,Do you hear how homophobic you sound?
Sheldon,"Oh, I donêt want a broken toy.  Nothing!"
Sheldon,Nothing. I said nothing.
Penny,That was weird.
Leonard,Really? I donêt even notice any more.
Penny,I cannot believe you guys arenêt going to play with these.
Leonard,"Well I told you, you donêt, itês mint in box."
Penny,I dunno. I just think itês a waste.  Relax. Iêm just looking at the box.
Sheldon,"Perhaps you should look with your eyes, and not your muscular Nebraska man-hands."
Penny,What is your problem?
Sheldon,"My problem is that I donêt want you to break Leonardês toy, which you probably did by shaking it. She shook it. We all saw her."
Penny,"Leonard, I bought you this because I wanted you to have fun with it. I donêt want it to just sit in this box."
Leonard,"You know, youêre right. I mean, itês from you, Iêm never going to sell it. Iêm opening it."
Leonard,Itês broken.
Sheldon,"Oh, nice job, man-hands."
Penny,"I didnêt break it. I, I guess Stuart sold it to me like this."
Sheldon,"Yes. Yes, he did, that is a perfectly satisfying and plausible explanation. Yeah, letês all be mad at Stuart."
Penny,"You know, I paid a lot for this. Letês take it over there and show him."
Sheldon,"Wait. It was me. I opened your toy, discovered it was broken and didnêt tell you."
Leonard,Why would you open mine?
Sheldon,I didnêt. That was a lie. I opened my own toy. And it was already broken so I switched them.
Leonard,"Well, you should talk to Stuart."
Sheldon,I canêt because that was a lie. Yours was broken in an earthquake. And thatês a lie.
Penny,What is the truth?
Sheldon,My Mr Spock doll came to me in a dream and forced me to open it. And when the toy broke I switched it for yours. Later he encouraged me to do the right thing and I defied him. And then I was attacked by a Gorn.
Leonard,"Okay, that I believe."
Sheldon,"Leonard, Penny, I just, I want you both to know that I regret my actions toward the two of you. Thatês a lie."
Leonard,"So, is that one mine."
Leonard,"Well, hand it over so I can open it."
Sheldon,"Okay. Leonard, even though I donêt have one any more, I hope you have fun playing with it."
Leonard,"And thatês a lie, right?"
Sheldon,Big fat whopper. I hope it breaks.
Raj,"This is a treat, what brings you guys by?"
Bernadette,"Raj, Howie told me whatês going on with you and Lakshmi."
Raj,you told her?
Howard,I told everybody.
Bernadette,We believe thereês someone out there whoêll love you for you.
Howard,"Well, actually we kind of agreed to disagree on that one, but we both think you shouldnêt marry this woman."
Raj,"So, while Iêm waiting for this mysterious perfect match, who may or may not exist, Iêm supposed to just be alone."
Bernadette,Not necessarily. I think weêve found someone for you to cuddle with. 
Raj,"Oh, my goodness. Arenêt you the cutest little Yorkie ever? You got him for me?"
Howard,Her. We thought you two would hit it off.
Raj,I think we already have. Thank you guys so much. Letês see if you fit in my man purse.
Bernadette,Metrosexual my ass.
Howard,"So, I got the craziest e-mail this morning."
Raj,"I donêt mean to burst your bubble, dude, but those penile enlargement pills do not work."
Howard,"Believe me, I know. The e-mail I got was from the office of Stephen Hawking."
Leonard,Youêre kidding.
Howard,"Heês coming to the university for a couple weeks to lecture, and heês looking for an engineer to help maintain the equipment on his wheelchair."
Leonard,"Thatês amazing. Youêll be like his pit crew. A word of caution, I would not do your Stephen Hawking impression in front of him."
Howard,Youêre right. I suppose that could be considered offensive.
Raj,"Oh, boy, Sheldonês going to freak out."
Leonard,"Yeah, he worships Hawking."
Howard,I was actually thinking about bringing him along when I go over there so he can meet the great man.
Raj,"Thatês really nice of you, Howard."
Howard,"Hm, itês no big deal."
Leonard,"Boy, a restraining order from Stephen Hawking. Itêll look so nice next to the ones heês already got from Leonard Nimoy, Carl Sagan and Stan Lee."
Sheldon,"Leonard, do you recall when I said that I was going to revolutionize humanityês understanding of the Higgs boson particle, and you said, Sheldon, itês two a.m., get out of my bedroom?"
Leonard,Like it was ten hours ago. What about it?
Sheldon,"Well, I believe Iêve done it. And Iêm only saying believe to sound modest, because, sweet Sam Houston, I did it."
Raj,"Thatês incredible. Oh, here, break out the math."
Sheldon,"Oh, okay, let me see this. All right, so this particle here is the boson moving forward in time. Now, I was thinkingÑ Howard, you go ahead and eat. This isnêt going to make any sense to you."
Howard,"Sheldon, I have a working understanding of physics."
Sheldon,"Yeah, good for you, and donêt stop working on it."
Raj,Are you still going to tell him about you-know-who?
Leonard,Still going to introduce him?
Howard,Not on your life.
Sheldon,"Please, please, please let me meet Hawking."
Howard,"I told you, no."
Sheldon,But I said Iêm sorry.
Howard,"No, you said, would it help if I said Iêm sorry?"
Sheldon,And you never answered me. So who owes whom an apology now?
Howard,"Sheldon, youêre a condescending jerk. Why on earth would I want to do something nice for you?"
Sheldon,"Um, to go to Jewish heaven?"
Howard,Jews donêt have heaven.
Sheldon,Then to avoid Jewish hell?
Howard,Have you met my mother? I live in Jewish hell.
Sheldon,"Howard, please. This is Stephen Hawking. Perhaps my only intellectual equal."
Howard,"Oh, you canêt be serious."
Sheldon,Try to put yourself in my place. Imagine youêre the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but dogs. And then it turns out thereês another human being.
Howard,Hang on. Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?
Sheldon,"Yeah, okay, I can see youêre going to take this the wrong way. Let me try again. Imagine youêre the sole human being living on a planet populated with nothing but chimps."
Howard,Get out of my lab.
Sheldon,"Oh, now theyêre so much smarter than dogs. Have you seen them on those little bicycles?"
Howard,Get out.
Sheldon,How about dolphins?
Leonard,"So, come on, how was the first day with Hawking?"
Howard,It was great. We talked about movies.
Howard,I showed him some card tricks.
Howard,He even let me read a couple pages from his new book.
Howard,"Something got you down there, bunky?"
Sheldon,"Howard, please, Iêm begging you."
Leonard,"Raj, youêre our group historian. Has Sheldon ever begged before?"
Raj,"Three times. He begged the Fox network not to cancel Firefly. He begged the TNT network to cancel Babylon 5. And when he got food poisoning at the Rose Bowl Parade, he begged a deity he doesnêt believe in to end his life quickly."
Sheldon,"Do you understand how important Hawking is to me? When I was six years old, I dressed up as him for Halloween."
Howard,Youêre kidding.
Sheldon,"No, sir, no, I took my dadês desk chair, attached a Speak & Spell to it and made my sister push me up and down the block to trick or treat. Granted most people thought I was R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy."
Howard,"You donêt seem to be understanding the English word no. Maybe a different language will help. Russian, nyet. Chinese, bu. Japanese, iie. Klingon, qo. Binary coded Ascii, 0110111001101111."
Sheldon,Itês actually 01100111.
Sheldon,"Iêm not asking for me, Iêm asking for Hawking."
Howard,"Let me try gansta, hells no."
Sheldon,"Okay, look, how about this? Just give him my paper on the Higgs boson. If he sees the incredible breakthrough Iêve made, heêll reach out to me."
Leonard,What if he doesnêt?
Sheldon,"He will, heês really smart."
Howard,Thatês an interesting idea. Why donêt you give me a minute to talk it over with my friends?
Sheldon,How do I do that?
Howard,You walk away.
Sheldon,Walking away.
Leonard,You do realize you own his ass right now.
Howard,I do.
Raj,You can make him do anything you want.
Howard,"Yeah, I know, Iêm just trying to figure out how much I want to punish him."
Raj,"Well, donêt be too mean."
Sheldon,"Hey, fellas, Iêm thinking about making some freshly brewed iced tea if anyone would like some."
Raj,I wouldnêt mind a glass.
Sheldon,I wasnêt talking to you.
Raj,Bring him to his bony knees.
Howard,"Sheldon, come on back."
Sheldon,"Yes, yes. What did you decide?"
Howard,Iêll give your paper to Professor Hawking.
Sheldon,"Great, thank you. Oh, thatês terrific."
Howard,"But in exchange, Iêd like you to do a few things for me."
Sheldon,What kinds of things?
Howard,Are you familiar with the 12 labours of Hercules?
Sheldon,Of course.
Howard,You should be so lucky.
Sheldon,All right. What would you like me to do first?
Howard,"Well, I thought Iêd start you off by polishing my belt buckles."
Sheldon,"Oh. By all means. When I was a boy, I would polish my Mee-Mawês silver. And she would entertain me with stories about growing up in Oklahoma. Interesting woman. You know, she once killed a prairie dog with a gravy boat."
Howard,Thatês nice.
Sheldon,Thatês a lot of belt buckles.
Howard,"Funny thing is, I only have one belt. Anyway, Iêll let you get started. Oh, by the way, the little marks, uh, that look like water spots, I tend to stand too close to the urinal, so what youêre seeing there is splash back."
Sheldon,You make sissy on your belt buckles? Mee-Mawês forks never had that.
Howard,"Here is a black light to check them. And for your own peace of mind, you might not want to shine that around the rest of the room."
Howard,"Sheldon, these look great. Theyêre like magnificent little crowns to hang over my magnificent little jewels. Howêd you get them so shiny?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I-I buffed them with Turtle Wax. The man down at Pep Boys says from now on, the urine should just bead up and roll right off."
Howard,Way to go the extra mile. Your Mee-Maw would be proud.
Sheldon,My Mee-Maw must never know of this. Now will you give Professor Hawking my paper?
Howard,"Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay. Next, this is a sexy French maid costume I bought for Bernadette. I thought it might spice things up and get her to dust my room at the same time, but I was wrong and really wrong."
Sheldon,And you want me to return it for you?
Howard,"No, no, no, mon petit cherie."
Sheldon,What are you all staring at? Didnêt you ever see a man try to get a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?
Penny,Itês not Saturday night. Why are you doing your laundry?
Sheldon,This is not my laundry.
Penny,"Wow, are these Amyês? Kind of trashy, good for her."
Sheldon,Those are Howardês.
Penny,Ugh. Why are you washing Howardês man panties?
Sheldon,"Because if I donêt, he wonêt give my paper to Stephen Hawking. Heês a famous physicist."
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, I know, heês the wheelchair dude who invented time."
Sheldon,Thatês close enough.
Penny,"I donêt understand, why doesnêt Howard just introduce you to the guy?"
Sheldon,"Because heês punishing me for being a, quote, condescending jerk. You donêt think Iêm condescending, do you?"
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm sorry, condescending meansÑ"
Penny,"I know what it means. And yes, you love correcting people and putting them down."
Sheldon,"Au contraire. When I correct people I am raising them up. You should know, I do it for you more than anyone."
Penny,"Come on, you do it to feel superior. I see that twinkle in your eye when someone says who instead of whom or thinks the moon is a planet."
Sheldon,Or Don Quixote is a book about a donkey named Hotay.
Penny,"See, there it is, thereês that twinkle."
Sheldon,"Well, I canêt help it. Thatês an involuntary twinkle."
Penny,"What do you want me to tell you, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,I want you to tell me that Howard is being mean to me for no reason.
Penny,"Fine, Howard is being mean to you for no reason."
Sheldon,I knew it.
Howard,Whatês the matter?
Bernadette,"Every time I spend the night, your mom slaps me on the behind and says, go get ‚im."
Howard,"Itês not her fault. Sheês getting hormone replacement therapy. Makes her crazy horny. Check this out, I got Sheldon to wear the French maidês costume."
Bernadette,"Oh, my God, thatês terrible."
Howard,"Hey, I gave you first crack at it."
Bernadette,Why are you doing that? Youêre being mean to him.
Howard,Heês mean to me all the time. Youêve heard him tease me about not having a doctorate.
Bernadette,"If you donêt want to get teased about that, get a doctorate. I have one, theyêre great."
Howard,"Oh, come on, the man torments me. Iêm just letting him have a little taste of his own medicine."
Bernadette,Itês not the same thing. Sheldon doesnêt know when heês being mean because the part of his brain that should know is getting a wedgie from the rest of his brain.
Howard,"Fine, Iêll just make him do a couple more things, then Iêll stop."
Bernadette,"No, you have to stop now."
Bernadette,"Oh, damn. Iêm sorry, I canêt make it, but Sheldonês going to go with you! And thatês the last thing you do to him."
Sheldon,"What is it now, Mrs. Wolowitz?"
Sheldon,What do you want me to do?
Sheldon,Iêm not sure how to do this.
Sheldon,"Sleeping bags donêt usually sweat this much, but okay."
Sheldon,"Oh, if we squeeze you any tighter, you may turn into a diamond."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, you know, Iêm not really the holding kind ofÑ Oh!"
Howard,"Oh, guys, I just remembered. I got you some Hawking souvenirs."
Leonard,What are these?
Howard,"Gears and springs from his wheelchair. Pretty cool, huh?"
Raj,"Wow, thatês amazing."
Howard,"Yeah, I made an adjustment on the motor drive and when I was putting it back together I could not for the life of me figure out where they went."
Sheldon,"I did it. Had to go to three clothing stores, but we finally found a dress that could envelop your mother."
Howard,I should have sent you to the custom car cover place in Altadena. They have her pattern on file.
Sheldon,Humorous. Now will you please present my paper to Professor Hawking?
Howard,I donêt know.
Sheldon,"Oh, for heavenês sake. I did your laundry, I pee-pee-proofed your belt buckles, I, I even sprained my wrist helping your mother lift her bosom."
Howard,"All right, Sheldon, thereês only one thing left I want you to do. Donêt worry, itês an easy one."
Howard,Give me a compliment.
Sheldon,Fine. You have very tiny hands.
Howard,"No, about my job. I want you to tell me Iêm good at what I do."
Sheldon,Youêre obviously good at what you do.
Howard,"Well, then why are you always ripping on me?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I understand the confusion. I have never said that you are not good at what you do. Itês just that what you do is not worth doing."
Leonard,Itês nicer than anything heês ever said to me. Iêd take it and run.
Howard,"Thank you, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Now will you give my paper to Hawking?
Howard,"Sorry, I canêt."
Sheldon,why not?
Howard,I gave it to him three days ago. He was really impressed. He wants to meet you.
Sheldon,"All right, then. Thank you, Howard. Please let Professor Hawking know that Iêm available at his earliest convenience."
Raj,I thought he might be a little more excited.
Leonard,Give it a second. 
Sheldon,"Professor Hawking, itês an honour and a privilege to meet you, sir."
Sheldon,I want to thank you for taking time to see me.
Sheldon,I know.
Sheldon,"Thank you. It just, it came to me one morning in the shower."
Sheldon,What do you mean wrong?
Sheldon,"No, no, th-th-th-that canêt be right. I-I donêt make arithmetic mistakes."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, no, no, of course not. Itês just, I was thinkingÑ Oh, gosh, golly, I made a boo-boo, and I gave it to Stephen Hawking."
Sheldon,"I wish you could all be inside my head. The conversation is sparkling.  Fine, Iêll tell you. A lichen is an organism made up of two separate species, fungi and algae. If you could merge with another species, what species would you pick and why? Hint, there is a right answer. None of you will get it."
Raj,"Okay, uh, Iêd pick swan because, uh, the resulting hybrid would have the advanced industrial civilization of a human and the long graceful neck Iêve always dreamed of having."
Sheldon,Wrong. Leonard?
Leonard,"Horse, but mostly just for the height. A little bit for the genital girth."
Sheldon,"Wrong, and letês keep it clean, shall we?"
Howard,"Kangaroo, uh, Iêd be a Kanga-Jew. The first of my people to dunk a basketball."
Leonard,"Also instead of just living in your motherês house, you could actually live inside her body."
Sheldon,"Clever, but also wrong. No, the best organism for human beings to merge with is the lichen itself. That way, youêd be human, fungus, and algae. Triple threat. Like three-bean salad."
Leonard,Give me one circumstance in which that would be useful.
Sheldon,"All right, picture this, a beautiful outdoor concert. Now, as a human, I appreciate Beethoven. As a fungus, I have a terrific view, growing out of a towering maple tree. And no thank you, expensive concessions. Because as an algae, Iêll just snack on this sunlight."
Raj,He got us again.
Leonard,"No, he didnêt."
Raj,"Anyway, if itês okay with you, we should talk about Howardês bachelor party."
Sheldon,"Well, seems like a bit of a let down after our lichen conversation, but, what do you know, youêre half swan."
Raj,"Iêve been doing some research on strippers. One agency I spoke to, said I could get us a great price if weêre flexible on age range and number of limbs."
Howard,"Sounds like loads of fun, but I promised Bernadette no strippers."
Raj,You donêt want strippers? Youêre the king of strippers. The one club in North Hollywood named a pole after you.
Howard,"What can I tell ya, Iêm not into that stuff any more."
Leonard,"Good for you, Howard. Iêm proud of you. And still, youêre the first one of us to get married. We have to do something special."
Sheldon,You know Germans have an interesting pre-wedding custom.
Howard,"Well, itês probably not for me."
Raj,Maybe we can go up to Napa Valley. Theyêve got that wine train.
Sheldon,"Boo, wine! But yay, trains. Iêm in."
Raj,"Anyway, itês a beautiful time of year. Uh, you travel through the vineyards. Thereês a tasting on board. And all the wild flowers are in bloom. Itês magic."
Leonard,"Look at that, in 30 seconds, we went from hiring women to being them."
Penny,"So, I hear you and the lost boys are having a bachelor party tonight."
Leonard,"Yeah, just going to a restaurant, get some steaks and scotch. Nothing to worry about."
Penny,Why should I worry?
Leonard,"Well, I donêt know. Itês a bachelor party. There could be strippers. Wouldnêt that make you a little jealous?"
Penny,"Oh, come on Leonard, itês you. Whatês going to happen? I mean, even if there was a stripper, all youêd do is avoid eye-contact and maybe offer to help her kid with his homework."
Leonard,"Hey, I am a young man in his sexual prime. Under the right conditions, I-I-I am capable of just, really crazy stuff."
Penny,Really? What is the craziest thing youêve ever done with a woman? And the time you and I had sex in the ocean does not count.
Leonard,"Oh, come on, thatês got to count. There was a really strong undertow, we could have died."
Penny,"Well, have fun tonight."
Leonard,"Oh, I will. There is no telling what might happen."
Penny,"Yeah, there is."
Leonard,"You know, thereês nothing wrong helping some womanês kid get through their S.A.T.ês."
Leonard,"Hey, I got to hand it to Raj, he found a really nice spot to have a bachelor party."
Sheldon,Itês not bad. Unless you compare it to a train; then it stinks.
Leonard,Are you drinking whisky?
Sheldon,"Indeed. If Iêm to participate in the social convention that is the stag night, then I must embrace all its components, including tobacco, swear words, and yes, alcohol. Jeepers! Thatês yucky."
Leonard,"Whoa, itês a little early to start dropping J-bombs, donêt you think?"
Leonard,"Oh, hey, Wil. Nice of you to make it out tonight for Howard."
Sheldon,"Iêm confused. I thought since our reconciliation, I was your friend in this group."
Sheldon,Oh. I guess youêre just friends with anybody.  Aagh!
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, no worries."
Leonard,"Oh, all right."
Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
Leonard,"Wow, thatês very nice."
Raj,"Hey, everybody! The bachelor boy has arrived! For heês a jolly good fellowÑ"
Howard,"Actually, Barry, weêre not going to have strippers tonight."
Amy,"This is Maid of Honour Amy Farrah Fowler, bringing you the wedding activities just weeks out from the big day. Letês check in with a beautiful, radiant young woman, and her friend whoês about to get married. Ladies, can you tell us what youêre doing?"
Bernadette,"Um, these are gift bags weêre going to put in the hotel rooms of our out-of-town guests. This is a map of Pasadena. This is a list of local restaurants. And then, for Howieês relatives, we have antihistamines, antacids, and medicine for diarrhoea and constipation."
Penny,"Yeah, we labeled them stop and go."
Amy,"All right, pivoting to the big question. Bernadette, on your wedding night youêll be consummating your marriage. What do you think your first sexual position will be as husband and wife?"
Bernadette,"Amy, please."
Amy,Keeping in mind that whoeverês on top may set the tone for the marriage.
Penny,"Okay, showês over."
Amy,"Hey, they may conceive a child on their wedding night. Donêt you think the kid might get a kick out of knowing how it happened?"
Penny,I donêt care. Ask her things like are you going to take Howardês name? Not whoês going to sit on who?
Bernadette,Iêve actually been thinking Iêm going to hyphenate: Bernadette Mary-Ann Rostenkowski-Wolowitz.
Penny,"Nice. You know, you should totally get BernadetteMaryAnnRostenkowskiWolowitz.com before someone snaps it up."
Bernadette,"Howard already took care of it. Plus, he set up our beautiful wedding website with cute little facts about our family histories. Do you know, for a while in Poland, my family and his family were neighbours."
Penny,"Oh, thatês cool."
Amy,"No, itês not. Iêll explain it to you later."
Raj,"May I have your attention, please? We are hear tonight to celebrate the upcoming nuptials of my best friend Howard Wolowitz."
Sheldon,"And, apparently, Wil Wheatonês best friend."
Sheldon,Talk to the hand.
Raj,Does anyone have any words theyêd like to say about our man of the evening?
Sheldon,"Yeah, I do. . As is the tradition, I have prepared a series of disrespectful jokes which generate humour at Howardês expense. Prepare to have your ribs tickled. Howard, I always thought youêd be the last one of us to ever get married, because you are so short and unappealing. Am I right? Letês see here. Oh, seriously though, Howard, youêre actually one of the most intelligent people I know. And thatês a zinger, because youêre not. Iêve always thought that youêd make someone a fine husband someday. Assuming youêd be able to get the parts, and develop the engineering skills to assemble them, which I donêt see as likely. Hacha! Okay, let me see here. Okay, kidding aside, Howard, you are a good friend. And I wish you nothing but happiness. Bazinga, I donêt!"
Sheldon,Doubleazinga! I do! Good luck following that.
Leonard,"So, Howard Wolowitz tying the knot. Leaving his crazy bachelor days behind. He was a wild one. Well, I guess we all kind of were. I remember this one time, I was with this girl at the beach. We were in the ocean and we started making out. I know, it was crazy. I wasnêt even wearing my Aquasocks. ThenÑ"
Leonard,Right. To Howard.
Leonard,I totally had sex in the ocean.
Raj,"Yeah, to Howard. Um, uh, whoês next?"
Raj,"Hear, hear."
Raj,"Okay, uh, anybody else? Huh? No? Okay, it all comes down to me, the best man. Ooh! This grasshopper is kicking my ass-hopper. Okay, when I first came to this country, I-I didnêt know how to behave or how to dress, or what was cool, I was pretty lonely. But then I met Howard, and suddenly, my life changed, because we could be lonely together. This man became my whole world."
Raj,"Iêm not done, but thank you.  I think back to all the good times we had, like, uh, when we went camping and spent that night telling each other all our secrets. I told him Iêm addicted to pedicures and he told me he lost his virginity to his cousin."
Howard,She was my second cousin.
Sheldon,And the first woman you ever disappointed sexually. Ba-da-bazinga!
Raj,"Oh, oh, yeah, and then there was the time when Leonard and I took Howard to Las Vegas and paid a hooker to pretend she was Jewish and that she wanted his little kosher pickle. Of all the Howard humping hookers stories, that oneês my favourite!"
Howard,"Okay, buddy, thatês it. Sit down."
Raj,"Oh, oh, what about that tubby girl in the Sailor Moon costume at Comic-con?"
Howard,Donêt remember. Please sit down.
Raj,"The only threesome Iêve ever had in my life, and Iêm proud to say it was with this man right here."
Howard,"Oh, please shut up."
Raj,"Oh, oh, donêt get me wrong, nothing happened with me and Howard. There was about 200 pounds of Sailor Moon between us."
Sheldon,"Jeepers, Iêm drunk."
Howard,"Thank you for picking us up. Thereês a warning, right there, on the scotch bottle. You cannot be operatinê heavy machinery after you had a snootful of this, laddie!"
Bernadette,Funny. You boys have a nice time?
Howard,"Yeah, it was great. And low-key, like I promised. No hanky-panky, no strippers. Just the guys telling jokes."
Bernadette,Thatês nice.
Howard,"How about you? Did you have a fun night? Yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this."
Raj,"You know, weêre not that far from my apartment. If you stop the car, I can walk from here."
Bernadette,"You ainêt goinê anywhere, Threeway."
Howard,"Bernadette, listenÑ"
Bernadette,"You lied to me. You said you told me about all the girls youêve been with, but you never mentioned your cousin, the prostitute or Raj!"
Raj,"Seriously, you donêt even have to stop the car. Anything under ten miles an hour and I can combat-roll into the street."
Howard,"Okay, just to set the record straight, I didnêt hire the prostitute, she was a gift from him. Shame on you, Raj. That is not how we treat women in this country."
Bernadette,Donêt you try and blame this on him.
Raj,"Thank you, Bernadette."
Bernadette,"Zip it, pervert!"
Bernadette,I donêt know what Iêm going to do. Iêm supposed to marry Howard in a couple of weeks and Iêm not sure I even know who the man is any more.
Amy,"Iêm curious whatês bothering you most, the borderline incest, the prostitute or group sex with the girl dressed as the childrenês cartoon?"
Penny,"Amy, remember when we went over things that would be helpful and things that wouldnêt?"
Amy,Right. And that wasÑ
Bernadette,"When I first met Howard, he seemed so innocent to me, just a sweet little guy who lives with his mother."
Penny,"Well, if thatês what you like, Iêll take you to the comic book store, the place is full of êem."
Bernadette,Wait a minute. You set me up with Howard. Did you know about all the creepy stuff he was into?
Penny,"Well, a little. You hear stuff."
Bernadette,Why didnêt you tell me
Penny,"Well, I was gonna, but I didnêt think it would go past the first date. Then, when it did, I thought for sure it wouldnêt go past you meeting his mother. Definitely not past the two of you sleeping together. I mean, the warning signs were there, this is really on you."
Bernadette,My God! I thought you were my friend. 
Amy,I donêt think that was helpful.
Howard,"Hi, Bernie, itês me again. Please call me back."
Raj,"Dude, I am so sorry."
Howard,"Itês not your fault, itês mine. I did all that stuff, not you."
Leonard,"Actually, you did do one of them together."
Howard,What is this?
Sheldon,Youêre upset. The convention is to bring an upset person a hot beverage.
Howard,"No, but what is it?"
Sheldon,"Chicken broth. It seemed culturally appropriate. Also, there was a single cube of chicken bouillon in the cupboard when I moved in and itês been bothering me for the last eight years. So, as they say, two birds."
Howard,I donêt know what my next move is.
Leonard,"Well, Howard, I donêt know much about women."
Leonard,"No, uh, that, thatês it. I donêt know much about women. Raj, you got anything?"
Raj,Iêve got the phone number of the tubby girl from Comic-Con.
Howard,Iêm not calling the girl from Comic-con.
Raj,All right. More Sailor Moon for me.
Sheldon,I just threw up the bachelor party.
Penny,"Please come out, Bernadette. Letês talk through this."
Bernadette,"No, leave me alone."
Amy,Perhaps you should give him a taste of his own medicine. Do you have a cousin who you find attractive?
Amy,"Hey, you introduced him to the sleazebag. Iêm just trying to clean up your mess."
Howard,"Oh, hi."
Howard,I need to talk to Bernadette.
Penny,"Well, I donêt think she wants to talk to anyone right now."
Howard,"All right, well, could you at least give her a message?"
Penny,"Yeah, sure, I guess."
Howard,"Tell her Iêm really sorry, and if she doesnêt want to marry me, I get it. But what I really want her to know is the guy that sheês disgusted by, is the guy that Iêm disgusted by, too. But that guy doesnêt exist any more, heês gone, and the reason is because of her. So, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you."
Penny,"Oh, my God, Howard. Thatês the most beautiful thing Iêve ever heard. And it came out of you."
Howard,Penny has a message for you.
Bernadette,"I heard. Your voice, not unlike your motherês, travels through walls."
Howard,Do you want me to go?
Bernadette,Come here. Iêm still really mad at you.
Howard,I get that.
Bernadette,Is there anything else about your past I should know?
Howard,"Couple things, but, you know, most of them happened overseas. Iêll tell you later."
Howard,"So, is the wedding still on?"
Bernadette,"Yeah, the weddingês still on. "
Amy,"Oh, thank God. Iêm still a maid of honour. "
Penny,"Oh, what the hell. "
Amy,This is kind of hot.
Penny,Whatês with the robe?
Leonard,"Iêm gonna have sex with you right here, right now, on that washing machine."
Penny,"No, youêre not."
Leonard,"Come on, please."
Penny,"If you want to do something, you can help me fold this sheet."
Leonard,"Folding a sheet in my underwear, still pretty crazy."
Howard,Howard Wolowitz.
Howard,"Yes, yes, Iêve been doing my push-ups. Iêm still stuck at nine, but thatês going all the way down with no one holding me."
Sheldon,Iêm going to need a larger shirt. This oneês a little tight under the arms.
Leonard,Do you think maybe itês tight because youêre wearing long underwear?
Sheldon,"Yes, of course thatês why itês tight."
Leonard,"All right, let me rephrase the question. Why are you wearing long underwear?"
Sheldon,Youêre kidding. Shouldnêt the question be why arenêt you?
Leonard,"No, it should be: why are you?"
Sheldon,"Leonard, these rental tuxedos have been worn by hundreds of sweaty strangers. I donêt like my own sweat touching my skin, how do you think I feel about theirs?"
Sheldon,Said the hangman offering a noose.
Raj,"Well, that wasnêt as entertaining as when he rents bowling shoes, but it was right up there."
Howard,"Well, thatês it. My orders have been rescinded. I am officially no go to space."
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, Howard, but I got to tell you, Iêm a little relieved youêre not going."
Leonard,"Come on, you were gonna go up in a rocket designed in the 1960s by the Russians."
Howard,"Yeah, so?"
Leonard,"When was the last time you were at Best Buy and you heard someone say, ooh, check out this Blu-ray player, it must be good, it was built in Russiaî?"
Howard,"Well, their technology isnêt that bad."
Raj,"When you come back to Earth in a Soyuz capsule, you free-fall from space at 500 miles per hour, and the only thing that slows you down is a little parachute that pops out right before you crash into the ground. And the whole thing was designed by the same brilliant minds who were unable to capture Rocky and Bullwinkle."
Howard,"All right, well, whatever. I wasnêt worried."
Raj,You werenêt?
Howard,Let me explain the difference between you and me. You watch Star Trek. I live it.
Raj,"Oh, please. I donêt remember the episode of Star Trek where the guy never goes to space and brags about it in a tuxedo store."
Howard,"Make all the jokes you want, but thereês only one of us here brave enough to almost do what I almost did."
Sheldon,"Ah, much better."
Leonard,You must be burning up.
Sheldon,"A little. But not more than your urethras will be after whateverês in those pants swims up them. Well, I cut quite the dashing, yet hygienic figure, donêt I? I look like the Flash about to get married. Oh! A tissue! A tissue! Oh, good Lord!"
Leonard,He keeps emergency Purell in the car.
Sheldon,Keys! Keys! Keys!
Penny,"Hey, you."
Leonard,"Before I come in, you should know, I have gas.  "
Penny,"For the record, not your worst opening line."
Leonard,Check it out. Itês the gas I use in my free-electron laser to support high voltages. But it also has an interesting secondary use. Here. Breathe this in.
Penny,"B-Before I do it, if youêre a cop you have tell me, right?"
Leonard,Just try it.
Penny,"Okay.  Whatês it supposed toÑ Oh, my God, this is so freaky!"
Leonard,Youêre a mean one Mr. Grinch.
Penny,"Okay. Me, me, me. Ready?  Leonard, I am your father."
Leonard,I have never been more attracted to a woman who sounds like a man in my life.
Penny,"Oh, Mm. Hey, you know how weêve been taking things slow?"
Penny,"Well, Iêve been thinking, and maybe Iêm ready to take things a little faster."
Leonard,"Oh, great."
Leonard,"And I promise, after waiting four months, fast is what youêre gonna get."
Penny,"You know, just-just one thing. Look, weêre in a really great place right now, and I donêt want to do anything that will make stuff all weird again."
Leonard,So we wonêt let it get weird.
Penny,"Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up, mm, since the last time you saw me naked, I got a Cookie Monster tattoo. The acceptable responses when you see it are awesome or nothing."
Leonard,What about  Cookies!
Sheldon, Amy?
Amy,"Seven oêclock, right on time."
Sheldon,Itês not an accident. I waited outside your door for twenty minutes.
Amy,"Well, dinnerês almost ready."
Sheldon,"I must say, I was surprised you chose to spend our date night in your apartment. As I mentioned, the Pasadena City Council is debating longer crosswalk times, and later, the LEGO store is having a midnight madness sale. You ask anyone, thatês a hot date."
Amy,"Tempting choices, but I have something special planned for tonight."
Sheldon,What can be more special than having an adequate amount of time to cross the street on your way to buy a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?
Amy,"With our friends moving forward in their relationships, Iêve decided that we should make progress in ours as well."
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord. Two years ago, we didnêt even know each other, and now Iêm in your apartment after dark. How much faster can this thing go?"
Amy,"I had a feeling youêd be reluctant, which is why Iêm going to dip into my neurobiological bag of tricks."
Sheldon,"Oh, you brain monkeys kill me. Dip away."
Amy,I have devised an experiment that I believe will increase your feelings for me in an accelerated time frame.
Sheldon,"And how do you propose to do that? Uh, hope youêre not thinking about some sort of LSD thought control. Because thereês only one mind-expanding drug that this man enjoys, and thatês called school."
Amy,"Human beings form emotional attachments as they grow up. In your case, to your mother, superheroes, et cetera. Iêm going to attempt an experiment that will get you to transfer those feelings to me."
Sheldon,"Well, seems whatês on the menu tonight is malarkey with a big side of poppycock."
Amy,"Weêll see. Letês start with a little romantic dinner music, shall we?"
Sheldon,Super Mario Bros. theme?
Sheldon,"I see what youêre doing. Youêre attempting to build on the work of Ebbinghaus by triggering an involuntary memory of me playing that game, admittedly the happiest 600 hours of my childhood, but it wonêt work."
Amy,Fine. Thereês no reason we still canêt have a lovely dinner. Why donêt you have a seat.
Sheldon,"Da-da-da da-da dum, boink, boink."
Amy,May I offer you something to drink?
Sheldon,You know I donêt drink.
Amy,Not even strawberry Quik?
Sheldon,"I love strawberry Quik. Itês my favourite pink fluid, narrowly beating out Pepto-Bismol."
Amy,"Oh, I know. I think it will go nicely with what I have prepared for dinner."
Sheldon,Spaghetti with little pieces of hot dog cut up in it!
Amy,Just like your mommy used to make.
Sheldon,"Oh yummy, yummy! We should do this more often. Uh-oh."
Leonard,"Iêm sorry. I did, I crossed a line. I didnêt mean to!"
Penny,Who says something like that right in the middle of sex?
Leonard,"I donêt know, it just came out. People say weird things during sex all the time."
Penny,"Okay, well, they sure as hell donêt say that."
Leonard,It was the heat of the moment.
Penny,"No, the heat of the moment is, ooh, yeah, just like that, not will you marry me?"
Leonard,"Iêm sorry. Just, just give me another chance."
Penny,"Why, so you can crawl under the covers and go, hey, baby, want to go look for houses in neighbourhoods with good schools?"
Leonard,"Again, Iêm sorry. You know, with Howard and Bernadette getting married, I got caught up in a little wedding fever. I take it back."
Penny,"You canêt take something like that back. I mean, what are we even supposed to do now?"
Leonard,"Okay, at some point, weêll look back and this is going to be a funny story. Why donêt we just start doing that now?"
Penny,Youêre kidding.
Leonard,"Hey, do you remember that time when I proposed to you in bed? And you were all, like, what are you doing? That was so funny. So funny."
Penny,Itês not funny.
Leonard,Give it a minute. Is that a little smile I see there? I should go.
Howard,"Hey, I was thinking. For our first dance at the wedding, what if we learn the final number from Dirty Dancing?"
Bernadette,Youêre kidding.
Howard,"No, come on. How cool would that be? Me running into your arms, you lifting me up into the air."
Bernadette,"Oh, youêre in a good mood."
Howard,"Yeah, well, why wouldnêt I be? You know, Iêm marrying the girl of my dreams, and I finally got my mother to agree not to come on our honeymoon.  Oh, hang on. Oh, itês NASA. Wolowitz. Oh! Hi, Dave. Whatês up? No kidding. Really? Well, thatês great news. Great, great news. All right, Iêll watch my e-mail for the details. Okay, talk soon."
Bernadette,Whatês so great?
Howard,It looks like Iêm going into space after all.
Bernadette,"Oh, Howie, thatês wonderful!"
Howard,"Uh-huh, wonderful. Yay."
Bernadette,What happened? I thought they cancelled your mission.
Howard,"Th-They did. But NASA really wants my telescope up on the space station, so theyêre putting me on an earlier launch."
Howard,A week from Friday.
Bernadette,Weêre getting married that Sunday.
Howard,"Youêre right. I, I canêt go to space. I have to get married, and no one can say thatês not a good reason. Iêll call him back."
Bernadette,Wait. I donêt want to be the one who stands in your way.
Howard,"Well, too bad, you already did. Itês a done deal. Oh, well. But I forgive you."
Bernadette,"Thatês not how I want to start our marriage, killing your dream. Weêll have the wedding when you get back."
Howard,But what about all the plans and the guests?
Bernadette,Weêll call them. Although my dadês gonna go a little nutso over losing his deposits.
Howard,"Youêre right, he is! Your dadês gonna be furious. Thereês no way heês gonna let us postpone this wedding. Well, we tried."
Bernadette,Iêll talk to him. He wonêt say no to his little girl.
Howard,"I, uh, I should talk to him, man to man."
Bernadette,"But, Howie, my dad can be a bully. Heês gonna make you cancel your space flight."
Howard,We can only hopeÑ that he doesnêt.
Sheldon,"Bishop to queen four, level two. Check."
Leonard,"Sheldon, knight takes bishop. You all right?"
Sheldon,Iêm fine.
Leonard,"Are you? You left your queen exposed from above, you trapped your knight in the corner, and you keep sighing and saying, why me?"
Sheldon,Very well. Can I ask you a question about women?
Leonard,We got you that book last year. Wasnêt everything in there?
Sheldon,"No, Iêm having a relationship problem with Amy. And by the way, that book gave me nightmares."
Leonard,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I screwed things up pretty good with Penny."
Sheldon,"Look at us, Leonard, engaging in the social convention of men bellyaching about their olê ladies."
Leonard,"I guess we are. So, whatês going on?"
Sheldon,"Believe it or not, Amy has embarked on a campaign to increase my feelings for her by making me happy."
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, that must be very difficult for you."
Sheldon,"Itês awful. This morning, she arranged for me to be an Amtrak junior conductor for the day. It, itês usually only open to children. She got them to make an exception."
Leonard,Shame on her.
Sheldon,"They let me blow the whistle, Leonard."
Leonard,Sheês good.
Sheldon,I know. And it gets worse. Her efforts are causing me to have affectionate feelings for her at inappropriate times.
Leonard,"You mean, like in bed or in the shower?"
Sheldon,"No! Would you please stop referencing that infernal book? For example, this morning, I was calculating the random motion of virtual particles in a vacuum, when suddenly the particles morphed into an image of Amyês dandruff gently cascading down onto her pale, slightly hunched shoulders. Oh, what has that vixen done to me, Leonard? And how do I make it stop?"
Leonard,"Well, if you had a physical relationship, Iêd say propose during sex. Turns out thatês a real mood killer."
Sheldon,I assume weêre talking about you now?
Sheldon,"So, thatês how this works? I complain, and then you complain, and no one offers any solutions?"
Leonard,Pretty much.
Sheldon,"Well, no wonder the women are winning."
Howard,"Mr. Rostenkowski, are you busy?"
Howard,"Family pictures, orÑ holy crap, thatês a dead person."
Howard,Iêm not sure.
Howard,"How about that. Anyway, sir, I need to talk to you about something."
Howard,"No, thank you. Iêm allergic."
Howard,From nuts?
Howard,"Nice story. Anyway, the reason I wanted to talk to you is NASA has moved up my launch to the International Space Station."
Howard,"So, the date is going to conflict with me marrying your daughter. Now, I know what youêre going to say, I made a commitment to Bernadette and to your family and Iêve got a hell of a lot of nerve coming in here and demanding that we postpone this thing. Well, message heard and understood. Mission cancelled. Thank you."
Howard,Iêm sorry. May I be excused?
Howard,"Iêm sorry, I didnêt know, is this going toÑ Well, I should sitÑ May I be seatÑ Well, Iêll just sit."
Howard,"Iêm aware of that, sir."
Howard,"Right, right."
Howard,"Oh, I am. And just so you know, Iêd still be an astronaut, even if I didnêt go to space. Iêve got an I.D. Card and a NASA golf shirt."
Howard,But what about the wedding and all the money you put down for the reception?
Howard,"Um, okay."
Howard,"All right, look, Iêm gonna level with you. Iêm terrified about going into space. What if I donêt make it back?"
Howard,You really think so?
Leonard,Hey. Off to work?
Leonard,Have a nice night.
Penny,"Okay, you, too."
Leonard,"Penny, just, wait. Iêve been thinking about what I said when we were in bed the other night."
Penny,"Yeah, Iêve been thinking about it, too."
Leonard,I noticed you never answered me.
Penny,Youêre right.  No.
Leonard,"Uh, follow-up. Are we still dating?"
Leonard,Is it still weird êcause I proposed?
Leonard,I have a couple more quick questions. Do you want to call me from the car?
Leonard,I played that pretty well. 
Amy,"Hello, Leonard."
Leonard,What are you doing?
Amy,Weêre playing doctor. Star Trek style.
Sheldon,"Iêm in hell, Leonard. Donêt stop."
Howard,Hey Mike?
Howard,I changed my mind. I donêt want to do this.
Howard,"Yeah, Iêm a funny guy. I also have a hysterical bit planned for later where I pretend to cry through the whole launch."
Leonard,"Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?"
Sheldon,"289, right between the Game Show Network at 288 and the East coast feed of the Disney Channel on 290."
Amy,"I love his eidetic memory, itês so sexy. Sheldon, what are the ingredients in Pringles?"
Sheldon,"Dried potatoes, vegetable oil, corn flower, wheat starch, maltodextrin, salt, and my favourite ingredient of all, uniformity."
Amy,"The uterus quivers, does it not?"
Leonard,"Thereês Howardês rocket, live from Kazakhstan."
Bernadette,"Oh, God, Iêm so nervous. I donêt think I can watch."
Raj,Youêre nervous? Iêve been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. Iêm wearing my fat pants.
Sheldon,"Remarkable. In just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howardês keister. And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy, has been Tetris and mail-order brides."
Bernadette,Give me those damn Pringles.
Howard,"Good! Good! Oh, quick question, I missed it in the briefing. How much urine do these suits hold?"
Howard,"No, itês êcause I live with my mom and she makes me Froot Loops."
Howard,"Thanks, we decided to do it before the launch."
Howard,"Not exactly. Listen, if you donêt mind, Iêm not really up for chatting. Iêm just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes. That went really quick. Let me try it again."
Howard,Close your eyes. Put out your hand. I got you something special.
Bernadette,"Come on, Howard. Iêm not falling for that again."
Howard,"No, here."
Bernadette,"Oh, Howie. A little star, itês beautiful. Put it on me."
Howard,"Okay, but Iêm going to have to get it back from you so I can take it to the International Space Station. That way, when I come home, you will have a star that was actually in space."
Bernadette,"Oh, my God."
Howard,"Take that, every guy whoês ever bought you anything."
Bernadette,This is the most amazing gift Iêve ever gotten.
Howard,"Really? Well, if you like it that much, then close your eyes and put out your hand."
Howard,"No! When I eat Froot Loops, the other astronauts make fun of me!"
Bernadette,"Howard, I donêt want to wait until youêre back to get married."
Bernadette,I want to be married to you before you get in that rocket.
Howard,But Iêm leaving in two days.
Howard,I donêt need to take cereal.
Howard,They invented blintzes. Iêll be fine.
Bernadette,"Weêll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends, and weêll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back."
Howard,Wow. Okay. Letês get married.
Bernadette,"So anyway, we decided to go down to City Hall this afternoon get married, and then have the reception when Howard gets back."
Leonard,Thatês so great. 
Howard,"I mean, we know itês short notice, but weêd love you all to come with us."
Amy,"No, no, no, this is not the wedding I wanted! I want to wear my maid of honour dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me, while a string quartet plays The Way You Look Tonight."
Bernadette,That wasnêt going to be our processional music.
Amy,"Well, it was going to be mine."
Sheldon,"Thank you for the invitation, but I have to decline because it doesnêt sound like something Iêll enjoy."
Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon, itêll be fun."
Sheldon,Thatês what you said about The Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong.
Bernadette,"So, what do you say, Amy?"
Amy,Can I wear my maid of honour dress?
Bernadette,Seriously? Youêre going to wear that thing to City Hall?
Amy,"Itês all I have left. Youêre going to take that from me, too?"
Penny,"Amy, you look great."
Amy,I know.
Leonard,Whereêd you get a beer?
Raj,"From that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. Beautiful story, theyêre in rival drug gangs, and theyêre getting married. Shh, no one can know."
Amy,"Look at all these people in love. It kind of gets you thinking, doesnêt it?"
Sheldon,"It does, indeed. Leonard, is it awkward being here with Penny given that you recently proposed to her?"
Howard,You proposed to Penny?
Leonard,I donêt want to talk about it.
Raj,Where did he pop the question? What did you say?
Leonard,"She said no, can we drop it now?"
Penny,It wasnêt a real proposal.
Bernadette,Why wasnêt it a real proposal?
Sheldon,He asked her during coitus.
Howard,Did you get down on one knee or were you already there?
Bernadette,"Howard, donêt talk like that on your wedding day."
Howard,"Iêm sorry, MaÑ Bernadette. MaÑ BurnaÑ Youêre ma Bernadette."
Penny,Good move telling Sheldon.
Leonard,I canêt propose? I canêt talk to my friends? Is there anything else Iêm not allowed to do?
Amy,"All right, thatês enough. Today is not about you two. Today is about Howard and Bernadette and me."
Bernadette,"Oh, no."
Howard,"I got this. Excuse me, but is there any way you could squeeze us in? See, Iêm an astronaut and Iêm leaving for Russia on Sunday so I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station."
Bernadette,I canêt believe weêre not going to get married.
Amy,"Excuse me, Iêm going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honour."
Howard,"Uh, shouldnêt you guys be talking about space stuff instead of dogs?"
Howard,"You know, we could always drive to Vegas and get married."
Bernadette,"No, isnêt that kind of tacky?"
Penny,"Hey, I know tons of people who got married in Vegas."
Bernadette,Are any of them still married?
Penny,"Yeah, I mean, not to the same people butÑ"
Bernadette,Thereês got to be some place special we could do it.
Sheldon,"Leonard, where did you envision marrying Penny?"
Leonard,Will you shut up?
Raj,"Well, I know how to make it special."
Howard,I told you we are not recreating the wedding from The Sound of Music.
Raj,"Yes, you made that brutally clear to me. What I was going to suggest is if that youêre willing to wait until Sunday morning, the Google satellite will be over Pasadena. You can have a wedding photograph from space."
Leonard,Thatês so cool.
Howard,"Oh, wait to go, Raj."
Raj,"I keep telling you, if I wasnêt an astrophysicist, I would have been a party planner. It was always a coin flip."
Howard,"Okay, so we know weêre going to do it Sunday morning. Now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us."
Leonard,How about our roof?
Bernadette,"Oh, I like that."
Howard,Thatês great.
Amy,"Oh, my gosh. I canêt believe my maid of honour dress is going to be on Google Earth."
Howard,"So, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out whoês going to do the ceremony."
Penny,"Well, thatês easy. Anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister. I know a piercing parlour where, for a hundred bucks theyêll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want."
Bernadette,"Great, well, whoês it going to be?"
Sheldon,"Iêll do it, provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon."
Sheldon,What do you see in her?
Howard,Leaking? Whatês leaking?
Howard,Thereês fuel leaking and weêre still going to go?
Howard,What happens on the tenth time?
Howard,"Hey, guys, before I forget, I got you a little groomsman present."
Raj,"Oh, thanks, man."
Sheldon,You didnêt have to do that.
Howard,"Fantastic Four, annual number three from 1965, in mint condition. The one where Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl get married."
Leonard,"Oh, wow."
Sheldon,"Oh, dear. I was afraid of this."
Sheldon,"While a thoughtful gift, this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars."
Howard,"Yeah, so?"
Sheldon,"I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. Which places me in your debt and I canêt be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move, or to kill a man."
Leonard,I doubt heêll ask you to kill a man.
Sheldon,"Well, what if itês his only way out? I canêt risk it. Here is twelve dollars. Now, weêre even. Wait, wait, wait, I bought a card. Give me two dollars. And for the record, this is why I hate gift-giving."
Amy,Who is it?
Howard,Itês the groom.
Amy,Canêt come in. Bad luck to see the bride.
Howard,"Okay, uh, fine. Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother. Iêll be right back."
Bernadette,Why canêt she drive herself?
Howard,She doesnêt want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so Iêm going to lay her down in the back of my neighbourês van.
Bernadette,"All right, just hurry!"
Howard,"Okay, Iêll see you later, MaÑ uhÑ lovely bride-to-be. I really got to watch that."
Leonard,"Come on, Raj, weêre ready to start."
Raj,"weêre ready when I say weêre ready. Uh-du-du-du, ooh, okay, now weêre ready."
Howard,"Ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?"
Howard,Youêll fall through the roof before you fall off it.
Raj,Penny.  
Bernadette,"Not now, Dad."
Bernadette,"Here you go? What am I, a football?"
Raj,"Howard and Bernadette, the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers."
Bernadette,"They all got ordained, theyêre all marrying us, itês adorable, if you want to hear come closer."
Raj,"Guys, when I look at the two of you starting your lives together, it fills my heart, It fills my, heart, okay, Iêm going to need a minute."
Penny,"Okay, Iêll, Iêll go. Howard and Bernadette, I know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding, but when youêre in love, it doesnêt matter where or how these things happen. It just matters that you have each other."
Sheldon,I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom.
Penny,"Oh, grow up."
Leonard,"Hey, I didnêt say it."
Amy,"All right, thatês enough from the both of you."
Penny,"Well, he started it."
Amy,"Well, Iêm ending it. Bernadette, I want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honour. I also want you to know, that I will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out."
Leonard,"Thank you, Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And thatês the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. Qualities that are hard to find in people these days."
Sheldon,"Would you like some aloe vera? You just got burned. All right, my turn. Howard, Bernadette. Daq tuê taH Daq yIn tlhej ghajtaH."
Bernadette,Sheldon! I told you no Klingon.
Sheldon,"Fine, Iêll do it in English, but it loses something. The need to find another human being to share oneês life with has always puzzled me. Maybe because Iêm so interesting all by myself. With that being said, may you find as much happiness with each other as I find on my own. The Klingon would have made you cry."
Raj,I believe you two have prepared vows?
Bernadette,"Howard Joel Wolowitz, like you, this is going to be short and sweet. I love you with all my heart and soul and promise to be with you forever."
Howard,Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski.
Howard,"Hey, from now on, sheês the only women who can yell at me! Until I met you, I couldnêt imagine spending my life with just one person. And now I canêt imagine spending one day of it without you."
Sheldon,And the Klingon High CouncilÑ
Howard,I have strongly mixed feelings.
Bernadette,"Oh, my God, itês happening."
Penny,Did I miss it?
Leonard,"No, come on in. Hurry."
Bernadette,I love that man.
Raj,"Me, too."
Penny,"I canêt believe it. This whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying."
Leonard,This is it.
Sheldon,"Boldly go, Howard Wolowitz."
Howard,Oy vay!
Leonard,"Mm-hmm, International Space Station. 250 miles that way."
Raj,"Right now, Howardês staring down at our planet like a tiny Jewish Greek god. Zeusowitz."
Sheldon,"I must admit, I canêt help but feel a twinge of envy. He can look out the window and see the majesty of the universe unfolding before his eyes. His dim, uncomprehending eyes. Itês like a cat in an airport carrying case."
Leonard,"You know, itês not exactly glamorous up there. The water that the astronauts drink is made from each otherês recycled urine."
Raj,I wonder what heês doing right this very second.
Leonard,"Mm, conducting experiments in zero gravity."
Raj,Peering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos.
Sheldon,"Whatever it is, we know his life will never be the same."
Howard,"I can hear you without the phone,"
Howard,"Iêm excited to talk to you, too."
Howard,How about calling her my wife?
Howard,They do. Thatês why we marry them.
Howard,"Ma, please. Everyone from NASA is listening to this phone call."
Howard,"Okay, Ma, great talking to you. Gotta go. Well, space is ruined."
Amy,"This is so exciting. Soon, my upper lip will be the same fake blonde as my beautiful best friend."
Penny,"Hey, this is my natural hair colour. Now. So, does Sheldon have anything special planned for you tomorrow night?"
Amy,"Oh, yes. According to the Relationship Agreement, on the anniversary of our first date, he must take me to a nice dinner, ask about my day and engage in casual physical contact that a disinterested onlooker might mistake for intimacy."
Penny,Thatês hot. You kids better use protection.
Amy,How long does this stay on?
Penny,Just a couple of minutes. Youêve really never done this before?
Amy,"Once in high school, but I dozed off and woke up with second-degree chemical burns on my face."
Penny,"Oh, my gosh, thatês awful. The other kids make fun of you?"
Amy,"No, I had a cover story, I told everyone it was herpes. So, howês everything going with you and Leonard?"
Penny,"Uh, I donêt know, itês still kind of weird. We havenêt really recovered since he proposed to me in the middle of sex."
Amy,"Oh, boo-hoo. If Sheldon proposed to me during sex, my ovaries would grab on to him and never let go."
Sheldon,"Leonard, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?"
Leonard,"Interesting question. On the one hand, I always thoughtÑ"
Sheldon,"You donêt even know what it is, do you? The anthropic principle states that if we wish to explain why our universe exists the way it does, the answer is that it must have qualities that allow intelligent creatures to arise who are capable of asking the question. As I am doing so eloquently right now."
Leonard,I know what the anthropic principle is.
Sheldon,"Of course. I just explained it to you. Now, where do you stand on it?"
Leonard,Where do you stand on it? 
Sheldon,Strongly pro.
Leonard,"Then I believe that God created the world in six days, and on the seventh he made you to annoy me."
Raj,"Hey, guys."
Sheldon,"Yeah, wait, Raj, where do you stand on the anthropic principle?"
Raj,Iêm all for it.
Leonard,"Well, hang on. Why do you believe that he knows what it is and I donêt?"
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard. Letês not take a saw to the branch weêre sitting on, shall we?"
Raj,"Hey, uh, if you guys are free tonight, I heard about a spa where you soak your feet n a pool full of little fish that eat all the dead skin right off them. I donêt need to tell you in Los Angeles, sandal season is year round."
Leonard,"Actually, Iêm hanging out with Penny. "
Raj,"Oh, okay. Sounds like itês me and you, Sheldon. How about we sic some guppies on those puppies?"
Sheldon,"As Iêve stated before on numerous occasions, the only sea creature I would even consider being eaten by is the Kraken, because the last words I would hear are _Release the Kraken.î That never gets old. _Release the Kraken!î Oh, chills. Besides, Iêm having dinner with Amy."
Raj,"Oh, okay. Iêll just go home and be alone. Which is cool. I eat alone, I sleep alone, I cry alone, so, cool."
Sheldon,"Darn. If you werenêt busy, Iêd ask you to join us."
Raj,Really? I can come? Thanks.
Leonard,"Sheldon, are you sure you want to be bringing Raj on your date night with Amy?"
Sheldon,"Oh, absolutely. I have a contractual obligation to provide Amy with conversation and casual physical contact, but nowhere is it specified that I canêt outsource that to an Indian."
Bernadette,Howie? Howie?
Howard,"Hey, thereês my beautiful bride. Can you see me?"
Bernadette,I can. How are you?
Howard,"Iêm amazing. I mean, this is even better than I dreamed. I look out the window, and itês all so unbelievable."
Bernadette,Good for you. I just had a seemingly endless dinner with your mom.
Howard,"Oh, yeah? Thatês nice."
Bernadette,It was. Until I found out you never told her weêre not gonna live with her. Letês talk about that for a minute.
Howard,"Hey, look, this pen is floating. How crazy is that?"
Bernadette,"You said you told her, but you never did!"
Howard,"Okay, okay, I know youêre upset, but let me share something Iêve learned since I got here. You realize how small your problems are when youêre looking down on them from space. Now, come on, thatês got to make you feel better."
Bernadette,How clear is the image of me on that screen?
Howard,Pretty clear.
Bernadette,Do I look like I feel better?
Howard,"I mean, itês not, like, HD quality."
Bernadette,"Listen, mister, youêre gonna talk to your mother and youêre gonna fix this, or that thing I said I was gonna do to you the minute you got home, you can do to yourself."
Amy,"Sheldon, this place is so romantic. "
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm glad you like it. Raj picked it out."
Amy,"Well, when you see him, tell him I say thank you."
Sheldon,Tell him yourself.
Raj,Yoo-hoo! Over here!
Amy,I donêt understand. Whatês he doing here?
Sheldon,I invited him.
Amy,"On our date? Sheldon, thatês not okay."
Sheldon,"Yes, it is. Thereês a loophole in the Relationship Agreement."
Amy,You found a loophole?
Raj,Sorry I started without you. Iêm a little nervous. Itês been a long time since Iêve been on a date.
Amy,I canêt believe I bleached my moustache for this.
Raj,You should go to my girl. Sheêll knock out those sideburns for free.
Raj,"You know, Amy, I donêt even think you and I have had a real conversation. Letês use tonight to get to know each other a little better. You start."
Amy,Go home.
Raj,I donêt understand.
Amy,"Sheldon, how could you do this? Itês our second anniversary."
Raj,"Itês your anniversary? Oh, my God, I had no idea. Amy, please, let me make this right. "
Amy,Thank you.
Raj,"My pleasure. Waiter? A bottle of champagne and three glasses. Oh, boy, isnêt this romantic?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I hope thatês a rhetorical question, because I have no clue."
Penny,This is great. Whatês the occasion?
Leonard,"No occasion. You know, things have been a little weird between us, so I wanted to throw together a fun night just for you."
Penny,That is so sweet.
Leonard,"I got all your favourites. Beer, wings, sliders. We can watch the football game. I even painted my stomach."
Penny,Go Sports?
Leonard,"Well, in case you were in the mood for baseball, I didnêt want to look ridiculous."
Penny,This is awesome. I love it!
Leonard,"Good, Iêm glad. "
Penny,"Gosh, I worked my ass off today. This is exactly what I needed."
Leonard,Great. Just relax and enjoy. Tonight is all about you.
Penny,"Ah, thank you!"
Leonard,"So, where exactly are we in this relationship?"
Penny,"Oh, come on. I just told you I had a hard day."
Leonard,"Youêre right, Iêm sorry. Letês watch the game. "
Leonard,"I just know the longer we wait to talk about it, the weirder it gets."
Penny,"Sweetie, can I just be the girl tonight?"
Leonard,"Absolutely. Youêre the girl, Iêm the guy. Now, you watch your football game while I make you a little plate here."
Penny,Thank you. 
Leonard,"Oh, Iêll get it. Go sports."
Leonard,What are you doing here? I thought you were out with Sheldon and Amy.
Raj,"I was, but itês their anniversary and I didnêt want to be a third wheel, so I figured Iêd come over here and hang out with you and Penny on your date."
Leonard,"Well, itês not really a great time. Penny and I have some things we need to talk about."
Penny,"No, we donêt! Come on in!"
Leonard,I canêt believe I shaved my stomach for this.
Howard,Who is it?
Howard,"Hey, Ma. You know, we could see each other if you turn on the computer."
Howard,You canêt catch a computer virus.
Howard,"What do you want, Ma?"
Howard,"Okay, here it is. Bernadette and I are starting a life together andÑ"
Howard,Itês not definite. Iêll talk to Bernadette.
Howard,"Stop it, Ma. Iêm sure I can get Bernie to come around."
Howard,"Okay, okay."
Howard,"Now, can we please change the subject?"
Raj,"You know, Iêm growing to like American football. "
Penny,"Yeah, itês fun, isnêt it?"
Raj,"Well, itês not the balls-to-the-wall action of badminton or cricket, but hey, what is?"
Penny,"All right, whoês ready for another beer?"
Leonard,Iêm good.
Raj,"No, thank you."
Raj,"Oh, Iêm having the nicest time. You guys are like family to me. You know that, right?"
Leonard,Thatês great. Get out.
Raj,Why?
Leonard,Penny and I have some issues we need to talk about.
Raj,"Oh pish on your issues. You guys are fine. Yes, you hit some bumps along the way. I mean, Penny, youêve always known how this man has felt about you, but you made him grovel for affection."
Penny,"Okay, hold onÑ"
Raj,"Now, donêt blame yourself. He was a groveller from way back. But the point is, the two of you got past it. And, Leonard, you go and propose to this poor girl in the middle of sex? That was some weak tea, dude."
Leonard,Some people might say it was romantic.
Raj,"Yeah, no. But yet, here you two are, still together. And thatês even after you and I had our crazy naked night."
Penny,Thatês enough.
Raj,"Iêm just saying that after everything youêve been through, you get to look into each otherês eyes and say _I love you.î And thatês beautiful."
Leonard,"Actually, to this day, sheês never really said it."
Raj,"Oh, Penny. Thatês ridiculous. You know you love him. You, you look him in the eyes and you say it. "
Raj,"Oh come on, you know you want to say it. Say it. Say you love him. Say it!"
Raj,I really thought she would say it.
Amy,Have I ever told you youêre like a sexy praying mantis? 
Sheldon,Every time you drink alcohol.
Amy,You know whatês wonderful about the praying mantis? They devour their mate.
Sheldon,Your point being?
Amy,Dessert is served.
Sheldon,I just had cobbler.
Amy,You know what? Iêm done with this.
Sheldon,W-Where are you going?
Amy,Iêm leaving.
Sheldon,You canêt leave. I need you.
Amy,You do?
Sheldon,Yes. Youêre my ride.
Amy,"Sheldon, you either say something meaningful and from the heart, or you and I are done."
Sheldon,"All right. Please. Amy, when I look in your eyes and youêre looking back in mine, everything feels not quite normal, because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time. I feel excited and, at the same time, terrified. The truth is, I donêt know what I feel, except I know what kind of man I want to be."
Amy,"Sheldon, that was beautiful."
Sheldon,I should hope so. Thatês from the first Spider-Man movie.
Amy,Iêll take it.
Sheldon,"Good. Now, I assume weêre splitting the cheque?"
Raj,"Hey, Stuart."
Raj,"Oh, Iêm sorry. Iêll leave."
Raj,You sure?
Raj,All right. Great.
Raj,What are you drinking?
Raj,Perfect for the night Iêm having. Thank you.
Raj,Amen to that. Sometimes I pour a little chardonnay into my dogês water bowl.
Raj,"Sheês kind of a mean drunk, but what are you gonna do?"
Raj,Sure. Mmm. Bossa nova. You listen to that with your hips as well as your ears.
Raj,Oh. Something about latin music just makes me feel like Iêm on a white sand beach in Rio.
Raj,I should go.
Raj,"Uh, thank you for the drink."
Raj,"Hey, Stuart."
Raj,"Do you want to hang out tomorrow night, maybe grab a bite to eat or catch a late movie?"
Raj,No problem. My treat. Iêll swing by after work.
Bernadette,"Aw, thatês such good news, Howie. Thank you for telling her."
Howard,"Hey, Iêm a grown man. Iêm gonna live with my wife. My motherês just gonna have to learn to make do on her own."
Bernadette,Was she upset?
Howard,Who can tell? She yells everything. She might have been upset. She might have been hungry.
Bernadette,Thanks for fixing it. I love you.
Howard,"I love you, too. Sweet dreams. Iêll talk to you tomorrow?"
Bernadette,"Good night, Rocket Man."
Howard,"To infinity and beyond, baby."
Howard,I know.
Howard,"Oh, Iêm never going back."
Bernadette,And the next wedding gift is a gravy boat.
Penny,"Ooh, one gravy boat."
Amy,Thatês from Sheldon. He told me he had it engraved.
Bernadette,"In the event of a divorce, please return to Sheldon Cooper."
Penny,"One inappropriate, yet I wish I thought of that gravy boat."
Amy,When I get married Iêm going to register at the UCLA Cadaver Lab.
Penny,"Ew, why?"
Amy,‚Cause Iêve always wanted a whole human skeleton and they are really spendy.
Bernadette,"So, you actually see you and Sheldon getting married someday?"
Amy,Not just someday. In exactly four years. But donêt tell Sheldon. Heês still a flight risk.
Bernadette,"What about you, Penny?"
Penny,What about me what?
Bernadette,Do you think you and Leonard might ever get married?
Penny,"Oh, well, you know, Leonard is great."
Bernadette,But do you think youêll ever get married?
Penny,Heês a sweetie.
Amy,Youêre not answering the question. Do you love him?
Penny,"Yeah, sure, of course I love him."
Bernadette,It doesnêt sound like it.
Penny,"Well, I do."
Bernadette,Do you tell him that?
Penny,"No, heêd just take it the wrong way."
Amy,What does that mean?
Penny,It means he is special and smart and nice andÑ
Bernadette,Are you gonna break up with him?
Penny,Maybe. I donêt know.
Bernadette,I had no idea you were unhappy.
Penny,"Thatês the thing, Iêm not. Iêm not unhappy at all. Itês just, I donêt know, I, Iêve been in love before, but it felt different. But maybe this is a new, better, boring kind of love. Do you ever feel that way about Howard?"
Bernadette,"Oh, thatês not really a fair comparison. Iêm basically married to a sexy Buzz Lightyear."
Penny,"Amy, you?"
Amy,"Canêt help ya, kid. Whenever Iêm around Sheldon, I feel like my loins are on fire. In the good way. Not the urinary tract infection way."
Raj,"Hey, buddy, howês it going up there?"
Howard,"You donêt have to shout, Raj. Itês not like Iêm an astronaut floating around in outer space. Oh, wait, I am."
Leonard,"So, is it everything you hoped it would be?"
Howard,Itês better. I wake up every morning and I just canêt believe Iêm on this incredible adventure.
Howard,Excuse me. Iêm talking to my friends.
Howard,"Funny. Weêre always giving each other a hard time up here. Itês kind of like being in a frat. You know, joking, kidding around, hurting feelings."
Sheldon,"Okay, my turn. Let me talk to him."
Leonard,Go ahead.
Sheldon,"2311 North Los Robles Avenue, Pasadena, California to International Space Station. Can you read me? Over. "
Howard,"Yes, I read you, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Copy that. Over. 
Leonard,What are you doing?
Sheldon,I am talking to a man in space. If you donêt have the  then he might as well be at the Coffee Bean over on Lake Street.
Howard,"Youêre out of your mind,Sheldon."
Sheldon,Thatês a negative. My mother had me tested. Over. 
Howard,"All right, all right. I gotta go. Thereês a meteor shower."
Sheldon,Over and out. 
Raj,"Bye, buddy!"
Raj,"Hey, Stuart, come on in."
Sheldon,What are you doing here?
Sheldon,Excuse me. I didnêt authorize this.
Leonard,"Sheldon, you are not in charge."
Sheldon,Thatês mighty sassy for a man with a roommate performance review around the corner.
Raj,Whatês the big deal? You guys are bringing your girlfriends. I didnêt want to sit by myself.
Sheldon,"The big deal is I was expecting us to be an intimate group of five. Now, weêre going to be a faceless mass of six."
Leonard,"Itêll be fine. Just, uh, pretend heês Wolowitz."
Sheldon,Hmm. Do you like Raisinets?
Sheldon,"At the movies, Wolowitz always eats Raisinets."
Sheldon,"Well, itês hardly my business what you eat, as long as it doesnêt crunch during the film and itês Raisinets."
Sheldon,"Yuh-uh, one more question, if youêre going to replace Wolowitz, I need to know a little more about you."
Sheldon,Wolowitz went to MIT. Whatês your educational background?
Sheldon,Equally ridiculous. Letês go.
Sheldon,This insistence on hand-holding is preposterous.
Amy,"Well, I like it."
Sheldon,"Yeah, of course you do. Youêre a girl. You like all kinds of hippy-dippy things."
Amy,Just watch the movie.
Sheldon,Itês not fair. Penny isnêt making Leonard hold hands.
Amy,There might be a reason for that.
Sheldon,Sweaty? Unhygienic? Looks dumb? Take your pick.
Amy,Penny said sheês not sure she wants to be Leonardês girlfriend anymore.
Sheldon,Wrong. She just took a sip from his Diet Dr. Pepper.
Sheldon,"So, if she wants to end her pair-bond with Leonard, why on earth would she guzzle a witchesê brew of his soda and spit?"
Amy,Itês complicated.
Sheldon,"String theory is complicated. Thatês just yucky. Donêt get any ideas. All right, for the sake of argument, letês say thatês true. Why doesnêt Penny just end the relationship?"
Amy,Sheês not sure how she feels.
Sheldon,"How can she not be sure how she feels? You know, when I have a feeling, I know it. Trains? Love them. Swordfish? I love them, too. Theyêre fish with a sword for a nose."
Amy,"Regardless, donêt say anything to Leonard."
Sheldon,"Now youêre asking me to keep a secret from my best friend, colleague, and roommate?"
Amy,"Yes, please, Penny will kill me."
Sheldon,"Uh, fine. FYI, secret-keeping? Hate it. Hand-holding? Not a fan. Hammerhead shark? I love that thing. Yeah, itês another fish with a tool on its head."
Sheldon,"Shh, weêre trying to watch the movie. This is not working out with him."
Leonard,What are you doing?
Sheldon,I think I might have tartar buildup. My tongue wonêt go as far forward as it used to.
Leonard,Maybe your tongue is shrinking.
Sheldon,"Nope. Oh, you have no idea how annoying this is."
Leonard,Iêm starting to get a sense of it. Donêt worry. Iêll take you to the dentist tomorrow.
Sheldon,"Thank you. I appreciate that. Youêre good people, Leonard. Thereês something I need to tell you."
Sheldon,I canêt tell you.
Sheldon,I canêt tell you why I canêt tell you. So I guess thereês two things I canêt tell you.
Leonard,I wish there were more.
Sheldon,Good night. Iêm sorry. This is really important.
Leonard,What is it?
Sheldon,I like The Transformers. Do you like The Transformers?
Leonard,Where exactly did your mother have you tested?
Sheldon,"Leonard, the Transformers teach us that things are not always what they appear to be. You know, like, uh, a semi truck might be an alien robot, or, uh, someone in a romantic relationship, uh, might feel differently than they appear to. Or a conversation about The Transformers might actually be about someone in this room. Iêm going to pause to let that sink in."
Leonard,"Okay, I think I understand."
Sheldon,You do?
Leonard,"The guy who seems like an emotionless robot is you, but your relationship with Amy is causing you to transform into a red-blooded man with sexual desires."
Sheldon,That is literally the stupidest thing Iêve ever heard.
Sheldon, Leonard?
Sheldon,Are you sleeping?
Leonard,I was. Now Iêm having a nightmare. What do you want?
Sheldon,Never mind. I still canêt tell you.
Penny,"Oh, my God. Sheldon?"
Sheldon,You frightened me.
Penny,What are you doing in my bedroom?
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, I knocked on the front door, but you didnêt hear it."
Penny,"How did you even get in, you weirdo?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, really? Iêve seen strange men traipsing in and out of here for years, but when I do it, itês weird?"
Penny,"What do you want, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I was having a little trouble sleeping and I just thought, uh, seeing as youêre up, we could talk."
Penny,Talk about what?
Sheldon,"Oh, I donêt know, uh, weather, uh, fish you could do carpentry with, why Leonard is such an attractive and desirable boyfriend. Yeah, pick one, your choice."
Sheldon,Did you know that Leonard has a perfect driving record and enjoys the insurance discounts that go along with that? Hubba-hubba.
Penny,"Okay, go home, crazy man."
Sheldon,"Yeah. Did you know that while Leonard is not considered a tall fellow in our country, in todayês North Korea, heês downright average. Hey, talk about a keeper."
Penny,"Okay, what did Amy tell you?"
Sheldon,"Oh, very well. I canêt keep up this clever charade any longer. She told me that you were thinking of ending it with Leonard."
Penny,"Okay, you listen to me. I think itês really sweet youêre trying to protect your friend, but this is none of your business. Got it?"
Sheldon,Excuse me. This is not about protecting my friend. Iêm a big fan of homeostasis. Do you know what that is?
Penny,Of course not.
Sheldon,Homeostasis refers to a systemês ability to regulate its internal environment and maintain a constant condition of properties like temperature or pH.
Penny,Worst bedtime story ever.
Sheldon,"My point is I donêt like when things change. So, regardless of your feelings, I would like you to continue dating Leonard. And also, while weêre on the subject, you recently changed your shampoo. Iêm not comfortable with the new scent. Please stop this madness and go back to green apple."
Penny,"Okay, honey, I have a lot to figure out, and until I do, you are not to say a word to Leonard. Do you understand?"
Sheldon,I do. You clear on the shampoo issue?
Penny,Get out.
Sheldon,Please donêt hurt my friend.
Penny,That is the last thing I want to do.
Sheldon,Thank you. Coconut? What were you thinking? Are you a hula girl?
Penny,Get out.
Penny,What the hell is wrong with you? You told Sheldon? Do you know what a terrible position this puts me in? 
Amy,"Hang on, please. Hello?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, just a heads-up: Penny knows that you blabbed about Leonard. Sheês pretty mad."
Amy,I know. Sheês yelling at me right now.
Sheldon,"All right then, so weêre all on the same page. Yes."
Howard,"Hey, Bernie."
Bernadette,Thereês my hubby. Howês everything going up there?
Howard,"Oh, itês okay. Space is beautiful. Earth is beautiful. Same old, same old."
Bernadette,Whatês wrong?
Howard,Nothing. Everythingês fine.
Howard,The other astronauts are being mean to me.
Bernadette,"No, what are they doing?"
Howard,"Well, like for instance, the other day when I was asleep, one of the guys went on a space walk and glued a big-eyed rubber alien mask to the outside of my window. When I woke up, I screamed for like nine minutes."
Bernadette,"Oh, Howie."
Howard,You can see it if you want. Itês on YouTube. Google astronaut screams for nine minutes.
Bernadette,Why donêt you stand up to them?
Howard,What am I supposed to say?
Bernadette,"I donêt know. Say, being mean is lame, whatês cool is being nice."
Howard,"Great, Iêll do that when I want to be the first guy in space to get a wedgie."
Bernadette,Do you want me to call somebody at NASA?
Howard,My mom already tried that. It only made things worse.
Leonard,Gelatinous Sphere.
Raj,Focused Locust.
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. Wolowitz would never play that card.
Sheldon,"Fairy God Monster, I win. Your desperate need for friendship makes you weak."
Raj,"So, what are you guys doing later? Stuart and I were thinking of going out for a drink."
Raj,‚Cause thatês what we do.
Raj,"In case you didnêt follow that, Iêm the coffee."
Sheldon,Leonard? Maybe youêd like to go with them to meet girls.
Leonard,Why would I be interested? I have Penny.
Sheldon,"Yeah, for now. But that woman has a death wish, Leonard. She talks to strangers, she pets unfamiliar dogs, and it is ridiculously easy to break into her apartment. If I were you, Iêd get a back-up."
Leonard,You canêt just replace someone you care about with some other random person.
Sheldon,Do you remember how upset I was when they replaced Edward Norton as the Hulk?
Leonard,"Yes, you walked around for a week saying, Sheldon unhappy with casting choice."
Sheldon,"But, then Mark Ruffalo was the Hulk in The Avengers, and he was even better."
Leonard,Whatês your point?
Sheldon,Call me a romantic. I like to think that your Mark Ruffalo is still out there somewhere.
Leonard,This is ridiculous. Are we gonna play cards or not?
Sheldon,"Yeah, settle down there, fake Wolowitz. No one likes a kiss-up."
Leonard,"So, I had to take Sheldon to the dentist this morning."
Leonard,"Yup. I told him if he didnêt bite the hygienist, Iêd take him for ice cream."
Leonard,I didnêt have to take him for ice cream.
Leonard,You okay? You seem a little distracted.
Penny,"Look, thereês something I need to tell you."
Leonard,"Oh. Yeah, okay."
Penny,I donêt really know how to say this.
Leonard,Just say it.
Penny,Okay. Here goes.
Amy,You slept with him?
Penny,"I didnêt know what else to do. He had those big, sad eyes."
Bernadette,"Oh, sure, you had no choice."
Penny,He looked at me like this.
Amy,"Well, if thatês all it takes, itês a good thing you donêt have a dog."
Bernadette,"Donêt worry. Youêll have plenty of chances to break up with him. Your wedding day, your honeymoon, your 50th anniversary."
Penny,"Look, itês fine. Weêre not getting married, okay? Weêre keeping things, you know, homeostasis."
Amy,Itês so cute when she tries.
Howard,"Hey, Bernie, guess what? I stood up to the other astronauts like you said and I got to tell you, last night was the first time in a week I got a good nightês sleep. "
Bernadette,"Oh, Howie."
Howard,Whatês wrong? You look upset.
Bernadette,"Nope, this is my proud face."
Howard,"Hey, Bernie."
Bernadette,"Hey, howês my little astronautie hottie?"
Howard,"Okay, I guess. Itês just, being cooped up in this tin can for weeks on end is starting to get to me."
Bernadette,"Well, hang in there. You just have a couple more days to go, and then youêll be home."
Howard,I know.
Bernadette,I got to get back to work. I love you.
Howard,"Love you too. Hey, Bernie? Before you go, can you do something for me?"
Bernadette,What do you want me to do?
Howard,"Okay, here it is. I really miss gravity. Can you drop something so I can watch it fall?"
Bernadette,"Really, youêre serious? Okay. "
Howard,"Oh, baby, youêre killing me."
Penny,"Ugh. Hey, Sheldon? Hi. This came for you today. Itês from your mom."
Sheldon,"Oh, thank you, Penny."
Sheldon,"Yeah, wait, here. For your troubles."
Penny,"Oh, boy, a whole dollar. Now, I can quit my paper route. So, whatês in it?"
Leonard,"Mmm, doesnêt matter. Half the time, he just ends up playing with the box."
Sheldon,"Yeah, itês journals and research papers I wrote as a child."
Penny,"Aw, how cute. Is this like a diary?"
Sheldon,"No, thatês my potty training journal."
Penny,"Really, your potty training journal?"
Sheldon,Yeah. And forgive my crude penmanship. I didnêt start typing until I was six.
Penny,"August 7, 8:42 a.m. This is humiliating. What was wrong with diapers?"
Sheldon,"There are some charts in the back where I kept track of shape, colour and consistency."
Penny,"Oh, disgusting."
Leonard,"No, whatês disgusting is heês still keeping track."
Penny,Why do you need all this stuff?
Leonard,"No, no, no, no."
Sheldon,I am glad you asked. Are you familiar with the Higgs boson?
Penny,"Of course, it is, itês been in the news. And itês a very famous boson."
Sheldon,"Nice try. Now, in 1964, Dr. Peter Higgs, accomplished self-promoter and physicist, he wrote a paper postulating the existence of a subatomic particle called the Higgs boson. Now, initially the paper was rejected, but recently, he was proven right, and now heês on the fast track to win a Nobel prize."
Penny,"Yeah, thatês basically what I said."
Sheldon,"Yeah, the point is Higgs is being celebrated for work he did 50 years ago, so that got me thinking, perhaps Iêve already hit upon the idea that will win me my Nobel prize."
Leonard,I didnêt know they gave Nobel prizes for making boom-boom in the potty.
Penny,You really think thereês some kind of scientific discovery in here?
Sheldon,"Well, this box only covers my work through nursery school. Thereês a good deal more to come. I didnêt really hit my academic stride until I cut out that time-suck known as playing outdoors."
Leonard,"So, youêre going to spend hours and hours combing through all this stuff?"
Sheldon,"Thatês a good point. My time is much too valuable. You know, perhaps I should find someone to do it for me. You know, someone with a rudimentary understanding of science, but whose real talents lie in menial labour."
Leonard,Not gonna happen.
Sheldon,"Well, if I didnêt think you could handle it, I wouldnêt be asking."
Leonard,"If you want help, just hire a grad student."
Penny,Maybe I could do it.
Sheldon,"You, really? You can assess the quality of my work? Okay, um, here. I wrote this when I was five years old."
Penny,"A proof that algebraic topology can never have a non self-contradictory set of abelion groups. Iêm just a blonde monkey to you, arenêt I?"
Sheldon,"You said it, not me."
Sheldon,"All right, Ms. Jenson. Uh, before we begin, may I offer you a refreshment? Water, coffee, tea, a marijuana cigarette?"
Sheldon,"Now, are you sure? Everyoneês smoking them. I think theyêre the best."
Sheldon,"Excellent, yeah. That was a ruse. Theyêre not the best. Physics is the best. And by the way, coffee was also an unacceptable choice. All right, so I see here youêre from Des Moines, Iowa. Uh, youêre summa cum laude in theoretical physics from Stanford University. Oh, and two years ago, you had a persistent ear infection. I hope that didnêt cause any hearing loss."
Sheldon,"I did a comprehensive background check. Medical records, credit reports, criminal history.   I trust you paid off those parking tickets."
Sheldon,"Hearing unimpaired, good."
Sheldon,"Flattery will not get you this job, Ms. Jenson."
Sheldon,"Oh, well, thank you. Welcome aboard."
Leonard,You talk to Howard lately?
Raj,"Uh, yeah, last night. He kept making me drop pencils for him. I got uncomfortable.   che-ee-ee-ese."
Leonard,Smooth. Hi.
Leonard,"Sheldon, arenêt you going to introduce us?"
Sheldon,I have people for that now. Youêre up.
Leonard,"Ah, congratulations and may God have mercy on your soul. Iêm Leonard. This is Raj."
Sheldon,"Yeah, please reserve chitchat for your breaks, Ms. Jenson. FYI, there will be no breaks."
Leonard,She seems nice.
Raj,"Hey, you already got a girlfriend. I call dibs."
Leonard,All I said was she seems nice.
Raj,"Yeah, well, I love her."
Bernadette,"Hey, I wasnêt expecting to hear from you today. Everything okay?"
Howard,"Uh, no, not really."
Bernadette,Whatês wrong?
Howard,"Well, remember the Soyuz capsule they were sending to bring us home?"
Howard,"Itês delayed. Weêre gonna be here at least another week. Maybe ten days. Itês the Russians, so you donêt know. They left dogs up here in the sixties."
Bernadette,"Come on, Howard. No oneês leaving you up there."
Howard,"I donêt know how much longer I can take this. I canêt sleep, and zero gravity is giving me crazy acid reflux. Iêm down to my last three Tums."
Bernadette,Youêre going to be fine. You survived that Weight Watchers cruise with your mom. And they ran out of low-fat ice cream on day two. Just calm down and take a few deep breaths.
Howard,"Okay, okay. What am I doing? Iêm using up all the oxygen. If I die, promise youêll never have sex with another man."
Amy,"Oh, yeah. Iêm a man-eater now."
Penny,"Okay, for the final touch, this is an eyelash curler. You just place it on your lashes and squeeze it closed."
Amy,"Oh, I donêt know. Looks like something used by Tinkerbellês gynecologist."
Penny,"Who I hope for her sake is not Captain Hook, soÑ who are you calling?"
Amy,"Iêm going to video-chat Sheldon. If my new look leads to phone sex, Iêm going to have to ask you to leave the room."
Amy,"Oh, hello. Who are you?"
Amy,Iêd like to speak to Sheldon.
Amy,"All right. Well, tell him Amy called."
Amy,He knows my last name. Iêm his girlfriend. We have a contract and everything. Iêll send you a PDF.
Amy,"Hmm, thatês weird."
Amy,Sheldon told me he had a new assistant named Alex. He didnêt mention that Alex was a girl.
Penny,Maybe he didnêt notice.
Amy,Youêre right. I donêt have to worry about Sheldon.
Penny,"No, you do not."
Amy,Itês her I have to worry about.
Penny,"Oh, Amy, really? She is not going to come on to Sheldon."
Amy,"Oh, really? Look at this face  How can any woman spend eight hours a day alone with this face and not fall in love with it?"
Penny,"Well, for starters, at some point, that face starts talking."
Penny,"Amy, this is crazy. You have nothing to be suspicious about."
Amy,"Iêm not suspicious. I just want to stop in, say hi to my boyfriend and meet his new assistant.  Aha!"
Penny,Can we go now?
Amy,Hang on. 
Penny,What are you doing?
Amy,Isnêt it obvious? Iêm spreading my scent to mark my territory.
Penny,"Come on, Amy. That is not gonna work."
Amy,"Really? Because just before you became my best friend, I did this all over your apartment."
Raj,"Has your, uh, assistant said anything about me?"
Sheldon,"Oh, in fact, she has. Uh, her exact words were, what is that guyês problem?"
Raj,Iêm in her head. Let the dance begin.
Leonard,This should be fun.
Sheldon,"Half chocolate, half vanilla, side by side, not swirled?"
Sheldon,Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?
Sheldon,Two cherries?
Sheldon,Stems removed?
Sheldon,"Itês all right, Alex. Iêm not mad at you, Iêm just disappointed."
Leonard,"Wait, Alex. Do you want to join us?"
Sheldon,"Uh, Alex, a moment. I need a word with Dr. Hofstadter. Do you think itês appropriate for her to sit with us, given her station?"
Leonard,Given her what?
Sheldon,"If Iêve learned anything from British television shows on PBS, itês that servants dine downstairs with their own kind."
Sheldon,"Itês a kindness, Leonard. Otherwise, youêre cruelly tempting them with a glimpse of a world thatês just beyond their soot-stained fingertips."
Leonard,"Oh, sure. Please join us."
Leonard,"So, Alex, whatês the topic of your dissertation?"
Leonard,"Oh, that happens to be Dr. Koothrappaliês field of expertise. You two have a lot to talk about."
Leonard,"But compared to your boss, heês the poster boy for sanity."
Leonard,"Oh, SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. You should introduce him to Sheldon. The search is over."
Leonard,High-energy lasers.
Leonard,"Not yet, but I can remove unwanted hair from two miles away."
Amy,"You were right. I had nothing to worry about. That skankês your problem, not mine."
Leonard,Thank you.
Sheldon,Cherry stem! Cherry stem!
Bernadette,"How you doing, Howie? You feeling a little better?"
Howard,"Oh, a lot better, thanks. One sec. Listen close, I donêt have a lot of time. I need you to go to my house. In my bedroom, youêll find a model rocket. I want you to take it and bring it back to your place."
Howard,"Step two, build a version roughly fourteen stories high. Fill it full of rocket fuel and come get me. Iêll leave the door unlocked."
Bernadette,"Howie, honey, maybe you should talk to someone, let them know youêre having a little anxiety."
Howard,"No, no, Iêm fine. No anxiety. We should probably talk in code. From now on, frog is me, sandwich means you and lemon means rocket. So, come on, sandwich, build me a lemon êcause froggy wants to come home."
Amy,"Look at you, putting on a brave face."
Penny,Thereês nothing to be brave about. Everythingês fine.
Amy,"Really? I donêt know how much you know about primate behaviour, but Sheldonês assistant was clearly courting Leonard. Were she a mandrill, she would have bent over and displayed her brightly coloured hindquarters like a big red welcome mat. By the way, you try that at the junior prom, you get kicked out."
Penny,"Okay, maybe she was flirting with him, but who cares? Look, I donêt even know where my relationship is with Leonard is right now."
Amy,"So says your prefrontal cortex. But meanwhile, the limbic system of your brain is calculating that if another woman is attracted to Leonard, it must be because heês desirable."
Penny,"Well, of course heês desirable. I mean, heês great. Heês smart, heês sweet, and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew, let me tell you, he really tries."
Amy,So it does bother you.
Penny,"Fine, it bothers me a little. You know what? This is stupid. It doesnêt bother me. Okay, it bothers me. But only because she wouldnêt stop laughing. Leonard is not that funny."
Amy,"And there you have it, prefrontal cortex reasoning versus limbic lust. If this were a boxing match, they might call it the thrilla adjacent to the amygdala. If you were a brain scientist, you would be busting a gut right now."
Penny,"So, how was work today?"
Leonard,"Ah, it was all right, I guess. Got to Heimlich a cherry stem out of Sheldon. Caught Raj right in the eye."
Penny,Oh! Youêre kidding.
Leonard,"No, Raj had to go to the nurse."
Penny,Wow. Anything else?
Leonard,"Mmm, the nurse is a woman, so he couldnêt talk to her. She had to bring him a Grover puppet so he could point at what hurt."
Penny,"Oh, is that it?"
Leonard,Isnêt that enough? It had the weaponised fruit and a puppet. What more do you want?
Sheldon,"Oh, good, Leonard, youêre here. Science news. This will interest you. And, Penny, feel free to paint your nails."
Leonard,What do you got?
Sheldon,I believe Alex may have unearthed the grade school science project that could be my ticket to the Nobel Prize. Behold.
Leonard,"Magnets: What Do They Stick To? If the answer is metal, itês not exactly groundbreaking."
Sheldon,The original title was _A Rederivation of Maxwellês Equations Regarding Electromagnetismîî I dumbed it down because some of the more religious people in town were starting to say I was a witch.
Penny,"Oh, itês about time. I hated the old way. Hi. Iêm Penny."
Penny,In a way. Weêve kind of been involved in a five-year experiment.
Penny,"Well, a lot of people canêt. Uh, hey."
Leonard,Where are we going?
Penny,My limbic system wants to take your pants off.
Sheldon,Notice people on your own time. Weêre working.
Bernadette,"Hey, Howie, how you feeling?"
Howard,"Better. Much better. The other astronauts held me down, gave me a shot. Oooh. Attention, people of Earth. Tonight, there will be two moons in the sky."
Bernadette,"Howie, stop that. NASAês watching this! Put your pants back on!"
Howard,Whee! Whee!
Raj,Howardês capsule should be re-entering the atmosphere any minute.
Leonard,Itêll be good to have him back.
Raj,The Fantastic Four reunited.
Sheldon,"Yeah, you had a good run, Fake Wolowitz. Weêll remember you with nostalgic fondness, the way we do the dial-up modem, the VHS tape, or, or Leonardês gym membership."
Raj,Weêre not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.
Sheldon,"Okay, one vote for, one vote against. Leonard, youêre the tiebreaker."
Leonard,"I donêt have a problem with Stuart. Besides, he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store."
Sheldon,"Well, I donêt sell my friendship that cheaply."
Sheldon,"Welcome aboard, old chum."
Raj,"Okay, the NASA Web site says Howardês final descent has begun."
Sheldon,"He left a boy, he returns a boy-sized hero."
Howard,"Baruch atah, Adonai, Eloheinu. Melech haolam, hamotzi. Lechem min haaretz"
Howard,The Jewish prayer for eating bread! We donêt have one for falling out of space! We did it! Weêre on the ground! We survived!
Bernadette,Waiting for my husband.
Bernadette,Heês coming back from outer space.
Bernadette,"No, I mean, heÑ Never mind. There he is! Howie!"
Howard,"Whoa, thank you. Great to be back on Earth."
Bernadette,I missed you so much.
Howard,"I missed you, too. Where are the guys?"
Bernadette,"Oh, itês just me."
Howard,"Oh, I get it. Theyêre waiting back home with a big surprise party. Donêt worry, I can act surprised. "
Bernadette,"No, I told them they could have you tomorrow night. Tonight, you belong to me.  "
Howard,Gesundheit. You okay?
Bernadette,"I am now that youêre back. Come on, letês go home so I can tear off those little pants."
Howard,"Great. Just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting."
Sheldon,"You know, I am very disappointed that I wonêt be able to celebrate Howardês accomplishment tonight."
Amy,"Me, too. But weêll see him tomorrow."
Sheldon,"Yes, itês just that in all the years Iêve known him, heês never had the opportunity to receive my admiration. I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened."
Penny,Youêre unbelievable.
Sheldon,I know.
Leonard,"All right, Pictionary. What are the teams?"
Penny,How about boys versus girls?
Sheldon,"Oh, that hardly seems fair. But I guess any team that Iêm not on has a decided disadvantage."
Penny,"Once again, unbelievable."
Sheldon,"Yeah, once again, I know."
Penny,"All right, round one. Here."
Sheldon,Got it.
Penny,"Okay. Ready, set, go."
Amy,"Uh, box? Uh, window?"
Leonard,"Batman. Batman and Robin. Uh, Wonder Twins plus the monkey. Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman."
Amy,"Uh, gift? Uh, Present!"
Penny,Present! Yeah!
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard. Now, how can you not get that?"
Leonard,In what universe is that a present?
Sheldon,"Itês not a present, itês the present. Look. Thereês you and me. Thereês Penny and Amy. Weêre playing Pictionary. In the present."
Penny,"Oh, my God, weêre gonna kill them."
Sheldon,Itês a quark-gluon plasma.
Sheldon,Itês asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.
Leonard,Nothing with quarks.
Sheldon,Itês an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.
Penny,Itês a chocolate chip cookie.
Leonard,How could you miss that?
Sheldon,"Hey, if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie, you draw a glass of milk next to it."
Leonard,Penny got it.
Sheldon,"Yeah, only after I eliminated all the obvious answers. Youêre welcome."
Leonard,"Oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage. Uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst? Oh, oh, a hot dog."
Amy,"Penny, arenêt you gonna draw something?"
Penny,"Relax, we got time, this is so fun."
Leonard,"A solar system. Uh, uh, uh, uh, um, unidentified flying liverwurst? I donêtÑ"
Sheldon,"Come on, Leonard, I am spoon-feeding this to you."
Leonard,"I donêt know, uh, Casper the alcoholic ghost?"
Penny,"All right, thatês enough. "
Amy,"Uh, hand. Uh, nail, polish?"
Sheldon,"Wait, no, no. The word is Polish. See, look. Polish sausage. And the, the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer. And then, finally, if that wasnêt enough, which it should have been, this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized French citizen, was Polish by birth."
Penny,"Excuse me, the word is polish. See? Small P."
Sheldon,Ah. So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one.
Howard,"Bernie, you okay?"
Howard,Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?
Bernadette,Itês just allergies.
Bernadette,"Took some Benadryl. Iêll be fine. So, did you miss me?"
Howard,Oh. Are you kidding? Every minute of everyÑ
Bernadette,Ew. Excuse me.
Howard,"Sweetie, we donêt have to do this now."
Bernadette,"Yes, we do. You left right after we got married. This is like our honeymoon. Now, hold on to your hat. Oh. Uh-oh."
Howard,You okay?
Bernadette,A little dizzy. Must be the Benadryl. Switch places with me.
Bernadette,"Now, kiss me. "
Howard,Bernadette? Bernie? Bernie?
Howard,"Well, that was quick, and a little gross. Now, I know how she feels."
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon, youêre always full of fun little facts. Where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from?"
Sheldon,Donêt know.
Penny,"I wonder if itês from, like, ancient Rome where theyêd actually chop somebodyês ass off and then go, here. You know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers."
Sheldon,I am not a loser. Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.
Leonard,"Mmm, in all fairness, Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills. Itês a pretty well-rounded game."
Sheldon,Lot of big talk from a man who canêt draw a chocolate chip cookie.
Penny,"All right, fine, pick another game. Amy and I will beat you at anything."
Sheldon,All right. Letês play Physics Fiesta.
Penny,"Oh, come on, what is that?"
Sheldon,"Itês a game that I just invented, in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish. Um, èD nde est_ el boson de Higgs?"
Leonard,En el acelerador de particulares.
Sheldon,"Bueno, mi amigo."
Penny,"No, no, weêre not playing some dumb made-up game."
Sheldon,"All games are made up. Theyêre not found in nature. You donêt just dig in the ground, come across a rich vein of Rockêem Sockêem Robots."
Leonard,Just pick another game.
Amy,Why donêt we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?
Leonard,"No good, Sheldon doesnêt float."
Sheldon,"That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath, I drown."
Amy,"All right, letês keep it simple. How about darts?"
Sheldon,"No, thatês not fair either."
Penny,Why not?
Sheldon,Darts is a bar game. Youêve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.
Leonard,"Yeah, thatês when it started."
Sheldon,"Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests, theyêre all out."
Penny,"Okay. Just for the record, I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest. Iêve won a few, but thatês just because I spill when Iêm drunk, soÑ"
Amy,We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA and play real-life Operation.
Penny,I donêt think so.
Amy,"Are you sure? I mean, the nose doesnêt light up, but if the corpse is fresh enough, sometimes you can get the leg to jerk."
Howard,"Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle, your little star is home. Ma, the chainês on the door."
Howard,"Yeah, well, Bernieês not feeling well, so I thought Iêd stop by, tell you about the greatest adventure of my life, see if you can make me feel bad about it."
Howard,All right. Woman hasnêt tied her robe in 20 years. Suddenly sheês not decent?
Howard,"Ma, who is in there?"
Howard,Who is that?
Howard,"If youêre busy, I can come back."
Howard,Dr. Schneider?
Howard,What are you doing here?
Howard,Youêre a dentist.
Penny,"Okay, glasses off. Find Waldo."
Sheldon,"Hurry up, find him, find him."
Leonard,Iêm trying. Donêt yell at me.
Sheldon,"For goodnessê sake, heês wearing a hat, glasses, and a red striped shirt."
Leonard,I know what he looks like.
Amy,"Oh, there he is, I got him."
Penny,"Yes, we win again."
Sheldon,How could you not find him?
Leonard,"Because heês hard to find. If he was easy to find, the books would be called Thereês Waldo."
Leonard,"57, 58, 59, thatês one minute."
Amy,"Long division, long division. Go, go, go."
Leonard,"Remember, show your work."
Sheldon,Iêm okay. Iêm okay. Iêm not okay.
Leonard,"Get up, we canêt lose at math."
Amy,"Ready, set, wrestle.  One, two, three, pin."
Sheldon,Stop that.
Sheldon,"Amy, do something. Amy, help. Amy, stop that. Amy, Penny, both of you, stop it."
Howard,One to beam aboard?
Raj,"Oh, my God, youêre back. Oh, look at you. You, you look like you grew."
Howard,"Yeah. The lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so Iêm like an inch and a half taller. Iêm going to the DMV tomorrow to get my license changed before I shrink back."
Raj,"Oh, uh, come in, come in. Oh, I, uh, I didnêt think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow."
Howard,"Yeah, well, Bernadetteês a little under the weather and my momês kind of under my dentist."
Raj,"Wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?"
Howard,Former dentist. I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.
Raj,So youêre wandering all around by yourself? Thatês not the kind of heroês welcome an astronaut should come home to.
Howard,"Itês okay, you know, we space cowboys donêt do what we do for glory and fame. We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels."
Howard,"Oh, Stuart, thanks. What are you doing here?"
Raj,"Just until he gets back on his feet, which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday."
Howard,"Wow, so you guys are like buds now?"
Raj,"Oh, yeah, we hang out all the time."
Raj,"Itês like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each otherês holes."
Raj,Which part?
Howard,"Okay, so what do you guys got going on tonight?"
Howard,"Sound of Music sing-along? That used to be our thing, but thatês cool."
Raj,"Oh, Howard, itês still our thing. Come with us, weêll, weêll get you a scalped ticket."
Howard,So Iêd be sitting by myself?
Raj,Weêll switch. Youêll come sit with me after intermission.
Howard,"No, no, you guys go. Have fun."
Raj,"Okay, uh, will I get to see you tomorrow?"
Howard,"Absolutely. See you, Stuart."
Howard,At least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.
Penny,"All right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are, no hands, first one to clean the pan wins."
Amy,"On the count of three. One, twoÑ"
Sheldon,Wait. Iêm a little concerned. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.
Sheldon,"So, with all those antioxidants, what if I run out of oxidants?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, we havenêt won a game all night. Now, you either stick your face in that pie or Iêm gonna stick that pie in your face."
Sheldon,Thatês rude.
Amy,"One, two, three, eat."
Howard,"Hey, guys, guess whoês back from space."
Sheldon,"Oh, ow, blueberry in my nose, blueberry in my nose!"
Leonard,Snort it down and keep eating!
Howard,I donêt think so.
Howard,"Yes. Yes, I am."
Howard,"Oh, thank you so much. Iêve been having the worst night. I just got back, and my friends donêt care, my wifeês sick, I went to my momÑ"
Howard,"Yes, please.  Perfect."
Howard,"Oh, hey, Stuart, I got you a little souvenir from my trip to space."
Leonard,"Yeah, maybe. Open it first."
Howard,Itês my official NASA portrait.
Sheldon,"For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world."
Howard,Thatês not true. At the Walgreens I was over the moon for their store-brand antacids.
Raj,"Hey, Stuart, I see youêre getting ready for your Halloween party."
Raj,Would you like me to help? I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.
Raj,"You know, you donêt worry about money. Iêll take care of everything."
Raj,"Yeah, youêll love it. Ainêt no party like a Koothra-party."
Howard,"But you know what wasnêt a party? That hotel in Kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch. I mean, itês your last night on Earth. Youêd think youêd get one porn channel."
Leonard,Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?
Sheldon,"Interesting hypothesis. Letês apply the scientific method, perform an experiment."
Leonard,"Okay. Hey, Howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?"
Howard,"Anywhere but the Space Station. On a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf. But, hey, you donêt go there for the food, you go there for the view."
Sheldon,"Itês fascinating. Let me see if I can duplicate the result. Howard, Iêve always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit. Care to weigh in?"
Howard,Not really.
Sheldon,"Oh, well."
Howard,"You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon. But, hey, that baby got me to space and back."
Amy,Ladies night at the Cheesecake Factory. Does it get any better than this?
Penny,I hope so.
Amy,Question. Do you think your husbandês fondness for turtlenecks is an expression of longing for his missing foreskin?
Penny,Itês not getting any better.  Ugh. Itês Leonard. He wants to go costume shopping later.
Bernadette,I thought you liked Halloween.
Penny,"I do, itês just he wants to go to that party at the comic book store. A lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy."
Bernadette,Like my husband?
Amy,And my boyfriend?
Penny,"Iêm, Iêm sorry, Amy. You were saying something about Howardês foreskin?"
Bernadette,"Nice try, but you have to go to that party because weêre going."
Penny,"Yeah, Iêm gonna go. Itês just not my idea of a good time."
Bernadette,Leonard does thing he doesnêt like to make you happy.
Penny,"Well, yeah, heês my boyfriend. Isnêt that, like, his job?"
Amy,Then whatês your job?
Penny,Letting him make me happy.
Bernadette,I just think in relationships you get back what you put into them.
Amy,"Thatês not always true. Last night I gave Sheldon my best come-hither look, and he responded by explaining how wheat came to be cultivated."
Penny,I guess I could probably try a little harder.
Bernadette,You could start by taking an interest in his work.
Penny,"Yeah, thatês kind of a problem."
Penny,Not really clear on what he does.
Bernadette,Heês an experimental physicist.
Penny,"Yeah, Iêm not really clear on what that means."
Amy,He takes hypotheses and designs protocols to determine their accuracy.
Penny,"Yeah, youêre really just making it worse."
Sheldon,What kind of tea would you like?
Amy,I think Iêm gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.
Sheldon,Two tea bags in one cup? Youêre not at a rave.
Amy,"So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking, since this is gonna be our first Halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend, I thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume."
Sheldon,I couldnêt agree more.
Amy,Really? I find that inconsistent with everything I know about you.
Sheldon,"Oh, oh, on the contrary. Couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship. Now imagine this, you and I entering Stuartês party and all eyes turn to see Americaês most beloved and glamorous couple."
Sheldon,R2-D2 and C-3PO. Dibs on Threepio.
Amy,"Sheldon, when I said couples costume, I meant like Romeo and Juliet or Cinderella and Prince Charming, not two robots from some silly movie I donêt even like."
Sheldon,"Okay, Iêm gonna let that slide because I know youêre hopped up on tea bags."
Amy,"I make compromises for you all the time. Just this once, canêt we find something that weêre both happy with?"
Sheldon,Fine. How about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century? Hewlett and Packard. Dibs on Hewlett. You want to be Hewlett?
Penny,Anybody home?
Leonard,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
Penny,I just thought Iêd stop by and say hello.
Leonard,"Oh, what a nice surprise. I donêt think youêve ever seen my lab before."
Penny,"No, I know. Itês long overdue. So, what ya doing? Better not be building a robot girlfriend."
Leonard,Although Howard was making some real strides in that area until he met Bernadette.
Penny,Youêre kidding.
Leonard,Nope. Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.
Penny,Ooh! Whatês going on in here?
Leonard,"Oh, no, no, no, donêt look in there."
Penny,is it secret?
Leonard,"No, itês a nitrogen laser. Itêll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg."
Penny,Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.
Leonard,Sign right there.
Penny,"Ah. Danger. Sure, sure. Yeah. Whatês, whatês that?"
Leonard,"Uh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer."
Penny,Wow. High-techie-techie. Whatês this little box?
Leonard,That is a pencil sharpener.
Penny,"Ooh, low-techie-techie. So, what are you working on right now?"
Leonard,Itês actually pretty neat.
Leonard,"Yeah. Itês a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. Here, Iêll show you. Weêll just put this pencil over here."
Penny,Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.
Leonard,"Very good. And then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila. "
Penny,Wow. That is amazing.
Leonard,"You know, thereês a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram."
Penny,What do you mean? . Oh! Wow!
Leonard,"Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really  So itês possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe."
Penny,Sometimes I forget how smart you are.
Leonard,You should visit more often. What are you doing?
Penny,Take off your clothes.
Leonard,Here? Now?
Penny,Yeah. You got a problem with that?
Leonard,"No, no. Itês kind of crazy. Iêve never fooled around in the lab before."
Penny,Really? Never?
Leonard,"I did have a shot with the Lisatronic, but the extension cord wasnêt long enough."
Raj,"Before I forget, Iêd like your opinion on the menus Iêve prepared for the Halloween party. The theme is food that goes bump in the night."
Howard,Creature from the Black Forest Ham Lagoon.
Raj,On Sesame seed Bunzillas.
Sheldon,Night of the Living Garlic Bread?
Raj,Itês funny because bread sounds like dead.
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie."
Raj,"Ooh, Hallow-weenies! Thatês a good one. Theyêll pair nicely with my Draculoni and Cheese. How do I do it?"
Howard,"That reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume. But then I realized everyone would be, like, whereês your costume? Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?"
Leonard,"Hello, boys."
Sheldon,What are you smiling at?
Howard,You know whereês thereês a lot of nothing.
Howard,"Boy, itês nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again. Did I tell you about the night my retainer floated out of my mouth and into the air lock?"
Bernadette,"Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice."
Howard,"So, here we are, just a couple of young newlyweds. What to do? What to do to you? Astronaut Wolowitz, reporting for booty. Preparing thrusters. We have liftoff. Are we clear to jettison that nightgown?"
Bernadette,"Okay, we need to talk."
Bernadette,"Howie, I know you went to space. Iêm incredibly proud of you. But you might want to try and not bring it up every minute."
Howard,I donêt talk about it every minute.
Bernadette,Tonight at dinner you went on bout it for an hour straight.
Howard,What was I supposed to talk about? We were eating at Johnny Rockets.
Bernadette,"Iêm just saying, people are getting a little tired of it."
Howard,"So, I did this amazing thing and Iêm never allowed to mention it?"
Bernadette,Of course you can. But maybe a good rule would be to wait for people to bring it up.
Howard,"Okay, no problem. It wonêt happen again."
Bernadette,I love you.
Howard,"I love you, too. I canêt tell you how many times I dreamed I was in bed here with you when I wasÑ you know. I canêt even point?"
Leonard,"So, basically, this is whatês called mag-lev technology. It uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity. Here, you hold this."
Penny,Whoa! Thatês heavy.
Leonard,"Yeah. Oh, uh, you donêt have on any jewellery, do you?"
Penny,Why?
Leonard,A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings. Now heês on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size. Now watch this.
Penny,Whoa! That is very cool.
Leonard,Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend Iêm the super villain Magneto.
Penny,"Getting a little less cool, Leonard."
Leonard,But what I really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.
Penny,There we go.
Raj,"So, I thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummyês tomb, or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who."
Sheldon,"A Tardis makes no sense. Itês a time machine from a science-fiction show. It has nothing to do with Halloween. That being said, if you donêt get a Tardis, you stink and your party stinks."
Raj,Do you have a preference?
Howard,I donêt care. Get the Tardis.
Sheldon,Yes! This party just became a major rager.
Raj,"Oh, by the way, can I borrow your bullwhip and fedora?"
Howard,"Yeah, sure, whatever."
Raj,I was thinking of dressing up as Indiana Jonesê mocha-skinned love child. Indian Jones.
Raj,Whatês wrong with you?
Raj,"Oh, Howard, Iêve got a party to plan. Donêt make me pull it out of you."
Howard,"Okay, here it is. Bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space. Is that true?"
Sheldon,We seem to have different approaches here. I was going for helpful honesty. I have no idea what youêre doing.
Raj,Itês called being nice.
Sheldon,"Okay. If you think being nice will get him to shut up, Iêll try it."
Howard,"You know what, guys? Never mind. I just wonêt talk about the greatest achievement of my life ever again."
Sheldon,"Look at that, the problem solved itself."
Leonard,"Hello, boys."
Sheldon,What if we were to go as dinner table favourites salt and pepper?
Amy,You know salt makes me retain water and my cousin William was ground to death in a pepper factory accident. How about Raggedy Ann and Andy? I loved them growing up.
Sheldon,"No, I donêt think so. Those dolls represent three things I do not care for, clowns, children and raggediness. I think itês a lost cause."
Amy,"There are certain things that say to the world, I have a boyfriend, and heês not made up. Matching costumes, hickeys and sex tapes. Pick one."
Sheldon,Whatês a hickey?
Bernadette,How do I look?
Bernadette,"Uh-oh, is someone a little blue? Come on, Howie, thatês like the funniest thing Iêve ever said in my life. What do you say? You ready to go?"
Howard,"To tell you the truth, Iêm not really in the mood."
Bernadette,What are you talking about? Itêll be fun. All your friendsêll be there.
Howard,"Yeah, some friends. They all think Iêm boring. Maybe you should go without me."
Bernadette,"No, if Iêm there alone, people might think Iêm just a really short person from Avatar."
Howard,Iêm sorry. I just donêt want to go.
Bernadette,"Hey, I just spent the last three hours colouring myself blue. Iêm gonna be washing paint out of my Smurf for a month."
Howard,Fine. Two weeks ago I was an astronaut.
Bernadette,"Yeah, well, now youêre a Smurf. Keep walking."
Penny,"Oh, my God, you guys look adorable."
Bernadette,"Thanks, so do you. Slutty cop?"
Penny,"No, sexy cop. Slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges."
Bernadette,And Albert Einstein?
Leonard,"Ja, und later sheês going to arrest me for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light."
Penny,"I thought we said in the car, no accents?"
Leonard,"Sorry, Officer."
Amy,"Sheldon, get in here."
Sheldon,I shouldêve picked hickey.
Amy,"Iêm Raggedy Ann, and heês Raggedy C-3PO."
Sheldon,It was a compromise. I lost.
Raj,Can you believe Stuartês walking around taking credit for this party?
Howard,Who cares?
Raj,"What do you mean who cares? Look at what I pulled off here. The DJês on fire, thereês a Tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my God, the food. Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese."
Howard,"Youêre right, the partyês fantastic. Please, tell me more. I havenêt heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old."
Raj,Is this about the space thing again?
Howard,"Well, Iêm not allowed to talk about it, but since you brought it up, I went to space! Space, space! Space! Space, space! Space!"
Bernadette,"Whoa, Drinky Smurf. Can I talk to you for a second?"
Howard,"Great, now Iêm in trouble. You happy?"
Bernadette,"You, out! You are being very rude."
Howard,"No, Iêm not. Theyêre all being rude. And youêre being rude."
Bernadette,Me? What did I do?
Howard,"Oh, Howie, stop talking about space so much. Nobody likes it."
Bernadette,I donêt sound like that.
Howard,Youêre my wife. Youêre supposed to be on my side.
Bernadette,Iêm always on your side.
Howard,"Then why are you trying to take this away from me? Being an astronaut is the coolest thing Iêm ever gonna do. If I stop talking about it, then Iêm justÑ"
Bernadette,Just what?
Howard,Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.
Bernadette,Plain old Howard Wolowitz is the best guy I know.
Howard,Youêre just saying that.
Bernadette,"No, Iêm not. I married him. On purpose. Come here."
Howard,I love you.
Bernadette,"I love you, too."
Penny,Nothing to see here. Just sexy police business.
Leonard,Just explaining the theory of relativity. Twice.
Bernadette,"Hey, what you watching?"
Howard,I donêt know. Raj sent me some video of Buzz Aldrin.
Howard,"Okay, I get it."
Raj,"Try to keep up, Howard, Iêm killing it."
Howard,"Yeah, I wish we looked as cool dancing in clubs as we do right now."
Leonard,"Donêt worry, this is exactly how you look when youêre dancing in clubs."
Raj,"Youêre welcome, ladies."
Sheldon,"Paradigm-shifting news, gentlemen. "
Raj,Dude! I was about to Bollywood this bitch.
Sheldon,"Earlier today, I invited Professor Stephen Hawking to join me in the popular online game Words with Friends. Moments ago, he accepted my request. Do you understand what that means?"
Howard,"That somewhere right now Stephen Hawking is saying, damn it, I meant to click no.î"
Sheldon,"Iêll walk you through it. The game is not called Words with Strangers. No, itês not even called Words with Acquaintances. It is called Words withÑ"
Raj,Iêm not finishing your sentence. You pulled the plug on my funk.
Sheldon,"Friends! Itês Words with Friends! Which Stephen Hawking and I officially are. Now all I need is a bunk bed with a slide, Iêll have everything Iêve ever wanted since I was six years old."
Leonard,"Thatês really nice, Sheldon, Iêm happy for you."
Sheldon,"And Iêm happy for you, too. You are now friends with someone who is officially friends with Stephen Hawking. Enjoy it, boys. You may have peaked."
Howard,"Sheldon, I know Stephen Hawking. I worked with him."
Sheldon,"And if they ever come out with a game called Words with People You Once Worked With, youêll be off to the races."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I donêt think this actually meansÑ"
Sheldon,"Hold that thought! Professor Hawking has made a move. Boy, oh, boy. Oh, itês only a matter of time before weêre coming up with fun nicknames for each other. Iêll be Coop. Heêll be Wheels. If heês okay with that. "
Raj,"All right. Crank up the AC, boys, itês gonna get hot in here!"
Bernadette,"So, I was taking a shower this morning, and when I got out, I started to dry off with what I thought was a towel but turned out to be Howardês momês underwear. I had to take another shower. It wasnêt enough. Nothing will ever be enough."
Amy,I once looked in Sheldonês underwear drawer. He yelled at me. But now I know what it looks like and he can never take that away.
Bernadette,Thereês a book under here.
Penny,"Oh, Iêll get that."
Bernadette,I got it.
Penny,"No, no, itêsÑ"
Bernadette,I got it. Why do you have a history textbook?
Penny,"No, itês not a big deal. Just taking a class at the Pasadena Community College."
Bernadette,Thatês great. I didnêt know you wanted to go back to school.
Penny,"Itês just one history class. Look, I didnêt finish college, so I thought I would give it a try."
Amy,"Not to mention, your acting career is going south like Sherman. Read about it in your book."
Bernadette,Why would you be embarrassed to tell us?
Penny,"No, Iêm not embarrassed. I just didnêt want anyone to know because I havenêt told Leonard yet."
Amy,Why wouldnêt you tell Leonard?
Penny,"Because itês me going back to school, and heês gonna be all _you can do it,î and _how can I help?î and _Iêm so proud of you.î Ugh!"
Bernadette,I just canêt believe you could keep something like that from him.
Amy,You guys have got to be the weirdest couple I know.
Penny,Really? You canêt think of anyone weirder?
Amy,"I can, but sheês sitting right there."
Sheldon,"Yes. I play the word quiver with a triple letter and a double word score for 72 points. That ought to let the air out of your tyres, Hawking."
Amy,"Wow, my boyfriend is friends with Stephen Hawking and my new dandruff shampoo doesnêt smell like tar. Everything really is coming up Amy."
Sheldon,It is glorious. One of the greatest intellects of our time has agreed to engage with me in a gentlemanly battle of wits. And Iêm spanking him so hard his grad students wonêt be able to sit down.
Amy,"You know, when one male dominates another, his testosterone level rises."
Sheldon,Whatês your point?
Amy,Itês exciting to think you might be getting a testosterone level.
Sheldon,"Ooh, my friend Stephen just played the word act for 18 points. Thatês right, I call him Stephen now, because I checked, and he was not okay with Wheels."
Amy,"Oh, you could turn his act into extract , and it would be for double points."
Sheldon,"Amy. Why would you give me a word? Now, if I play extract it would be cheating."
Sheldon,"Although, I could play the completely unrelated and better word extract . Ethical conundrum avoided. Thanks, brain."
Penny,Spaghetti okay?
Leonard,Itês crunchy. Just the way I like it.
Penny,"Yeah, I donêt think the water was really boiling."
Leonard,Itês great. I love it.
Penny,"Okay, listen, thereês something I need to tell you. Iêve been thinking about going back to school for a while now. So a couple months ago, I started taking a history class at the community college."
Leonard,"Oh. Thatês great. Great, great, great. Why wait so long to tell me?"
Penny,I donêt want you to make a big deal out of it.
Leonard,"Why do you think Iêd be like that? I get it, youêre taking one class. Itês nice. Maybe if it goes well, you take another, you enrol full-time. Ooh, be sure to keep an eye on which credits transfer to a four-year college."
Penny,Youêre making it a big deal.
Leonard,Sorry. Whatever. Itês all good.
Penny,"Anyway, thatês it. I just thought you should know."
Leonard,Am I allowed to ask how the class is going?
Penny,Itês really good. Weêve been talking about the origins of slavery. Turn in my first paper tomorrow.
Leonard,"Great topic. I can help with that. There are lots of different perspectives you can take, economic, sociological, political."
Penny,"Hey hey hey, this is my paper. And my perspective is that slavery is bad. Oh, and my professorês black, so Iêm pretty sure thatês the right answer."
Leonard,Can I take a look?
Penny,"No, Leonard, this is my thing."
Leonard,"Okay, I get it."
Penny,Thank you.
Leonard,"Itês like when I started doing chin-ups, I didnêt want you to see until I could do one. FYI, really close."
Penny,"Thank you. Now behave yourself and eat your dinner. Maybe later, if youêre lucky, you get to sleep with a college girl."
Leonard,"Really? ‚Cause I went to four years of college and five years of grad school, that never happened once."
Raj,"I think the next time I have to speak to a call centre in India, Iêm going to try using an American accent."
Raj,"Because when I use my regular voice, I feel like Iêm making fun of them."
Howard,"Thatês ridiculous. Not to mention, your American accent is terrible."
Raj,"Dude, my accent is brilliant.  Hey, my snow-white American friends, letês put some cow meat on the barbecue and eat it until weêre all obese."
Howard,"This is what you sound like. I think Iêm talking in an American accent, but it really sounds like Iêm wearing a set of giant dentures."
Raj,"Sheldon, do I really sound like that?"
Howard,Tell him he sounds like that.
Raj,"Sheldon, you okay?"
Sheldon,Itês been three days. Why hasnêt Stephen Hawking played a word?
Raj,The guyês a genius. Maybe you werenêt challenging enough for him.
Sheldon,Not challenging? I was humiliating the man. I was thinking of writing a book called A Brief History of the Time I Made Stephen Hawking Cry Like a Little Girl.
Howard,"Thereês the problem. You canêt beat Hawking like that. He hates to lose. Everyone knows the guyês a big baby. I mean, forget the wheelchair, he should be in a stroller."
Howard,"One time when I was working with him, he said that Johnny Depp was in The Matrix. I told him he was wrong, but he kept insisting. So I looked it up online and showed him. Well, the next day, he had a pizza party, and everyone got invited but me. And then he was all, your invitation must have gotten lost in the matrix."
Sheldon,"Good Lord, what have I done?"
Raj,"Good Lord, what have I done?"
Raj,"All right, hotshot, letês hear your Indian."
Howard,"I canêt sit on that elephant, my ass is on fire from eating all this curry."
Raj,"Okay, yeah, thatês pretty good."
Leonard,Please be good. Please be good. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. She writes like she cooks.
Sheldon,Play. Play. Play. Play. Play.
Leonard,What are you doing?
Sheldon,Trying to use a Jedi mind trick to control Stephen Hawking. Play. Play. Ugh! He must be wearing a tinfoil hat or something.
Leonard,I did a bad thing.
Sheldon,Does it affect me?
Sheldon,Then suffer in silence. Play. Play. Play.  Stephen Hawking.
Leonard,"Penny started taking a class. She wrote a paper, she didnêt want me to read it, I went behind her back and I read it anyway."
Sheldon,Stephen Hawking hates me.
Leonard,"I donêt know what to do. I mean, the paperês terrible. But if I tell her, sheêll know that I read it and sheêll get really mad."
Sheldon,"I was beating him so bad, he doesnêt want to be friends anymore. Why does everyone love me except Stephen Hawking?"
Leonard,Is it possible weêre having two different conversations?
Sheldon,How would I know? Iêm not listening to you.
Leonard,"Hang on. Okay, hereês what weêre gonna do. Chess clock. We each get five minutes to talk about our problems. Weêll take turns. Each turn will consist of a statement and a helpful response from the friend. Begin."
Sheldon,"I humiliated Stephen Hawking in a game of Words with Friends. He stopped playing, and now weêre not friends anymore."
Leonard,"Heês probably busy. Youêre worried about nothing. Give it a couple more days. Iêm sure heêll play, and youêll see that everythingês fine. My turn. I canêt let Penny hand in a bad paper, but how do I tell her itês bad without letting her know that I read it?"
Sheldon,"Hmm. Beats me. Now, I know Hawkingês not busy because I can see heês playing other people right now."
Leonard,"Maybe since youêre so good, heês taking his time to meet the challenge. I want Penny to enjoy schoolÑ"
Sheldon,"Wolowitz told me heês a big baby. But I didnêt know that, and I played extract for 82 points. Itês all Amyês fault. She told me to play it. I have got to cut her loose."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I wasnêt done talking. She hands in the paper tomorrow. I know I could help her. And sheês my girlfriend. I, I should be allowed to help her. Why arenêt I allowed to help her?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, I hear you, brother."
Leonard,You need to give me some advice.
Sheldon,"Fine. Women, huh?"
Leonard,"No, specific to my situation."
Sheldon,"Blonde women, huh?"
Sheldon,It sucks to be you.
Leonard,I quit.
Sheldon,"Leonard, wait. I listened to your dumb thing. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back. Leonard, come back."
Sheldon,"Oh, of course, it only works on the weak-minded."
Leonard,"Good morning, sunshine."
Penny,Leonard. Itês eight a.m. Itês like the middle of the night.
Leonard,"I know, but I have to go to work, and I made you breakfast."
Penny,"Oh, wow, thatês so sweet. Hey, whatês this?"
Leonard,"Uh, before you open that, um, are you familiar with the story of The Shoemaker and the Elves?"
Penny,"Elves? Come on, Leonard. Itês too early for Lord of the Rings."
Leonard,"No, no. Listen, um, once upon a time, there was this shoemaker and when he went to bed at night, elves would sneak in and they would make all these amazing shoes for him. And when the shoemaker woke up in the morning, he, he would be super happy, not mad at the elves at all. Open it."
Penny,"Okay. An examination of the economic, cultural, and political roots of slavery in the Old South, 1619 to 1865. What the hell is this?"
Leonard,Donêt ask me. A little elf did it.
Penny,So let me get this straight. You just assumed my paper would be bad so you wrote one for me?
Leonard,"No, I assumed it would be good. Then I read it."
Leonard,"No, I, I mean, it was good. There were just a few things that needed a little polishing."
Penny,You changed every word.
Leonard,"Thatês not true. Uh, slavery. 1619. Your name at the top. Thatês all you."
Penny,You are such an ass. This is exactly why I didnêt want to tell you I was taking a class in the first place.
Leonard,"Please donêt be upset. I just, I didnêt want you ending up with a bad grade and get discouraged and give up on the idea of going back to school."
Penny,"Right, because me being in school is so important to you. That way, you wouldnêt have to be dating someone whoês only a waitress."
Leonard,"Oh, come on, you know thatês not true."
Penny,"Do I? Listen to me. I need to do this on my own. If I fail, I fail. If I pass, I pass. Do you get it?"
Leonard,Iêm sorry. I was just trying to help.
Penny,"Yeah, well, next time donêt. Oh, and since you like stories so much, this is not The Shoemaker"
Howard,You ever hear back from Hawking?
Sheldon,It would appear as if Iêve lost him. Stupid brain.
Raj,Itêll be okay.
Sheldon,How can it be okay? Stephen Hawkingês a genius and he talks like a robot. Itês everything Iêve ever wanted in a friend.
Raj,"Yeah, but if heês a sore loser, maybe youêre better off without him."
Sheldon,Youêre right. I guess I just have to make lemonade out of the two of you. He played! He played! Coop and Rolling Thunder are together again. He was okay with that nickname.
Howard,"So, now all you have to do is let him win."
Sheldon,"Yeah, way ahead of you. I will play the word at for two measly points, throwing the game and thus securing my friendship with the smartest man in the world."
Howard,What are you waiting for? Hit send.
Sheldon,I canêt. Losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest.
Raj,So donêt do it.
Sheldon,"Oh, but I want to be Hawkingês friend."
Howard,So do it.
Sheldon,"Oh, but if I do, Iêll be a phony, a sellout, a Hollywood poser."
Raj,Then donêt do it.
Sheldon,"I wonêt. This feels right. My mother always said, to thine own self be true."
Howard,Good for you.
Sheldon,"‚Course she also told me that every animal in the world got on one boat, so what does she know? And send."
Leonard,"Oh, hey. Havenêt heard from you in a couple days. You still mad at me?"
Penny,Nope. I have no reason toÑ _Bî mad at you. Minus.
Penny,"Thatês right. On my paper. Not yours, mine, you punk-ass elf."
Leonard,I donêt know what to say.
Penny,"Hmm, how about, gee, Penny, youêre smarter than I thought. You may be the one in school, but Iêm the one who learned a lesson. Iêm so stupid, Penny. Duh."
Sheldon,She sounds exactly like you.
Amy,Howêd it go with Leonard?
Penny,I donêt think heêll be making that mistake again.
Penny,"So, I know this goes without saying, but if either of you tell Leonard you helped me rewrite this paper, I will beat you both with a bag of oranges."
Bernadette,Got it.
Penny,"Now, ladies, we got a B-minus on this paper. I think if we put our heads together, on the next one we could get an A."
Bernadette,"Uh, but we got you a B-minus on purpose to make it believable."
Penny,Believable? You saying Iêm not smart?
Bernadette,"No, no!"
Amy,Youêre smart.
Penny,Thatês better.
Amy,I feel like Iêm in high school again.
Bernadette,"Yeah, doing the prom queenês homework so sheêll like us."
Amy,I know. Itês finally working.
Sheldon,Itês Stephen Hawking.
Leonard,Well answer it. I want to hear.
Sheldon,"Professor Hawking, how nice of you to call."
Sheldon,"Oh, me, too."
Sheldon,"Yes, congratulations. You won fair and square. Uh, very impressive, sir."
Sheldon,"Oh, I love brain teasers."
Sheldon,"Hello, Iêm Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Before we get started, Iêd like to announce the winner of our design your own flag competition. But I canêt. The only entry was from GameyGamer75, and I know that was a jpeg of your buttocks. Now this week we have a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help me, Iêm pleased to introduce Internet personality, former star of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and the only guy I know lucky enough to be immortalized in one sixteenth scale. Set phasers to fun for my friend, Wil Wheaton."
Sheldon,Whatês wrong?
Amy,"Sorry, Sheldon, you were brilliant as always. Wil, that was a little wooden."
Amy,"Donêt worry, it wasnêt terrible. Just, this time, try to say it the way people sound. And action."
Sheldon,"My friend, Wil Wheaton."
Sheldon,"So, Wil, what do you have for us first?"
Amy,"Itês called Fun with Flags. Theyêre not at half-mast, nobody died. Letês try and keep it upbeat."
Sheldon,"Itês true. In 1982, Wil played the voice of Martin the mouse in The Secret of NIMH. You moved me."
Amy,"Youêll have to forgive me. This is my first time directing, I just want it to be good."
Amy,"Great. So, this time letês try more real boy, less Pinocchio. And action."
Amy,"Yes. And so far, weêre still not getting our moneyês worth. Letês try it again. Everybodyês having fun. And action."
Sheldon,"So, Wil, what do you have for us first?"
Sheldon,"Oh, none that I could see. I saw a man who loved flags almost as much as I do. I got goose bumps."
Amy,He was overacting on purpose.
Sheldon,Really? He reminded me of a young William Shatner.
Amy,You gonna let him speak to me like that?
Sheldon,"Well, youêre my girlfriend and I donêt want you to be upset. Then again, Wil Wheatonês my friend and I donêt want him to be upset. Hmm, this is a sticky wicket.  What do you think?"
Amy,Can I speak to you for a second?
Sheldon,Iêll be right back. Feel free to play with yourself.
Amy,"I donêt care for your friend, heês being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave."
Sheldon,"Amy, I canêt just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. Heês a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him."
Amy,Fine. Then maybe I should go.
Sheldon,Could you? That would solve everything. You are the best. Iêll see you at dinner tonight?
Amy,You sure you wouldnêt rather have dinner with your friend Wil Wheaton?
Sheldon,"Come to think of it, I would! You, little lady, are on fire."
Bernadette,"Every time we eat dinner here, your mother refuses to let me help with the dishes."
Howard,Donêt take it personally. She likes doing them by herself so she can lick the plates with no one looking.
Bernadette,You ready to go?
Howard,"Yeah, let me just grab a couple of fresh turtlenecks."
Bernadette,I donêt understand why you keep your stuff here when thereês plenty of room at home.
Howard,"What are you talking about? All I have here is a few sweaters, books, bank stuff, computers, mail, collectibles, medicine and my electric body groomer. Ooh, thereês my plaid dickie. Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents. Can you believe it?"
Bernadette,50 cents sounds right. Letês go.
Howard,"You know, itês kinda late. Why donêt we just spend the night here?"
Bernadette,Because we donêt live here.
Howard,I know.
Bernadette,"Do you? You said when you got back from space you were gonna move into my apartment, but half the time we stay here."
Howard,Thatês not true.
Howard,Thereês some underwear in the hamper.
Howard,"Thank you, I only put it on the list two weeks ago. Okay, I see what youêre getting at. How about this weekend Iêll box up all my things and move them to our place."
Bernadette,Thank you.
Howard,The lightsabres are gonna look great in the living room.
Bernadette,Or in the closet. We can decide later.
Howard,Let go of whatever piece of food youêre holding.
Leonard,"Hey, look whoês out after dark, like a big boy."
Sheldon,I was out raising heck with Mr. Wil Wheaton. Four hours more and we would have closed down the HomeTown Buffet.
Leonard,I thought you had plans with Amy.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I did, but then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S. She got huffy and left, then Wil and I headed out to dinner. That place really did remind me of my hometown. Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet."
Leonard,Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?
Sheldon,"Yes, quite the kerfuffle."
Leonard,Then Amy got mad and left?
Sheldon,Walked right out the door.
Leonard,And you?
Sheldon,Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price. The manager recognized Wil and let us sit right next to the frozen yoghurt machine. Right next to it. I was closer to it than I am to you right now.
Leonard,"Buddy, I think Amy might be upset."
Sheldon,Whyês that?
Leonard,"Because your friend was rude to her, and then you went to dinner with him."
Sheldon,Youêre just repeating what I said. Itês like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.
Leonard,"Trust me, call her."
Sheldon,"Fine. Itês a shame you didnêt go to dinner with us, because the buffet youêre about to enjoy only serves humble pie, a dessert much less tasty than frozen yoghurt. I was this close."
Sheldon,"Youêll appreciate this. Leonard has some ridiculous notion that youêre mad at me. Tell him youêre not mad at me. Go ahead, set him straight."
Amy,"Iêm mad at you, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Hmm. Eat one of your Luna bars. Very often when women think theyêre angry, theyêre really just hungry."
Amy,"Iêm not hungry. Your friend insulted me, and you didnêt do anything."
Sheldon,"Precisely, I didnêt do anything. Now does someone feel like checking her emotional math?"
Leonard,"Keep going, buddy, youêre doing great."
Amy,"Sheldon, Iêm your girlfriend, and you should have taken my side. Thatês it. End of story. Good night."
Sheldon,"Wow, Amyês mad and Leonard was right. What a weird day."
Penny,"Hey. Sorry this took so long. But you used to work here, you know how it is."
Bernadette,Kitchen slammed again?
Penny,"No, Iêm a terrible waitress, remember?"
Bernadette,"So, is there anything I can do to help you with the move tomorrow?"
Howard,"Now that you mention it, I was thinking tomorrow might not be great."
Bernadette,Whatês your excuse this time?
Howard,"No excuse. Itês just, you know, Iêm Jewish, and technically, weêre not supposed to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath. So this oneês on God."
Bernadette,That might be a little more convincing if you didnêt have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.
Howard,"My religionês kinda loosey-goosey. Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and donêt wear a cross, youêre good."
Bernadette,"Howie, you promised youêd move."
Howard,And I will.
Penny,"Yeah, right."
Howard,I will. Iêm obviously not going to live in my motherês house for the rest of my life. Iêm not a child.
Penny,Iêve seen her burp you.
Howard,"She did not burp me. She was patting me on the back, and I happened to burp. Donêt you have other tables you should be waiting on?"
Penny,"Yeah, but I told you, Iêm not good at my job. Bernadette, listen to me. He is never gonna leave."
Bernadette,Iêm starting to think youêre right.
Howard,"All right, Iêve had enough of this. Iêm a grown man, I have a successful career, for the love of God, Iêve been to space. I will move out when Iêm ready, and I donêt need anyone badgering me into it."
Penny,"Wow, excuse me."
Howard,That was just for her benefit. Iêll move tomorrow. I love you. Donêt leave me.
Sheldon, Angry Amy.
Sheldon,"Iêve been thinking about what happened, and I hope this gift will make things better."
Amy,Star Trek DVDs? Why would I want this?
Sheldon,"First of all, youêre welcome. And furthermore, not being familiar with Wil Wheatonês body of work, there was no way for you to know you were being rude to a national treasure. Get ready for 130 hours of I told you so.  Sheês hooked."
Raj,Wow. An end of an era.
Howard,"Boy, if these walls could talk."
Leonard,"Theyêd say, why does he touch himself so much?"
Howard,Yeah. I canêt believe Iêm not going to live here anymore. This has always been my bedroom. Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. Fifth grade. Sixth grade. Seventh grade. Eighth grade. Ninth grade."
Howard,"I remember when I was five, hiding under this desk with all my Halloween candy. Had some Peanut M&MêS, went into my first anaphylactic shock and had to be rushed to the hospital. Came home, celebrated with a Snickers, went into my second anaphylactic shock."
Raj,When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?
Howard,Sometime around the third Almond Joy.
Leonard,Okay. You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?
Howard,"Yeah, I guess. Hey, would you do me a favour? Go on ahead. I just want one last moment alone in my old room."
Leonard,Weêre not standing outside by the U-Haul while you fondle yourself.
Howard,"Fine, letês go."
Penny,Hey. What brings you in?
Sheldon,"Penny, if you wouldnêt mind, Iêd like to have a conversation about girls."
Penny,I had a feeling weêd have a talk like this sooner or later. Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?
Sheldon,"Penny, please, Iêm on the horns of a relationship dilemma. And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair by the time I was 19."
Penny,"And for the record, bleugh. So what are you drinking?"
Sheldon,"Well, itês been a rough day. I usually go chamomile tea, but I donêt think thatês going to cut it."
Penny,You could have a Long Island Iced Tea.
Sheldon,Will that calm my nerves?
Penny,Itês calmed the pants off me a couple of times.
Penny,"Oh. So, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?"
Sheldon,"The trouble isnêt with me, Penny, itês with your gender. Someday, scientists will discover that second X chromosome contains nothing but nonsense and twaddle."
Penny,"Yeah, Amy told me what happened. Look, just apologize. Itêll warm her twaddle."
Sheldon,"Itês a Band-Aid at best. See, the core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other. Which is baffling because theyêre both crazy about me. And I like them, which indicates theyêre bright and interesting and/or were on Star Trek."
Penny,"Honey, you canêt make people like each other."
Sheldon,"Not true. Leonard made me like you. And let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe. Cheers, pal. Ooh. Boy, that is a treat thatês hard to beat. Get the Mad Hatter on the horn, Iêm having a tea party."
Penny,You might want to pace yourself.
Sheldon,I drink tea all the time. I think I know what Iêm doing.
Penny,"Far be it from me to criticize a man with a full pubis. Look, Sheldon, your problem is not Wil Wheaton, okay? Your problem is the way you treated Amy."
Sheldon,My problem is Iêm out of tea.
Penny,"Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend and you just let him do it. I thought you Texas guys stood up for your womenfolk."
Sheldon,"Penny, please, I think Iêve evolved beyond my simple rustic upbringing."
Sheldon,"On the other hand, that low-down polecat done wronged my woman."
Penny,"Welcome to Long Island, Tex."
Sheldon,"Amy deserves better. You know, when we buy the Planterês deluxe mix, she eats all the Brazil nuts so I donêt have to look at them. Sheês a unique blend of saint and squirrel."
Penny,"Yeah, that she is. Here you go."
Sheldon,Iêm a callous egomaniac. Sheês gonna leave me.
Penny,"No, she wonêt."
Sheldon,"No, she wonêt. Iêm great."
Howard,"Okay, I have now officially moved out of my motherês house. You are now the only woman in my life who Iêll see naked in the bathroom."
Bernadette,I know this wasnêt easy. You doing okay?
Howard,"Oh, Iêm fine. Itês just her Iêm worried about."
Bernadette,"Aw, sheêll be okay. Sheês a grown woman."
Howard,"I know. Itês just ever since my dad left, Iêve felt responsible for her."
Bernadette,Thatês a lot for a kid to deal with.
Howard,"She was just so sad all the time. I was the only person who could cheer her up. Well, me and Ben and Jerry."
Bernadette,Sheês lucky you were there.
Howard,"You know, sheês why I first got into magic. I would do little shows for her, hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain, put on a top hat and cape. And part way through the act, I would say I needed a volunteer from the audience to be my beautiful assistant and invite her up on stage. I can still remember the way sheêd smile. For a few minutes, sheêd forget how lonely she was."
Bernadette,"Aw, crap. Letês go."
Howard,Where we going?
Bernadette,Grab a box. Weêll sleep at your motherês place tonight.
Howard,"No, but I want to live here."
Bernadette,"Well, you shouldêve thought of that before you told me the stupid magic trick story."
Howard,Canêt we talk about this?
Bernadette,No husband of mine is gonna break his motherês heart!
Sheldon," Wil Wheaton! Wait, how many was that?"
Sheldon,Wouldnêt you like to know?
Sheldon,Just tea. Sêthe best tea Iêve ever had.
Sheldon,Iêll tell you. Iêm from Texas. Need I say more?
Sheldon,You insulted my woman. Iêm here to defend her honour. Two! It was two.  Wil Wheaton! Now prepare yourself for what may come.
Sheldon,My fists are not up here because Iêm milking a giant invisible cow. Theyêre up to beat an apology out of you.
Sheldon,"Well, that was a long bus ride for not very much."
Sheldon,"Youêre asking a lot of questions, Wil Wheaton. As a matter of idle curiosity, which of your shrubberies do you feel would benefit from a thorough vomiting? Never mind, Iêll choose.  You were so good in Stand by Me."
Sheldon,"Hello, Iêm Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Get ready for a very special episode where we explore the flags of the popular entertainment franchise, Star Trek. And to help us, Iêm pleased to introduce a special guest, surprisingly, it only took gas money and the promise of free food to get him here, Mr. LeVar Burton."
Amy,"Cut. Yikes, this guy is worse than Wil Wheaton."
Sheldon,"I donêt know what sheês talking about, but Iêm obligated to agree with her. Sheês my girlfriend."
Raj,What are you drawing over there?
Sheldon,Itês a hypothetical containment field for a Frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.
Howard,"Oh, you silly doodlebug."
Leonard,"You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us."
Sheldon,"Itês a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard. You can block it with a Frisbee. Calm down. "
Howard,Do you expect me to build this?
Sheldon,I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. Gentlemen.
Howard,Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon always disappears every day at two forty-five?
Raj,He probably just goes to the bathroom.
Leonard,"Actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at eight a.m. with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre Fridays."
Raj,Itês sad that you know that.
Leonard,"Oh, thatês just the tip of the sadness iceberg."
Howard,"Iêm looking at his public calendar. Two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing. Yesterday, two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing, last week, nothing, last month, nothing. He never has anything booked during that time."
Raj,"Twenty minutes a day, completely unaccounted for."
Howard,We should figure out where he goes.
Raj,"Ooh, this is exciting. Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties."
Leonard,"Right, the case of who murdered three Saturday nights of my life?"
Howard,Colonel Koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread.
Raj,It was tapenade and you guys suck.
Penny,"So, how was work today?"
Leonard,"Well, I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection."
Penny,That sounds like fun.
Leonard,"Yeah, it was."
Penny,"Oh, good, I guessed right."
Leonard,Who you talking to?
Penny,"Oh, just this guy I met at school."
Leonard,"Oh, great. Weêre still dating, right?"
Penny,Relax. Heês just a friend. Weêre doing an oral report together. Heês really nice.
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, what was that? I had a little stroke after oral."
Penny,"Would you stop? Look, he just moved here from London, okay? He doesnêt really know anybody."
Leonard,"Oh, good, an English accent, the sexiest accent you can have."
Penny,"Thatês not true. Thereês French, thereês Italian. No, youêre right, itês the best."
Leonard,Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?
Penny,It didnêt come up.
Leonard,"Well, maybe you should tell him."
Penny,What am I supposed to say?
Leonard,"Say, canêt talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. England sucks, you suck, USA number one."
Penny,Fine. Hanging with my boyfriend. Talk to you later. Happy?
Leonard,Yes. Thank you.
Penny,Mm-hmm. Hmm.
Leonard,What did he say?
Penny,Did your boyfriend make you type that?
Leonard,I hate this guy.
Penny,Donêt be like that.
Leonard,"Come on, trust me, heês hitting on you."
Penny,"No, heês not. Weêre just friends. Look, is this gonna be a problem? Because heês supposed to come over tomorrow to work."
Leonard,Really? Here?
Penny,"If it makes you uncomfortable, Iêll switch partners, even though the thingês due next week and everyone already has a partner and Iêll probably end up failing the class."
Leonard,Thatêd be great. Thank you.
Howard,"Two forty-four, Right on schedule. Hey, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Oh, hello."
Howard,Raj and I are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny. Want to come with us?
Sheldon,"No, thank you."
Raj,"Are you sure? They turn off the lights, and itês like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place."
Sheldon,Iêm quite sure. Good day.
Howard,"Well, where are you going?"
Sheldon,Where are you going?
Raj,We just told you.
Sheldon,I just told you.
Howard,"No, you didnêt."
Sheldon,"Well, itês your word against mine; see you in court."
Howard,Should we follow him?
Raj,"I donêt know, Iêm torn. I want to know where heês going, but now I kind of want to play with the bunny."
Howard,"Hey, Alex, do you know where your boss just went?"
Howard,Donêt you know his schedule?
Howard,Come on.
Raj,"Boy, what I wouldnêt give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish."
Howard,This is where he goes? Whatês in there?
Raj,I think itês an old storage room.
Howard,What could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?
Raj,"Well, heês not doing twenty-minute abs, because if he were, he would have way better abs. Can you hear anything?"
Howard,Not yet. What are you doing?
Raj,Iêm listening.
Howard,Canêt you face the other way and listen?
Raj,"I canêt do anything right for you, can I?"
Howard,What the hell is he up to?
Raj,He is kind of a weirdo. Maybe heês got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there. Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.
Howard,Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?
Raj,"Howard, please, you canêt treat the man differently just because heês disabled. Thatês not okay."
Leonard,"If youêre wondering why Iêve been staring through the peephole, Iêm trying to get a look at this guy whoês coming over to Pennyês."
Sheldon,"To be honest, I didnêt know you were here."
Leonard,"Itês not a big deal. Heês just in her history class. Theyêre working on a project together. I donêt even know why I care. You know what, I donêt care."
Sheldon,You think you donêt care?
Leonard,This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.
Sheldon,"Oh, I donêt know. I mean, statistically speaking, Iêm sure you have something to worry about."
Leonard,What do you mean?
Sheldon,"Well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. Thatês one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade."
Leonard,"Well, yeah, but this isnêt just about looks. Iêm, Iêm way above average in a lot of other things."
Sheldon,"Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products."
Leonard,Iêm talking about important things like emotional maturity.
Sheldon,You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.
Leonard,I liked it better when you thought I wasnêt here.
Sheldon,"Iêm not saying you donêt have attractive qualities. Your choice of friends is impeccable, youêre a good sleeper, and last but not least, you buy the grapes I like. Youêre a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes."
Leonard,"None of this matters. I trust that Penny cares about me, and nothingês gonna happen with this guy."
Sheldon,"Well, unless of course heês a skilled hypnotist."
Sheldon,"While unlikely, itês still a statistical possibility. She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it."
Leonard,Now youêre just being ridiculous.
Sheldon,"Am I? The mindês a mysterious thing, Leonard. He could be having the time of his life while she thinks sheês a chicken pecking for corn."
Raj,"Look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars."
Howard,I think weêre more like ninjas.
Raj,"I donêt want to be a ninja, I want to be a cat burglar."
Howard,"Fine, Iêll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar."
Raj,"No, we both have to be the same thing. Okay, weêre ninjas."
Howard,Thank you.
Raj,"But next time, weêll be cat burglars."
Howard,Itês locked.
Raj,Are you sure?
Howard,"Yes, Iêm sure. Now, you stand guard, Iêm going toÑ"
Raj,Itês locked.
Howard,Just keep an eye out. Iêll have this open in a minute.
Raj,When did you learn how to pick locks?
Howard,"When I was starting to do magic in junior high, I thought I could be an escape artist like Harry Houdini."
Raj,How did that work out?
Howard,"Pretty good. I managed to escape friends, popularity, and every party thrown in a twelve mile radius. There. Ready?"
Raj,"Hold on, hold on."
Raj,"Sheldon is a very smart man, and he obviously wants to keep this a secret."
Howard,"Yeah, so?"
Raj,What if itês booby-trapped?
Howard,"Donêt worry, Iêm one step ahead of him."
Raj,"Great, whatês your plÑ "
Howard,Are we good?
Raj,Yeah. Huh. Forty-three? What the hell does that mean?
Howard,I donêt know. The solution to an equation?
Raj,Maybe. Itês a prime number. Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.
Howard,What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt?
Raj,Heês always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.
Howard,Itês paprika.
Raj,"Really? Well, oh, okay, one mystery solved."
Penny,"Thanks, Cole. See you at school."
Leonard,Iêll be right back.
Sheldon,I thought you left a long time ago.
Leonard,"You, uh, moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?"
Leonard,"Oh, cool. That cute blonde on four?"
Leonard,"I, well, I see her around. I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude."
Leonard,Yeah. Heês ganged up.
Leonard,Thatês the name of his gang. The Scientists. They are crazy.
Leonard,"No problem, brother. Stay frosty.  Weêre still dating, right?"
Leonard,"Hey, Alex, and call me Leonard. Dr. Hofstadter is my father. And my mother. And my sister. And our cat. Although, Iêm pretty sure Dr. Boots Hofstadterês degree was honorary."
Leonard,"Hey, Alex, let me ask you something. My girlfriend knows this guy at school. Heês got an English accent."
Leonard,"Yeah, you all do. Anyway, I feel like heês hitting on her. She says heês just being nice and that I should trust her."
Leonard,"Right. Because girls are always like, ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections. I got to get me some of that."
Leonard,"Trust me, it doesnêt."
Leonard,"Okay, I got to get back to work. Thanks for listening."
Leonard,Hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.
Raj,"Come on, weêre smart guys. We can figure this out."
Howard,Forty-three. What is forty-three? Besides my momês neck size.
Raj,Itês the atomic number for technetium.
Howard,That stuffês radioactive.
Raj,Do you think heês building a bomb?
Howard,"Ah, it took him two years to put together that Lego Death Star, Iêm not worried."
Raj,"Ooh, this could be something. forty-three is the number of calories in half a cup of fat-free yoghurt."
Howard,Why would you know that?
Raj,"Iêm sorry. We canêt all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. Wait, in the Hitchhikerês Guide to the Galaxy, isnêt forty-three the answer to the question of life, the universe,and everything?"
Howard,"Thatês forty-two, dumb-ass."
Raj,"Hey, hey. Feelings."
Howard,We should stop. Iêm exhausted.
Raj,"Yeah, me, too. Weêve got more important things to do. Who cares what stupid forty-three means?"
Howard,Not me.
Raj,Letês go home. You want to get something to eat?
Howard,Sounds good.
Raj,What the balls is forty-three?
Howard,I have to know!
Penny,"Hey, shouldnêt you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?"
Leonard,"Come on, Iêm sorry."
Penny,I just canêt believe you donêt trust me.
Leonard,"I do, of course I do."
Penny,"Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend, who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?"
Penny,Your pictureês on my refrigerator.
Leonard,"Oh. You know, Iêm really starting to not like this guy."
Penny,What is your problem? Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?
Leonard,"I donêt know. It-it-itês hard sometimes. Everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if Iêm standing right there. And theyêre all taller than me. Why is everyone taller than me? You know what, this is all in my head. Itês my problem, not yours."
Penny,"Leonard, why do you always do this? Listen to me, youêre the one Iêm with. You know I love you, so will you please relax because youêre driving me crazy."
Leonard,You know thatês the first time you ever said that you love me.
Leonard,Weêre just supposed to pretend itês not a big deal?
Penny,"Thatês exactly what weêre gonna do because youêre about to make me cry, and we both know if I start crying, youêre gonna start crying."
Leonard,"Youêre right, you should go."
Penny,All right.
Howard,"Okay, pictureês up. Looks like the cameraês working."
Raj,Thatês good quality video.
Howard,It better be. Itês the spare camera for the Mars rover.
Raj,How did you get your hands on that?
Howard,"Million dollar camera, ten dollar lock."
Raj,"Oh, my God, here he comes. This is it."
Howard,What the hell is that thing?
Raj,I donêt know.
Sheldon,This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Experimental log. Wormhole generator test forty-four.
Howard,Wormhole generator test? 
Sheldon,The first forty-three parallel universes Iêve checked proved to be empty. I see no reason to suspect universe number forty-four will be any different. 
Howard,"Oh, my God!"
Raj,Holy crap!
Sheldon,Oh! Itês eating my face!
Raj,Aah! Itês eating his face!
Sheldon,I found your webcam and replaced the video feed. You two should be ashamed of yourselves.
Raj,"Sheldon, weêre really sorry."
Howard,"Yeah, really sorry."
Sheldon,"Sorry? You may not realize it, but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want to. Itês exhausting. Which is why, for twenty minutes a day, I like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge."
Howard,But what are you doing in there?
Raj,And what does forty-three mean?
Sheldon,"You donêt need to know, you donêt deserve to know, and you will never know."
Raj,"Yeah, well, I know how to make your egg salad now."
Sheldon,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eightÑ Drat. Iêm never going to get to forty-three again. One, two, three, fourÑ Rats."
Leonard,They are not.
Raj,"They are, too."
Leonard,Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed by all the data. Youêre just clinging to it out of intellectual stubbornness.
Raj,"No, youêre displaying a shocking ignorance of the subject matter. Mummies and zombies are the exact same thing."
Leonard,"Oh, yeah? Mummies are wrapped in bandages."
Raj,Thatês called a fashion choice.
Leonard,"All right, you brought this on yourself. Sheldon, get him."
Sheldon,"If a zombie bites you, you turn into a zombie. However, if a mummy bites you, all you turn into is some schmo with a mummy bite. So, like a zombie, thatês been eaten from the waist down, you, sir, have no leg to stand on."
Leonard,Good boy. Hereês a cookie.
Sheldon,"Oh, thank you."
Howard,"Hey, fellas, whatês going on?"
Leonard,"Oh, mummies and zombies again."
Howard,"Oh, theyêre not the same thing."
Leonard,"You get a cookie, too."
Howard,Thanks. Guess who picked up his new car this morning?
Raj,Congratulations. Does it have that new car smell?
Howard,"Yep. For as long as I can keep my mother out of it. If you want to check it out later, itês parked right out front, space 294."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, 294?"
Sheldon,Thatês my parking spot.
Raj,Why do you have a parking spot? You donêt have a car. You donêt even drive.
Sheldon,It doesnêt matter. Thatês my spot.
Leonard,Maybe they reassigned it because you never use it.
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm not using my nipples, either. Maybe they should reassign those."
Howard,"Sheldon, someday, if you get a car, Iêm sure theyêll give you another parking space."
Sheldon,"I donêt want another parking space. I want my parking space. Itês perfect. Itês a corner spot, cutting the risk of door-dings in half. Itês a mere 28 steps from the building entrance. The nearby tree provides shade on hot days and is also home to a delightful squirrel. Which is fortuitous because most squirrels are real jerks."
Howard,"Fun story. Meanwhile, you still donêt have a car."
Sheldon,Donêt try to change the subject. This is about a parking space. It has nothing to do with cars.
Howard,Are you listening to yourself?
Sheldon,"I always listen to myself. Itês one of the great joys of my life. Now, get your car out of my spot."
Sheldon,Very well. You leave me no choice.
Sheldon,"What are you looking at, you stupid squirrel?"
Sheldon,"President Siebert, listen to reason. Yeah, I understand I donêt use the parking spot, but thatês not the point. IÑ Yes, Iêm aware you told me not to call you at home, but you didnêt answer the door. And I know you were there, because I saw you through the mail slot. Yeah, well, thatês some salty language. May I remind you that youêre the president of a major university, not the president of the Potty Mouth Club. There it is again. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? Oh, well, Iêm sorry for your loss. Good night, sir. Unbelievable. He says Wolowitz deserves my spot because heês a high-profile asset to the university."
Leonard,"Well, heês not wrong. Howard did go to the International Space Station."
Sheldon,"Yeah, that was five weeks ago. How much longer is he gonna milk that cow?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, let it go. Itês not a big deal."
Sheldon,"No, no, this is a slippery slope, Leonard. It starts with a parking space, where does it end? Itês like my dad always said, first they say you canêt drink and drive, next thing you know, you canêt let your 10-year-old take the wheel while you sleep one off in the backseat."
Leonard,All that story does is make me feel bad for your mother.
Sheldon,"Leonard, youêre my best friend. Why donêt you ever take my side?"
Leonard,Because I can never understand your side.
Howard,Give it back.
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, but could you be more specific?"
Howard,My Iron Man helmet. Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.
Sheldon,"Oh, that. Well, see, I wanted it, and you werenêt using it. Apparently, those are the rules we live by now. Payback, it truly is the B word, isnêt it?"
Howard,"Sheldon, that is a five hundred dollar limited edition collectible, and I want it back."
Sheldon,"Iêd love to help you out, but unfortunately , Iêm using it."
Howard,Fine. Iêm taking your diploma.
Sheldon,Go ahead. Thatês the only doctorate youêll ever get. It smells funny in here.
Bernadette,"Weêre so proud of you, Amy. Your first bikini wax."
Penny,"Yeah. So, how you doing?"
Amy,"A little sensitive, but not bad. Does it always take that long?"
Penny,"Uh, no, they usually donêt have to go out and get more wax."
Amy,I feel like Iêm five pounds lighter.
Bernadette,Really? Only five?
Penny,"Hey, anybody want a drink?"
Bernadette,"Okay. So, did you spend last night hearing about this silly parking space fight, too?"
Amy,"For hours. Fortunately, I couldnêt understand most of it êcause Sheldon was wearing that stupid robot mask."
Bernadette,Howard was so angry I had to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream to get him to fall asleep.
Amy,"I guess this is what we get for being with two testosterone-fueled alpha males. At some point, theyêre bound to lock horns."
Penny,Iêm assuming these are some kind of horns they bought at Comic-Con?
Bernadette,Iêm really sorry they took Sheldonês spot away. He shouldnêt have to suffer just because Howardês such a big deal now.
Amy,"I know, Sheldon should just let Howard have his little moment in the sun."
Bernadette,Whatês that supposed to mean?
Amy,"Well, I mean, Howardês never gonna go to space again, but Sheldon will always be a genius."
Bernadette,"Youêre right. And Iêm sure Sheldon will get a fancy parking spot again, if and when he makes a worthwhile contribution to science."
Amy,If and when?
Penny,"Okay, maybe we should change the subject. Um, Amy, how are your lady parts? Still chilly down there?"
Bernadette,Hang on. None of Sheldonês theories have ever been definitively proven. My husband actually went to outer space.
Amy,Thatês an impressive accomplishment. Heês now an inspiration to millions of Americans who know you donêt have to be special or even qualified to go into space.
Penny,"You know, I remember the first time I got a bikini wax. My sister did it with melted Crayolas and duct tape. Itês a bad idea."
Bernadette,"Gosh, Amy. Iêm sensing a little hostility. Is it maybe because, like Sheldonês work, your sex life is also theoretical?"
Amy,"Yeah, well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon wonêt be thinking about his mother. And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howardês lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb."
Penny,"Anyway, to this day, I still canêt see a box of crayons without crossing my legs."
Bernadette,"I donêt have to take this. Iêm gonna go home and have sex with my husband right now. Maybe Iêll let him do it to me in the parking spot. Which sounds dirty, but I didnêt mean it that way,"
Raj,"Okay, hereês another one: If a zombie bites a vampire, and the vampire bites a human, does the human become a vampire or a zombie? Or a zompire?"
Leonard,I donêt have any.
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm not giving it away. "
Howard,Hi Sheldon.
Sheldon,"Heês in my spot. Leonard, make him stop being naked in my spot."
Leonard,"Howard, what are you doing?"
Howard,He wasnêt using it. And I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on.
Sheldon,Get off there.
Howard,Give me back my Iron Man helmet.
Sheldon,Give me back my parking space.
Howard,You donêt need a parking space. You donêt have a car.
Sheldon,You donêt need an Iron Man helmet. Youêre not Iron Man.
Howard,"Well, we appear to have reached an impasse. And you know, I have to say, I thought youêd be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk."
Raj,I didnêt pick up on that. Thatês a nice touch.
Amy,This is so exciting. Iêm feeling all tingly. Although that could just be my newly defoliated bikini zone.
Sheldon,Keep a lookout. This place is swarming with campus security. They will not hesitate to scold us.
Amy,Freaking pigs.
Sheldon,"Oh, yeah. Okay, now, pull your car into the spot and letês get out of here."
Amy,"Wait, Iêm leaving my car here?"
Sheldon,"Yes, and be sure and put on the emergency brake. Really makes these things tough to budge."
Amy,"Before I park, come in the back seat. I want to show you something I had done today."
Sheldon,"All right, colour me intrigued."
Amy,What do you think?
Sheldon,"I think youêre high on paint fumes. And boy, thatês a lot of Band-Aids."
Penny,"Okay, Howardês mother is in, like, every one of your wedding photos."
Bernadette,"What can I tell ya? Sheês a big girl. Wherever you look, there she is. More coffee?"
Penny,"No, Leonardês taking me to a physics lecture, and coffeeêll just keep me awake.  Oh, Iêll get it."
Amy,"Oh, looks like someoneês on Team Bernadette. Whereês Howard?"
Bernadette,Heês not here. Whatês wrong?
Amy,He had my car towed. It cost me two hundred dollars to get it back.
Bernadette,"Oh, no. Where was it parked?"
Amy,In Sheldonês spot.
Bernadette,That doesnêt make sense. Sheldon doesnêt have a spot. Was it maybe in Howardês spot?
Amy,"Donêt play dumb with me, sister. You tell your husband he owes me two hundred dollars."
Bernadette,"Well, that doesnêt make sense, either."
Amy,Why not?
Bernadette,Because Iêm the one who had it towed.
Bernadette,"Didnêt see that one coming, did ya?"
Amy,"Oh, yeah? Well, youêre not gonna see this coming. "
Penny,Ow! Ow!
Amy,"Oh, my God,"
Bernadette,Are you okay?!
Penny,"You idiot, what the hell do you have in there?!"
Amy,"Just my wallet, keys and a coffee can full of change Iêve been meaning to take to the bank."
Bernadette,Donêt move. Iêll get some ice.
Amy,Are you okay?
Penny,Get away from me or I swear to God I will rip out whatês left of your pubes!
Penny,Thanks. Ah!
Bernadette,"Amy, you think maybe this has gotten a little out of hand?"
Penny,"Gee, you think?"
Amy,"I do. Penny, Bernadette and I are sorry."
Bernadette,You hit her! What did I do?
Amy,You had my car towed.
Bernadette,You were parked in Howardês spot.
Amy,I was parked in Sheldonês spot.
Bernadette,Sheldon doesnêt have a spot.
Penny,"Guys, I think I need to go to the emergency room."
Bernadette,"Okay, letês go."
Amy,Iêll drive. You can see where the tow truck scratched my car.
Bernadette,The tow truck didnêt scratch your car.
Amy,How do you know?
Bernadette,‚Cause I did it!
Sheldon,"Morning, Professor Stevens. Donêt look at that whiteboard. Thatês my math, not your math. Keep walking, nosey."
Howard,What the hell are you doing?
Sheldon,"Oh. You said Iêm not using my space, so Iêm using it."
Howard,"Okay, you need to move now."
Sheldon,"No, I donêt."
Howard,You canêt stay there forever.
Sheldon,"Actually, I have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says I can. Give up, Wolowitz. Youêve chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you canêt defeat. There is nothing you could possibly do toÑ "
Howard,"Those arenêt gonna help you, Sheldon,"
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, they are. I mean, what?"
Howard,"Iêm warning you, Sheldon!"
Sheldon,"Your threats are empty, nothing can move me.  Stop that."
Howard,Get out of my spot.
Sheldon,Thatês it. I am calling campus security. You prepare for the scolding of your life.
Leonard,What are you idiots doing?
Sheldon,"Heês trying to kill me, Leonard. Video games and rock music have desensitized him to violence."
Howard,Would you please talk some sense into your lunatic roommate?
Leonard,Youêre both acting like lunatics. Itês just a parking spot.
Howard,Itês not just a parking spot. He canêt handle the fact that Iêm a bigger deal than he is now.
Sheldon,"Oh, preposterous. I have been solely responsible for this universityês six loop quantum gravity calculations, I have changed the way we think about Bose-Einstein condensates, and I am also the one who got Nutter Butters in the cafeteria vending machine. Maybe you missed that news while you were floating around like a goof in outer space. Now, if youêll excuse me, I have work to do."
Howard,Can you believe this guy?
Leonard,What I donêt believe is that you tried to run him over.
Howard,"Oh, like youêve never thought of doing that. Donêt hate me just because I lived the dream.  "
Sheldon,"Hey, sweet ride."
Howard,What are you doing in there?
Sheldon,Just breaking in your new car.
Howard,Stop that. You stop that.
Sheldon,You know what they say? Revenge is a dish best served nude.
Raj,"Hey, got a minute?"
Sheldon,"Oh, of course, come in.  This is an authentic Chinese throwing star, and I must warn you, I have seen many people throw them in movies."
Raj,Calm down. Howard has something he wants to say to you.
Howard,"All right. Sheldon, when this whole thing with the parking space started, I had no idea just how much of a crazy bastardÑ"
Raj,"Howard, thatês not how we practiced it."
Howard,"I had no idea how much that spot meant to you. Anyway, I called President Siebert and told him itês not worth fighting over the spot, so you keep it, and Iêll park in the structure across the street."
Sheldon,"Well, Howard, thank you. Itês quite a gesture on your part. Youêve shown yourself to be the bigger man."
Howard,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Which I find totally unacceptable. I must be the bigger man. Therefore, you may use my spot until such time as I learn to drive or get a Batmobile."
Howard,"Wow, okay. Well, thanks. I donêt know what to say."
Sheldon,There is nothing to say. Except Iêm the bigger man. Iêm not kidding. Say it.
Raj,Just say it.
Howard,"Youêre the bigger man, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Oh, stop. And I believe this is yours. FYI, if you wear that into a bank, they will tackle you to the ground."
Howard,"Iêd like to propose a toast, to burying the hatchet."
Sheldon,To burying the hatchet.
Bernadette,"You know, Iêm kind of glad this happened."
Amy,"Me, too. In some weird way, I kind of feel like it brought us closer."
Penny,"Yeah, everybodyês happy, great."
Sheldon,"Yes. According to information I gleaned from Yelp, you had great success when a santeriasuzy37 brought you a pair of leather slacks stained with chicken blood. I believe I may have a similar problem. This cushion experienced a nude revenge wiggle."
Sheldon,"A naked man sat on it. Now, hereês my concern, his diet is rich in fatty deli meats. What test do you have to detect lipid residue?"
Sheldon,"Lipid residue. An anal autograph. A colon calling card, if you will."
Sheldon,Donêt rush it. We may be dealing with befoulment on a molecular level.
Sheldon,Is that your son?
Sheldon,"Looks like that laptopês seen better days. If youêre interested, Iêm selling this. Itês only two years old, 16 gigabytes of RAM, Intel core i7 processor, and I can personally guarantee it has spent less than 20 minutes resting on an astronautês penis."
Sheldon,Is anyone else troubled by the Spider-Man theme song?
Leonard,"Why would it trouble you? Itês, like, your third favourite cartoon theme song."
Sheldon,"It is, right behind do-do-do-do-do Inspector Gadget., and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, heroes in a half-shell."
Sheldon,"However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit that Spider-Man, Spider-Man does whatever a spider can."
Howard,"Yeah, so?"
Sheldon,"I can think of many things Spider-Man canêt do that a spider can. One, crawl in your ear and die. Two, legally leave Guatemala without a passport. Three, have sex with a spider."
Raj,an we change the subject? Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.
Howard,Itês heebie-jeebies.
Raj,"I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic. Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight. The theme, movies that killed their franchises."
Leonard,"Oh. Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1."
Raj,"Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous. I mean, you know a movieês bad when my homegirl Sandy B canêt save it."
Leonard,"Pennyês working tonight, Iêm in."
Howard,Not me. Iêm having dinner with Bernadette and her parents.
Leonard,Fun. We know how much you love that.
Howard,Itês torture. Especially with her dad. We have nothing in common.
Sheldon,"You know what I like to do when Iêm forced to speak with those beneath my intellectual station? I bring up an interesting topic, like the difference between Spider-Man and spiders."
Howard,"Thanks, Sheldon. Iêll try that with my father-in-law."
Sheldon,"No, you canêt use that one. Thatês mine. Uh, try this one for an ice-breaker. Uh, despite popular lore, there is no place in the continental United States, Alaska or Hawaii from which one can dig straight through the centre of the earth and come up in China."
Howard,"Great, thank you."
Sheldon,"Actually, you canêt have that one either. Itês too good. Sorry."
Raj,"What about you, Sheldon? Do you have any plans tonight?"
Sheldon,"Sadly, yes. Amyês taking me to a memorial service. Itês for one of her colleagues who is of Asian descent, so my planned conversational gambit is to casually remark that no matter how deep they dig his grave, heêll never make his way back to China."
Leonard,That should lighten the mood.
Sheldon,What can I say? I put the fun in funeral.
Sheldon, Amy.
Amy,"Hello, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Iêm not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer neck tie, but you can wear a bathrobe?"
Amy,I think Iêm too sick to go to the funeral.
Sheldon,"Youêre sick? You poor kid. Well, see ya."
Amy,"Sheldon, arenêt you gonna take care of me?"
Sheldon,"Me? No, Iêm not that kind of doctor."
Amy,"But our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick, the other must take care of them."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, I see the confusion. No, the intent behind that clause was to force you to take care of me when Iêm ill. When youêre feeling better, youêll think thatês funny."
Amy,"Never mind. Good night, Sheldon."
Sheldon," Amy. I made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this. Additionally, you are my girlfriend, and I care about your well-being."
Amy,"Thank you, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Youêre welcome. Now letês get this over with.
Howard,"So, how have you been?"
Howard,Good. Fine is good. How you liking retirement?
Howard,Iêm sensing a theme. You ever really think about the Spider-Man theme song? Howês that dinner coming?
Bernadette,I just put it in. Itês gonna be a while.
Howard,I like rare chicken. Letês do this.
Bernadette,You could die.
Howard,Death by chicken. Thatês a pretty fowl way to go.
Howard,"So, Mrs. Rostenkowski, you took that trip to the Grand Canyon. How was it?"
Howard,Had no idea you were the chatty one.
Sheldon,102.2. Exactly what it was half an hour ago. Itês like youêre not even trying to get better.
Amy,"Sheldon, you donêt get over the flu in half an hour."
Sheldon,"Well, not with that attitude."
Amy,"I have to say, Iêm finding your bedside manner a little lacking."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry. I just want you to get better as soon as possible. And with that goal in mind, let me ask you a question. Do you believe in the placebo effect?"
Amy,Of course I do. There have been many studies proving its validity.
Sheldon,"Great. Now, this may look like a Tic Tac, but it is really a powerful medication specifically designed to cure your illness as well as freshen your breath."
Amy,"Sheldon, this isnêt helping. Why donêt you just let me get some rest."
Sheldon,"How can you sleep? Iêm not done making you feel better. I still have to put a cold rag on your head, sing to you and apply VapoRub to your chest."
Amy,"You, you want to rub something on my chest?"
Sheldon,Yes. All over it.
Amy,Maybe we should start with that.
Sheldon,"Now youêre being a responsible patient. Now, you may notice some tingling."
Amy,"Oh, Iêm counting on it."
Howard,"Okay, dig in."
Howard,Took the words right out of my mouth.
Bernadette,"So, Dad, have you done any fishing lately?"
Howard,"Oh, you like to fish?"
Howard,Sure. I can hear it in your voice.
Howard,"You know, I hadnêt thought of that.  Help me."
Bernadette,"Hey, Dad, maybe you could take Howard fishing sometime. Give you guys a chance to get to know each other better."
Howard,"No, no. We know each other well enough. Heês been talking my ear off all night."
Bernadette,"Howie, I think youêd have fun."
Bernadette,Terrific. My two favorite fellas gone fishinê.
Howard,"Well, hang on a second, Bernie. Next weekend, we have that thing."
Bernadette,What thing?
Howard,"You know, the thing."
Bernadette,"Oh, that thing. No, I cancelled that thing."
Howard,Great.  Thanks for the help.
Howard,Iêve never even been fishing. This is gonna be a disaster.
Raj,"If you donêt want to look foolish doing something, you should practice. Do you know how many Beef Wellingtons I made by myself before I invited you guys over? Iêll give you a hint. You can see them here, here and here."
Leonard,Raj is probably right. You should get someone to give you some pointers.
Howard,Do either of you guys know how to fish?
Raj,"But if you catch anything, I know how to steam it in banana leaves."
Howard,"Come on, we must know somebody who can do manly stuff like this."
Penny,"Step one, worms."
Penny,"Okay, right there, ew is one of the things youêre not gonna want to say in front of your father-in-law. Itês right up there with icky and get it away. Now pick one up."
Penny,Youêre gonna have to do it when youêre fishing.
Penny,What are you waiting for?
Howard,"I donêt know, for them to die of natural causes."
Penny,Just pick up a worm and put him on this hook.
Howard,Fine. There.
Leonard,"Iêm no expert, but I think the hook has to go through the worm."
Howard,"Fine. Sorry, Mr. Worm. Sherm. Sherm the Worm."
Penny,"Hey, donêt name him. Just jab a hook in his face."
Raj,"You got this, buddy."
Leonard,"Yeah, come on, Howard. Hook that worm."
Raj,You can do it.
Penny,"Thatês great. Cheerleading, way to man things up."
Sheldon,"And the control group displayed significantly fewer genetic abnormalities. But, because of flaws in the experimental design relating to environment and diet, they lived inconclusively ever after. The end."
Amy,That was great. Rub my chest again.  
Sheldon,"I need to get you down for a nap. And for some reason, that VapoRub gets you all fired up. "
Bernadette,Howês the poor thing?
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm hanging in there. Thanks for asking."
Bernadette,"Okay, Amy, I brought you some drugs we were working on in the lab. This is proving really good for congestion, but thereês a slight chance it can make your tears burn like acid, so if you take it, happy thoughts."
Sheldon,"Uh, Iêm going to draw you a soothing bath. Whereês your bath thermometer?"
Amy,I donêt have a bath thermometer.
Sheldon,Fine. Then Iêm going to draw you a nerve-wracking bath of indeterminate temperature.
Bernadette,This is a really good expectorant. Although some test subjects reported lactating uncontrollably when they heard music.
Amy,"Okay, okay, hereês the deal. I donêt need your medicine. Iêm not sick."
Bernadette,I donêt understand.
Amy,I got better two days ago. Itês just been so nice having Sheldon take care of me.
Bernadette,So youêve just been lying to him?
Amy,See the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement.
Bernadette,"I donêt mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do."
Amy,All right. Iêll tell him.
Sheldon,"Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?"
Amy,Iêll tell him tomorrow. Mama needs a bath.
Penny,"Now, letês assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a fish. Youêre going to have to know how to gut it. So, what youêre going to do is youêre going to take your knife, slice him right up the belly.  You want me to stop?"
Howard,"No, Iêm fine. Keep going."
Penny,"All right. Now, you donêt want to cut too deep into its guts, or the blood will just squirt all over your face.  Oh, my God. What is with you guys?"
Leonard,Itês not our fault. Our dads never did anything like this with us.
Penny,never?
Leonard,"My dad was an anthropologist. The only father-son time he spent was with a 2,000-year-old skeleton of an Etruscan boy. I hated that kid."
Raj,"Mine just took me to his gynecology office. I got so bored, Iêd put vaginal lubricant on the bottom of my shoes and pretend I was ice-skating."
Howard,"Yeah, well, my quality father-son time was spending my adolescence looking out the window waiting for my dad to come back someday."
Raj,"Yeah, okay, Howard wins."
Leonard,"You know, maybe we didnêt have opportunities like this when we were growing up, but right now, thereês a dad that wants to take you on a fishing trip."
Howard,Youêre right. Oh! I should do this.
Penny,"Great. Here you go. What youêre going to do is youêre going to stick your thumb down its throat, grab the guts and pull."
Howard,Here we go. Oh!
Penny,"Oh, look, itês a female. You can see all the eggs. "
Amy,"Oh, Sheldon, am I glad youêre back. Taking a turn for the worst. I think Iêm going to need another bath."
Sheldon,"Iêm surprised to hear that. See, the other day, I was concerned that you werenêt recovering, so while you were sleeping, I took a cheek swab and had it cultured in the lab."
Sheldon,"I got the results back. Have you developed any of the following symptoms? A growing nose, or perhaps a warm sensation in the trouser region? Also known as full-blown liar, liar, pants on fire."
Amy,"All right, all right. But I really was sick at the beginning. Itês just been so nice having you take care of me."
Sheldon,"It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy. I thought our relationship was based on trust and a mutual admiration that skews in my favour."
Amy,I feel terrible I did this.
Sheldon,"It pains me to say it, but I think some form of penalty is in order, so as to discourage this type of behaviour in the future."
Amy,I suppose thatês fair. What do you suggest?
Sheldon,"In a perfect world, Iêd lock you in a stockade in the public square. That probably requires a permit."
Amy,I could not be allowed to go to the opening of the next Star Trek movie.
Sheldon,"Oh, that seems overly harsh. I mean, you gave in to a human weakness, you didnêt kill a man. You know, itês a tad old-school, but my father was not one to spare the rod when my brother would sneak into his truck and drink his driving whiskey."
Amy,Are you saying you want to spank me?
Sheldon,I donêt want to. But it looks like you left me no choice.
Amy,Thatês true. Iêve been a very bad girl.
Howard,"Hi-ho, hi-ho, itês off to fish we go."
Howard,No good? The guy at the sporting goods store said these are what fishermen wear.
Howard,Wish I had known that before I posted all those pictures on Facebook.
Howard,"Wait, now weêre shooting things?"
Howard,"Sir, Iêm flattered that you invited me, and I really want you to like me, but I donêt think this trip is the way to do it. And I canêt return these things if thereês chunks of duck all over them."
Howard,‚Cause Bernadette made me.
Howard,"Really? Your wife makes you do stuff? Youêre a big, scary cop."
Howard,"So, what do we do now? They expect us to go away for the weekend."
Howard,"No, but Iêm not a stranger to dice games. I was the Temple Beth-El Hebrew School Yahtzee champion."
Howard,"Really? Thank you, sir."
Howard,"Okay. Oh, boy, weêre just married to a couple of ballbusters, huh, Mike?"
Howard,Great couple of gals.
Sheldon,Are you prepared to receive your punishment?
Amy,One second. I want to put on some music.
Amy,I donêt want to disturb the people next door while you discipline me.
Sheldon,"Very well, then. Get over my knee. Letês begin."
Amy,"Oh, my."
Sheldon,Excuse me. Youêre not supposed to be enjoying this.
Amy,Then maybe you should spank me harder.
Sheldon,Maybe I will.
Penny,"Okay, now holding sides of hearth in position, lower mantelpiece assembly onto top tabs."
Leonard,"Look at that, I built a fireplace with my own two hands."
Penny,Youêre so butch.
Leonard,"Aw, I got a little paper cut."
Penny,Of course you did. Your hands are softer than veal.
Leonard,"Oh, before I forget, Saturday Iêm planning a little Dungeons and Dragons night with the guys."
Penny,Really? Thatês how youêre gonna spend your Saturday night?
Leonard,"Oh, come on, I hardly ever get a chance to play anymore."
Penny,"Oh, you poor thing. Is having a real-life girlfriend who has sex with you getting in the way of your board games?"
Leonard,"Little bit, yeah."
Amy,"Oh, great! Iêve always wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons."
Sheldon,"Yeah, oh, Iêm sorry. I shouldêve mentioned this earlier. Youêre not invited."
Amy,Why not?
Sheldon,"Amy, from time to time, we men need to break free from the shackles of civility and get in touch with our primal animalistic selves."
Amy,By rolling dice and playing make-believe with little figurines?
Sheldon,"Yeah, like a bunch of savages."
Bernadette,Saturday night? But Iêve been working late all week. That was gonna be our night.
Howard,"But I have to go. We play as a group. If-if Iêm not there, then everyone will blame you. Theyêll be all, Bernadette ruined everything. Sheês the worst. So, you see? I have to play Dungeons and Dragons for the marriage."
Bernadette,Youêre an idiot.
Howard,Iêm your idiot. Forever.
Raj,"So, listen, I know we talked about getting a bite to eat in Silver Lake, and then seeing the Christmas lights in Griffith Park, but Leonardês talking about a big D and D game at his place."
Leonard,"All right, Sheldon, to start our quest you need to open this little Christmas gift I got you."
Sheldon,A Christmas gift? You know I donêt enjoy Christmas.
Sheldon,"Oh, where to begin? Trees indoors. Overuse of the words êtis and êtwas. And the absurd custom of one stocking. Everyone knows socks belong in pairs. Who uses one sock?"
Sheldon,"Actually that helps, thank you."
Leonard,Would you just look inside?
Sheldon,"Oh, a scroll. I like scrolls. Theyêre my third favourite system of transmitting the written word. After stone tablets and skywriting. You have all been summoned to join a thrilling Dungeons and Dragons adventure. Your quest begins in a secret northern village of elves who have all been massacred. I like where this is heading. Your task is to rescue their leader from a dungeon of ogres. Oh, thatês a saucy twist. That leaderês name, Santa Claus. No, no, no."
Leonard,"Itês actually ho, ho, ho, but youêll get the hang of it. Thought itêd be fun to make a quest with a holiday theme."
Sheldon,"Fun? Mixing Dungeons and Dragons with Christmas is like making a sandwich of grape jelly, the best-tasting jelly, and petroleum jelly, the worst-tasting jelly."
Leonard,"Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in the smoking remains of Santaês village. Clearly, a great battle has taken place."
Raj,"Oh, man, the first monster I see, Iêm gonna sneak up behind him, whip out my wand, and shoot my magic all over his ass."
Leonard,"Okay, there are ogre tracks and a trail of broken candy canes in the snow. Sheldon, what do you do?"
Sheldon,I signal my contempt for your cruel plan to shove Christmas joy down my throat by making a gesture that says get a load of this guy.
Leonard,"Fine. Howard, what do you do?"
Howard,"I follow the ogre tracks, checking for secret doors along the way."
Leonard,And you discover a secret door leading to a dark corridor.
Howard,"Okay, guys, letês make a plan, spell casters in the back, warriors in the front."
Raj,"No, screw that noise, Iêm going in. Hang on, Santa, Iêm coming for you."
Leonard,"Okay, you run into a room full of weapons, hit a trip wire, a cannon blows your face off, you die, youêre out of the game."
Raj,"But, a cannon? Am I really out of the game?"
Leonard,"Okay, come on, moving on."
Raj,"Wait, doesnêt anyone have a rod of resurrection? Because if youêve got one, I need it bad. Get in here with your rod and give it to me."
Penny,"Hey, guys. I donêt mean to interrupt your little game, but I thought youêd like to see what youêre missing out on. So, Bernadette? Bernadetteês wearing leopard-print pumps and a rack-tastic red dress from Forever 21. And thereês Amy, showing all kinds of ankle. In an outfit Iêm assuming is from Forever 63. And I, myself am wearing a little number that got me out of two speeding tickets and jury duty."
Sheldon,"I know theyêre making a rhetorical point, I just donêt know what it is."
Penny,"See you, boys. We are going drinking."
Raj,"Uh, wait, can I come with you? My character died."
Bernadette,"Sorry, Raj, itês girlsê night out."
Amy,Maybe another time.
Penny,Come on.
Raj,"Ooh! Girlsê night, girlsê night! Ooh! Ooh!"
Amy,"So, whatês the plan? Are we gonna teach our fellas a lesson by getting stinking drunk, luring strange men into the bathroom, and turning the toilet stall into a temple of the senses?"
Amy,"Geez, whoês Forever 63 now?"
Raj,Can we get another bottle of champagne for the table? Donêt worry. Itês my treat.
Penny,"Wow, you should come to girlsê night more often. And not just because if you werenêt here, this would be a can of Pabst."
Raj,"My pleasure, nothing makes me happier than the chance to spoil a lady. Just ask my dog. My vet says if I give her any more foie gras, sheês going to die of gout."
Bernadette,"Hey, letês help Raj meet a girl tonight."
Raj,"No, no, no, Iêm fine."
Penny,"Okay, wait, are we talking one-night stand or do we want to get him into a relationship?"
Amy,Letês get him laid!
Raj,Stop it. Youêre ruining girlsê night.
Penny,"Raj, youêre a great guy, youêre in a bar full of single women, let us help you."
Bernadette,"Yeah, youêre a real catch. I know youêre shy, but that doesnêt mean you shouldnêt have someone wonderful in your life."
Raj,Thatês sweet of you. But what can you do to help?
Bernadette,"Weêll nose around, see if we can find a nice girl, and then introduce you."
Raj,"Okay. Well, a couple of things. Donêt tell them I come from money. I want them to love me for me. They must be insanely hot. Like, nines or tens."
Penny,Nines or tens?
Raj,"Okay, an eight is acceptable if sheês willing to bring another eight to the hot tub."
Bernadette,"Bottom line, youêll take any woman whoêll have you, right?"
Raj,In a New Delhi minute.
Leonard,"Oh, uh, yeah. I got êem on Amazon."
Leonard,"I know, but when I shop online, I can do it on the toilet."
Howard,Can we please move this along?
Leonard,"Yeah, sorry. Uh, you come to the end of the tunnel and find a large chest. What do you do? And, Howard, do not say, I feel up the large chest."
Howard,"Excuse me, Iêm a married man now. I wasnêt going to say anything so juvenile."
Leonard,Great. What do you do?
Howard,"I walk up to the large chest, bury my face in it and go _blublublublublublublubluî"
Sheldon,I open the chest.
Leonard,"Itês locked, but suddenly the door behind you slams shut and now the walls of the room start closing in."
Leonard,"Glowing letters appear on the chest that read, If squashed to death you wish not to be, sing of Svaty Vaclav and his victory."
Howard,Who the hell is Svaty Vaclav?
Leonard,Walls are getting closer.
Sheldon,"Wait, Svaty Vaclav was the Duke of Bohemia."
Leonard,"Youêre ten seconds away from getting crushed. Nine, eight."
Howard,What are we supposed to do?
Leonard,"Seven, six."
Sheldon,"Wait, wait. Svaty Vaclav is better known as Good King Wenceslas from the beloved Victorian Christmas carol."
Howard,Never heard of it. Must be the one Christmas song not written by a Jewish guy.
Leonard,"Three, two."
Sheldon,"Good King Wenceslas looked out, on the feast of Stephen. When the snow lay êround about, deep and crisp and even"
Leonard,The walls are getting slower.
Sheldon,"Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel. When a poor man came in sight gathering winter fuel."
Howard,"That was amazing, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"It was simple. I combined a well-known historical fact about Bohemia with the memory of my grandparents, Mee-Maw and Pop-Pop, singing Christmas carols while I sat in front of the fire and tried to build a high-energy particle accelerator out of Legos."
Leonard,"Okay, continuing our quest."
Sheldon,"W-W-Wait. Thereês still four more verses. You donêt sing a song and not finish it. Hither, page, and stand by me, if thou knowêst it, telling. Yonder peasant, who is he? Where and what his dwelling? Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frostÑ"
Bernadette,Looks like heês doing pretty good.
Penny,"Of course he is. Look, that girl just got dumped by her boyfriend. Sheês angry, sheês drunk, and her favorite movie is Slumdog Millionaire. I mean."
Amy,That is some low-hanging fruit.
Bernadette,"Oh, here he comes."
Penny,"So, howêd it go?"
Raj,"Great. I bought her a couple of drinks, and she gave me her e-mail address."
Bernadette,Jennifer at not-even-if-you-were-the-last-guy-on-earth dot loser.
Bernadette,"Iêm sorry, Raj."
Raj,"Why canêt I find someone? Iêm smart, Iêve got a cool job, and my naturally bronzed complexion means I can pull off mustard yellow in a way most guys canêt."
Penny,"Oh, honey, itês not you, itês them."
Raj,"No, itês not. She was too beautiful for me."
Bernadette,Why would you say that?
Raj,Itês true. Iêm always attracted to women I canêt have. I do it all the time. I did the same thing with the two of you.
Amy,The two of them? I donêt understand.
Raj,"Well, uh, there was a time when I had a thing for Penny, and I thought she was into me, too, because she got drunk and naked and climbed into bed with me. But apparently I misread those signals."
Amy,And you liked Bernadette also?
Raj,That was before Penny. I make it a rule to only fall for one of my friendsê girlfriends at a time. Iêm very old-fashioned that way.
Amy,"So at, uh, some point, you probably had a thing for me, too."
Raj,"No, not really."
Penny,"Oh, come on, Raj, not even a little bit?"
Raj,Not that I can think of.
Bernadette,Think harder.
Raj,"Nope. I guess the heart wants what the heart wants. Or in this case, doesnêt, I mean, at all. What?"
Sheldon,"Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing. Ba-da-bum."
Sheldon,I think the word youêre looking for is bravo.
Leonard,"Okay, you leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen."
Sheldon,Melted snowmen? Are there carrots and lumps of coal in the water?
Leonard,I donêt know. Whatês the difference?
Sheldon,"Well itês a game of the imagination, Leonard. Paint a picture."
Leonard,Fine. You leave the room and find yourself standing before a pool of melted snowmen. There are carrots and lumps of coal in the water.
Sheldon,What happened to the top hats and the corncob pipes?
Leonard,"You see those, too."
Sheldon,"Oh, itês like Iêm really there."
Howard,Good story.
Leonard,What are you drinking there? A little eggnog?
Sheldon,Yes. is there a problem?
Leonard,"No, itês nice to see you enjoying a holiday beverage. Pretty Christmassy."
Sheldon,Since when is eggnog a Christmas drink? Eggs are available all year êround. Iêve been known to enjoy this poolside.
Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon. You know all the Christmas stories, and the carols, youêve got an eggnog moustache going on there. Just admit it. Youêre getting a little Yuletide spirit."
Sheldon,"Oh, donêt be silly. Christmas is a bunch of baloney created by the tinsel industry. Why is this so important to you?"
Leonard,"Honestly, because I had enough crappy Christmases as a kid and Iêm tired of you sucking the joy out of them now."
Leonard,"I grew up in a house full of crazy academics. Instead of leaving Santa milk and cookies, we had to leave him a research paper. And in the morning, you could tell heêd been there because the paper would be graded."
Sheldon,No wonder you love Christmas. That sounds amazing.
Leonard,It wasnêt amazing. I got a C-minus four years in a row.
Sheldon,"Yeah, Iêm familiar with your work. C-minus was your gift."
Raj,"Amy, Iêm really sorry. I didnêt mean to upset you."
Amy,"Itês fine. Iêm used to being the girl who never gets looked at twice. I didnêt have my first kiss till I was 22, and the guy only did it so Iêd give him back his insulin."
Bernadette,Sometimes the pancreas wants what the pancreas wants.
Amy,Forget it. I donêt expect you guys to understand.
Raj,"I understand. In seventh grade, I played Spin the Bottle and it landed on Alina Shankar. She said if I came near her, she would break the bottle and cut me."
Amy,"You think thatês bad? In college, I passed out at a frat party and woke up with more clothes on."
Raj,"Sometimes I get so lonely, I sit on my left hand until it goes numb, then I put it in my right hand and pretend Iêm holding hands with another person."
Amy,"I do that, too. Sometimes the left hand tries to cop a feel. And I let it."
Raj,Itês kind of nice to talk to someone who understands what it feels like to be alone.
Amy,"It is, isnêt it?"
Raj,But youêre not alone anymore. Now youêve got Sheldon.
Amy,"I do. And donêt worry, someday youêll have somebody, too."
Raj,Thank you. I hope sheês half as lovely and amazing as you are.
Amy,"Thank you, Rajesh. He wants me, Iêm good. We can go now."
Raj,Damn it.
Raj,"Now that I know she doesnêt like me, Iêm kind of into her."
Sheldon,All right. I think I cracked the code to lower the drawbridge.
Howard,Great. Letês do it. 
Leonard,The drawbridge is lowering.
Sheldon,Play through the pain.
Leonard,"You did it. The drawbridge is down. You cross the chasm and find yourself in a small dungeon room. And in the corner, chained to the wall, you see a bloodied and beaten Santa Claus. He says, ho, ho, help me."
Howard,"Yes, we found Santa. Christmas is saved. Donêt ever tell my mother I said that."
Sheldon,"But first, I cast a spell of paralysis on Stuart and Howard."
Howard,"Wait, what are you doing?"
Sheldon,"You canêt talk, youêre paralyzed. I get right up in Santaês big, fat face and say, well, well, well, jolly old Saint Nick, we meet again. Yeah, I believe the last time we spoke was in the Baybrook Mall in Galveston, Texas, when I was five years old, isnêt that right?"
Leonard,"Uh, okay."
Sheldon,"My mother dragged me there and she plopped me down on your lap and you asked me what I wanted for Christmas. And I told you, my Pop-Pop, because that was the year my grandfather died. I missed him and I wanted him back."
Leonard,"This is weird, right?"
Sheldon,"Pop-Pop was the only one in my family who encouraged me to pursue science. But you didnêt bring him back, did you? No, instead, I got Lincoln Logs. Well, you can build a lot of neat things out of Lincoln Logs, but Pop-Pop ainêt one of êem. And now youêre here asking me for something, to save you. Well, sorry, Mr. Kringle, but todayês not your day. Iêm leaving you here to rot, and I hope the ogres feast on your bones. I take the skeleton key, and I toss it into the chasm, and on the way out, I give Santa a swift kick in his bowl full of jelly!"
Leonard,"Okay. So Wolowitz and Stuart are paralyzed, Santaês dead, and I picked this over having sex with my girlfriend."
Sheldon,"Well, then, you shouldnêt have jingle bells on your boots."
Sheldon,I understand.
Sheldon,"Oh, I hope itês a train."
Sheldon,Two trains?
Sheldon,Iêm getting three trains.
Sheldon,"Wait, uh, uh, hang on. In my defenseÑ"
Sheldon,"Well, I must say, Leonard, when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga, I was sceptical."
Leonard,I canêt blame you. Tiny Twister was a complete bust.
Sheldon,"No, I was wrong. The looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice. Iêve never felt so alive.  Oh, hello, Alex. Uh, let me go get you last nightês recordings."
Leonard,What recordings?
Sheldon,"Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep? Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say, itês probably pure gold. So I started recording it all, and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours of what I like to call Sheldon After Dark."
Leonard,Hey. Just playing a little Giant Jenga here.
Leonard,"Well, most of Saturdayês gonna be figuring out where to put this game when weêre done. How about you?"
Leonard,Ooh. Thatês his take on John Wheelerês quantum foam. That should be great.
Leonard,"Ah, Iêd love to, but Iêm supposed to hang out with Penny."
Leonard,"Well, sheês not really into that kind of stuff."
Sheldon,"Jenga, I win!"
Howard,"Oh, come on, that canêt be true."
Raj,"I did the research. Tony the Tiger, Digêem the Frog, Capên Crunch, Toucan Sam, Count Chocula, Trix the Rabbit, Snap, Crackle and Pop. Not one cereal mascot is a girl. Itês a total breakfast sausage fest."
Leonard,Are we done with this?
Raj,"Almost. Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee, I believe his name is Buzz."
Leonard,Terrific. Something weird happened and I donêt know what to do about it.
Howard,Whatês going on?
Leonard,Sheldonês assistant asked me on a date last night.
Raj,How could you do that to me? You know Iêve been working it with Alex for weeks.
Leonard,Working it? You canêt even talk to her.
Raj,I talk with my eyes.
Howard,You look like my little cousin when heês dropping one in his diaper.
Leonard,She knows I have a girlfriend. Itês so weird.
Raj,"Oh, my God. Youêre loving this."
Leonard,"To my bones. I mean, Iêm not gonna do anything about it. I love Penny. Itês just nice to have a young, attractive woman sniffing around the goods."
Raj,I both hate you and want to be you. This is Ryan Gosling all over again.
Sheldon,"Ah, gentlemen, what is on the conversational menu this morning?"
Raj,"Leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well I was only six to eight months away from making my move."
Leonard,I didnêt steal anyone.
Raj,Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.
Sheldon,"Well, thatês not acceptable. I mean, Iêm her boss. She needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality."
Leonard,Iêm androgynous?
Sheldon,"Oh, please. Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips."
Leonard,What do you guys think I should do?
Raj,"I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny, I provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good."
Sheldon,"I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. Uh, in the past, Iêve reached out to each of you individually, but I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group, which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts I have dubbed Sheldon Cooperês Council of Ladies."
Penny,What is happening?
Sheldon,"I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation. Uh, to protect those involved, Iêll be changing their names."
Bernadette,Whoês involved?
Sheldon,"Well, a short, bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate. Letês call this colleague Ricardo Shilly-Shally."
Penny,Youêre talking about Leonard.
Sheldon,"No, no, Shilly-Shally has red hair and, uh, he briefly served in the Mexican Navy. Anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend, Shilly-Shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady."
Amy,"Itês your assistant Alex, isnêt it?"
Sheldon,This is Tondelaya della Ventimiglia.
Penny,"Wait, what the hellês going on with Leonard and Alex?"
Sheldon,"No, uh, no, Iêm sorry. Whoês talking about Leonard and Alex?"
Penny,Fine. Ricardo and Tondelaya.
Sheldon,"Okay, look, itês not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya. It is really about her boss, who doesnêt quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice, which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm, heês usually pretty smart about these things."
Penny,Iêm gonna kill her.
Bernadette,Iêm sure youêve got nothing to worry about. Leonard would never cheat on you.
Amy,"Sheês right. But say the word, I got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose. One of them could end up in the backseat of her car. Or her shower."
Sheldon,"Ladies, ladies, please. Weêre not here to talk about Penny, okay? Weêre here to talk about me. Uh, I mean Einstein Von Brainstorm. Oh, darn it! All right, I guess the catês out of the bag. Let me explain whatês going on. Ricardo is really Leonard."
Penny,"We know whatês going on, Sheldon!"
Sheldon,"Well, what should I do?"
Bernadette,"Well, Alex is your employee. If sheês doing something thatês making Leonard uncomfortable, you should talk to her."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, heês not uncomfortable at all. No, heês loving it. Yeah, heês strutting around like heês five-foot-six."
Penny,Heês loving it?
Bernadette,"Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away."
Sheldon,"Talk to her? Thatês all youêve got? With a cool name like Sheldon Cooperês Council of Ladies, I really expected more. Give me back the T-shirts."
Sheldon,"Alex, check my schedule. What does my afternoon look like?"
Sheldon,"Well, that snuck up on us, didnêt it?"
Sheldon,Letês not call it a problem. Letês call it an opportunity. To solve a serious problem.
Sheldon,"You donêt know? Oh, you poor dear. Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you donêt even know which way is up. You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter."
Sheldon,"Now, thereês no need to get defensive. Iêm not unsympathetic to your plight. My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day."
Sheldon,Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.
Sheldon,"Yeah, you and me both, sister. Now, please understand, I donêt hold you responsible for your behaviour because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, youêre a slave to your desire to reproduce. But during the work day, when you feel possessed by amorous intent, may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases? Letês see here. Oh, yes. Check out this oozy doozy."
Sheldon,"So does this fellow, but he canêt without it burning like hot soup."
Leonard,"Hey, pretty lady."
Penny,"Oh, you seem extra happy."
Leonard,"Uh, I guess I am."
Penny,Any particular reason why?
Leonard,"I donêt know, just having a good day. This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so I got to listen to the radio. That was pretty crazy."
Penny,Mm-hmm. Anything else?
Leonard,Mm. I found this quiz online called Which Star Trek Character Are You? and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.
Penny,Thatês great.
Leonard,Oh. It. Was.
Penny,"Hmm. Well, Iêm glad youêre having such a great day."
Leonard,Yeah. And the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl.
Penny,"Oh, and whoês that?"
Leonard,What do you mean?
Penny,"Oh, I just didnêt know if you meant me or Alex."
Leonard,"Um, why would I mean Alex?"
Penny,Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it.
Penny,"Donêt play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!"
Leonard,Iêm missing something.  Did you say something to Penny about Alex?
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you."
Leonard,Why would you do that?
Sheldon,"I needed advice about a woman. I would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, itês that you canêt tell a uterus from a unicycle."
Leonard,At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.
Sheldon,"Good to know. Yeah, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies.  Hello. I see. Uh, what time? Very well, then. Huh. That was the Human Resources Department at the university. Apparently, my assistant Alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace."
Leonard,"Oh, my God, what did you do?"
Sheldon,"Hmm, let me think. Nothing. Iêm a delight."
Sheldon, Human Resources Department.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Sheldon,"So Iêve been told. But I canêt understand what she has to complain about. I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history. Thereês string cheese in my mini-fridge, and thatês for anyone. Yeah, and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia."
Sheldon,Like what?
Sheldon,"Oh! I see the confusion here. No, no, Alex thought I was singling her out. I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know? Even you. Youêre a slave."
Sheldon,"Well, y-you, I-Iêm just saying, you know, at a certain point in a womanês menstrual cycleÑ"
Sheldon,"I donêt see why Iêm the one being persecuted here. Dr. Hofstadter, he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen. You know, and Howard Wolowitz, he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot. Oh, and at the office Christmas party, I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as Brown Sugar."
Sheldon,"Yes. No, yeah, but in his defense, that wasnêt racist. Heês also brown."
Leonard,"Iêm sorry Alex hit on me, hit on me, hit on me. Iêm sorry Alex hit on me, Iêd no idea Iêm cute."
Penny,"Oh, damn it, you are."
Leonard,Please forgive me. I should have told you about Alex.
Penny,"I donêt care about Alex. Fine, I care. Okay, I hate that bitch. But what really hurt is that you liked it so much. I mean, do I need to be worried?"
Leonard,Of course not. Why?
Penny,"Because, she is pretty and smart, and when you talk about work, she doesnêt have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said."
Leonard,You do that?
Leonard,"Hang on. Are you feeling insecure? Because thatês my thing, and if you take it away, I donêt know what Iêm bringing to this relationship."
Penny,"Yes, Leonard, I am insecure. Happy?"
Leonard,"No, Iêm not happy."
Penny,Why are you smiling?
Leonard,Iêm sorry. I just never think of you having feelings like that.
Penny,"Well, I do."
Leonard,Why? Nothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex.
Leonard,Come here. Tell you a secret?
Penny,Whatês that?
Leonard,"With all these women chasing me, I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk."
Penny,Can I tell you a secret?
Penny,"Keep talking about Captain Kirk, and weêre all gonna stop."
Leonard,"Message received. Ah, excuse me.  Hello. This is Dr. Hofstadter. Okay. All right, thank you. Thatês weird. Iêm getting called in to Human Resources."
Penny,What did you do?
Leonard,I donêt know.
Howard,Huh. I just got called in to Human Resources.
Howard,I donêt know.
Raj,Huh. That is so strange. Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow.  Could you stop licking your ass for two minutes? I have a problem here.
Howard,Do you really think you should be drinking right now?
Raj,How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?
Howard,I donêt know. Seek professional help?
Raj,I did. The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.
Howard,"Wait, you got called in, too? What is going on?"
Leonard,Sheldon threw us all under the bus.
Raj,I feel like Iêve been called down to the principalês office. Although I wouldnêt mind if Brown Sugar suspended me. From a sex swing. This may have been a mistake.
Howard,"Relax. Everythingês gonna be fine. Before I met Bernadette I was in here every other day. Uh, little tip, turn off your I Like Big Butts ringtone before you go in."
Raj,"Well, this is all your fault."
Leonard,How is this my fault?
Raj,"If you werenêt screwing around with Sheldonês assistant, none of this would be happening."
Leonard,I wasnêt screwing around with anyone.
Raj,"Oh, of course not. She was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles."
Howard,"Hey, Janine. How are Tom and the kids?"
Leonard,"Yes, but I think this is all a big misunderstanding."
Raj,"Yeah, yeah, me, too. I didnêt do anything."
Raj,Howard built a sex robot.
Howard,That is not true. All I did was build a robot.
Howard,"Iêm sorry, Iêm a feminist, I donêt notice things like how many breasts a robot has."
Sheldon,"Well, hello."
Leonard,What are you doing here?
Sheldon,"Actually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis."
Sheldon,But I came to file a complaint. Somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.
Sheldon,"You, you dirty birdie. I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized Iêm deeply offended. Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms."
Sheldon,"And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if youêre menstruating. And based on your behaviour, I donêt have to."
Sheldon,"It has been pointed out to me that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive, and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology."
Sheldon,"Yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesnêt happen in the future."
Sheldon,"Yeah. Now, unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this, so, um, Iêm gonna need you to take it for me. Oh, and, uh, youêd better ace it, theyêre pretty mad."
Penny,"So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex."
Leonard,"Oh, would you stop worrying about that?"
Penny,"I canêt help it. But, look, I figured I could sit around and feel insecure, or I could do something about it. So I got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes."
Leonard,Thatês great.
Penny,"No, it isnêt, they are extremely boring. I mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day? Anyway, I decided I donêt need to be a scientist, I could just look like one. So I bought these."
Leonard,"Glasses? I really donêt think thatês gonna changeÑ oh, my God, you look so smart and hot."
Penny,"I know, right? Watch this. Molecules."
Leonard,"Okay, come with me."
Penny,Where are we going?
Leonard,"To my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses. And maybe the boots."
Leonard,"Hey, will you steam my uniform next?"
Sheldon,"Interesting. Do you recall this conversation? Leonard, want to go halfsies on a steamer? No, Sheldon, we donêt need a steamer. Looks like that rumpled chickenês come home to roost."
Penny,Hi. Here are the make-up sponges you asked for.
Leonard,"Oh, thanks, I thought I had more."
Penny,"Damn, youêve got more makeup than I do. Youêve got better makeup than I do. Yeah, Iêm borrowing this."
Leonard,"Hey, hey, hey, hey. This is my Comic-Con makeup. I love you, but there are some things a man doesnêt share with his girlfriend."
Sheldon,"Thatês a wise policy. I once borrowed my sisterês makeup for a costume contest. Got a terrible case of pinkeye. But luckily, I was going as a zombie. I won second place."
Penny,I feel like you guys just went to Comic-Con.
Leonard,That was San Diego Comic-Con. This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.
Penny,Is that better?
Leonard,"Well, itês a lot smaller. Itês more about the comic books. The way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood."
Sheldon,"So to answer your question, no, itês not better."
Penny,"Well, then why are you going?"
Sheldon,"Itês a comic book convention. You know, itês like pizza or particle accelerators, even the stinky oneês still pretty good."
Penny,"All right. Well, you guys have fun. I guess Iêll see you Sunday night."
Leonard,"Oh, hang on a second. "
Penny,What was that for?
Leonard,To show people when they donêt believe me.
Penny,"Oh, this is the best. You have booze with breakfast on a Tuesday, you got a problem. You do it on the weekend, you got brunch."
Amy,Sheldon doesnêt believe in brunch. He canêt stand being at a table where one personês having an omelette and another personês having a sandwich.
Bernadette,Heês not exhausting at all.
Penny,"Oh. Itês Leonard. He says theyêre on the road and headed for Bakersfield at warp speed. Maybe itês the mimosa, but Iêm gonna give the kid an LOL."
Bernadette,Itês cute how excited they are. You should have seen Howard sewing his costume all week for the convention.
Amy,When did Howard learn to sew?
Bernadette,"When he was a little boy, every couple months, he would have to let his momês pants out."
Amy,I donêt even understand why they go to these conventions.
Penny,I know. The four of them work at a major university. Theyêre all super smart. How can they still be into something made for 12-year-olds?
Bernadette,"I donêt mind it. I think Howieês just in touch with his inner child. Although when he comes to bed in his Batman pyjamas, sometimes it feels like Iêm touching his inner child."
Amy,"Itês probably because they were bullied growing up. In a world where you canêt fight back, superheroes provide meaningful wish-fulfillment."
Penny,"Mmmm. Now I feel bad for picking on all those kids. Although, in my defence, if Danny Biffle didnêt want to eat a mouthful of dirt, he shouldnêt have shown up to school wearing a bow tie."
Bernadette,Iêve never even read a comic book. You guys?
Bernadette,"I mean, itês such an important part of their lives. Maybe we should try reading some."
Bernadette,The comic book store isnêt far from here.
Penny,"That is an amazing idea. Okay, how many of these have I had?"
Sheldon,I think you should turn on the GPS.
Leonard,It is on.
Sheldon,But the turn-by-turn voice option isnêt on. I know Iêd feel more safe if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option. I love the turn-by-turn voice option.
Howard,Has it really only been ten miles?
Leonard,"Iêm turning it on, but just to shut you up."
Sheldon,"Ooh, sounds like that fellow knows what heês talking about. Iêd put on my listening ears if I were you."
Leonard,What did you do?
Sheldon,I found a hack online. I was able to upload MP3 recordings of my voice to your GPS.
Raj,That is so cool.
Leonard,"Counterpoint, no, itês not."
Sheldon,"Shh, he said itês interesting."
Howard,"Look, Leonard, thereês a bridge. Drive off it."
Raj,"You know, weêre not that far from Vazquez Rocks."
Sheldon,"Oh, they shot a lot of Star Trek episodes out there."
Howard,Weêve got our costumes in the trunk. We could go there and have a little photo shoot.
Raj,Great idea. I havenêt had a carbohydrate in two weeks. These cheekbones need to be in front of a camera before I eat a pretzel and theyêre gone.
Leonard,"Yeah, that sounds fun."
Sheldon,"Oh, smashing. Now, Leonard, do you know how to get there?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, well luckily, someone in the car does."
Sheldon,None of you will get it. Itês Eisenhower.
Bernadette,Why are they staring?
Amy,"Who cares? Just soak it in. Hello, boys."
Penny,"Hey, Stuart."
Bernadette,We were looking for a recommendation about comic books.
Penny,"No, we were just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much, so we thought weêd give it a try."
Bernadette,What kind of comics do the guys like?
Amy,"All right, well, whoês the best superhero?"
Penny,"Well then, what do you recommend?"
Amy,"Ooh, I do love a bad boy."
Penny,As evidenced by your boyfriend and his fear of hamsters.
Penny,"Ooh, Thor! Heês hot."
Raj,"And weêre blending, and weêre blending, and weêre done."
Sheldon,"I know Mr. Data isnêt supposed to smile, but here it comes."
Howard,"Come on, guys. Letês do this."
Leonard,"Yeah, Iêm sweating my bald cap off."
Howard,So whatês our first pose going to be?
Raj,I say we begin with a classic Star Trek fight scene.
Leonard,Iêll set the timer.
Howard,"Sheldon, how is that a fight pose?"
Sheldon,Mr. Dataês weapon is his mind. Iêm wielding it.
Raj,Phasers on the Borg! Charlieês Angels.
Howard,"Okay, whatês next?"
Raj,"Now letês do some sexy glamour shots. Iêll set the mood.  Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, Yeah, nice one, oontz, oontz. Thatês right. Oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontz, oontzÑ"
Howard,"Oh, my God. Leonard, someoneês stealing your car!"
Leonard,"Hey, hey! Come back here!"
Sheldon,Stealing is against the law!
Leonard,I donêt believe this.
Howard,Son of a bitch.
Raj,"Iêll call 911. oh, no, my phone is in my other pants."
Howard,"Oh, so is mine."
Leonard,"Mine, too. Anybody got any ideas?"
Sheldon,Nope. The only thing left to do now is assign blame.  Nice going.
Leonard,What kind of a person steals another personês car in broad daylight?
Sheldon,What kind of person leaves his keys in the car?
Leonard,I thought we agreed this was all Koothrappaliês fault.
Sheldon,Youêre right. Nice going.
Raj,What is wrong with people? Why donêt they stop?
Sheldon,Maybe weêre better off. What if we were to get in a car with a crazy person?
Leonard,"Look at us, Sheldon. Weêre the crazy people."
Sheldon,"Well, perhaps we should hold up a sign that assures passing motorists of our mental competence."
Howard,Good idea. Why donêt you get started on that?
Leonard,"Come on, letês just start walking. Thereês got to be a gas station or something nearby."
Sheldon,"you think just because youêre wearing a captainês uniform, youêre in charge?"
Sheldon,All right.
Penny,"Hmm, okay, Iêm done. How did you guys finish so fast?"
Bernadette,"I donêt know, there were a lot of pictures, and one page only had the word brakkadoom!"
Penny,"Yeah, well, I have street smarts."
Bernadette,"So, whatêd you guys think?"
Amy,"Well, there was a lot of action."
Amy,"And the story moved along at a brisk pace. It was, overall, whatês the word Iêm looking for?"
Amy,So stupid.
Penny,I donêt know how Leonard can get so caught up in this.
Bernadette,"Itês crazy, they spend hours arguing about things that donêt even exist."
Amy,What a waste of time.
Penny,I know. A hammer so heavy that no one else can pick it up?
Bernadette,"I donêt think itês heavy. Itês some sort of magic, so only Thor can lift it."
Penny,"That makes even less sense, I meanÑ"
Amy,"No, no, no, it doesnêt. Thor is a god. The hammer is his, only he can use it. Itês like Sheldon and his toothbrush. Or his thin, beckoning lips."
Penny,"Okay, hang on, what if Thorês hand is on the hammer? I mean, if heês touching it with his god magic, does that mean I could lift it?"
Penny,"Well, which is it?"
Amy,Maybe we missed something.
Bernadette,Letês read it again.
Bernadette,You want some tea?
Amy,Good idea. Iêll help you.
Penny,"Wait, I thought we were reading."
Amy,"We are. Weêre just, uh, giving you a head start."
Howard,I wish my mom was here. We could all hang out in her shadow.
Raj,Wool pants in the desert. I feel like Iêve got poached testicles.
Leonard,"Oh, you poor thing, youêre sweating. Thatês so much worse than having your car stolen."
Raj,Insurance is gonna buy you a new car. Itês not gonna de-funk my junk.
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, a little less bellyaching. Weêre Starfleet officers and a member of the Borg Collective."
Leonard,"Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood."
Sheldon,"Leonard, all our lives we have dreamed of finding ourselves inside one of the fantasy worlds we love. And look at us. At this moment, we are, in fact, a Star Trek landing party stranded in an alien and unforgiving environment, relying only on our wits, our fortitude and our moxie. As long as we have those things, nothing can stopÑ"
Sheldon,I hate this planet.
Amy,"It says right here on the hammer, whoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor."
Bernadette,"Hold on, who decides whoês worthy? Does the hammer decide?"
Amy,No! It canêt decide. Itês a hammer.
Penny,You said itês a magic hammer.
Amy,"Yeah, but, it canêt make decisions."
Penny,"If Harry Potterês wand can make decisions, why canêt Thorês hammer?"
Amy,"Okay, if youêre going to start comparing wands and hammers, I canêt even take you seriously."
Sheldon,"Hello. Hello. Uh, uh, uh, four glasses of water, please. Anything for you guys?"
Leonard,Can I use your phone? Our car got stolen.
Sheldon,"Scotty was on the original series, and weêre Next Generation. So, jokeês on you."
Howard,Weêre not with him.
Amy,"You canêt pick something up in outer space. In space, there is no up."
Penny,"Oh, yeah? Then how does the sun come up every day?"
Amy,Hard to argue with those kind of street smarts.
Bernadette,Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics across the hall. Why donêt we go look at those?
Penny,"Oh, great. Yes. And then you will see, I am not wrong, because if we were in outer space, then anyone could pick up the hammer because it would be floating around in a weightless environment. Yeah, thatês right, the slow reader used science. Suck on that."
Leonard,"Our clothes, our wallets, phones."
Raj,"And about three hundred dollars worth of makeup, so this thief could look like anyone right now."
Leonard,"Uh, weêre going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield. They have a big costume contest. Itês cooler than it sounds."
Raj,"It, it is. Itês not just comic books. Theyêve got action figures, toys, a Tron-themed dance party."
Leonard,"Okay, he gets how cool it is."
Leonard,"Thanks, but weêve got it covered."
Howard,"Okay, I just talked to my mom. She arranged for us to get a rental car."
Raj,Great. We can still make it to Comic-Con.
Leonard,"Are you kidding me? After all weêve been through, I just want to go home."
Raj,"Donêt be like that. Come on, Howard, talk to him."
Howard,Iêm with Leonard. Iêm done.
Raj,"Fine, then I guess itês two against two. How do we decide?"
Sheldon,"Actually, itês three against one."
Raj,What about the mission? You said we were a real-life landing party.
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, weêre not. Weêre an imaginary landing party who had real-life garbage thrown at us by real-life strangers who think weêre idiots. And to tell you the truth, Iêm starting to feel like one. I want to go home now."
Raj,Okay. Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise? Get it? Enterprise? Screw you. Thatês funny.
Bernadette,"Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor while Thor is holding the hammer?"
Bernadette,"Then by the transitive property of picking things up, Hulk picked up the hammer."
Amy,"Hulk picked up Thor, Thor picked up the hammer."
Penny,"Okay, hang on. If I go to a bar and pick up a guy, and he picks up a girl, and then we all leave together, did I pick up the girl?"
Amy,Did that ever happen?
Penny,"Hey, are we talking about me or are we talking about Thor?"
Sheldon,"Well, I say thatês the last time we ever go outside."
Amy,"Look, right here. Red Hulk is picking up Thorês hammer êcause Thorês touching it."
Penny,"No, itês because theyêre in space. Heês really just touching the strap."
Amy,The strap is part of the hammer.
Bernadette,"No, itês not!"
Raj,Are they actually arguing about comic books?
Leonard,"No, that canêt be right."
Howard,Maybe Thorês Hammer is a new colour of nail polish.
Bernadette,Then Red Hulk must be worthy.
Penny,How could Red Hulk be worthy?
Bernadette,You donêt know his life.
Sheldon,Thereês only one logical explanation. Somewhere in the desert we crossed into an alternate dimension where the women in our lives can finally appreciate great literature.
Raj,"If itês an alternate dimension, sounds like a job for a landing party."
Sheldon,"Captain, what are your orders?"
Leonard,I say we investigate.
Sheldon,Wait. They might be hostile.
Leonard,"Fine, but set them to stun. If we vaporize Penny, Iêll never find a girlfriend that pretty again."
Leonard,"Sheldon, your foodês getting cold."
Sheldon,"Iêll eat later. Right now, Iêm suckling at the informative bosom of mother physics."
Penny,Itês hot when Sheldon talks dirty.
Raj,"So, I found this Web site where you send them pictures, they sculpt your head and make an action figure out of you. How awesome is that?"
Howard,Let me see.
Raj,"Yeah, you can pick your wardrobe. You can even choose your accessories."
Howard,"Leonard, you can get a little asthma inhaler."
Leonard,"Oh, this is neat. Think about all the action figures weêve bought over the years. It would be kind of cool to have ones that look like us. Donêt you think?"
Penny,"Yeah, if thatês your idea of whatês cool, you should get one."
Leonard,"Yeah, so, Iêm out."
Raj,"What do you think, Sheldon? Want an action figure that looks just like you?"
Sheldon,Would it come with Kung-Fu grip?
Sheldon,Donêt waste my time.
Leonard,You get that these are personalised action figures.
Penny,"Honey, if you want one, just get one."
Howard,"Youêre still out, right?"
Sheldon,"A hush falls over the crowd as Cooper studies the board. He makes his move. Heês dividing both sides by I. Heês adding back the coefficient. He has a value for P. Heês plugging that back in. He takes the derivative, and he solves the equation. The crowd goes wild. Nobel! Nobel!"
Sheldon,Nobel. Kripke. Donêt look at my board.
Sheldon,"Thatês a drawing of a really cool train. Donêt look at that, either. What do you want?"
Sheldon,"So they asked you to pack up your things and ship out. Thatês hard cheese, Barry. Youêre one of the good ones."
Sheldon,Thatês ridiculous. I am one of the great minds of our generation. I work on a level so rarified you couldnêt even imagine it. I said stop looking at my cool train!
Leonard,Hmm. Kind of a strange place to put a picture of you and Bernadette.
Howard,"Well, I wanted everybody to know I love my wife. And nobody to know I forgot to turn off the laser."
Raj,Theyêre here. Our action figures have arrived. This is the best five hundred dollars Iêve ever spent.
Leonard,A thousand dollars on action figures? How can you afford that?
Howard,"Easy. His familyês loaded, and Bernadette has a great job. My wife came with both fun bags and money bags."
Raj,"Say hello to an exact scale model of me. Oh, Iêm not dark chocolate. Iêm melt-in-your-mouth caramel."
Howard,"Oh, man. Look at my nose."
Leonard,Maybe itês a shipping problem.
Leonard,Yeah. Maybe Wesley Snipes and Toucan Sam just got action figures that look like you guys.
Raj,This sucks.
Howard,I canêt believe I wasted all that money.
Leonard,"Aw, and my girlfriend wouldnêt let me get one. Look at my face. Do I look smug? I feel smug."
Penny,I hate it when you make me sit through all the credits.
Leonard,"Well, sometimes thereês a secret ending, like in The Avengers."
Penny,"Yeah, but I donêt think thatês going to happen in a documentary about the Holocaust."
Leonard,"They could show bloopers. Oh, no."
Penny,What is that?
Leonard,"That is Sheldonês _Iêm unhappy and about to destroy the planetî music. Come on, letês just go to your place."
Penny,"Well, wait, if heês unhappy,shouldnêt we talk to him?"
Leonard,Shouldnêt we talk to him? Have you learned nothing in six years?
Penny,"You doing okay, sweetie?"
Sheldon,"There is ominous music playing, and there is an afghan over my head. I donêt know where youêre from, but where Iêm from, that means Iêm not doing okay."
Leonard,Want me to make you some tea?
Sheldon,Tea is for when Iêm upset. Iêm not upset. The universityês forcing me to work with Kripke. Iêm outraged.
Leonard,"So, cocoa?"
Sheldon,"Yes, cocoa. Do you have any idea what itês like to be paired with someone whoês so incredibly annoying?"
Leonard,"Oh, teacher! Me! Me!"
Sheldon,"See, I did all this great work, and now heês just going to come along and ruin it. I am angrier than ever and filled with despair."
Penny,What beverage do you make for that?
Leonard,"Oh, no, no, no, I know this. Uh, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks?"
Sheldon,"Yes, hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks!"
Sheldon,"And yet, now youêre in my office. Point, Cooper. Welcome to the Thunderdome, Kripke."
Sheldon,Why donêt you show me yours first.
Sheldon,How do I know youêre not going to take my ideas and publish them as your own?
Sheldon,"Because Iêm not interested in getting published in Mad magazine. Zingers fly fast in the Thunderdome, Barry."
Sheldon,And I am sure itês still more valuable than whateverês in here.
Sheldon,Very well.
Raj,You! Always bet on black.
Howard,Get that waste of money out of my face.
Raj,"Itês only a waste of money if we donêt play with them.  Heês right, dawg."
Howard,"Please, Iêm working."
Raj,"You know, there is a way we can get action figures to look exactly like us."
Howard,"Oh, yeah? Howês that?"
Raj,"Two words, 3-D printer. Wait, maybe itês three words. No, hang on. Okay, one word, a letter and a number and maybe a hyphen. 3-D printer."
Howard,I have always wanted a 3-D printer.
Raj,"Of course you have. Theyêre an engineerês dream. Anything you can design, a 3-D printer can make out of plastic."
Howard,"Yeah, but theyêre so expensive."
Raj,"Oh, come on. You deserve one. Youêve worked hard to find a woman who makes a lot of money."
Howard,"Well, the prices have been coming down."
Raj,"Oh, true. Theyêre practically giving them away. You know, in exchange for money."
Howard,"And we can make stuff we need for work with it. Prototypes of my CAD/CAM designs, specialized toolsÑ"
Raj,Not to mention Malibu Koothrappali and his totally bitchinê dream house.
Howard,We donêt need Malibu Koothrappaliês dream house.
Raj,"Really, smart guy? Whereês he supposed to park his sweet little Corvette?"
Sheldon,Iêm fine.
Amy,"All right, well, how was work today? Did you exchange your research with Kripke?"
Amy,"Sheldon, whatês going on?"
Sheldon,"I read his research, and, itês leaps and bounds ahead of mine. Which means the mommy of the smartest physicist at the university is not my mommy as I had thought. Itês his mommy."
Amy,"Sheldon, I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better. May I offer you a consoling hug?"
Sheldon,What do we have to lose?
Amy,Howês that?
Sheldon,I feel like Iêm being strangled by a boa constrictor. Whyêd you stop?
Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon, weêre going to be late."
Sheldon,I canêt go in today. Iêm sick.
Leonard,Youêre not sick. You just donêt want to face Kripke.
Sheldon,"No, look."
Leonard,"What did you do, put this in your tea?"
Sheldon,"Oh, dear. Now Iêm not even smarter than you."
Leonard,"Sheldon, Kripkeês not smarter than you. You just got stuck on a wrong path. Happened to Einstein. He got stuck on the unified field theory for decades."
Sheldon,"Oh, donêt play the Einstein card. His great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything. So everything was a great breakthrough."
Leonard,"Sheldon Lee Cooper, I do not have time for this nonsense. Now, go put your clothes on, get in the car, and lets go to work."
Sheldon,"All right, geez. What a grouch."
Leonard,How did I do that? I got to remember how I did that.
Howard,"Do you realize, by owning a 3-D printer, we are reclaiming the manufacturing process and taking jobs back from sweatshops in China?"
Raj,I think this thing was made in China.
Howard,"Eh, what can you do?"
Raj,"Ooh, I, I think itês done. Oh, it worked. We printed a whistle."
Howard,Amazing. You realize these things go for 25 cents a pop at a party store.
Raj,And we made it in only three hours. Sounds just like store-bought.
Howard,"Okay, give me a superhero pose, and I will scan you into the computer for your action figure."
Raj,"Oh, I wish I was in better shape."
Howard,Stop holding your stomach in. Iêll give you a six-pack with the computer.
Raj,"Oh, okay, great. Now I can look like Val Kilmer as Batman instead of Val Kilmer as he looks today."
Howard,"All right, you can suck it in a little bit."
Sheldon,"I know. Go ahead, mock me. Just use small words so I understand."
Sheldon,We do?
Sheldon,Yes. That is the reason. My work is suffering because of all the laid Iêm getting.
Sheldon,"What can I say, you know? She enjoys my genitals. I am giving them to her on a nightly basis."
Sheldon,"Iêll do what I can. But itês not going to be easy, because when Iêm with Amy and our bathing suit areas mush together, boy howdy, is it magic"
Howard,"Oh, good, youêre home. Got a little surprise for you."
Howard,Say hello to my little friend.
Bernadette,"Oh, my God. Thatês so cute. I didnêt think there could be a smaller version of you."
Howard,"I know, right? And, thanks to photographs and a little 3-D modeling, here comes the bride."
Bernadette,"Oh, Howie, I love these."
Howard,I thought you might.
Bernadette,Were they expensive?
Howard,Didnêt cost a thing. I made them myself.
Howard,"Koothrappali and I bought a used 3-D printer for $5,000."
Bernadette,"$5,000 for a couple of dolls? Are you out of your mind?"
Howard,Not just for a couple of dolls. For as many dolls as we want. And whistles.
Bernadette,"At any point, did it dawn on you to talk to me about spending this kind of money?"
Howard,Itês kind of dawning on me now.
Bernadette,"I donêt believe you. Howie, we canêt afford to waste money on junk like this."
Howard,What are you talking about? We make plenty of money.
Bernadette,I make plenty of money. You make peanuts.
Howard,"Yes, but weêre married now. That means, when you get sick, I take care of you. And when you make a bunch of money, I get to buy stuff. Sorry if you donêt like it, but thatês how love works."
Bernadette,"No, hereês how love works. Youêre gonna return the machine, or you can print out a working set of lady parts and sleep with those. Oh, my God! Are you actually thinking about it?"
Penny,"All right, I donêt understand. Why didnêt you just tell Kripke the truth?"
Sheldon,"Because the truth made me look bad, whereas a ridiculous bald-faced lie makes me look good. Anyway, if Kripke asks, tell him my coitus with Amy is frequent, intense and whimsically inventive."
Leonard,Is my coitus whimsically inventive?
Penny,"That is what I write on the bathroom walls. For a whimsically inventive time, call Leonard Hofstadter."
Leonard,"I know youêre joking, but Iêd be okay with that."
Penny,"Yeah. Sheldon, can I ask you a question?"
Sheldon,Of course.
Penny,You ever going to sleep with Amy?
Sheldon,Thatês awfully personal.
Leonard,We donêt ask Sheldon things like that.
Penny,"Maybe you donêt, I do. Whatês the deal?"
Sheldon,"Well, word around the university is Iêm giving her sex organs a proper jostling."
Penny,"All right, come on, be serious. Look, you guys have been going out a long time. She would clearly like to have a physical relationship with you, so what are you doing?"
Leonard,"All right, weêre down the rabbit hole. What are you doing?"
Sheldon,"Well, first of all, Iêm quite fond of Amy."
Penny,Then whatês the problem?
Sheldon,"Penny, all my life, I have been uncomfortable with the sort of physical contact that comes easily to others, hand-shaking, hugging, prostate exams. But Iêm working on it, you know? Just recently, I had to put VapoRub on Amyês chest. A year ago, that would have been unthinkable."
Leonard,Now you know how I feel when I have to put it on you.
Penny,Okay. Hang on. Are you saying someday you and Amy might actually get physical?
Sheldon,Itês a possibility.
Penny,"Oh, my God!"
Raj,Are you sure you want to do this? Give up your half of the 3-D printer?
Howard,Yes. And can you please make that out to Bernadette? I was taken off the joint account until I learn the value of money.
Raj,"Wow, thatês harsh."
Howard,Tell me about it.
Raj,Arenêt you gonna eat lunch?
Howard,"Nah, I blew my food allowance on Pokemon cards."
Sheldon,"Well, the equation balances, but itês certainly not elegant."
Sheldon,"No, I gave it to her well. Now, over here, I was thinking the turbulence could be reduced if we just putÑ"
Sheldon,I didnêt notice.
Sheldon,I was too busy squishing all the desirable parts of her body.
Sheldon,Can we get back to work?
Sheldon,Toys? I do have a model rocket next to my bed.
Leonard,I donêt know why I avoided the Harry Potter books for so long. These are great. I just started number six.
Sheldon,"Thatês a good one. Dumbledore dies in that one. Yeah, I know, I didnêt see it coming, either."
Leonard,Why would you say that?
Sheldon,"You brought up the subject. I contributed an interesting fact on that subject. Itês called the art of conversation. Okay, your turn."
Leonard,That was a huge spoiler.
Leonard,"What is wrong with you? If I did that, youêd bitch about it for weeks."
Sheldon,"Oh, really, Leonard? Are you going to have another one of your hissy fits?"
Leonard,Hissy fits? I have hissy fits?
Sheldon,"Yes, and I have a theory why. Because of your lactose intolerance, you switched over to soy milk. Soy contains estrogen-mimicking compounds. I think your morning Cocoa Puffs are turning you into a hysterical woman."
Leonard,"You are unbelievable. I donêt know why I put up with you. Youêre controlling, youêre irritating."
Sheldon,"There you go again, nag, nag, nag. Youêre only proving my point, little lady."
Leonard,"You know what? Screw you, Sheldon. You are the most annoying person I have ever met."
Sheldon,"Iêm annoying? You criticize my behaviour all the time. Sheldon, donêt talk about your bowel movements over breakfast. Sheldon, when the president of the university is giving a eulogy at a funeral, donêt yawn and point at your watch. Sheldon, donêt throw away my shirts êcause you think theyêre ugly. Youêre impossible."
Leonard,"Thatês it. I donêt, I donêt have to put up with this."
Sheldon,"Actually, I have your signature on a roommate agreement that says you do."
Leonard,Aw. Hereês what I think of your roommate agreement.
Sheldon,You pick that up right now.
Sheldon,"Roommate agreement, section 27, paragraph 5, the roommate agreement, like the American flag, cannot touch the ground."
Leonard,I donêt care. I donêt have to do anything you say because I donêt think I want to live here anymore.
Sheldon,Where are you going?
Leonard,"To live with Penny and not you, you crazy bastard."
Sheldon,Crazy bastard?
Sheldon,"Leonard, wait."
Sheldon,Dobby the elf dies in book seven.
Raj,Here you go.
Howard,Great. Come on in.
Raj,you donêt say thank you?
Howard,Itês my suitcase. I lent it to you two years ago.
Raj,"Well, then, I should tell you I broke the wheel and the handle. So, is everyone from Bernadetteês company going to Vegas?"
Howard,"No, just me, her and a couple of the big wigs. Itês part of a bonus she got."
Raj,Cool. Did she discover a cure for something?
Howard,Not exactly. They spent a ton of money developing this dandruff medication that had the side effect of horrible anal leakage.
Raj,Is there a good anal leakage?
Howard,"Anyway, it was Bernieês idea to rebrand the stuff as a cure for constipation."
Raj,"Way to make lemonade. You know, from around the corner where fudge is made."
Howard,"Hey, I got a favour to ask."
Howard,My momês been kind of an emotional wreck since that dentist she was dating dumped her.
Raj,Dumped her? did he use a forklift? Sorry. Thereês nothing funny about morbid obesity.
Howard,"Sheês huge. It was funny. Anyway, I was just hoping that maybe you could check in on her tomorrow night and make sure sheês doing okay."
Raj,"Dude, Iêm a single man. Saturday night is my party night."
Howard,Really? What do you got going on?
Raj,"I donêt know, maybe drive down to Hollywood, hit a few hot spots, see if I can get lucky."
Howard,"Yeah, tell me if this sounds familiar. You pay fifteen dollars to park, you stand on the pavement for an hour until you break down and give the bouncer twenty bucks to let you in. You push your way to the bar, where you drink an eighteen dollar cosmopolitan, then you stare at a pretty girl and imagine your perfect life together. Your children, grandchildren. Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy who claims he wrote Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Then you give up on anyone ever loving you, go to Marie Callenderês, buy a pie and eat it in your car in the parking lot."
Howard,I told her around seven.
Leonard,"I swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being I have ever met."
Penny,"Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. Like Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers."
Leonard,"Well, Iêve had it. I am done. I canêt, I canêt live with him for one more minute."
Penny,Wow. Where are you going to go?
Leonard,I was thinking here with you.
Leonard,That a problem?
Penny,"No, not at all. No, itês, itês great. Itês terrific. I, you know, I just canêt help feel bad about Sheldon. I mean, howês he going to get by without you? Ernie."
Leonard,Heês got Amy now.
Penny,"Yeah, he does, but itês not the same."
Penny,"Um, well, um, all right. You, you know how in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Ron didnêt abandon Harry just because Harry started dating Ronês sister?"
Leonard,Harry and Ginny get together?
Penny,"Sorry. Spoiler alert. My point is, as much as I want to live with you, I canêt do it knowing how much Sheldon needs you."
Leonard,"Please, the only thing he needs me for is to be his whipping boy, his, his stooge, his doormat."
Penny,"Well, you know what they say, if it ainêt broke."
Leonard,Wow. It sounds to me like you donêt want us to live together.
Penny,"No, no, I do. I do. Itês just, I mean, itês a really big step."
Leonard,"Is it? Weêre together all the time. Financially, it makes great sense. Can you think of one reason why we shouldnêt do this?"
Penny,"Well, um, Iêm just a little thirsty."
Penny,I got nothing.
Leonard,Great. Iêll go get my stuff.
Penny,"Yeah. Okay, all right, donêt freak out. You can make this work."
Leonard,"Oh, could you clear off a shelf for me in the bathroom? I take a lot of medicine."
Penny,"Oh, please let some of it be Xanax."
Raj,"No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz. As it is, Iêm going to have to carry my stomach out of here like Iêm a fireman rescuing an infant."
Raj,"Well, I, I really couldnêt. But, uh, Iêve had a lovely time eating your brisket and hearing about the things youêve had removed from your body over the years. Didnêt know you could have a cyst inside another cyst."
Raj,"That would be lovely. Thank you.  Mrs. Wolowitz, uh, are you okay?"
Raj,"I, uh, I suppose I could stay for some dessert."
Sheldon,One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure. Thatês Leonardês.
Amy,Childrenês toy.
Sheldon,One Star Trek: The Next Generation phaser. Thatês Leonardês.
Amy,Childrenês toy.
Sheldon,"One Game of Thrones collectorês edition Longclaw sword. Oh, Leonard and I bought that together. Thatês a bit of an ethical conundrum. Eh, Iêll keep it."
Amy,"So, uh, whatês your plan moving forward?"
Sheldon,"Uh, suppose Iêll have to find and cultivate a new roommate. What a task that will be. Do you know how uncivilized Leonard was when I took him in?"
Sheldon,"Oh, it took me forever to get him on a bathroom schedule. He would just go whenever the mood struck him."
Amy,Like a dog-boy.
Amy,What if you could find a roommate who was a scientist and already familiar and comfortable with your ways?
Sheldon,"That would be ideal. If a person like that existed, I would sign on, no further questions asked."
Amy,Great. Here I am!
Sheldon,Wait. Here who is where?
Amy,Me. Arenêt I your perfect roommate?
Amy,"Think about it, Sheldon. Iêm not a stranger, weêre intellectually compatible, Iêm willing to chauffeur you around town, and your personality quirks, which others find abhorrent or rage-inducing, I find cute as a button. What do you think?"
Amy,Tell me one reason why this isnêt a fantastic idea.
Amy,See? You canêt. Iêm gonna go see if Leonardês room is big enough for my water bed.
Sheldon, Good buddy Leonard.
Leonard,What do you want?
Sheldon,"Hey, good buddy. So, uh, I was just talking to Amy, and she made me realize that this little dust-up between you and me is much ado about nothing."
Leonard,Is that so?
Sheldon,"Yes. All is forgiven, so come back home. Iêll make you some soy hot chocolate, and then Iêll you tell you about our exciting new devil-may-care bathroom policy."
Leonard,"Cut to the chase, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Okay. Amyês decided she wants to move in with me, so I need you to come back home, you lovable scamp. Thatês a lot of product."
Penny,Hey. Whatês going on?
Leonard,"Oh, get this, suddenly, Sheldon wants me back because Amy wants to move in with him."
Penny,Really? Interesting.
Leonard,"Well, too late, pal. Iêm not going anywhere. Penny and I are very happy living together. Isnêt that right?"
Penny,Itês like the happiness wonêt ever leave the apartment.
Sheldon,"Leonard, please. You know Amy moving in marks a level of intimacy our relationship isnêt ready for."
Penny,"Yes. That is a real thing. And it doesnêt mean you donêt care about each other, it just means things are moving at a pace youêre not comfortable with, and thatês fine."
Leonard,"Well, if he doesnêt want to live with her, then he should tell her how he feels."
Penny,"Well, maybe he doesnêt know how to say it without hurting her feelings."
Sheldon,"Feelings? What am I, a hippie at a love-in? The problem is, she laid out a series of logical arguments that I couldnêt refute."
Penny,"That is the worst, isnêt it?"
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, Sheldon. I canêt help you. Oh, spoiler alert, this doorês about to slam in your face."
Amy,"Oh, there you are. When do I get a key to our apartment?"
Howard,Hey. Howêd it go last night with my mom?
Raj,"Okay, I guess."
Howard,What time did you leave?
Raj,"Actually, Iêm still here."
Howard,You spent the night?
Raj,"Yeah. Uh, after dinner, we watched a rerun of Rockford Files, and then she opened a bottle of, uh, cream sherry, and the next thing I know, she was tucking me into your bed."
Howard,You wore my pyjamas?
Raj,"Mm-hmm. How do you sleep in these things? Silk pajamas on satin sheets? I slid out of the bed, like, three times."
Raj,"Oh, boy. Breakfast."
Howard,"Okay, Raj, listen to me. You need to get out of there."
Raj,But I have a cream sherry hangover and I smell blintzes.
Howard,"If you donêt leave now, sheêll use food and guilt to keep you there for the rest of your life."
Raj,"Oh, Howard, stop."
Howard,"Trust me, youêre not Jewish. Thatês how they get you."
Raj,Youêre being silly. I can leave whenever I want.
Howard,"Oh, really? Where are your clothes and your shoes?"
Raj,"Theyêre on the chair, right overÑ Oy vey."
Sheldon,"Hello, home wrecker."
Penny,What did I do?
Sheldon,"You gave Leonard somewhere to go. Thanks to you, Amyês out buying his and hers bath towels. Like Iêd ever dry myself with something that has a possessive pronoun on it."
Penny,"Okay. Listen, the truth is I donêt want him living with me."
Sheldon,Great. Kick him out. Break his heart. Everybody wins.
Penny,"No, I donêt want to break his heart. I love him. This is just happening too fast."
Sheldon,You think this is fast? Itês just a matter of time before I see Amyês leg stubble in my shower.
Penny,"Yeah, and Iêve seen those legs. You might want to get some Drano."
Sheldon,"Hold on. If you donêt want to live with Leonard, why donêt you just tell him?"
Penny,"Well, you know how he is. Heês sensitive and emotional."
Sheldon,Thatês because he drinks too much soy milk.
Penny,"Well, I donêt know what else we can do but tell them the truth."
Sheldon,"I suppose thereês no choice but to face the crying, angry accusations and the high-pitched wails of despair."
Penny,Yeah. And who knows how Amy will react.
Howard,Hereês some more ice.
Bernadette,"Oh, thanks."
Howard,What were we thinking? We should have just done it the regular way.
Bernadette,Those Chinese acrobats in Cirque du Soleil made it look so easy.
Howard,"Honestly, if I could bend that far, what would I need with you?"
Bernadette,"If you could bend that far, youêd be doing us both a favour.  "
Howard,"Hey, Raj. Whatês up?"
Raj,You were right. I canêt get out of here.
Howard,Youêre still at my motherês?
Raj,"Iêm trapped. My clothes have been in the laundry all day, and she hid my keys. I think they might be in her bra, because she jingles when she walks. What do I do?"
Howard,"Hey, you wanted a woman in your life. Now you got one."
Raj,"Come on, Howard, help me."
Raj,"Oh, my God. Sheês not gonna bathe me, is she?"
Howard,"Gee, I wish I could tell you no. All right, well, thanks again for helping me out."
Raj,"But, HowardÑ"
Bernadette,Should we go back and rescue him?
Howard,Itês too late. Weêll see him at his Bar Mitzvah.
Amy,Here you go. I picked up the Chinese food just the way Leonard used to.
Sheldon,Is it kung pao chicken?
Sheldon,"Brown rice, not white rice?"
Sheldon,Spicy mustard from the Korean deli?
Amy,"Yes. I did good, right?"
Sheldon,"Yes. Amy, are you worried that us living together will take the mystery out of our relationship?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, why would you?"
Amy,"Oh, and, uh, check this out. I took the liberty of scripting a new outgoing voice mail message for both of us."
Sheldon,Hello. This is Sheldon.
Amy,And this is Amy.
Sheldon,Weêre not home right now.
Amy,"‚Cause we out dropping science, son."
Sheldon,You canêt live here.
Amy,Why? Is it the message? I only used urban slang to sound tough so people wouldnêt break in.
Sheldon,Itês not the message.
Amy,"Well, what is it, then? I did everything just the way you like it."
Sheldon,You did.
Amy,"Then what the hell, Sheldon? We have been going out for over two years, and I have been nothing but patient with you. I watch your dopey space movies. I signed your ridiculous contract. I even stopped wearing lip gloss êcause you said it made my mouth look too slippery. I am the best girlfriend youêre ever gonna have. You give me one good reason why I canêt live here."
Sheldon,Itês Pennyês fault.
Sheldon,"She doesnêt want to live with Leonard, so he has to come live here again. Sheês the snake in our garden. Sheês the reason we canêt be happy."
Penny,"Hey, Ames."
Amy,"Yeah. Hey, Ames, nothing. I was all set to move in with Sheldon, and now I hear I canêt êcause you donêt want to live with Leonard."
Penny,"Sheldon, what did you say?"
Sheldon,"I said the truth. You donêt want to live with Leonard, and you know it."
Leonard,Since when donêt you want to live with me?
Penny,"Oh, donêt get all huffy. Youêre the one who decided to move in without even asking me if I was ready."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I think we should talk about that."
Penny,"And since you love the truth so much, why donêt you tell Amy you donêt want to live with her instead of blaming it on me?"
Sheldon,I thought we were talking about the other thing.
Amy,Youêre a coward.
Sheldon,"Well, the evidence does support that."
Penny,"Come on, Amy, letês go drink wine and talk about what jerks our boyfriends are."
Amy,You know what would show them? I should move in here with you.
Sheldon,Do you want to catch up on some Walking Dead?
Sheldon,Have you seen the one where Lori dies?
Sheldon,Or maybe she doesnêt. Letês find out.
Penny,Youêll never believe what happened to me at work today.
Penny,"This old guy was choking on his food, and I saved his life."
Leonard,Youêre kidding. Did you Heimlich him?
Penny,"I said, oh, my God, I think that old guyês choking, and then one of the busboys Heimlichêed him."
Leonard,Youêre a hero.
Penny,"Yeah, that was the point of the story."
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have Thursday night off?"
Penny,"Um, I think so. Why?"
Leonard,"What do you mean, why? Itês Valentineês Day."
Penny,"Oh, right. Yeah, we can do something."
Leonard,You could be a little more into it.
Penny,"No, Iêm into it, Iêm into it. Just, thereês so much pressure to make the night special, and it never works out."
Leonard,"Okay, well, this time itês going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja. You donêt see it coming, and then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!"
Penny,"You know, sometimes I think Iêve made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that."
Sheldon,"So, in conclusion, I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste."
Amy,"I concur, but you changed the subject. What are we doing for Valentineês Day?"
Sheldon,"Oh, you caught that, did you?"
Howard,Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay! Okay.
Raj,Everything okay?
Howard,"Bernieês a little cranky since sheês been working, like, 17 hours a day. And Iêve got a lot on my plate, too, because Iêve been busting my tail playing Assassinês Creed."
Raj,"Hey, Stuart, you got anything going on for Valentineês Day?"
Raj,"Oh, well, I was going to spend the night with my special little lady, but, uh, she got worms, and then I had to take her to the vet."
Raj,"Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we throw a party for all the people who donêt have dates?"
Raj,"Yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself."
Sheldon,"Ah, Alex, excellent. I have a research problem that I believe you can help with."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, no. Thatês not going to happen, no. What I need you to do is find a Valentineês gift for my girlfriend."
Sheldon,"Well, I guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents. Now, here is, letês see, this is, this is about two thousand dollars, um, I think she likes monkeys and the colour grey. Contribute to my work. Ah, kids say the darnedest things."
Leonard,"Hey, you coming to lunch?"
Howard,"Yeah, one second. Come here. I want to show you something."
Leonard,What you looking at?
Howard,"Well, I was trying to come up with something really romantic to give Bernadette for Valentineês Day since sheês been such a pain in the ass."
Leonard,You canêt find a card that says that?
Howard,Check it out. I used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart one one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.
Leonard,"Oh, thatês cool."
Howard,A micro-valentine for a microbiologist.
Leonard,From her micro-husband. That is amazing. How long did this take you?
Howard,"Mmm, about twelve hours. I pulled an all-nighter."
Leonard,"Oh, wow."
Howard,"Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video game time. What are you and Penny doing?"
Leonard,"Oh, Iêm going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner."
Howard,"Oh, thatês not bad, but as far as romance goes, I think my gift hits it right out ofÑ "
Leonard,Want to come to dinner with us?
Howard,"Yes, please."
Sheldon,"Okay. Amy will be here shortly, expecting the perfect Valentineês gift, so, youêre up kid. Dazzle me. Go."
Sheldon,"Now, see, I never would have thought to do that. Clearly, I made a good choice farming this out to you. But I am telling you, Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. Anyway, my socks are on. Letês knock them off."
Sheldon,"Now, Amy already has a real harp. And it can play any song. What are you trying to pull here?"
Sheldon,But sheês got Google Maps on her phone.
Sheldon,"Well, I hope itês with a third good option, because these first two, buh."
Sheldon,"Wow. Oh, this is truly remarkable."
Sheldon,I think Iêll keep it for myself.
Sheldon,Itês too late. I call dibs.
Penny,This place is really beautiful.
Leonard,"Waugh, romance ninja."
Howard,Sorry weêre late.
Penny,No problem. We just sat down.
Leonard,"Mmm, would you like some wine?"
Bernadette,"Yeah, fill her up. Iêll tell you when to stop."
Penny,Is everything okay?
Howard,Terrific. Couldnêt be better.
Bernadette,"Oh, bite me."
Howard,"Look, we can still have a nice night. Just tell me where it is."
Bernadette,"Maybe if you did what you said you were going to do, Iêd tell you."
Leonard,"Uh, where what is?"
Howard,"She hid my Xbox like Iêm a child. Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you donêt give it back, Iêm telling."
Bernadette,"Iêve been working late every night. All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. But did he do it? He just kept on playing that stupid game. You like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine."
Howard,I said Iêm sorry.
Bernadette,"Sorry doesnêt clean my underpants, buddy."
Howard,"I told you, turn them inside out."
Bernadette,And I told you to bite me.
Leonard,"Trying to have a magical night here, guys."
Penny,"Oh, son of a bitch."
Penny,Nothing. Nothing.
Leonard,"No, tell me."
Penny,Itês just this guy I used to date.
Penny,"Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen, whoês here with him now."
Leonard,Youêre kidding.
Penny,"And it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it."
Leonard,"I know itês not ideal, but donêt let them ruin our night."
Penny,"No, youêre totally right. She could be skinny êcause sheês dying."
Leonard,Thatês the spirit.
Penny,"You know what, screw them. Our night is going to be way more special than theirs."
Penny," Oh, you got to be kidding me."
Leonard,Two can play this game. PennyÑ
Penny,Get up.
Leonard,All right.
Raj,Itês nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentineês Day can come here tonight and be together.
Raj,Except on a date with anybody.
Raj,"You know, you and I have so much fun hanging out. If you were a girl, all our problems would be solved."
Raj,"Oh, yeah, think about it. Weêd hang out, weêd read comic books, weêd see movies. Itêd be like the best relationship ever."
Raj,"Then Iêd take you home, slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion."
Penny,"Oh, I canêt believe heês going to marry the girl he cheated on me with."
Leonard,"Isnêt it kind of nice? I mean, he was with the wrong person, and now he found the right person."
Penny,"so Iêm the wrong person? Maybe you want to be with Gretchen, too."
Bernadette,They do look happy.
Howard,"Yeah, maybe tonight. But a year from now, heêll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox. Well, he will."
Leonard,You know what? Why donêt we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentineês Day?
Penny,"Yes, absolutely. Now theyêre doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. I totally taught him that."
Leonard,I thought we were letting it go.
Penny,"We were; itês just, itês not fair, okay? Theyêre bad people. Itês not supposed to end happy for them, itês supposed to end happy for me."
Leonard,"Um, it did end happy for you. Youêre here with me."
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, I know."
Leonard,"Okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally."
Penny,"Oh, come on, donêt make this about you."
Leonard,"Oh, Iêm not. Itês about you."
Penny,"Yeah, well, whatever, okay? I told you, Valentineês Day sucks."
Leonard,"This one does, and youêre the reason why."
Bernadette,"You know, compared to them, Iêm feeling pretty good about us."
Howard,"Me, too. How about we blow off dessert, go home early, Iêll do that laundry."
Bernadette,Thank you.
Howard,I love you.
Bernadette,"Love you, too."
Howard,So whereêd you hide it?
Bernadette,Where youêd never look.
Howard,"Damn it, itês in the washing machine."
Amy,Happy Valentineês Day.
Sheldon,Okay. Shall we go to dinner?
Amy,"Hang on. As you know, I had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts."
Sheldon,"Yes, and as you know, I planned to pretend to enjoy it. Iêve been working on this facial expression all day."
Amy,"And I appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, I decided I was being selfish. So, I cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate Valentineês Day."
Sheldon,What is that?
Amy,"By doing none of it. No dinner, no romance, no gifts. We stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved Star War Trek things."
Amy,"Well, thatês what youêd love, isnêt it?"
Sheldon,More than anything.
Amy,"Well, then, thatês what weêre going to do."
Sheldon,"Well, I donêt know what to say. This is the most thoughtful gift that anyoneês ever given me. And thatês including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today."
Amy,"Iêm your girlfriend. Thatês my job. And I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can return."
Sheldon,"No, after everything you didnêt do for me tonight, I want you to have it."
Amy,Whatês this?
Sheldon,Read it.
Amy,"Sheldon Cooper, Caltech University employee information?"
Sheldon,At the bottom.
Amy,"In case of emergency, please contactÑ Amy Farrah Fowler. And thereês my phone number. This is the most beautiful gift you couldêve ever given me."
Sheldon,"Well, I thought, if I have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would I want to share that with?"
Amy,And you picked me.
Sheldon,"Itês like you said, youêre my girlfriend."
Amy,"Oh, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Yeah. Okay. Stop ruining Valentineês Day and order my pizza.
Leonard,"Yep. You know what? That was pretty crappy of you. I mean, all I wanted to do was give you a great night, and itês like you-you went out of your way to destroy it."
Penny,"Yeah, I know. Iêm a total bitch."
Leonard,Iêm not saying that.
Penny,"Well, I am."
Leonard,"Fine, you win. Youêre a bitch. Why couldnêt we just have a nice time?"
Penny,I donêt know. Maybe êcause things are going so well between us lately and Iêve been really happy.
Leonard,"Okay, youêre gonna have to make a lot more sense than that."
Penny,"Obviously, I have some commitment issues."
Leonard,Glaringly obvious. Go on.
Penny,"As long as things keep going great between us, youêll keep asking me to marry you, and eventually Iêm gonna end up saying yes, and then weêre gonna be married forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out."
Leonard,Okay. I know I propose a lot. So how about this? I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.
Penny,what do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?
Leonard,"No, no, no, no. But if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me."
Leonard,"Yes. Itês all on you. But I got to tell you, when the time comes, I want the whole nine yards. I want you down on one knee, flowers, I want to be swept off my feet."
Penny,"Yeah, you got it."
Leonard,And Iêm cool with surprises. But nothing on a Jumbotron. I donêt want to cry on a big screen like that.
Penny,"Okay. You know what? This might be the wine talking, but I have a very important question to ask you."
Leonard,You do?
Penny,Leonard Hofstadter?
Penny,Will you be my valentine?
Leonard,Sorry. Maybe next year. Iêm just kidding. Romance ninja. Letês have sex. Waugh!
Raj,Weêre glad you could make it.
Raj,What is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?
Raj,"I got to tell you, weêve got to stop beating ourselves up like this. Excuse me, everybody. Can I have your attention, please? Weêre all here tonight because we have no one to be with. But that doesnêt make us mutants. The only mutants here are in these comic books. Weêve got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not weêre in a relationship. You know what I see when I look around? I see a room full of great people. So letês give ourselves a break. We are a community, and as long as we have each other, weêre never truly alone."
Raj,You really think so?
Raj,"Thank you. Uh, would you like to, uh, get a cup, a cup of coffee orÑ?"
Raj,"Later, losers!"
Amy,"Hello? Another medical emergency? Whatês wrong with him now? I seriously doubt he was bitten by a Chinese bird spider. How exactly does a bump feel Asian? Just put him on the phone. Sheldon, I am not driving over there again. Because I drove over there yesterday for a brain tumour that turned out to be an ice cream headache. Yes, I still want to be your emergency contact. Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumour. Iêm on my way. Brain tumour would explain a lot."
Raj,"So then I went to Cambridge, which was wonderful not only because itês a good school but because it totally looks like Hogwarts. Thatês where I fell in love with astronomy, and now Iêm an astrophysicist at Caltech, so I guess you could say, uh, Raj is my name and stars are my game. And rhyming is also my game. So, uh, two games. Uh, anyway, that, thatês enough about me. I want to hear everything about you."
Raj,"I go to the bathroom, too. Sometimes more frequently than I care to admit. Oh, Iêve had it checked out, itês nothing. Hmm. This is going great. Mmm, can I have a refill on my chai tea? Yes, I have a good feeling about this.  I should have bought condoms."
Sheldon,"Hello, Iêm Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. My apologies that this episode is coming late. I did shoot one last week, in honour of Black History Month, but I was informed by my roommate that my spot-on portrayal of George Washington Carver could be considered wildly racist. My heart goes out to the members of the African-American community, who, like me, have been kept down by The Man. Now, Fun with Flags is not just for the flag aficionado, itês also for the flag novice, so, to help me with that, please welcome my friend, neighbour, and flag virgin, yeah, not a real virgin. Sheês had coitus many times. Sometimes within earshot of this flag enthusiast. Once while he was trying to watch The Incredibles. Penny."
Sheldon,"So, Penny, I understand you would like to learn more about flags."
Penny,"Yeah, I canêt tell you how many times Iêve been at a party where everyoneês talking about flags and I just couldnêt join in."
Sheldon,"Yeah. Well, you came to the right place."
Penny,"Uh, Iêm sorry, can we just pause for a minute?"
Sheldon,Whatês wrong?
Penny,"I just think it might look more natural if you talked to me instead of the camera, you know, like, like a real conversation. Itês something we work on in my acting class."
Sheldon,Interesting. A few people in the comments section have said that my delivery is robotic. Perhaps that isnêt the compliment it sounds like.
Penny,"Yeah, letês try it again, and maybe, this time, you could work on your body language a bit. You know, when youêre all hunched like that, youêre shutting the audience out, but when youêre relaxed and open, youêre inviting them in."
Sheldon,Right. And which one do I want?
Penny,Letês try open.
Sheldon,"If our friend, the flag, has taught me anything, itês to go where the wind takes you. As long as you remain firmly attached to a rigid pole. And, action. So, Penny, what sort of flag questions keep you awake at night?"
Penny,"Um, well, Iêm from Nebraska. So what can you tell me about the state flag?"
Sheldon,"Gosh, Penny, whatêd you have for breakfast? A big glass of good question juice? The Nebraska state flag is simply the state seal on a field of blue. Spread your legs, invite them in."
Howard,"Iêm telling you, somethingês wrong. I can always feel it when Raj is in trouble."
Bernadette,"Geez, how close were you guys before we got married?"
Leonard,"Donêt look under that rock.  Raj, you okay?"
Howard,You in there?
Raj,Go away!
Leonard,"Come on, buddy, open up."
Howard,Weêre worried about you.
Raj,"Oh, just because Iêve stopped going to work and answering my phone you think something bad happened? Maybe something good happened."
Bernadette,Did something good happen?
Leonard,"Nope, just, just, whoa."
Bernadette,It smells pretty ripe in here. You kind feel it in your eyes.
Leonard,"Raj, whatês going on?"
Raj,I was humiliated by yet another woman.
Howard,"You didnêt kill her and chop her up, thatês not what weêre smelling, right?"
Raj,"I took her for coffee, and she snuck out the bathroom window to get away from me."
Bernadette,"Oh, you poor baby."
Raj,I went and looked. It was a high and tiny window. She must have been very motivated.
Howard,"Iêm sorry. Thatês awful, but come on, you got to shake it off."
Leonard,"Yeah, you canêt stay in your apartment for the rest of your life."
Raj,"Why not? With online shopping and overnight delivery, I can get anything I want. Look, I just ordered a case of Dinty Moore beef stew and two live lobsters on Amazon."
Leonard,Lobsters overnight?
Howard,"Oh, youêre kidding. Let me see. Well, Iêll be. Look, you can throw in a couple steaks and have a surf and turf."
Leonard,The surf and turf sounds good. See if they have corn on the cob.
Bernadette,"Guys, weêre trying to get him out of here, not you in."
Raj,"Youêre wasting your time. Just please, leave me alone."
Howard,Now what?
Leonard,I donêt know.
Bernadette,We could go to Red Lobster and talk about it. Weêre all thinking it. I just had the decency to wait for him to leave.
Amy,"Hello, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Hello. Howês the final stage of your nicotine addiction study going?
Amy,"Fine. Just hold on. Mommyês on the phone! Sorry. Weêve cut the monkeys down to one cigarette a day, so things are a little intense. Makes me miss my marijuana-abusing flatworms. Those guys were mellow."
Sheldon,"Good news. Uh, the latest episode of Fun with Flags is online."
Amy,"Oh, thatês right. Howêd it go with Penny?"
Sheldon,Much better than I expected. She even gave me some helpful tips about acting and body language. Watch. Welcome to my world. Not welcome to my world. Welcome. Not welcome.
Amy,"Subtle, but powerful."
Sheldon,I know. Iêm still learning to control it.
Amy,Did you tell Penny how helpful she was?
Sheldon,Why would I do that?
Amy,"Because sheês your friend, and she did a nice job. Iêm sure sheêd like to hear it."
Sheldon,All right.
Amy,"I didnêt mean now. Hello? Yeah, yeah, you want a cigarette. Well, Iêd like a normal boyfriend. Deal with it."
Penny,"Oh, hi. Whatês up?"
Penny,You need me to shut the door so you can do your knocking thing?
Sheldon,"I didnêt start yet, itês fine."
Penny,"Okay. So, what do you need?"
Sheldon,"Well, I was thinking about you helping me out last night  Penny."
Sheldon,"Yes, you were very natural in front of the camera, and I found your suggestions extremely helpful."
Penny,"Aw, sweetie, you just made my day."
Penny,"Hey, my acting class is putting on a play Friday night. I could put you and Amy on the guest list."
Sheldon,"Oh, that sounds terrible. Why would I want to do that?"
Amy,Thatês right. Theyêre no good without the lighter.
Sheldon,"Well, so much for your advice on complimenting Penny."
Amy,Why? What happened?
Sheldon,"She tried to rope us into going to her acting class to see a play. Donêt worry. Luckily, I had the good sense to drown that kitten in the river."
Amy,"Sheldon, thatês very rude. She helped you with your show. The right thing to do is reciprocate by going to see her play."
Sheldon,"Oh, so many crazy rules."
Amy,That better be Tootsie Rolls youêre throwing at me!
Sheldon," Penny. Oh yeah, much better."
Sheldon,"Amy pointed out to me that since you did something nice for me, Iêm obligated to do something nice for you. So, yes, Iêll go to your dopey play."
Penny,"Hey, I donêt want you to go any more."
Sheldon,Why not?
Penny,"You should go êcause you want to go, not because you have to."
Sheldon,"Oh, Dear Lord, more rules? Where does it stop? Can I want to go because I have to want to go?"
Penny,Okay. Do whatever you want.
Sheldon,"Yeah, but now, wait. Do whatever I want? Or whatever I have to want?"
Penny,"Oh, for Godês sake, just come to the play."
Sheldon,"All right. I donêt want to, but at least that makes sense."
Sheldon,"You know, I havenêt seen Raj in several days. Is he no longer a part of our social group? And if so, should we be interviewing for a replacement? Perhaps, this time, we go Latin."
Howard,Heês just decided heês never leaving his apartment again.
Sheldon,"Oh, brilliant. Iêve been itching to pull that trigger."
Howard,Heês upset because he canêt get anywhere with women.
Sheldon,Would it help if I gave him some pointers? Iêm just funninê ya.
Howard,"Youêre the one? Okay, let me tell you something. That guy you blew off happens to be my best friend. Okay? He was devastated."
Howard,"Okay. But I gotta warn you, Raj is a proud, passionate man. If you go running out on him again, youêre only gonna get, like, three or four more chances before you are history."
Howard,"Come on, she came back. This is good news. You should celebrate."
Raj,I donêt want to celebrate.
Howard,"Not even a little? I mean, we could have a pants party. Go put some on."
Raj,Why would I want her number? I donêt want anything to do with this woman.
Howard,"Oh, come on, Raj."
Raj,"No, you donêt get it. I want nothing to do with any woman. My heart is stone. From now on, Iêm a monk. I renounce all worldly pleasures. Except for lobster. And garlic butter."
Howard,"Boy, I want to tell you itês her loss, but you are not making it easy."
Raj,"Youêre, youêre a good friend for trying to help, but, Iêve made my choice."
Howard,"All right. Well, Iêll see you around."
Raj,"See you. No, wait, take her number. I donêt want the temptation."
Raj,"I must be strong so I donêt stray from my true purpose, the study of the universe."
Howard,All right. Thanks for ruining lobster for me.
Raj,Wait! Give me the number! Give me the number! Give me the number!
Leonard,"So, Amy, whatês going on with your addiction study?"
Amy,"Sadly, Iêm no longer associated with that project."
Leonard,Why? What happened?
Amy,"Typical bureaucratic nonsense. You can get animals addicted to a harmful substance, you can dissect their brains, but you throw their own faeces back at them and suddenly youêre unprofessional."
Leonard,Iêm sorry. That I asked.
Sheldon,"All right, letês get this stupid play over with."
Leonard,"Uh, hang on. Empty your pockets."
Leonard,You know why. The Nintendo DS. And the PSP. Now the Gameboy.
Sheldon,"Aw, for Peteês sake. Can we go now?"
Leonard,"Well, is that all of it?  Just set it down."
Amy,"Just so you know, this is not a stupid play. A Streetcar Named Desire is an American classic."
Sheldon,"Itês about streetcars? Oh, great. I wonêt need this. "
Raj,"Just a sec. Oh, who says just a sec? I hate myself. Hello."
Raj,"Uh, would you like to come in?"
Raj,"Wait. Can you at least tell me what went wrong? Itês okay. I can take anything. Unless itês something I did, or said, or am. ‚Cause those are, like, my buttons."
Raj,Really? Then what were you doing at the comic book store that night?
Raj,"Yeah, me neither."
Raj,I lied. I love them. I only said that so youêd go out with me.
Raj,"Thatês great. Iêm broken, too."
Raj,"Oh, I totally am. If it wasnêt for this beer, I couldnêt even talk to you right now. Iêm a wreck. There are many things seriously wrong with me. And not quirks, either. Like, diagnosable psychological problems. Maybe brain damage."
Raj,"Go out with me on one date, and I promise you, youêll see."
Raj,"You wonêt regret it. Iêm the most pathetic guy youêve ever met. And that, boys and girls, is how itês done."
Penny,"You love her very much, donêt you?"
Penny,"I think you have a great capacity for devotion. Youêll be lonely when she passes on, wonêt you? I understand what that is."
Leonard,"Sheês pretty good, huh?"
Sheldon,She is. But when do they get to the part about streetcars?
Penny,"Ñwhen I was a very young girl. When I was 16 years old, I made the discovery, love. All at once, and much, much too completely. It was like you suddenly turned a blinding light on something that had always been half a shadow. Thatês how it struck the world for me. But I was unlucky. Deluded."
Sheldon,Sheês remarkable.
Leonard,She really is.
Amy,Our Pennyês a star.
Sheldon,"How can she remember all those lines, but as a waitress, she canêt remember no tomato on my hamburger?"
Leonard,"Look, I know you guys donêt want to do this, but we have no choice. So, you can either bitch and whine or we can just get it over with."
Howard,I got whine.
Sheldon,I got the B word.
Leonard,"Yeah, well, itês in our contract to serve on a university committee. And frankly, this is one I believe in. Okay, here we go. Encouraging more women to pursue a career in the sciences."
Howard,"Come on, if I was any good at convincing women to do stuff, I wouldnêt have spent so much of my twenties in the shower."
Sheldon,"If you ask me, this whole thing is a waste of our time."
Leonard,Helping women? Y
Sheldon,Helping anyone. People should take care of themselves.
Leonard,"Oh, like yesterday, when you made me drive you to the dry cleaners, the pharmacy and the post office?"
Sheldon,Iêm not saying people canêt use tools. Even an otter picks up a rock when he wants a clam.
Leonard,You donêt think itês worthwhile to try to get more women working in science.
Sheldon,"I think thatês incredibly sexist of you. I believe in a gender-blind society like in Star Trek, where women and men of all races and creeds work side by side as equals."
Leonard,"You mean where they were advanced enough to invent an interstellar warp drive, but a black lady still answered the space phone?"
Howard,"Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time with Lieutenant Uhura."
Sheldon,"Howardês disturbing recollections aside, I donêt appreciate being forced to do banal committee work."
Leonard,"Yes, I know, youêre too smart for this."
Sheldon,Exactly. Itês like asking the Human Torch to heat up your frozen burrito.
Leonard,"Got it. All right, Iêm thinking one way to counter bias in the peer-review process, is for papers to be submitted under gender-neutral names. Like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith."
Sheldon,"I suppose there is a history of professional women using their initials so as not to be pre-judged. Harry Potterês J.K. Rowling, uh, Star Trekês D.C. Fontana."
Howard,"Van Nuys pole-dancer D.D. Melons. All right, I think weêve really helped women today. Letês fire up the old Xbox."
Leonard,"Guys, please donêt make this a school project where Iêm the smart kid doing all the work while the slackers sit back and watch."
Sheldon,Weêre not. This time youêre the smart kid doing all the work while the even smarter kids sit back and watch.
Howard,"So, you think Iêm one of the smarter kids?"
Sheldon,"No, youêre a tool I was using to make my point."
Leonard,"Guys, our topic is encouraging women in science, can you at least play a less sexist game"
Sheldon,How is it sexist? My character wields a battle axe as well as any man.
Howard,Not to mention she has mammary glands that could nurse a family of 30. And have enough milk left over to open a Baskin Robbins.
Sheldon,"Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner, I hear glass ceilings shattering all over town."
Leonard,"Sheldon, youêre always saying how much smarter you are than me. Spend five seconds and come up with one idea on how to get more women into science."
Sheldon,All your ideas address the issue at a university level. By then itês too late. You need to design an outreach program that targets girls at the middle school level and sets them on an academic track towards the hard sciences.
Leonard,Thatês actually good. Why didnêt I think of that?
Sheldon,"Some people are otters, some people are rocks."
Leonard,I wonder if thereês a way we could give the idea a trial run.
Howard,"Maybe I could call my old middle school, see if we can talk to some of the female students."
Leonard,"Thatês great, try to set up something for the three of us to go over there."
Sheldon,"Oh, hold on. While Iêm comfortable speaking about science, Iêm not sure I know how to spark the interest of schoolchildren. Better Google it."
Howard,What exactly are you looking up?
Sheldon,How do I get 12-year-old girls excited.
Raj,Thanks again for letting me crash girlsê night.
Penny,Are you kidding? You brought fancy wine and made fondue. Iêve slept with guys for less. Itês a joke. Based on real events.
Raj,"Anyway, I was hoping I could, uh, pick your brains a little. Iêm supposed to take Lucy out Friday and I need a killer first date."
Amy,"Well, evolutionary biology says that women are attracted to a man who is steady n the face of danger, so I recommend an unsafe environment. Seedy bar on the wrong side of the tracks, picnic near a lunatic asylum, a wine tasting on Skid Row."
Raj,"Uh, Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues. Maybe we could start with something simpler."
Bernadette,"Why donêt you take her to Disneyland? You go on Space Mountain, youêre in the dark, sheês holding onto you."
Penny,"Yeah, but you just have to remember, that ride is shorter than you think and they take a picture of you at the end, so make sure you got your clothes back on. Itês a joke. Based on real events."
Raj,"Mm, Disneyland? I donêt know. With all the crowds and the weird characters walking around, just reminds me too much of India."
Amy,I havenêt been to Disneyland since I was a kid. We should definitely go one weekend.
Bernadette,Weekends are too crowded.
Penny,"So, blow off work, go on a weekday."
Amy,Hooky? Iêve never played hooky in my life. My mom said thatês how girls end up addicted to reefer and jazz music.
Penny,Itês more like how girls end up at a Best Western hotel with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.
Penny,I can laugh about it now.
Bernadette,"So, what do you say? This Friday we ditch work and go to Disneyland?"
Penny,Iêm in.
Amy,"Me, too."
Raj,"Excuse me, I thought we were trying to solve my problem?"
Penny,"Oh, yeah, right. Wait, what was your problem again?"
Raj,"I am a man who canêt talk to women, trying to figure out how to go on a romantic date with a girl who suffers from such crippling social anxiety she canêt be around other people."
Penny,"Yeah, thatês a toughie."
Bernadette,Letês think.
Amy,"Hmm. We doing just Disney or California Adventure, too?"
Leonard,Itês nice of your old school to let us try out our science talk on some female students.
Howard,"Well, theyêre actually pretty excited. Iêm their most famous alum. If you donêt count the serial killer who ate all those prostitutes."
Sheldon,"This must feel pretty good for you, coming back to your alma mater as an astronaut."
Howard,"Yeah, last time I was here, I was just a scrawny little nerd."
Leonard,And now youêre also an astronaut.
Howard,"So many memories. I mean, how many times in these hallways was I tripped, punched and spit on? Oh, look, hereês my old locker. I have a masters in engineering and I still canêt figure out how Scott Kapinski got me and my briefcase to fit in there.  Hey."
Sheldon,Smart. We donêt want any problems.
Amy,I canêt believe I ditched work for Disneyland.
Bernadette,What did you tell your boss?
Amy,"Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages. At seven oêclock last night, I called about a problem at the lab and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood. At nine thirty, I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird. At eleven thirty, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire hose. At twelve forty-five, I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds, and now Iêm going to Disneyland."
Bernadette,"Penny, what did you say?"
Penny,"I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I said bye."
Amy,"So, what are we gonna do first?"
Bernadette,"I donêt know about you guys, but Iêm gonna make a beeline for the place that gives you a princess makeover."
Amy,"Ooh, that sounds like fun."
Penny,"Youêre kidding, right? Weêre not just gonna get drunk and go on rides?"
Amy,"Come on, do it with us."
Penny,"All right, whatever. How does it work?"
Bernadette,"Okay, so, you pick your princess, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Cinderella, they give you hair, makeup, the works."
Penny,Guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.
Amy,"Oh, I want to be Cinderella, too."
Bernadette,We canêt all be Cinderella.
Amy,Then how do we decide?
Bernadette,"Well, itês simple. This was my idea. Iêm driving. Iêm Cinderella. You bitches got a problem with that, we could stop the car right now."
Raj,"Excuse me, Iêm meeting a girl here. Itês kind of our first date."
Raj,"She and I are both a little awkward in social situations, so this seemed like a good idea."
Raj,"No, you canêt join us. Just go, go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from."
Raj,"As youêre reading, it will help to remember I have an adorable accent."
Leonard,"Okay, whoês ready for some science? Me, too. Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. I am here with my friends Dr. Cooper and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz, and we are going to show you girls how cool a job in science can be. How cool, you ask? Well, how about negative 273 degrees, êcause thatês the temperature at which entropy reaches its minimum value. Did I just learn something new and have fun doing it? All right. So now letês bring out theoretical physicist Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
Sheldon,"Hello, female children. Allow me to inspire you with a story about a great female scientist. Polish-born, French-educated Madame Curie. Co-discoverer of radioactivity, she was a hero of science, until her hair fell out, her vomit and stool became filled with blood, and she was poisoned to death by her own discovery. With a little hard work, I see no reason why that canêt happen to any of you. Are we done? Can we go?"
Howard,"The thing to remember is you can go to outer space, too. I mean, look at me. I went to this very school. Those desks youêre sitting in, I was once superglued to one of them."
Howard,"No, but I did go to the International Space Station."
Howard,"No, but I was in the rocket. I didnêt actuallyÑ"
Howard,"No, Iêm an American hero. Your uncle brings people nuts, okay?"
Leonard,"Alright, alright. Boy, we are learning a lot here, huh? Thank you, astronaut Howard. Um, I am whatês called an experimental physicist, which is super-fun, because I get to test theories and work with lasers. Yes?"
Leonard,"Uh, excellent question. Um, I suppose Iêve always been into science, you know. My mother and father are scientists, so I was kind of led in that direction. Uh, pushed might be a better way to describe it. To be honest with you guys, when I was your age, I wanted to be a rap star. Like Snoop Dogg, but with a healthy respect for the police. Yeah, no, sure, you laugh. Just like my mother did. After I confided, I was derided and chided, my moms and I collided. She said my dreams were misguided. Thatês just a little freestyle."
Raj,"My dadês a gynaecologist in India, so if youêre over there and need a check up, as he likes to say, heês at your cervix."
Raj,Thatês a fitting pun-ishment. I still donêt know what you do for a living.
Raj,Anything I might have seen?
Raj,"No, never. What is porn?"
Raj,"Ooh, fun. I love prom. The romance, the gowns, itês like a fairy tale come to life. Sorry. Autocorrect. That was supposed to say, I like sports."
Leonard,"I never wanted to play the cello. How do you meet girls playing the cello? Hey, you want to come over to my house and listen to me play an instrument that sounds like a suicidal bumblebee?"
Howard,"Quick, pull the fire alarm. Letês get out of here."
Sheldon,"Uh, hello again. Um, yeah, I donêt know if women in general have been actively discouraged from pursuing the sciences, but itês clear you young women here, today, have been. While I was listening to my colleagues waste your time, it occurred to me that it might be much more meaningful to hear about women in science from actual women in science, and, uh, I happen to know two brilliant examples who have agreed to speak to you on the phone right now. Uh, Dr. Rostenkowski, Dr. Fowler, are you there?"
Amy,Weêre here.
Sheldon,Thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to enlighten these young women.
Amy,"Itês our pleasure. Iêm Dr. Fowler, and Iêm a neuroscientist."
Bernadette,"And Iêm Dr. Rostenkowski Wolowitz, and Iêm a microbiologist."
Amy,"The world of science needs more women, but from a young age, we girls are encouraged to care more about the way we look than about the power of our minds."
Bernadette,Thatês true. Every one of you has the capacity to be anything you want to be.
Penny,Unless you want to be Cinderella.
Bernadette,Come at me. See what happens.
Raj,This was really fun.
Raj,Iêm counting that as foreplay.
Howard,"Bernie, Iêm home. You have fun today?"
Bernadette,"Yes, and I have a surprise for you."
Howard,Please be Cinderella. Please be Cinderella.
Bernadette,"Well, hello, Prince Charming."
Leonard,"Hey, how was yourÑ what?"
Penny,"I can explain. I played hooky with the girls, then we all went to Disneyland and gotÑ What are you doing?"
Leonard,"Disneyland. Go on, Iêm listening."
Amy,"Sheldon, all Snow White needs is one little kiss to wake up."
Sheldon,Heard you the first time.
Bernadette,What you doing?
Howard,You said clean up. Iêm cleaning up.
Bernadette,You canêt just throw everything in the closet.
Howard,"Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you canêt do both. This isnêt sex."
Bernadette,What if someone looks in there?
Howard,Theyêre just coming over for dinner. No oneês gonna look in the closet.
Bernadette,"Well, you donêt know that. What if someoneês looking for the bathroom and they open that door?"
Howard,Could work out. For all we know thereês a toilet in there somewhere.
Bernadette,Fine. But after tonight we need to get a handle on this mess.
Howard,You know what we should do? We should show the closet to Sheldon.
Howard,"Are you kidding? Heês like a savant at organizing. Everything in his apartment has a label on it. Including his label maker, which has a label that says label maker. And if you look really close at that label maker label, youêll see a label that says label."
Bernadette,"Heês our guest, we canêt just ask him to straighten our closet."
Howard,"No, we wouldnêt ask him. Weêd just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there."
Howard,"Hey, guys, come on in."
Penny,"Ooh, it smells good."
Bernadette,"Thanks. And, Sheldon, I know tonightês the night you eat Thai food, so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch."
Sheldon,"Oh, you shouldnêt have."
Bernadette,"Oh, itês my pleasure."
Sheldon,"No, you really shouldnêt have. I brought my own."
Bernadette,You stopped and got him takeout?
Leonard,I had no choice. He kept kicking the back of my seat.
Bernadette,"Sheldon, Iêve been cooking all day."
Sheldon,"Well, now donêt you feel silly."
Bernadette,Show him the closet.
Raj,"These spring rolls are amazing. Good job, Bernadette."
Bernadette,Thatês the takeout that Sheldon brought.
Raj,"Oh, well, Iêm sure they wouldnêt have tasted nearly as good if I hadnêt tried your food first."
Sheldon,"Howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?"
Howard,Colourês fine.
Sheldon,"Wrong, theyêll be arranged seasonally."
Penny,"Sheldon, arenêt you gonna spend a little time with Amy?"
Amy,"Oh, itês okay, Iêm used to it. The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle."
Sheldon,"Yeah, and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami."
Amy,His quirks just make you love him more. Someone please agree with me.
Leonard,"Sheldon, come on. Itês getting late. Time to go."
Sheldon,"Oh, five more minutes."
Leonard,Thatês what you said five minutes ago. Amy and Penny are already in the car. Letês move it.
Sheldon,How come I never get to do anything I want to do?
Howard,"You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home."
Sheldon,"Please, Leonard, he said itês okay."
Leonard,"Sheldon, itês, wait, I can go home without you? Bye."
Sheldon,"Howard, I have a few questions. I found three bowling pins. Now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?"
Sheldon,You health nuts kill me.
Bernadette,"Oh, my God, itês beautiful. Look, he found the juggling pins I hid."
Sheldon,"Uh, just a couple more items. Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box. Now, based on the content, it could either be filedÑ"
Howard,"Whoa, you opened this?"
Sheldon,"Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying, based on the contentÑ"
Howard,"I couldnêt be less interested. Now, come on, Iêll take you home."
Bernadette,"Howard, donêt you want to know whatês in the letter?"
Howard,"If I wanted to know, I wouldêve opened it years ago. The closet looks great. Letês get out of here."
Sheldon,"Wait, can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?"
Howard,Do whatever you want.
Sheldon,Thanks. Oh. Great party.
Leonard,"You know, when I first met Howard, he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say, aw, I sat in gum."
Penny,What is your point?
Leonard,"Well, itês just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties."
Penny,Really? You couldnêt just say that? You had to tell the scrotum story?
Leonard,Trying to paint a picture.
Penny,It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.
Leonard,"Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up."
Penny,"Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?"
Leonard,Yeah. AlthoughÑ
Bernadette,"Howie, you okay?"
Howard,"Yeah, I just couldnêt sleep."
Bernadette,"Told you you shouldnêt have espresso after dinner. I know the little cups make you feel big, but itês not worth it."
Howard,Itês this stupid letter.
Bernadette,Did you read it?
Bernadette,You must be curious.
Howard,"Of course Iêm curious. I havenêt seen the man since, oh, I was a little kid. And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? Whatês that about?"
Bernadette,Why donêt you read it? Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.
Howard,He abandoned me and my mother. Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?
Bernadette,"I get that. So, what do you want to do with it?"
Howard,Something I should have done a long time ago. 
Bernadette,Really? Are you sure?
Bernadette,Feel better?
Howard,I do.  Great. Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.
Amy,I canêt believe he set it on fire.
Bernadette,"Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out. And he was already having a tough day êcause he accidentally wore my pants to work. I donêt know why he was upset. They were bigger on him than me."
Amy,"Boy, Iêm really curious what was in that letter."
Bernadette,"Me, too, but I guess now weêll never know."
Amy,"Well, you said Sheldon read it. Why not ask him?"
Bernadette,I canêt do that. What kind of wife would I be if I didnêt respect my husbandês privacy?
Penny,"What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?"
Bernadette,That works.
Sheldon,Bleuch. Like cleaning out the entire buildingês belly button.
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Oh, hello. What can I do for you ladies?"
Amy,You have something we want.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear. My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city."
Penny,"No, we just want information."
Sheldon,"Oh. Oh, Iêve got that in spades. Ravage me."
Penny,We heard you read the letter from Howardês father.
Sheldon,I did.
Penny,What did it say?
Sheldon,I canêt tell you that. Iêm bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
Amy,"Sheldon, thatês not a real thing."
Sheldon,"Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriendês hand at the movies. You know. That doesnêt stop you from pawing at me like youêre a bear and Iêm a trash can full of sweets."
Penny,Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.
Sheldon,"Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard. By happenstance, I came to know it. That doesnêt give me the right to disseminate it freely."
Penny,"Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadetteês closet. Doesnêt that count for something?"
Sheldon,"Are you pointing out that California is a community property state, and since Howard and Bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?"
Penny,"Yeah, obviously."
Sheldon,"Well played. Sometimes I donêt give you enough credit, Penny."
Raj,"Dude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party."
Leonard,"Actually, all I did was invite you."
Raj,"Well, put your mind at ease. Iêm here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howardês dinner partyês ass. Now, the first thing we need is a theme. Iêm thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge."
Leonard,"Iêm thinking you need a testosterone patch. Penny and I just want to do something low-key. You know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors dêoeuvres."
Raj,So your theme is I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joeês? Hate to miss that.
Leonard,"Hey, where have you been?"
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard. If I was prone to sarcasm, Iêd say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets."
Leonard,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, youêve been gone a long time."
Sheldon,"Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by Penny, Bernadette and Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about Howardês father."
Leonard,What information?
Sheldon,I canêt tell you that. I am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.
Raj,"Well, come on, we wonêt tell anyone."
Sheldon,"Sorry, badgering me wonêt work. What you should have said is, Itês pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us."
Leonard,"Fine, then that."
Sheldon,"All right, Iêll tell you. My goodness, everyoneês on their game today."
Amy,This is really fun.
Raj,"Yeah, itês nice to get dressed up once in a while."
Penny,"Yeah, and the hors dêoeuvres are delightful."
Leonard,As is the company.
Sheldon,My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.
Leonard,"Hey, uh, listen, everybody. Before Howard gets here, etês all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father."
Raj,Of course.
Sheldon,"If I say yes, can we turn off that Latin orgy music?"
Howard,Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.
Bernadette,"Yeah, try doing it in heels."
Howard,I am.
Bernadette,Wait. Thereês something I have to tell you.
Bernadette,I know what was in your dadês letter.
Howard,"Sheldon, I swear to God, Iêm gonna kill you."
Bernadette,I made him tell us.
Howard,Us? Who else knows?
Penny,I know.
Amy,"Me, too."
Leonard,Same here.
Raj,Shame on all of you.
Leonard,"You know, too."
Raj,"Couldnêt leave him one friend, could you?"
Howard,So everybody knows whatês in that letter except for me?
Sheldon,"Yes, itês six against one. Stand down, sir."
Howard,How could you do this?
Bernadette,Iêm sorry.
Raj,"If you want, we could tell you."
Howard,"No, I donêt want to know. I mean, I do, butÑ I got to go."
Amy,Use me as a human shield!
Sheldon,I panicked. He looked taller than usual.
Howard,In here.
Bernadette,Iêm sorry. I should have left it alone.
Howard,Itês okay. Sorry I ran off like that.
Bernadette,What are you looking at?
Howard,"Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid."
Bernadette,Thatês nice.
Howard,"I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. Look at this. Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever. Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows. Neither race was happy to see me with those."
Bernadette,Think you could take a break?
Bernadette,Got a little surprise for you. Come on.
Howard,"Oh, honey, I am in no mood to have sex tonight. Iêll lay there if you absolutely have to have it, butÑ Oh. What are you guys doing here?"
Leonard,"When you left, you werenêt sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dadês letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution."
Howard,"Oh, yeah, whatês that?"
Sheldon,"Itês simple, really. It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. The, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once."
Penny,"We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of the elephant in the room, soÑ"
Sheldon,"Anyway, um, I realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we donêt tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence."
Penny,"Yeah. And I said if it wasnêt epistemic, we might as well not do it."
Bernadette,"Sit down, honey."
Leonard,"Raj, youêre up."
Raj,"Okay, um, It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it said, Happy birthday, Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh, and it was a Far Side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. Thinks itês a fly. Silly frog. So funny."
Sheldon,It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.
Howard,Nice try. Thatês the plot for Goonies.
Amy,Told you.
Amy,"You didnêt know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. And he cried because he was so proud of you."
Sheldon,Or thatês complete poppycock which Amy made up. It still could be the map.
Penny,"It was a letter explaining that your dad wasnêt who he said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave."
Sheldon,I would like to change mine. The pirateês name was Peg-Leg Antoine. Now itês completely different from Goonies.
Amy,"No, itês not."
Leonard,"Okay, my turn. Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did."
Bernadette,"Inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born. On the back he wrote Howard, my son, my greatest gift. You okay?"
Howard,Yeah. Iêm terrific.
Leonard,"So, which one do you think it is, matey?"
Howard,"Actually, I donêt want to know. I want all of them to be true."
Leonard,"Well, one of them is."
Howard,"Thatês pretty cool. Thank you, guys."
Penny,"Hey, itês still early. Why donêt we go back and have that party?"
Leonard,"Yeah, cool."
Sheldon,"You know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasnêt the most interesting thing I read in the closet. Bernadetteês diary has some saucy passages."
Bernadette,"Sheldon, donêt you dare."
Sheldon,Thereês nothing to worry about. Your secretês safe with me.
Bernadette,Thatês more like it.
Sheldon,Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.
Bernadette,Glad youêre feeling better.
Howard,"Me, too. If Iêd known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats."
Penny,"This turned out pretty well, huh?"
Leonard,"Yeah, I think so."
Raj,"I agree. That is, if youêve never been to or heard of a party before."
Amy,"If youêd let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, youêd be happy all the time."
Sheldon,"Uh, Penny, I, I have a couple of questions about your closet. Is there any reason youêre keeping this dead goldfish?"
Penny,"Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him."
Sheldon,"Well, now, did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy."
Penny,Partyês over! Partyês over!
Leonard,"I was reading about this jellyfish that never dies. Instead, it reverts to its asexual state and then grows up again."
Howard,"We thought my 90-year-old grandfather had reverted to an asexual state, but the lawsuit from his Jamaican caregiver proved us all wrong."
Leonard,"My point is, immortality is not only a possibility, it is real."
Raj,Only if youêre this jellyfish which periodically reverts to a mass of undifferentiated protoplasm.
Sheldon,"If I could keep my Gmail account, Iêd be okay with that."
Howard,Thatês terrible.
Leonard,"Oh, my God."
Sheldon,"If weêre going to change the topic from jellyfish, Iêd be okay with brine shrimp or the history of the unicycle."
Howard,"Show a little compassion, a man died."
Sheldon,"Excuse me, the whole tenure system is ridiculous. A guaranteed job for life only encourages the faculty to become complacent. If we really want science to advance, people should have chips implanted in their skulls that explode when they say something stupid."
Raj,"Well, I believe people do their best work when they feel safe and secure."
Howard,You Ph.Dês gonna go suck up like Kripke?
Leonard,"I mean, Iêll apply, but Iêm not gonna stoop to playing politics."
Raj,"Yeah, me neither. It should be about the work. And if I canêt get tenure, Iêd like to see you or Sheldon get it."
Sheldon,"Raj, donêt dangle false hope in front of Leonard like that."
Leonard,"Excuse me, but I think Iêm just as qualified as you are."
Sheldon,Pchew! Pchew! Pchew! Pchew!
Penny,So tenured means a job for life?
Penny,You canêt get fired even if youêre bad at it?
Leonard,"Mm, not really."
Penny,"Wow, sounds a lot like being a pretty waitress at the Cheesecake Factory."
Sheldon,"While I disagree with the premise of tenure, if they gave it to me, it wouldnêt diminish my output. You know, Iêm like the sun. Canêt turn this off."
Amy,Are Rajesh and Leonard competing for it as well?
Amy,Do they know they donêt stand a chance êcause youêre so great?
Sheldon,"Well put. You know, I must say I go back and forth on this boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but those moments when you worship me really keep you in the running."
Raj,It would be nice to have the increased income. Stop taking money from my parents.
Howard,Money from family does come with strings attached.
Raj,"You have no idea. They buy me a new BMW for my birthday but can I get seat warmers? Rajesh, if you want a warm butt, youêre gonna have to pay for it yourself. Well, maybe I will, old man."
Bernadette,I think thatês enough wine for now.
Leonard,I just keep thinking about how cool it would be if I called my mom and told her that I got tenure at Caltech.
Penny,"Sheêd be proud, huh?"
Leonard,"Oh, very. Assuming she takes my call."
Sheldon,My primary concern with being granted tenure is living with an insanely jealous roommate after the fact. I might need to sleep with a gun under my pillow. Or a chainsaw.
Amy,"Or you take advantage of your newfound economic stability and move out, buy a house, get married. start a family."
Sheldon,"Or, the chainsaw."
Raj,"And I will return to New Delhi in triumph atop a bejeweled white elephant. And you know what will be on that elephantês back? A seat warmer. No, Father, you may not have a ride."
Bernadette,Iêm gonna make some coffee.
Penny,"So, who do you have to schmooze to get this deal?"
Leonard,Iêm not gonna schmooze anybody. Iêm gonna let my work speak for itself.
Penny,Thatês great. That shows a lot of integrity.
Leonard,"Thank you. Iêm a naive idiot, right?"
Penny,"Oh, good, you heard me."
Amy,"You know, if you really want tenure, maybe you should cozy up to the people making the decision."
Sheldon,Sheldon Cooper does not do cozy.
Amy,You donêt say.
Sheldon,"But I suppose it wouldnêt hurt to know whoês on the committee. Letês see. Oh, Janine Davis. Oh, dear."
Amy,Is that a problem?
Sheldon,Even you. Youêre a slave.
Sheldon,"Iêm not sure, it could go either way."
Leonard,Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey. Mrs. Davis.
Leonard,Yeah. Just thought Iêd come down and start getting ready for swimsuit season.
Leonard,Not that you need it. I bet you look great in a swimsuit.
Leonard,"Iêve got what my father used to call furniture disease. My chest is falling into my drawers. Iêm not, uh, familiar with this model. How do I make it start?"
Leonard,Right. This one might be broken.
Leonard,"Got it. Oh. There. Oh, yeah. Yeah, now Iêm feeling it. Oh, this is great. I could do this for the rest of my life. Hey, speaking, speaking of things you do for the rest of your life, uh, did I read that youêre on that-that tenure committee?"
Leonard,"Well, Iêm sure you have a lot of good applicants, I just wanted to say hi and let you know that Iêll be throwing my hat in the ring."
Leonard,Go away.
Leonard,"Well, look at that. Burned a whole calorie."
Leonard,"Oh, if you, if you like banana bread, Iêve got a-a great recipe. The trick is in, in fresh ground, Iêll e-mail it to you."
Leonard,Thatês enough cardio for me. Iêm just gonna stretch out before I hit the weights.
Leonard,Call someone.
Raj,"Good day, Mrs. Davis. This is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali from the astrophysics department. Donêt be alarmed, Iêm not really in space. Anyhoo, Iêd like to take this opportunity to tell you about myself, so sit back, relax and enjoy the following 90-minute video."
Raj,"Born in New Delhi, the third son of an itinerant gynecologist, I showed early signs of genius. At the age of five I discovered a celestial object which later turned out to be the moon."
Sheldon,"Yes, hello. Iêm fine. Um, I understand you may have a bad impression of me, so I bought you a gift."
Sheldon,Itês too late. Get ready to like me.
Sheldon,The tragic history of slavery in America. Fun for the whole family.
Sheldon,"UmÑ WellÑ You are black, right?"
Sheldon,"Because you want to start watching it right now. Copy that. Letês see. Up next on the tenure committee is Professor Wu. Well, get ready for the complete works of Jackie Chan."
Raj,Where have you been?
Leonard,Nurseês office.
Howard,Asthma attack?
Leonard,"Asthma, heart, some kind of attack. Iêm fine, though."
Howard,You guys going to Professor Tuppermanês memorial?
Raj,I donêt know.
Leonard,Probably not.
Sheldon,Barely knew him.
Howard,"Yeah, you wouldnêt want to look like you guys are brown-nosing the tenure committee, who will all be there. Oh, yeah, thatês what I was hoping for, meerkats."
Sheldon,"I wonêt be able to make our date night this Thursday, so, bad news for you."
Amy,"Well you better have a good excuse this time, because trimming Q-tips to fit your ears right is obvious nonsense."
Sheldon,"First of all, when you say things like that, people think youêre crazy. Second, the reason Iêm cancelling is because I have to attend a memorial service for Professor Tupperman."
Amy,It sounds like a long and tedious evening.
Sheldon,"Eh, it will be. Honestly, if I must endure a long and tedious evening, Iêd rather it be with you on date night. But I have no choice. The tenure committeeês going to be there."
Amy,"Oh. Well, in that case, perhaps I should come along."
Sheldon,"Well, now that I think about it, that would be most helpful."
Amy,"Of course it would. Iêm well-versed in academic politics, and as a respected scientist, I can only raise your stock as a candidate."
Sheldon,"Actually, I meant you could drive me. But if it makes you happy, that other stuff, too."
Leonard,Do anything interesting today?
Penny,"Oh, not really. I was out shopping with Amy. She wanted me to help her find something for this memorial thing."
Leonard,"Wait, Sheldonês going to be there? We all promised we werenêt going to go."
Penny,"Oh, what a jerk."
Leonard,I know. I was hoping to go without anyone finding out.
Penny,"Well, since Amyês going, do you want me there? You know, to support you?"
Leonard,"Oh, thatês nice, but it-itês just gonna be a room full of boring old men and Iêm not sure how much help youêd be."
Penny,Okay. Iêm just gonna tie my shoe while you think about that.
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. Thanks, that would be great help. You realize you might kill some of them."
Penny,"Oh, then you all can get tenure."
Raj,"Come on, Daddy. All the other scientists have seat warmers. This is so humiliating. Iêve got to get tenure. Okay, letês meet halfway. How about I cut my cleaning lady down to twice a week? Looks like weêre both going to be living like animals."
Amy,Letês go over our emotional responses one last time.
Amy,"Professor Tupperman is dead, and that makes us?"
Amy,The fact that there are so many people here tonight doesnêt make us cranky and claustrophobic. It makes us?
Amy,Giving Mrs. Davis the box set of Roots was?
Sheldon,Bad. HoweverÑ
Sheldon,Fine. Bad.
Raj,Unbelievable. You have some nerve showing up here just to schmooze with the tenure committee.
Sheldon,Youêre here.
Raj,"Excuse me. Iêm here to pay my respects to Professor Tupperware, or whatever his name is."
Sheldon,So am I. His passing makes me feel bad.
Leonard,"Well, well, well, Sheldon, fancy meeting you here. I guess the train store in Glendale wasnêt having a cotillion after all. And you, you said you werenêt coming here, either."
Raj,I have a thick accent. You donêt know what I said.
Amy,Iêd like to know why Pennyês here.
Penny,"Iêm here to support my man, just like you."
Sheldon,What are you going to do? Take peopleês drink orders and get them wrong?
Leonard,Do it.
Sheldon,Did she do it yet?
Amy,She plans on flirting with members of the tenure committee to further Leonardês cause.
Sheldon,"Well, thatês a fine how-do-you-do. Donêt just stand there. Take your breasts out."
Howard,"Ooh, meerkat fight!"
Amy,"Youêre all wasting your time. Sheldon is the most qualified for the job, and no amount of gravity-defying bosomês going to change that. Seriously, is that tape? Like, how are they staying up like that?"
Leonard,Way to hit êem with both barrels.
Raj,"You two should be ashamed of yourselves. Using women to advance your cause with sexuality, and whatever Amy plans on doing."
Sheldon,Are you implying that my girlfriend has no sexuality to exploit?
Sheldon,"Okay, because that was not clear."
Sheldon,That was ambiguous.
Raj,"Well, now itês biguous. What are you gonna do about it?"
Howard,You could talk some smack about his mother.
Sheldon,"Well, yes, of course, he wouldnêt like that at all. Last night, I was feeling in need of sexual release when I happened to come across your mother."
Leonard,"Okay, okay. Guys, what are we doing here?"
Sheldon,"I donêt know what youêre doing, but I was about to insinuate that I had coitus with Rajês mother for a dollar."
Leonard,"Oh, you do what you want, but I donêt want to lose my friends over tenure. Friends are forever."
Howard,So is tenure.
Leonard,Iêm just gonna go home and let my work speak for itself.
Raj,Youêre right. This is beneath me. Lie your mother was last night.
Leonard,"How about it, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,What do you think I should do?
Amy,"Well, youêll always be an academic success, but I seriously question whether youêll make any more friends."
Sheldon,"I donêt want any more, but letês go."
Leonard,We cannot lose to that jerk.
Raj,"Yeah, screw it. Iêm going in."
Sheldon,"Wait. Hold on. I believe screw it, Iêm going in is what I said to your mother last night. Donêt worry, I didnêt really say that. I find the concept of coitus ridiculous and off-putting."
Amy,Should have taken my breasts out while I had the chance.
Sheldon, Mrs Davis? I know youêre in there. I saw your car in the parking lot.
Sheldon,"I just found out that you recommended myself, Dr. Hofstadter and Dr. Koothrappali to be on the short list for tenure."
Sheldon,"I donêt know what you mean by quirks, but, um, I do want to express my gratitude."
Sheldon,"No, no. No, I learned my lesson. I understand that was inappropriate."
Sheldon,"Anyway, thank you."
Sheldon,"Yeah, right on, sister."
Sheldon,"Oh, dear. Penny, have you been recording shows on our DVR again?"
Sheldon,Answer honestly. This is not a trial. Thatêll come later.
Penny,"Absolutely not. Help me out here, I canêt afford another demerit."
Leonard,"Yeah. Uh, maybe we were hacked. You know, the Chinese have been hacking everything lately."
Sheldon,Why would the Chinese make our DVR record Paul Blart: Mall Cop?
Leonard,I donêt know. Itês a fat guy on a Segway. Thatês funny everywhere.
Sheldon,Iêm deleting it.
Penny,"Well, hang on. Maybe the Chinese havenêt finished watching it yet."
Leonard,"You know, if youêre trying to make space on the DVR, why donêt you just get rid of some of the stuff youêve already watched? Like, um, Alphas."
Sheldon,"No, thatês the season two finale. That was quite the cliffhanger. Iêm going to re-watch it before season three starts."
Leonard,There is no season three. They cancelled that show.
Sheldon,"Well, they canêt cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger."
Leonard,They did.
Penny,"Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?"
Sheldon,Dumplings? Donêt you understand whatês going on here?
Penny,"As a rule, no."
Sheldon,"That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious. Oh, now Iêll never know what happened."
Penny,"Well, why donêt you make up your own ending?"
Sheldon,"Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, Iêll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, Iêll rub pudding on my gums. Iêm going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for."
Leonard,"Oh, please, donêt do that."
Sheldon,They canêt just cancel a show like Alphas. You know? They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.
Penny,I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.
Leonard,"Ah, donêt. If they didnêt want to be yelled at by crazy nerds, they shouldnêt have started a sci-fi channel."
Howard,"I think youêre gonna be really happy with this security camera. The optics are great, itês got infrared technology, and thereês even a backup battery when the power goes out."
Raj,"Whatever. I can see my little princess while Iêm at work, right?"
Howard,Why canêt you just watch porn like a regular guy? I need your laptop so I can configure the software.
Raj,"Wait, hold on. This is weird."
Raj,"I was Googling that girl Iêve been dating, and I found her blog."
Howard,Cool. Anything juicy?
Raj,"She said she recently went on a date with a guy named Roger? And heês Indian? And heês an astrophysicist, too?"
Howard,"You know whatês going on, donêt you?"
Raj,"Yes, Mummy was right. American girls are sexually voracious devils."
Howard,I canêt believe I have to explain this. People change names on blogs to protect their privacy. Roger is Raj.
Raj,"Oh. I always thought, if I had a white name, it would be Gavin."
Howard,Keep reading. What does it say?
Raj,"No, no, I donêt know if I should. If she wanted me to know about her blog, she wouldêve told me. Itês almost like Iêm reading her diary."
Howard,Itês exactly what itês like. Keep reading.
Raj,"No, this is creepy."
Howard,"Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when I put up that camera."
Raj,"Itês not creepy. Donêt listen to him. Oh, look whoês got the sweetest kisses."
Howard,Should I go?
Leonard,"With all the TV Sheldon was talking about, I had the greatest idea ever. It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called Brewbaccaês. You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is the perfect show for the two of us. Itês got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this. What do you say?"
Penny,Itês six thirty in the morning.
Leonard,I thought you grew up on a farm.
Sheldon,"Hello, SyFy Network? Yeah, this is your vice president of programming. Now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding Alphas. Yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately. Well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them itês me, and I donêt want to answer a lot of questions about if I really am who I say I am, you know? I just. I want this done. No, I am not the person who just called. That man was clearly a cowboy. Yeah, who was plumb concerned about yêall cancelling his favourite show. Why do they keep hanging up on me?"
Amy,"Iêm sorry youêre upset. You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this."
Sheldon,I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.
Amy,"Okay. Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure."
Sheldon,"Oh, thatês nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. I donêt care how they end."
Amy,"You know, I might be able to help you with this. Thereês a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less."
Sheldon,"Yeah, but I just told you, I donêt have a problem with closure."
Amy,You sure about that?
Sheldon,"Oh, quite sure.  That proves nothing."
Howard,Ready to go to lunch?
Raj,Do you think Iêm feminine?
Howard,Yeah. Letês go.
Raj,Thanks a lot.
Howard,Whatês going on?
Raj,"I broke down, and I read Lucyês blog, and in one of the entries she said, when we first met, I struck her as a little feminine."
Howard,Just a little? Thatês great.
Raj,I have to talk to her about this.
Howard,"Oh, geez, why do you girls always want to talk about things? Listen to me, if sheês writing about your relationship, use it to your advantage. Rig the game."
Raj,"Well, that doesnêt seem fair."
Howard,"Is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more than nervous weirdos?"
Raj,"No, itês not. Iêve always thought that was unfair."
Howard,So take whatês in that blog and use it to get her pants off.
Raj,Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldnêt you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?
Howard,The key to her heart. Thatês nice. Were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?
Raj,"I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women, Sir Elton John."
Leonard,"So, did you love it? Of course you loved it. How could you not love it? Tell me how much you loved it."
Penny,It was cute.
Leonard,"Oh, donêt say cute. Thatês the worst."
Penny,Whatês wrong with cute?
Leonard,It just makes things seem small. It diminishes them.
Penny,So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?
Leonard,"You can try, but nobodyês gonna believe you. I just, I donêt understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it."
Penny,I liked it. Iêm excited.
Leonard,"Well, then, tell your face."
Penny,What do you want from me?
Leonard,You know what? Never mind. We gave it a shot. Letês just see what else is on.
Penny,"Oh, come on, donêt be like that."
Penny,Iêm sorry I called it cute. Letês watch another one.
Penny,"Yeah, it was fun. Kind of reminded me of my high school. But instead of vampires, we had meth heads. But both came out at night and had messed up teeth."
Leonard,"All right, cool. I think youêll like the next one better. All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse."
Penny,"Oh. Well, thatês like my high school, too. But instead of a curse, it was crabs."
Amy,Iêve come up with a series of exercises to help with your compulsive need for closure.
Sheldon,I take issue with the word compulsive.
Amy,"All Iêm saying is, we live in a world where closure isnêt always an opÑ"
Sheldon,"Ñtion. Okay. For the sake of argument, letês say I have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?"
Amy,Iêm going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isnêt so overwhelming.
Sheldon,By playing tic-tac-toe?
Amy,Yep. Your turn.
Sheldon,"Oh, Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure. Especially since Iêm about to win.  B-But we didnêt finish."
Amy,Exactly. How does that make you feel?
Sheldon,The same way any normal person would. I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.
Amy,And thatês exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.
Sheldon,"Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off."
Amy,"Come on, you can do this."
Sheldon,You donêt know what itês like to feel completely frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.
Amy,"Yeah, sounds like a drag."
Penny,"Okay, help me out here. Why does he love this show so much?"
Bernadette,"Well, there was action, it was funny. I mean, you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl, but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?"
Penny,"Yippee, itês backwards. I get it."
Bernadette,Why does this bother you so much?
Penny,"I donêt know. Itês just, heês so passionate about so many different things. I just donêt get that way. Do you?"
Bernadette,"Well, sure. Iêm pretty passionate about science. I remember the first time I looked through a microscope and saw millions of tiny microorganisms. It was like a whole other universe. If I wanted to, I could wipe it out with my thumb like a god."
Penny,"See? I wish I had some of that fire in my life. I mean, I want to care about things and get excited like you guys."
Bernadette,"Well, thereês no reason you canêt."
Penny,You think?
Bernadette,Absolutely. All we need to do is spend a little time and find something youêre passionate about.
Penny,"Ugh, that sounds like a lot of work."
Howard,"Hey, whatês up?"
Raj,"Uh, Lucyês coming over. I need some advice."
Howard,"However long you think the foreplay should be, triple it."
Raj,Just tell me which one you think is more manly. This hockey jersey or this football jersey.
Howard,I donêt know. Go with hockey.
Raj,"Good, black is more slimming. Oh, thatês her. I got to go be butch. Toodles. Hey."
Raj,Come in.
Raj,"Yeah, well, I wouldnêt get too close. If I give the right command in German, sheêll rip your face off."
Amy,"Oêer the land of the free, and the home of theÑ Next."
Amy,"Thatês quite an impressive layout, isnêt it?"
Amy,Letês box it up.
Sheldon,Letês box it up.
Amy,"Thatês enough. Sheldon, Sheldon, give it!"
Amy,"Okay, Sheldon, make a wish and blow out the candles. Oops, missed one. Now your wish canêt come true."
Sheldon,"Lucky for you, êcause I wished you were dead."
Raj,Thanks. I love hockey.
Raj,"Not Brian Boitano, thatês for sure. Howês your burrito?"
Raj,Probably because I didnêt read the instructions. No wrapperês going to tell me what to do. Unless his name is Jay-Z.
Raj,What do you mean?
Raj,I donêt know. Maybe itês all those steroids Iêve been taking.
Raj,"Wait, wait. I, I found your blog here you wrote about me."
Raj,"No kidding. You didnêt make it easy to find. I spent hours digging around online. For the record, you have excellent credit scores. And your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to her new leg just fine."
Raj,"You called me feminine. And I, I wanted you to think I was more manly."
Raj,I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturising regimen.
Raj,Bought this at the Staples Center when I went to see Taylor Swift.
Penny,"So, I was thinking how excited you get about stuff like Buffy or science or which TV remote you and Sheldon should buy."
Leonard,"The Harmony One was fine. We didnêt need to upgrade to the eleven hundred, which he knows is too big for my hand."
Penny,"See, thatês the kind of passion I didnêt think I had. But then I realized Iêm passionate about you."
Leonard,"Oh, my cute little tushy strikes again."
Penny,"No, Iêm serious. Look, Iêve always had these plans. I was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life, and anything less than that just wasnêt worth getting excited about."
Leonard,Those things can still happen.
Penny,"Oh, obviously itês gonna happen. Yeah, a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so. Anyway, what I meant was, I shouldnêt wait, you know? Iêve got you, Iêve got Sheldon, all these wonderful friends. My life is exciting right now."
Leonard,Thatês a big deal.
Penny,"It is, isnêt it?"
Leonard,"So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?"
Penny,"Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke."
Sheldon,"Amy, I must say, I was sceptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening."
Amy,Iêm a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive.
Sheldon,"Well, youêre an excellent neuroscientist, youêre a wonderful girlfriend, andÑ"
Sheldon,"Doesnêt matter, does it?"
Amy,"Iêm proud of you, Sheldon. "
Sheldon,And a complete sucker.
Sheldon,"Oh, yeah."
Sheldon,There he is.
Sheldon,And the home of the brave.
Sheldon,"Donêt stop. Yes, keep going. Just like that."
Penny,"Sheldon, you big weirdo, I want you to know that I love that youêre in my life."
Sheldon,"I love you, too."
Sheldon,"Hello. Uh, is this the Bruce Miller who wrote the season finale of Alphas? Oh, smashing. Yeah, you already sound nicer than the last Bruce Miller who suggested I have sexual relations with myself. Now, down to business. Um, your show ended on a cliffhanger. Could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it? Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. I see. Well, that all stinks. No wonder you got cancelled. Bye."
Leonard,"The interface is pretty simple. You put your horizontal X coordinate here, vertical Y coordinate here. When youêre happy with those, you press this button."
Penny,Got it.
Sheldon,"Leonard, youêll never guess who I just found online. Hey!"
Leonard,Nice shot.
Penny,"Eh, his giant head did most of the work."
Sheldon,"Very mature. Youêre lucky Iêm out of silly string. As I was saying, Leonard, youêll never guess who I just found online. Professor Proton."
Leonard,Youêre kidding. Heês still alive?
Penny,Whoês Professor Proton?
Leonard,He was the host of this greatÑ Hey!
Penny,"Yes! Sorry, tell me about Professor Proton."
Sheldon,Professor Proton hosted my favourite science show when I was a child. I never missed an episode. He demonstrated scientific principles using everyday objects.
Leonard,It was pretty cool.
Penny,"Aw, so cute when you use the word cool wrong. Like when kids say pasghetti."
Sheldon,"Oh, dear lord, Leonard, look. Heês still available for parties and events. We should hire him."
Leonard,Hire him to do what?
Sheldon,"Well, whatever we want. Hang out, do experiments, make him take 12 pictures with us so we can make a calendar."
Leonard,"It would be pretty awesome to hang out with him. I just used awesome wrong, didnêt I?"
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm e-mailing him right now."
Leonard,Do you remember his old theme song?
Sheldon,Of course I do.
Raj,"Hey, I just found out I have to be at the telescope lab all weekend. Any chance you and Bernadette could take care of my dog?"
Howard,Why donêt you put her in a kennel?
Raj,Why donêt you put your mother in a home?
Howard,"To be honest, sheêd do better in the kennel. Iêll talk to Bernie. Iêm sure itês fine."
Raj,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Itês happening. Leonard, itês happening. Professor Proton is coming to our house."
Leonard,Youêre kidding.
Howard,You mean the guy who used to host that lame kids show?
Sheldon,And you just got yourself uninvited. See? I told you Iêd find a tactful way to do that.
Howard,Howêd you get him to come to your house?
Sheldon,"As Professor Proton always says, there is no problem you canêt solve if you use your noggin."
Leonard,And he wrote him a cheque.
Sheldon,"Yeah, that, too. Big cheque."
Raj,Uncle Howard. Cinnamonês here for her sleepover party.
Howard,"You know if you had a stroke, sheêd eat you, right?"
Raj,And it would be my pleasure to be her num-num.
Howard,"Okay, so what do I need to know to take care of her?"
Raj,"Itês very simple. For breakfast, she has an egg-white frittata. Feel free to give her a choice of home fries or an English muffin, but not both. Weêre watching our weight. Uh, for dinner, something simple, a veal chop, some scampi, whatever you like."
Howard,Classy dog.
Raj,"Yes. Also, donêt forget to close the toilet or sheêll drink out of it."
Howard,"I feel for ya. Iêve got a psychotic mommy, too."
Sheldon,"Leonard, are you in bed?"
Sheldon,"Me, too."
Sheldon,I canêt sleep.
Leonard,"Well, I can, so shut up."
Sheldon,"Do you realize that in less than nine hours, Arthur Jeffries, aka Professor Proton, will be in our apartment?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, you know that if you stay up all night, youêre gonna be sleepy tomorrow. And a sleepy Sheldon is a cranky Sheldon. And a cranky Sheldon is actually no different than a regular Sheldon. Good night."
Sheldon,Iêm thinking of wearing a tuxedo.
Leonard,Thatês not ridiculous. Good night.
Sheldon,Do you have cufflinks?
Sheldon,"Ah, just as well. Where can you rent a tuxedo at three oêclock in the morning?"
Leonard,"Okay, good night."
Sheldon,"Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, Professor Proton. Nice to meet you, ProfÑ Ow! Leonard?"
Sheldon,I still canêt sleep.
Howard,"She really tuckered herself out at the park, huh?"
Bernadette,"Yeah, you two were so cute playing together."
Howard,It was kind of fun throwing a ball and not having anyone laugh at me.
Bernadette,And you were sweet not to throw it too far so she didnêt wear out her tiny legs.
Howard,"Yeah, thatês what I was doing."
Bernadette,"You know, there were a few moments today when I almost felt like we were a little family."
Bernadette,"Yeah. I never thought of myself as a mom, but when the three of us were out there having fun, I felt like maybe someday we could do it."
Howard,"Of course we can. Especially if our babyês as calm and quiet as little CinnaÑ Son of a bitch, sheês gone."
Bernadette,Whereêd she go?
Howard,"I donêt know, she didnêt leave a note."
Bernadette,"Well, you were the one who was supposed to put her back in the stroller."
Howard,"No, I wasnêt. You were."
Bernadette,"No, I wasnêt."
Howard,"Yes, you were!."
Bernadette,"Yeah, well, you throw like a girl."
Sheldon,Iêm getting worried.
Penny,"Relax, Sheldon, heês only a few minutes late."
Sheldon,"Professor Proton was never late when he was on TV. You know, every day, four oêclock, he was there. Unless tornadoes were ripping apart East Texas, in which case weêd join him in progress.  Itês him. Hello. Well, I see. Yes. All right, we can come get you. Yeah, well, see you soon. Bye."
Leonard,Where is he?
Sheldon,The third floor landing. The poor old guyês been walking up the stairs for half an hour. Itês really you.
Leonard,"Mr. Jeffries, I am so sorry. We shouldêve told you about the broken elevator."
Sheldon,"Professor Proton, itês an honour to meet you."
Sheldon,"Leonard, you hear that? Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means weêre friends."
Sheldon,Look at me. I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying itês going to ruin my eyes.
Leonard,"Actually, heês a genius."
Sheldon,I am.
Leonard,"Mr. Jeffries, Iêm, Iêm Leonard. This is my girlfriend, Penny."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, there are no kids. No, the, the showês for me. Come on. Iêll race ya, Arthur."
Leonard,"Yes, sir."
Penny,"So, do you do a lot of appearances like this?"
Leonard,We just wanted to hang out with you and maybe learn a little about your life.
Leonard,"Thatês too bad. But still, working with kids, it must be rewarding."
Sheldon,"Yes. And if thereês time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing."
Sheldon,"Yeah, thatês great. Did you bring your puppet?"
Sheldon,"Oh, no. How could anybody hate Gino the Neutrino? Itês nice, huh? I got him for 20 bucks on eBay. Including the shipping!"
Bernadette,"You know, maybe she doesnêt recognize her name because of Rajês accent."
Howard,"Good thinking.  Cinnamon, come to Daddy."
Bernadette,"Cinnamon. Where are you, my little lamb chop?"
Howard,"When this all blows over, remember that voice. Itês kind of a turn-on."
Bernadette,It turns you on when I sound like Raj?
Penny,I think I know.
Sheldon,Itês gonna get sucked in. Itês going to get sucked in.
Penny,"Okay, I didnêt know."
Penny,"See, Iêm not a scientist like them."
Sheldon,Potato clock. Do potato clock.
Penny,Whatês that?
Penny,"Shut up. You can do that? I mean, wouldnêt that solve the worldês energy crisis?"
Sheldon,well whatês wrong? Is she upsetting you? Because I can make her go away.
Leonard,Then what is it?
Sheldon,"Well, how can you say that? Professor Protonês the best."
Sheldon,"Mr. Jeffries, I need to show you something. :14:11,446"
Penny,Iêm sorry to hear about your troubles.
Penny,"But if you donêt mind me asking, uh, the potato clock, how does it work? Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?"
Sheldon,"I wrote a fan letter to you when I was a child in Texas, and you sent this autographed picture back to me. Do you remember that?"
Sheldon,"Well, anyway, um, you may find this hard to believe, but I didnêt have any friends growing up."
Sheldon,"But, um, I did have you. And every day at four oêclock, youêd come to my house on Channel 68, and weêd do science together. If it hadnêt been for you, well, who knows what wouldêve become of me? You know? Instead of a world-class physicist, I couldêve wound up as a hobo. Or a surgeon."
Leonard,"I bet there are important discoveries being made every day because you inspired millions of kids to pursue science. In a way, their discoveries are your discoveries."
Sheldon,"Yeah, itês true. A generation of young scientists are standing on your shoulders."
Leonard,Itês important you know how much you mean to us.
Penny,"Arthur, are you okay?"
Leonard,"Iêll, Iêll call for help."
Penny,Any chance we could plug it into the potato?
Raj,"Hello? What do you mean, you found my dog? Sheês with my friends. Is she okay? Oh, thank you. Uh, just text me your address, Iêm on my way. Oh, and if sheês hungry, go ahead and feed her. But do not give her anything starchy. Sheês having risotto for dinner."
Leonard,You want one of us to go with you in the ambulance?
Sheldon,Iêll do it.
Sheldon,"Oh, yeah."
Penny,Weêll pack up your stuff and meet you at the hospital.
Leonard,Iêm sorry things turned out this way.
Sheldon,"Met my childhood hero, now I get to ride in an ambulance. Boy, if we can get him to do that calendar, thisêll be the best day ever."
Bernadette,Canêt believe we lost her. What was I thinking? Iêd be a terrible mom.
Howard,"Well, maybe with the first one. But kids are like pancakes. The first oneês always a throwaway. Howês this look?"
Bernadette,Itês fine. Whereêd you get that picture of her?
Howard,"Itês not her. I just googled foo-foo little dogs.  Itês Raj. Stay quiet. Hey, bad timing. Bernadette just took Cinnamon out for a walk."
Raj,Hmm. Interesting. Did they take a walk down Liarsê Lane?
Raj,"A lane frequented by liars. Like you, you big liar."
Howard,You have her?
Bernadette,"Oh, thank God sheês okay."
Raj,"Well, I trusted you, and you let me down. The poor thingês been shaking for hours."
Howard,Iêm really sorry.
Bernadette,"Hang on, youêve had her for hours?"
Raj,"Yes. I picked her up, and then we both went for massages to try and calm down. And then we got Pinkberry."
Bernadette,"So you knew she was okay, and you couldnêt pick up the phone to tell us?"
Raj,"Well, I, I thought aboutÑ"
Bernadette,"Donêt well me, mister. Weêve been worried sick. She could have been dead for all we knew. You should be ashamed of yourself."
Raj,"Sorry. I, I justÑ"
Bernadette,Sorryês not good enough. Maybe you need to take some time and think about what youêve done.
Howard,Nice guilt trip. You are gonna be an amazing mom.
Sheldon,"Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
Sheldon,Want me to sing it again?
Sheldon,"There anything I can get for you? Some apple juice? Uh, some Jell-O?"
Sheldon,Name it.
Sheldon,"Oh, youêre not. You look awful."
Sheldon,Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?
Sheldon,"Oh, my. What an honour. Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dine with the gods."
Sheldon,"But theyêll know Iêm not you. Should I call myself Professor Proton, Jr.?"
Sheldon,"So, in a way itês like Iêm your son."
Bernadette,"Burbank Airport, please."
Penny,"Vegas, here we come."
Bernadette,"No husbands, no boyfriends, no rules."
Amy,"No rules? Weêre not gonna get drunk and have a six-way with the Blue Man Group, are we?"
Amy,So there are some rules.
Bernadette,"Fine. No husbands, no boyfriends, some rules."
Amy,Thank you. Vegas!
Howard,"The ladies are away, the boys will play."
Raj,Anything can happen.
Leonard,Itês gonna get crazy.
Sheldon,Dungeons & Dragons.
Penny,"I got a brand-new bikini, so drinks at the pool are on these."
Bernadette,"I got a sexy new tube top that says come hither, and a can of pepper spray that says close enough, Jack."
Amy,I got some old underwear Iêm gonna throw on stage at the Garth Brooks concert.
Penny,"Iêm sorry, why old?"
Amy,"‚Cause last time I saw him, I threw new ones and it got me nothing."
Sheldon,"Iêve got a brand-new seven piece set of polyhedral dice. Hello, new dice smell."
Leonard,"Iêve got my helm of lordly might, my boots of speed, and if things get too exciting, my inhaler of asthma."
Raj,"I got my new bloodthirsty savage warrior who will lay waste to all who stand before him. And I had a sensible salad for lunch, so I can eat all the pizza I want."
Howard,"Come on, are we gonna sit around chatting like a bunch of teenage girls, or are we gonna play D&D like a bunch of teenage boys who are never gonna have sex with those teenage girls?"
Raj,Iêm actually glad Lucy had to work tonight. Saved me the awkward conversation about how I was gonna be hanging with my bros.
Howard,Isnêt every conversation you two have awkward?
Raj,"Painfully so. We have this rule on the phone that if no one talks for three minutes, you can just hang up. So into her."
Howard,Ready whenever you guys are.
Sheldon,"Yeah, yeah, weêll be right there. Leonard?"
Sheldon,Iêm not sure how I feel about Howard being dungeon master instead of you.
Leonard,"Oh, thatês nice. But relax, sometimes change is good. Uh, you were worried about Zachary Quinto being the new Spock, but you wound up liking him."
Sheldon,"Oh, please. Every time the topic of change comes up, you throw Zachary Quinto in my face. Iêm upset the mailman has a new haircut, Zachary Quinto. Iêm upset that daylight saving time started, Zachary Quinto. Iêm upset daylight saving time ended, Zachary Quinto. Iêm saying this for the last time, Zachary Quinto was a weird, wonderful, unrepeatable event. So stop using him against me."
Howard,"Okay, here we go. You find yourselves in an overgrown old forest. Before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it that looks a lot like Nicolas Cage. He says,  Travel with caution. These woods are home to the bones of many a fallen hero."
Leonard,"See, Howardês just as good a dungeon master as I am."
Sheldon,"As good? You just got pantsed in the schoolyard, four-eyes."
Raj,"Hey, come on, guys, focus. Um, uh, oh, mighty Nicolas Cage tree, we thank you for your warning, but we are brave warriors, and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal.  Oh, Lucyês free after all. See ya."
Leonard,"Hey, hey, hey, you canêt leave. We just started."
Raj,"Youêre right, I should finish the game. I take my plus-one long sword, stab myself in the face with it. Iêm dead, Iêve got a date with a girl. Bye."
Howard,"Weêll be fine, watch. Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from Koothrappaliês bloody corpse, and says,  Well, Iêm just a tree, but if I were you, Iêd listen to your ghost friend."
Sheldon,"Go on, give him your lunch money."
Raj,Iêm very happy you were able to hang out tonight.
Raj,"Not that itês up to you to make me happy. Uh, well, unless you find neediness sexy. In which case, youêre about to have dinner with the hottest man on the planet."
Raj,"I, uh, Iêm sorry to put you through that."
Raj,What else have you been thinking about doing?
Raj,I like your bangs.
Raj,What else?
Raj,"Mm, yeah. Those are both toughies."
Leonard,I push my shoulder against the secret door to see if it gives way.
Howard,"Uh, it does. "
Sheldon,"He does sound effects, too!"
Leonard,"Hey, I always did sound effects. A-A swarm of bloodthirsty bats fly through the dungeon. "
Sheldon,"Okay, well, I have a sound effect for those sound effects. "
Penny,Guess who?
Howard,What are you doing back?
Bernadette,Thatês an excellent question. Amy?
Amy,"Uh, well, when we were going through security, I got pulled out of line for a pat-down. The, uh, TSA agent got a little handsy. I may have broken her nose with my elbow."
Bernadette,"Long story short, sheês on the No Fly List and we might have been followed here by a drone."
Amy,Iêm sorry. I feel like such an idiot.
Penny,"Oh, itês not so bad. You lost money, youêre filled with shame and you got groped by a stranger. I mean, thatês Vegas, you nailed it."
Amy,You guys enjoy your evening. Iêm gonna go before I ruin anybody elseês weekend.
Sheldon,"Ah, thatês my girl."
Leonard,"No, no, no, Amy, wait. I know itês not the night you had in mind, but why donêt you guys stay and play with us? Itêll be fun."
Sheldon,"It would? Fun? Okay, three weeks ago you bought crunchy peanut butter, now you want the girls to play D&D? Do you have a drug problem?"
Leonard,"Whatês the big deal? Raj bailed, so we could use some extra players."
Sheldon,"Well, Iêve just never played Dungeons & Dragons with girls before."
Penny,"Oh, donêt worry, sweetie. No one has."
Leonard,"So, what do you say?"
Sheldon,Iêll leave it up to the dungeon master.
Howard,"A satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like Al Pacino rises from the forest floor and says,  Youêre playing D&D. Youêre playing D&D. This whole apartment is playing D&D."
Penny,"Okay, who wants a drink?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, we, now, Penny, we donêt consume alcohol during Dungeons & Dragons. It impairs our judgment."
Penny,"Oh, this isnêt alcohol. Itês a magic potion that makes me like you."
Leonard,"Double potion, please."
Howard,"Okay, here we go. You find yourselves face-to-face with two hulking ogres. What are you doing in our dungeon? You shall die!"
Sheldon,"Okay, literal goose bumps. Look."
Howard,What do you do?
Leonard,I draw my broadsword.
Sheldon,I ready my quarter-staff.
Penny,I drink my potion.
Bernadette,I say we attack the big one.
Penny,"You know what? Give me the dice, I want to roll."
Howard,The dungeon masterês supposed to roll.
Penny,"Yeah, well Iêm supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet. Now give it. All right, what do I need?"
Howard,"Uh, fifteen or higher."
Penny,"Fifteenês the point, the point is fifteen. Give the little lady some room, here it is, coming out. Sixteen! Yes! Oh, please tell me weêre playing for money."
Sheldon,"Oh, even better than money. You gained experience points."
Penny,"More potion, please."
Raj,How are your crab cakes?
Raj,Thatês great.
Raj,"No, no. Uh, youêve always wanted to send your food back in a restaurant, hereês your chance."
Raj,Donêt be ridiculous. Waiter?
Raj,Hold on. Isnêt there something else you wanted to tell him?
Raj,Donêt be silly. Just tell him.
Raj,"Uh, yeah, sorry. Sheês just a little shy. The first time we met, she was so nervous, she climbed out a bathroom window to get away from me."
Bernadette,"Come on, mama wants a pair of dead ogres."
Howard,"Seventeen, the larger ogre is dead. The-the other ogre says, you killed my brother, now Ogre Thanksgiving is ruined."
Sheldon,That is amazing. He made me care about the ogre.
Leonard,"All right, Amy, thereês one ogre left. Take him out."
Penny,Pretend heês that TSA agent. Come on.
Amy,"Nineteen. Yes, this is turning out to be even better than Vegas."
Penny,"No, itês not."
Raj,"You donêt know me very well, but each time you crawl out a bathroom window to escape my company, it chips away at my masculinity."
Raj,Why would you leave like that?
Raj,"Okay, if I upset you, then why didnêt you just say something?"
Raj,"Yeah, well, I like you a lot, and thatês scary for me. Mostly because youêre a proven flight risk."
Raj,"Well, uh, for one thing, you have bigger emotional problems than I do, and I find that very attractive in a woman. I, I donêt know. I just, I think youêre wonderful."
Howard,"The dragon falls from the sky, crashing into the volcano."
Howard,"But wait., heês not dead. He crawls out, spreads his wings and prepares to attack."
Sheldon,"Yeah, uh, wait. Doesnêt he say something first? You know, maybe in the voice of a beloved celebrity?"
Howard,"Fine.  Youêd think, after all these years, Iêd know not to fly over volcanoes. Iêm a freaking idiot."
Sheldon,The dragonês Christopher Walken. Thatês perfect.
Leonard,"All right, Amy, itês your turn. We need one more hit. Finish him off."
Amy,Here we go. Fifteen?
Howard,Itês a hit. The dragon collapses to the ground.
Sheldon,Wait. Wait. And says?
Howard,Mother? Is that you? Your little boy is coming home.
Sheldon,"Oh, I donêt know about you guys, but I have been through the emotional wringer tonight."
Bernadette,"This may be the potion talking, but you are one fine-ass dungeon master."
Howard,"Oh, yeah? Well, when we get home, Iêm gonna take you on a whole different adventure."
Sheldon,Another quest by Wolowitz? Count me in.
Amy,"Sheldon, theyêre talking about sex."
Sheldon,"Oh, then Iêm out."
Penny,"Ooh, I have an idea. Since itês not happening any time soon, why donêt your character and your character do it in the game?"
Bernadette,"Ooh! Come on, back me up here."
Bernadette,"Okay, I cast a love spell on Sheldon and Amy."
Leonard,"Ooh! Sorry, I thought you were gonna do that."
Howard,"The love spell takes effect. When Sheldon looks at Amy, she is the most beautiful half-orc heês ever seen, and heês overcome with a desire to rip her armour off and gaze fondly at her four hairy breasts. When Amy sees Sheldon, he looks, well, just like Sheldon, êcause apparently sheês into that. What do you do?"
Amy,I donêt like this.
Sheldon,You see what happens when you let girls play D&D?
Sheldon,Iêve never knocked on my own door before. That was a wild ride.
Amy,You donêt have to come in here and cheer me up.
Sheldon,Thank you. Would you go tell everyone else that? Because they sure think otherwise.
Amy,Iêll tell you what they think. They think our relationship is a joke.
Sheldon,"Well, I donêt think our relationship is a joke. I think _a horse goes into a bar, bartender says, why the long face?ê, thatês a joke. Itês a good one, too, because a horse has a long face."
Amy,"Sheldon, are we ever going to have an intimate relationship?"
Sheldon,"Oh, my. Thatês an uncomfortable topic. Amy, before I met you, I never had any interest in being intimate with anyone."
Amy,And now?
Sheldon,And now what?
Amy,Do you have any interest now?
Sheldon,I have not ruled it out.
Amy,Wow. Talk dirty to me.
Sheldon,"I know it doesnêt seem like it to you, but, for me, what we have is extremely intimate."
Amy,"I guess I know that. Itês just, part of me wants more."
Sheldon,"More? I mean, look at us. Itês only been three years, here we are in bed together."
Amy,Come on. Letês go back out there.
Sheldon,"Well, no. Hold on. My Elven magic-user and your half-orc warrior did have a love spell cast on them. We wouldnêt really be playing the game right if we didnêt see that through."
Sheldon,"I believe that, uh, we just killed a dragon. While the others pillage the corpse, I lead you to a secluded area where I attempt to remove your leather armour.  It comes off."
Sheldon,What do you do?
Amy,I kiss you on the lips.
Sheldon,I kiss you back on the  lips as well. Your turn.
Amy,I remove your armour. What do you do?
Sheldon,I erotically caress your  nose.
Amy,Keep rolling.
Leonard,"Hey, you guys have been in there for a while. You doing okay?"
Sheldon,"Weêre fine, thank you."
Penny,"Okay, we just want to say, we feel really bad aboutÑ"
Amy,Go away! Sheldon is nibbling on my  14! Yes!
Raj,"So, anyway, last night on video chat, I spent, like, twenty minutes just staring into Lucyês eyes."
Leonard,"Oh, that sounds romantic."
Raj,It was until I realized the screen had frozen. Still one of my top three dates of all time.
Leonard,"So, are we ever gonna hang out with this girl?"
Raj,"Iêd love that, but sheês not really comfortable around people."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable around people, but then I learned a trick. I pretend everyone I meet is a beloved character from Star Trek."
Leonard,Howês that been working for you?
Sheldon,"Oh, like a charm, unnamed crewman in a red shirt."
Howard,"Leonard, I may have gotten you a job."
Leonard,I have a job.
Sheldon,"Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim."
Howard,"No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawkingês team is sending an expedition to the North Sea to test hydrodynamic simulations of black holes. One of their experimental physicists dropped out, and I recommended you."
Leonard,"Well, do you really think I have a shot?"
Howard,"Yeah, Iêve worked with Hawking. I talked you up. He knows your research. I think this could happen."
Leonard,"He knows, wow."
Sheldon,"Well, now, but do you think thatês a good idea? Uh, you know Star Trek. Should a guy with no name and a red shirt really go on an expedition?"
Raj,"Hey, donêt discourage him. This is a fantastic opportunity."
Sheldon,"No one asked you, Uhura."
Sheldon,Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?
Leonard,What do you think?
Sheldon,Great. Iêve been doing some reading about vehicular safety. Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?
Leonard,Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.
Sheldon,"Well, thatês the thing about factoids, theyêre interesting."
Leonard,I know what youêre doing. You donêt want me going on this research trip because youêre afraid to be alone.
Sheldon,"Iêm not afraid to be alone. On land. On the sea, it would be terrifying. Because of all the drowning."
Sheldon,"Fine, no more drowning talk. Iêll change the subject. Oh. Who do you think would win in a fight, you or a shark?"
Leonard,"Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness. If I get the chance to do this, there is nothing you can say thatês going to stop me."
Sheldon,"Very well. Things between you and Penny have never been better. I hope four months apart doesnêt change anything. I should have opened with that, huh?"
Raj,"If you look carefully at Venus, you should be able to see the International Space Station pass by."
Raj,Yeah. He brought me back a T-shirt that said My Friend Went to the Space Station and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt
Raj,"Nope. Itês exactly as lousy as advertised. Speaking of friends, they have been asking to meet you. I was thinking maybe we could all hang out sometime?"
Raj,"Letês see. Six. Thatês pretty cool, I have six friends. Kind of like Sinatra."
Raj,"Okay, how about you just dip your toe in and meet one of them?"
Raj,Of course.
Penny,"So, then, during my afternoon shift, I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself."
Leonard,"Oh, thatês awful."
Penny,"Not really. My shirt was soaking wet. I got, like, the biggest tip of my life."
Leonard,"So, listen, do you remember when I said the similarities of the equations of general relativity and hydrodynamics suggest you could find the equivalent of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?"
Penny,I thought I said that to you.
Leonard,"Anyway, Stephen Hawkingês team is looking into that, and Iêve been invited to join them."
Penny,"Wow, Hawking. Good for you."
Leonard,"Well, it is. Just, you know, Iêd be gone for a while."
Penny,"Well, how long?"
Leonard,"Three, four months."
Penny,Whoa. When would you leave?
Leonard,Couple of weeks.
Penny,"Wow. Oh, okay, well, Iêll just come visit you."
Leonard,"Thatês the thing, you canêt. Iêll be on a ship in the North Sea."
Penny,On a ship? Arenêt they afraid Hawking will just roll overboard?
Leonard,"Uh, heês not gonna be there. Heês just sending a team to research his theory."
Penny,"Oh, sure. Like when you send me to kill spiders in your bathtub. Wow. Okay. Four months."
Leonard,"Yeah. And Iêm a little worried because things between us have been so great, and Iêd hate to do anything that screws that up."
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, if youêre gonna screw things up, itês gonna be while youêre here, not while youêre away. I mean, look, you have to go. It sounds like an amazing opportunity. And Iêm just basing that on how much I didnêt understand what you said about it."
Leonard,Okay. Iêll confirm the travel arrangements in the morning.
Penny,Okay. Good.
Leonard,I do have to ask you one favour.
Leonard,Sheldonês nervous about me leaving. Just keep an eye on him while Iêm gone.
Penny,"Oh, I donêt know. Remember what happened when I took care of your goldfish?"
Leonard,"Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet and get me a new one."
Leonard,"Really, you guys do not need to throw me a going-away party."
Howard,Are you kidding me? How often can you say bon voyage to somebody when theyêre actually going on a voyage?
Amy,"Hello, Rajesh."
Howard,"Hello, Amy. Nice to see you. What can I say? Itês funnier with the accent."
Leonard,"Thereês beer in the fridge. Anyway, you guys really donêt need to make a big deal."
Sheldon,"Leonard, youêre being selfish. We need to give you a proper send-off so weêll have closure when you die at sea and crabs eat your face."
Penny,"Sheldon, sweetie, shut up."
Bernadette,"You know, one of the things that helped me get through Howard being in space for so long was getting married before he left."
Penny,"Bernadette, sweetie, shut up."
Raj,Okay. I have a request to make.
Amy,And now he can talk. I want to cut open your brain and see what the heckês going on in there.
Raj,"The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phil. Anyway, I, I spoke to my new lady friend about meeting you all, and she thought it would be easier for her to start with just one."
Sheldon,"Oh, gee, I donêt know. My scheduleês a little busy."
Raj,"Actually, I was thinking Leonard."
Leonard,"Oh. Thank you, Raj. Iêd be honoured."
Howard,What the hell? I thought I was your best friend.
Raj,"You are, but youêve got kind of a big personality, with your flashy clothes and your Woody Allen swagger."
Penny,"You know, maybe sheêd be more comfortable meeting a girl first."
Raj,Good idea. Bernadette?
Penny,What the hell?
Raj,"Well, youêre very pretty. That could be intimidating to another woman."
Penny,"Oh, yeah."
Bernadette,"Hey, you donêt think Iêm pretty enough to scare your girlfriend?"
Howard,"Calm down, Bernie. Youêre very scary."
Amy,It should be me.
Raj,Why? So you can make jokes about cutting open my brain?
Amy,"A, that was not a joke, that was a sincere request. And B, more importantly, I was the outsider to this group, and I know how frightening that can be. But you guys took me in and made me feel loved, like I was family."
Sheldon,"Fine, Iêll do it."
Amy,"So, after I started dating Sheldon, I met Leonard, and then everybody else, and theyêve all been so wonderful to me."
Amy,"Maybe next week, we could all get together."
Raj,"Oh, Lucy, you donêt have to answer that. Donêt put her on the spot. She hates that. Am I right? Tell her how much you hate being put on the spot. Go ahead, tell her."
Amy,Ignore him. Heês a little nervous êcause he doesnêt think I understand the severity of your social anxiety.
Raj,What the? Are you crazy? You canêt talk about social anxiety to someone who has social anxiety. It makes them socially anxious!
Amy,"Excuse me, but Iêm a neurobiologist. I think Iêm a little more qualified than you to understand whatês not working in your girlfriendês brain!"
Raj,"Donêt call her my girlfriend. We havenêt discussed whether or not weêre girlfriend or boyfriend yet. Now that itês out there, are you my girlfriend? By the way, if you say no, Iêll never be happy again. Not to put you on the spot."
Raj,We might as well go ahead and eat. Sheês not coming back anytime soon.
Sheldon,"This is ridiculous, weêre shopping for a party and this store doesnêt even have a party section."
Penny,"Yeah, it does, and here we are."
Sheldon,"You know, I have to say, Penny, I donêt understand why you of all people are encouraging Leonard to do this."
Penny,"Well, Iêm his girlfriend, of course Iêm gonna support him."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, youêre his girlfriend for now. You know, maybe youêre not aware of this, but there is a rich tradition of men at sea finding comfort in each otherês arms and britches."
Penny,"Honey, this is a big deal for Leonard, okay? He gets to work with Stephen Hawking. Who, by the way, will not be on the boat. I checked it out."
Sheldon,"Itês not that big of an opportunity. And even if Hawkingês theories are correct, all they prove is where the universe came from, why everything exists and what its ultimate end will be. I mean, me? Iêm interested in the big questions."
Penny,"Oh, my God, Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard."
Sheldon,Iêm not jealous. Iêm just very unhappy that good things are happening for him and not happening for me.
Penny,"Look, sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel, okay? But just because good things are happening to Leonard doesnêt take anything away from you. You know what? Let me tell you a little story. Once there was a girl who worked at the Cheesecake Factory, and she wasnêt very good at her job."
Sheldon,It was you.
Penny,"It wasnêt me. But she was also an actress, and we were both up for the same part in a toothpaste commercial. She got it. Look, I was so jealous. But instead of ripping out her fake blonde hairÑ"
Sheldon,You ripped out your own fake blonde hair.
Penny,"I, looked her in the eye, smiled and said, Iêm happy for you. Because thatês what friends do."
Sheldon,They lie so they donêt look petty.
Penny,Like this. I am so happy for you.
Sheldon,Wow. No wonder you didnêt get that toothpaste commercial.
Raj,"I want to apologize for Amy last night. She was completely out of line. Are you, are you not speaking to me or did the screen freeze again?"
Raj,"Okay. I know. It was me. I, I pushed too hard. Iêm sorry."
Raj,"You know, I, Iêve been thinking that maybe meeting somebody one-on-one is too intense, so Friday night, my friends are having a party."
Raj,"A little one. Itês, itês a farewell for Leonard, so all the attention will be on him. If you wear something brown and sit on the couch, they wonêt even know youêre there."
Raj,"Oh, please?"
Raj,"Come on. Donêt make me beg. And Iêm from India, so I know how to do it."
Raj,"Yeah, thank you! This means a lot to me. My friends are like my family. Unless you donêt like them, in which case, theyêre dead to me."
Bernadette,"So, have you ever spent a long time on a boat before?"
Bernadette,Are you referring to the time we got stuck on the Small World ride at Disneyland?
Howard,"Iêm proud of you, Leonard. Working out on the North Sea for months, thatês really something."
Leonard,"I know. As far as science goes, this is the adventure of a lifetime."
Howard,Maybe your lifetime. I went to space.
Leonard,Itês not a competition.
Howard,"Youêre right, youêre right. Iêm really proud of you, and Iêm gonna miss you when youêre gone. And space beats water."
Amy,"Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming."
Raj,"She is. Sheês just running a little late. You know how it is, girls always fussing about their hair, their makeup. Sheêll be here. Just give it a rest, okay?"
Sheldon,"Um, can I have your attention, everyone?  Thatês, uh, B-flat, for those who donêt have perfect pitch. I would like to propose a toast to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity, and I couldnêt be happier for him."
Leonard,"Thank you, Sheldon. That mustêve been very hard for you to say."
Sheldon,"Well, I mean it. Iêm really happy for you. And thatês how you get a toothpaste commercial. Cheers."
Howard,It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leonard.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Howard,It mustêve killed you when I went to space.
Raj,"Oh, no."
Howard,"Buddy, you okay? Oh, man."
Bernadette,Whatês going on?
Raj,"Uh, go ahead. Read it."
Howard,"Raj, I canêt come to the party. This is all just too much for me. I donêt think we should see each other any more. Sorry. Lucy."
Raj,Excuse me.
Penny,"Raj, Iêm so sorry."
Amy,"Me, too."
Sheldon,It did not kill me when you went to space. Monkeys went to space.
Penny,"Well, here we are."
Leonard,Yep. Iêm really gonna miss you.
Penny,"Iêm gonna miss you, too."
Sheldon,"Penny, weêre in the red zone. The white zone is for loading and unloading. Weêre breaking the law."
Penny,"Okay, thereês no space in the white zone, soÑ"
Leonard,"Anyway, we can e-mail, and I think the phone connections are pretty good."
Sheldon,"All right, you have to get out of the car right now. Iêm not going to jail for you."
Leonard,Would you just relax?
Sheldon,"Oh, I see a space in the white zone. Quick, circle the airport."
Penny,Did you bring enough inhalers?
Penny,"And, uh, extra Dramamine? You remember what happened on Itês a Small World."
Leonard,Iêm covered.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord, a police officerês glancing in our direction. Weêve been made."
Leonard,Calm down. Iêm getting out. I have something I want to give you.
Penny,"Oh, Leonard."
Sheldon,"Itês just a heart-shaped locket with a picture of Leonardês face in it. He got it at the mall on clearance. Now move, move, move."
Penny,I love you.
Leonard,"I love you, too."
Sheldon,"Donêt worry, Officer. They just love each other. Weêre not smuggling drugs."
Penny,"Raj, itês Penny. Are you in there?"
Raj,Hang on.
Penny,Hey. Iêm just coming back from the airport. I wanted to see how youêre doing.
Raj,"Thatês, thatês very nice of you. Uh, come, come. Come on in."
Penny,"Canêt stay long. I left Sheldon in the car with the window cracked open. Heês gonna go through that activity book in, like, 30 seconds, soÑ Are you okay?"
Penny,Oh. Iêm so sorry.
Raj,"Itês my fault. You know, I finally found someone who was right for me, and I, I drove her away."
Penny,"Oh, Raj."
Raj,"Penny, I, I miss her already."
Penny,"I know how you feel. I miss Leonard, too."
Raj,"Whatês like, what is wrong with me? Why, why canêt I ever have love?"
Penny,You will.
Raj,"No, I, I wonêt. Iêm, Iêm unlovable."
Penny,Thatês just the booze talking.
Raj,"No, itês not. I havenêt had a drink since last night."
Penny,Youêre talking to me.
Raj,I am. And now Iêm crying for a whole different reason!
Penny,"Oh, me, too."
Raj,So I guess what Iêm saying is I get where Lucyês coming from.
Penny,Thatês great. Do you want some wine?
Raj,"Uh, no, waterês fine. Anyhow, Iêve been thinking about it a lot and, and I totally see why Lucy did what she did. I pushed too hard. But you know what? If I back off and give her enough space, maybe thereês still a future for us. Yeah, the funny thing about life is that, you know, sometimesÑ"
Amy,Does he ever shut up?
Raj,"Ñ but then it turns good again, and that means itês better than if it had never been bad for a while. I know that now, thingês arenêt good, they are in fact very very bad but at least my heart is starting to heal. Slowly but surely. And oh how I cried. It was like a little, uh, thunderstorm on my face. But Iêm a man, okay? So I need to pull myself together, pick up a pen and get it all out in my journal. I mean, itês not all bad, right? Having my heart broken has allowed me to finally speak in front of you, so, you know, a silver liningÑ."
Leonard,"Sheldon, itês not a great time, what do you want?"
Sheldon,"Hello to you, too. Iêm sorry, but this is important."
Leonard,What is it?
Sheldon,"Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case, and Back to the Future III was, get this, in the Back to the Future II case."
Sheldon,"So, did you do that, or am I in the house with an intruder?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, I got to go inside. Itês getting rough out here."
Sheldon,"Youêre dodging the question, I knew it was you. What was that?"
Leonard,What was what?
Sheldon,"This isnêt a very good connection, but it sounded like someone just released a kraken."
Leonard,"Okay, Iêm hanging up now. You know thereês no such thing as a kÑ "
Sheldon, Penny. 
Penny,Whatês the matter?
Sheldon,"Um, well, I was worried that you might be missing Leonard. And that might be causing you to have bad dreams, like the kind youêd get if you watched Clash of the Titans right before you went to bed."
Penny,"Sweetie, did you have a bad dream?"
Sheldon,"To be honest, I did."
Sheldon,Back to the Future II was in the Back to the Future III case. Leonard did it.
Penny,Good night.
Sheldon,"No, wait. Perhaps I should sleep here so you donêt miss Leonard as much, uh, êcause youêre being kind of a baby about it."
Penny,You know what? That would make me feel better. Thank you.
Sheldon,Youêre welcome. Good night.
Raj,"I think youêd be pleased to hear that this morning in the parking garage I saw this oil stain on the ground that was shaped just like my ex-girlfriend, Lucy, and I didnêt get upset at all."
Howard,Iêm proud of you.
Raj,"Well, you should be, êcause she was looking good."
Sheldon,"Dear Lord, youêre an astronomer. Although you may have earthly woes, get your mind back on the stars. Gee, even the lowly dung beetle chooses to plot its course by using the Milky Way."
Raj,Is that true?
Sheldon,"Everything I say is true. Now, of course, the dung beetle also enjoys eating faeces, living in faeces and making little balls out of faeces, so, you know, pick and choose which aspects of its lifestyle you want to embrace."
Howard,"Come on, you can talk to girls now. It shouldnêt be hard for you to meet someone new."
Raj,"How can I meet someone new when everywhere I look, I see Lucyês face? Tell me you donêt see her smile in the crust of this chicken pot pie."
Howard,"Oh, will you stop it. Now, listen to me, thereês a welcome party for incoming post-docs tonight. Go to it and meet someone who isnêt made of grease or pie."
Raj,You think youêre so cool because your wife is a person?
Howard,"Look, Bernieês at a neuroscience conference with Amy, Iêll go with you."
Raj,You would do that for me?
Howard,Of course. Youêre my friend. I want you to be happy.
Raj,"Thanks. Oh, Sheldon, since Amyês out of town, would you like to join us?"
Sheldon,"I want you to be happy, too, but not enough to do anything about it."
Bernadette,"Howie, stop. I canêt talk like that. Amyês right here."
Amy,"Sheldon, stop. For the last time, I will not bring home bed bugs. "
Bernadette,"The hotelês nice. Thereês a pool, a gym, the bar looks like fun. "
Amy,"Because I looked in the bed, and there are no bugs."
Bernadette,"Aw, I love you, too. If I donêt talk to you before you go to sleep, Iêll meet you in dreamland."
Amy,"Good night. No, I will not consider sleeping in my garment bag."
Sheldon,"Penny, did you ever wonder how Starfleet captainsÑ"
Sheldon,"Well, now that Iêve piqued your interest, welcome to the exciting world of 3D chess."
Penny,Why donêt you just admit you only want to play this game because you always play it with Leonard and you miss him?
Sheldon,You overestimate his significance in my life.
Sheldon,Do I miss how he makes a face on my toaster waffle with syrup? Do I miss the way he fixes the zipper on my jacket when it gets stuck? I donêt think so. Do I miss how we say good night to each other through the walls of our bedroom using Morse code? 
Penny,"Okay, I get it, I get it. You are an emotionless robot."
Sheldon,"Well, I try."
Penny,"All right, letês just get this stupid game over with."
Sheldon,Great. Iêll go first.
Sheldon,"By the way, how are you with zippers?"
Sheldon,"Well, I really need to go to the bathroom, and this oneês gone all cattywampus."
Raj,"Wow, your work on jellyfish neural nets sounds so interesting. "
Raj,I will. You can download my paper on the Van Allen Belts from the university server as well.
Raj,All right.
Howard,Howêd it go?
Raj,"Well, if you like dry, factual statements interspersed with painful moments of silence, it was bananas."
Howard,Check it out. Mrs. Davis from Human Resources is here. Sheês probably on the lookout for sexual harassment.
Raj,"Oh, great. There go my chances of being sexually harassed."
Howard,"I heard her husband left her for a hot, young undergrad."
Raj,"Thatês so much better than the old, ugly ones."
Howard,"Mrs. Davis, nice to see you. "
Raj,"You know, I recently read a fascinating article on infidelity among penguins."
Raj,"So if the fact that your husband left you makes you feel unattractive, just remember, penguins get cheated on, and theyêre adorable."
Howard,It was better when you couldnêt talk to women.
Bernadette,I was thinking of going to the lecture on posterior cingulate cortex lesions in the formation of autobiographical memory.
Amy,"Oh, brain lesions are fascinating. Unless theyêre yours, then theyêre a drag."
Bernadette,To the advancement of science.
Amy,And to the sick and dying who make it possible.
Bernadette,"This is fun, we never really get to talk shop with Penny around. We usually just end up talking about boys."
Amy,"Which is fine, but itês nice to mix it up with a little intellectual conversation."
Amy,"Oh, my gosh, boys bought us drinks, boys bought us drinks. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much."
Bernadette,Be cool.
Amy,"You be cool. Guys are hitting on us, and not just to get to Penny."
Bernadette,Youêre right. Thank you.
Sheldon,Ooh. Bad move.
Penny,Really? Why?
Sheldon,My queen can now take your rook from below.
Penny,"So that means I lose, right? Itês over?"
Sheldon,"If I make this move, but I wonêt because weêre having too much fun."
Penny,"Okay, letês take a break. "
Sheldon,Weêre all out of alcohol.
Penny,"I wasnêt going to get alcohol. Gosh, I wonder what Leonardês doing right now. I miss him so much."
Sheldon,"Well, if youêd like, we could call him. I mean that you could call him. As Iêve explained, the absence of my friends does not cause me pain. As rock and roll bad boy Paul Simon once said, I am a rock, I am an i-i-i-island."
Penny,Iêm calling him.
Sheldon,"Oh, goodie, put him on speaker phone."
Leonard,"Excuse me, ladies, my pants are buzzing. North Sea, how can I kelp you?"
Leonard,"Penny? Hey, itês Penny. Everybody say hi to Penny."
Penny,"Wow, it sounds like youêre having a good time."
Leonard,Best time of my life. 
Sheldon,Isnêt it five thirty in the morning there?
Leonard,"Is it? Hey, everybody, itês five thirty in the morning!"
Penny,"Uh, okay, well, we were just calling you because we were missing you."
Leonard,"Uh-oh, hang on."
Sheldon,Are you in danger?
Leonard,"No, itês a drinking game. Whenever we see an iceberg, we take a shot!"
Penny,"Leonard, Leonard? I cannot believe we were missing that jerk."
Sheldon,You were.
Amy,So what happened? Howêd it go?
Bernadette,Itês fine. I thanked them again and let them know weêre not available.
Amy,So I can drink this without having to give up the goodies?
Bernadette,"Yes, itês all cool. Although, if you wanted to talk to one of them, no one would blame you."
Amy,And why would no one blame me?
Bernadette,I donêt know what Iêm saying.
Amy,"Well, it sounds like youêre saying that I could do better than Sheldon."
Bernadette,"Boy, these drinks are strong. Hoo, mama, Iêm gonna be hugginê the toilet tonight."
Amy,"No, tell me, I want to know what you meant by that."
Bernadette,"I just meant that youêre not married and your boyfriendês kind of, Sheldon."
Amy,And your husband is extremely Howard. Whatês your point?
Bernadette,Sorry. I have no point. That was a stupid thing to say. Can we please just go back to having a nice time?
Amy,"We could, but unfortunately my brain is lesion-free and I remember that rotten thing you just said about my sweet baboo."
Bernadette,Come on. I apologize. Can we please just let it go?
Amy,Your husbandês weird and his clothes are ridiculous.
Penny,I canêt believe it. All this time Iêve been doing nothing but sit around and miss that guy. And you know what the worst part is?
Sheldon,That youêre having to process your emotional pain without vodka?
Penny,Yeah. But you know what the second-worst part is? He does not miss me at all.
Sheldon,Allow me to comfort you. At least youêve got your health.
Penny,"Really? That, thatês it? Thatês comforting?"
Sheldon,"Um, uh, in a hundred years, youêll both be dead and it wonêt matter?"
Penny,"Come on, youêre supposed to say, of course he misses you, the only reason heês partying is to cover up his pain."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, I donêt think thatês true at all."
Penny,This is ridiculous. Why am I upset just because heês off having a good time?
Sheldon,"Well, perhaps youêre obsessively picturing him engaged in drunken coitus with another woman. Is that it? Did I get it right?"
Penny,"Okay, that, thatês great. You can stop trying to make me feel better now."
Sheldon,"Actually, I canêt. Before Leonard left, he made me promise that Iêd take care of you."
Penny,He did?
Penny,"Oh, thatês really sweet."
Sheldon,"Plus, if I do a good job, he said heêd bring me back a sailorês cap."
Penny,"Well, now I miss him even more."
Sheldon,"Well, if itês any consolation, Iêm sure Leonardês tormented every moment heês away from your warm embrace and cherry lips."
Sheldon,"Oh, seriously?"
Raj,"Uh, excuse me, Mrs. Davis?"
Raj,"Iêd like to apologize for being insensitive. And for possibly making penguins seem like jerks, because 99% of them are stand-up guys."
Raj,"You know, you, you and I, you and I have a lot in common."
Raj,"Oh, yes, I, I too am in the throes of heartbreak. Okay, fine, Iêll tell you about it."
Sheldon,Here is a hot beverage to comfort you. Itês in a to-go cup. Make of that what you will.
Penny,Come on. Itês still early. Letês do something.
Sheldon,"Well, I have been toying around with an idea for 4D chess."
Penny,How about we just talk?
Sheldon,All right. In 4D chessÑ
Penny,"Come on, letês talk about our lives. Tell me something about you I donêt know."
Sheldon,I own nine pairs of pants.
Penny,"Okay, that, thatês a good start, but I was thinking maybe something a little more personal."
Sheldon,I see. I own nine pairs of underpants.
Penny,How about I go first?
Sheldon,"But I donêt want to know how many underpants you own. Although, based on the floor of your bedroom, Iêd say itês a thousand."
Penny,"Okay, look, hereês something people do not know about me. When I first moved out to L.A., I did a topless scene in a low-budget horror movie about a killer gorilla. Ugh! After I did it, I felt so ashamed. Thankfully, that thing never came out."
Sheldon,Iêve seen that. Yeah. Serial Apeist. Howard found it online the day we met you.
Penny,"Oh, God."
Sheldon,"And it was literally the moment you walked out the door. But I see the type of personal revelations youêre going for. Okay, hereês one I thought Iêd take to the grave."
Sheldon,"Hmm. A while back, YouTube changed its user interface from a star-based rating system to a thumbs-up rating system. I tell people Iêm okay with it, but Iêm really not."
Penny,Thatês your big revelation?
Sheldon,"Yes. Whew, I feel ten pounds lighter."
Penny,"Okay, you know what? I give up. Iêm going to bed."
Sheldon,Hereês something else you donêt know about me. You just hurt my feelings.
Penny,What did I do?
Sheldon,"I opened up and shared something deeply upsetting to me, and you treated it as if it were nothing."
Penny,"I, I didnêt think it was a big deal."
Sheldon,It is to me; thatês the point.
Penny,"Sheldon, you are right. Iêm really sorry. I shouldêve known better."
Sheldon,Your apology is accepted.
Penny,Thank you. How about a hug?
Sheldon,How about a hearty handshake?
Penny,Come on.
Sheldon,Now I know how you felt getting mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.
Bernadette,Good night.
Amy,Mm-hmm. It was rather flattering to have strangers send us drinks.
Bernadette,"Yeah, that felt nice."
Amy,Maybe tomorrow morning we put on some hot pants and see if we can score us some free omelettes.
Bernadette,"So, hypothetically, if, if we were to have gone with them, which one would you have picked?"
Amy,I think I would have gone with the short one with the goofy haircut.
Bernadette,"Oh, good, êcause I liked the tall thin one. He seemed intelligent, kind of a loner, maybe a little sexually inexperienced, like Iêd have to teach him a thing or two."
Amy,"Not my guy. I caught him staring at my rack. Itêd be nice to be with a man who wants to know whatês underneath my cardigan. FYI, itês another cardigan."
Bernadette,Your short sexed-up guy kind of sounds like Howard.
Amy,Your brainy virgin kind of sounds like Sheldon.
Raj,"Yeah, I can relate to being a single parent. I have a dog."
Raj,"Mrs. Davis, I, uh, I must confess, I came here tonight in a futile attempt to pick up some lonely postdoc, but instead I got to connect with you at a human level. Thatês a much better evening. Youêre a lovely person."
Raj,"No, no, no, that would be crazy. I mean, if I were hitting on you, youêd know it êcause youêd feel uncomfortable and a little sad for me."
Raj,Good night.
Howard,Looks like she accepted your apology.
Raj,And then some. I think we had a moment.
Howard,"Oh, please, you did not have a moment."
Raj,Who died and made you king of moments?
Howard,"Okay, fine. Letês say there was a moment."
Raj,There was.
Howard,"There wasnêt. But, but even if there was, what are you gonna do about it?"
Raj,"I will slowly seduce her until she falls helpless into my bed, hungry for the pleasure only I can give her."
Howard,So nothing.
Raj,"No, not a thing."
Penny,"Ah, Iêm so glad the police finally caught that psychotic genetically engineered ape."
Leonard,That is my girlfriend. I swear to God.
Sheldon,And hereês another interesting weather fact.
Penny,Another? Great.
Sheldon,"Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer."
Penny,"Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere."
Sheldon,"Joke if you must, but youêre going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store."
Penny,"You know, I will miss this."
Sheldon,"Iêll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, weêll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck, you can even push the cart. Please donêt take my looking forward to Leonardês return as criticism of the job youêve been doing in his absence."
Penny,I wonêt.
Sheldon,That criticism will come later in your report card.
Penny,"Yeah, I didnêt stay for the detention, Iêm not gonna read the report card."
Penny,Leonard! Hi!
Leonard,Keep your voice down.
Penny,"Oh, my God. You werenêt supposed to be here till Sunday."
Leonard,"We finished the experiment early, so I thought Iêd come home and surprise you."
Penny,"Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?"
Leonard,"I didnêt tell Sheldon, so we could have a few days alone."
Penny,"Oh, that is so romantic."
Leonard,"Uh, sure, thatês why I did it."
Penny,"Oh, I just cannot believe youêre here."
Sheldon,"Penny, itês your lucky day. Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. Grab your keys."
Sheldon,"Uh, Stuart, I was wondering if you could help me find something."
Sheldon,"Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. Anyhoo, Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him. As heês been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate."
Sheldon,"Aquaman? Oh, this isnêt a gag gift, Stuart."
Sheldon,Iêm a real collector. How rare is it?
Sheldon,Donêt try and trick me into buying something I donêt want. Now letês talk Aquaman. 
Howard,"What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopusês mind in Spider-Manês body?"
Raj,"Well, Iêve been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions, original and Lohan."
Howard,Both versions: original and Lohan. Youêre an idiot.
Raj,"Hey, whatês your problem?"
Howard,"Iêm sorry, Iêve been kind of snippy lately. Itês probably this stupid diet Iêm on."
Raj,Why are you on a diet?
Howard,Iêve put on a couple pounds. Had to buy these pants in the menês section.
Raj,"Well, weêve all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost."
Sheldon,Twelve hundred dollars. Thatês my final offer.
Sheldon,"Oh, right, a present for Leonard. You better throw in that squirt gun."
Leonard,And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat.
Leonard,"And, oh, thatês me getting rescued after I fell in."
Penny,"Oh.  Oh, thatês the pizza."
Leonard,Yep. Hereês some money.
Penny,Thank you.
Leonard,And Iêm gonna hit the head. Thatês what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.
Penny,"Okay, hereês, uh, twenty-five. Keep the change."
Penny,"Oh. Okay. Well, hereês, um, thirty something cents and a promise I wonêt call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana."
Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, I see youêve ordered pizza. I have Chinese food. "
Penny,Thatês nice.
Sheldon,"Oh, thatês a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns."
Penny,"Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, soÑ"
Sheldon,"Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles, we could play Marco Polo. I mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer, not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport."
Penny,"Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks.  Have a good night!"
Sheldon,"now, do you have company?"
Penny,"No, no, no. You know what? The toiletês been doing that. I called the building manager, soÑ"
Sheldon,"Oh, I can take a look at it."
Sheldon,"Iêm quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag, but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet."
Penny,"Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, itês okay. You donêt have to go into the bathroom."
Sheldon,"Thatês curious. If thereês no one here, why are there two glasses of wine on the table?"
Penny,"Oh. Well, you know, I, Iêve got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem."
Sheldon,Of course. Ask a silly question. 
Penny,Oh. 
Sheldon,Thatês odd.
Penny,"Um, what?"
Sheldon,There are takeout containers in the trash can.
Penny,So? Thatês my dinner from last night.
Sheldon,Whatês odd is theyêre in the trash can.
Penny,"Okay. Look, honey, I promise thereês no oneês here. I‚ve had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself."
Sheldon,"Oh, very well. Iêm no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. Oh!"
Sheldon,Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?
Sheldon,"Oh, great. Do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun?"
Bernadette,"Hi, honey."
Bernadette,I made some brownies. You want one?
Howard,"Youêre kidding, right? I mean, you know Iêm trying to lose weight. God, I thought we were partners in this marriage."
Bernadette,"We are. Stop it. And for the last time, youêre not fat."
Howard,"Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale, êcause one of you is lying."
Bernadette,"Fine, forget I asked. How was dinner at your momês?"
Howard,Awful. I had to rub her ointment all over her again.
Bernadette,Why canêt she do it?
Howard,"‚Cause weêve got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didnêt take into account the square footage of her back."
Bernadette,Let me see. How long have you been putting this on her?
Howard,I donêt know. Few weeks. Why?
Bernadette,This is really strong oestrogen cream. Please tell me youêve been wearing gloves.
Howard,Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.
Bernadette,"Howie, the oestrogenês getting absorbed by your skin. Thatês why youêve been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass. "
Howard,Youêre full of oestrogen and you donêt act like that.
Bernadette,Thatês êcause Iêm a woman. Iêve had years of practice riding the dragon.
Howard,Fine. Iêll wear gloves next time.
Bernadette,Itês still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system.
Howard,I feel so stupid. And fat.
Bernadette,"Itês okay. You still look great to me. In fact, why donêt we go in the bedroom and Iêll prove it to you?"
Howard,"Sex? Really? I mean, thatês just your solution to everything. "
Amy,"Oh, and hereês a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. Janko is spelled with a silent ptang. Sheldon, youêre not even listening to the rules of my made-up language."
Sheldon,"Yes, I am."
Amy,Then what does tweepadock mean?
Sheldon,"Uh, elephant?"
Amy,Lucky guess.
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. Iêm just distracted by something that happened over at Pennyês.
Amy,What happened?
Sheldon,I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.
Sheldon,"She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonardês lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions."
Amy,I donêt think Penny would cheat on Leonard.
Sheldon,"Oh, really? She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. Itês a small leap from there to sexual infidelity."
Amy,Youêre being ridiculous.
Sheldon,"Amy, there were Chinese food containers in the trash can."
Amy,Poor Leonard.
Amy,Do you hear anything?
Sheldon,I hear a womanês voice.
Amy,Is it Penny?
Sheldon,"No, itês you. All right, I hear whispering and giggling. Now I think I hear kissing."
Amy,"Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like."
Sheldon,"Thereês kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants."
Amy,Let me listen. Sounds like Leonard.
Sheldon,"Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah, thatês it. Iêm catching her in the act. "
Amy,"No, Sheldon, donêt."
Sheldon,Aha. 
Penny,What the hell?
Penny,"Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that. "
Sheldon,Right.  Penny. Are you going to answer the door or should I open it and say aha again?
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, Sheldon. I shouldêve told you I was back. I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you."
Leonard,That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.
Sheldon,"Oh, no, no, letês not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying."
Penny,"No, he doesnêt."
Leonard,I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.
Sheldon,"Well, Leonard, I think itês high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room."
Leonard,The what?
Amy,Please leave me out of this.
Sheldon,"Fine. Leonard, thereês no need for you to pretend to like me anymore."
Leonard,"Come on, I said I was sorry."
Sheldon,"No, no, you save your apologies for after youêve had disappointing coitus with Penny."
Penny,It was fine.
Leonard,"Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? Itês that sailor cap that you wanted. Itês neat, huh?"
Sheldon,You honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?
Leonard,"I donêt. I really donêt. Just try it on. Oh, yeah."
Amy,"Hello, sailor."
Penny,"Ooh, now weêre talking."
Sheldon,"Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume Iêm wearing this year. Amy, youêre going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts."
Howard,Thanks for coming over.
Raj,"No problem. Ooh, you made little sandwiches."
Howard,"Yeah, thatês cucumber and cream cheese. Thatês turkey and loganberry. And donêt tell my hips, but Iêm warming up a brie in the oven."
Raj,"Nice. So, mmm. Whatês up?"
Howard,"Okay, well, Iêve been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen, and, I need you to be honest with me. Do my boobs look bigger to you?"
Raj,"Well, itês kind of hard to tell. "
Howard,"Come on, Raj, itês a yes or no question."
Raj,"Iêm not sure. Um, wait. Jump up and down, letês see if they jiggle. Uh, no, I, I still canêt tell, uh, oh, you know what? Okay, uh, give me some of this."
Raj,Do you want my help or not?
Raj,"Okay, yup. See, see, that, that looks like, that looks like they could be bigger. But you know, I bet, I bet when I do it, mine do the same thing."
Howard,"Yeah, they kind of do."
Raj,"Hmm. Uh, let me see something. "
Howard,"Hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive."
Raj,"Oh. Sorry, sorry, uh, okay.  I mean, yeah, maybe."
Howard,"Okay, let me feel. No, I am definitely up a cup size. "
Raj,"You know, but, but theyêre very firm, so youêve got that going for you."
Howard,You think?
Raj,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky."
Howard,"Thank you. I really needed to hear that today.  Ooh, brieês ready."
Leonard,Good morning.
Leonard,So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?
Sheldon,Iêd like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.
Leonard,Where do you think I would take you?
Sheldon,"Who knows? Uh, you said youêd be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. You say youêre taking me to work, but for all I know, Iêll end up in a deserted amusement park. Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me."
Leonard,Iêm going to work. You can come if you want.
Sheldon,"Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt."
Leonard,"No, I donêt."
Sheldon,"Hurts, doesnêt it? You know, I find myself wondering if anything youêve ever told me is true."
Leonard,"I didnêt make it back. The ship sank, Iêm in hell."
Sheldon,"You say youêre from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?"
Leonard,Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they werenêt?
Sheldon,"All right, Iêll give you that one."
Leonard,"Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?"
Sheldon,I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.
Leonard,Fine. What I did was wrong.
Sheldon,I wish I could believe you.
Leonard,"You know what? Iêm not driving you to work, because youêre incredibly annoying."
Sheldon,"You say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight."
Leonard,Stop it.
Sheldon,Keep it up?
Sheldon,Hello. So I guess youêre really holding up the other four fingers?
Penny,"Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?"
Amy,Driving Sheldon to work.
Penny,"Heês still mad at Leonard, huh?"
Amy,"Well, heês mad at you, too. He says youêre the succubus who led his friend astray."
Penny,"I donêt know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that canêt be good."
Sheldon,Thought I heard you out here.
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
Sheldon,You donêt get a hey. You get a hmm.
Penny,"Come on, donêt be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months."
Sheldon,Youêre right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.
Sheldon,I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons Iêm going to get in the mail now?
Amy,"Sheldon, your fightês with Leonard. Pennyês got nothing to doÑ"
Sheldon,"Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemyês girlfriend is my enemy. "
Sheldon,Yes. Youêre either with me or against me.
Amy,You want to take the bus to work?
Sheldon,Maybe thereês a third option.
Amy,"FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk."
Leonard,"So now weêre just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising."
Howard,"Thatês so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiationÑ Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here."
Sheldon,"Howard, Raj. Judas."
Leonard,You know what? Youêre a crazy person.
Sheldon,"A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army."
Howard,Stop it.
Sheldon,Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.
Howard,"I said, stop it. Now, listen to me. You two arenêt just friends. Youêre best friends. And thatês a beautiful thing. I mean, Leonard, you know why heês so mad at you? Itês êcause he missed you. Yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. As I do. This man held my breast the other day and I love him for it."
Raj,"A little loud, dude."
Howard,"So, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad weêre here together?"
Sheldon,I suppose so.
Howard,Thank you.
Raj,"Uh, it wasnêt anything weird. It was just to see how big they were."
Sheldon,"And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures. "
Leonard,"I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights."
Penny,Iêm so glad you guys are friends again.
Sheldon,"And Iêm glad you and I are friends again, too."
Sheldon,"Which reminds me. This came in the mail, and I want you to have it."
Penny,Fifty cents off Vagisil.
Sheldon,Think of me when you apply it.
Raj,"Uh, can I just say, Iêve missed all of us hanging out together."
Penny,"Me, too."
Leonard,"Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?"
Bernadette,"Oh, that happened right after you left."
Leonard,And no one told me?
Howard,Canêt believe we forgot to tell him.
Penny,Think of Sheldon when you apply it.
Raj,"So, couldnêt help but notice none of you RSVPêd to my murder mystery dinner party."
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. We were meaning to do that."
Raj,"No, you werenêt because it was a week ago and nobody came. So, if you want to solve the mystery of who stabbed Koothrappali in the back with the weapon of indifference, it was all of you."
Sheldon,"I donêt think thatqualifies as a mystery, we all knew what we were doing."
Amy,"Weêre sorry, Rajesh. "
Bernadette,Maybe we can do it next week.
Howard,"Whoa, whoa, weêre not that sorry."
Raj,"Donêt worry, I can take a hint. No more murder mystery parties."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Raj,Because Iêve got something even better planned.
Sheldon,Come on.
Raj,Just hear me out. Iêm going to make you guys a scavenger hunt like they have at M.I.T.
Howard,"Oh, I loved those. I did them every year there."
Leonard,"We did them at Princeton, too."
Howard,"Oh, thatês cute. Like itês a real college."
Sheldon,"Thatês amusing, I was going to say that about M.I.T., but it works for Princeton, too."
Amy,"Scavenger hunts at Harvard were really tough. I always got stuck on the first challenge, trying to find someone to be on a team with me. I guess that storyês more sad than funny."
Penny,I love scavenger hunts. My friends and I had them all the time.
Leonard,"Oh, these are a little different. Thereês a tradition at elite universitiesÑ"
Howard,And Princeton.
Leonard,"A tradition of hunts full of puzzles that rely on logic and obscure knowledge, science."
Penny,"Oh, in ours we would just run around town looking for a store that would sell us beer."
Raj,"So, uh, whoês in?"
Leonard,I think it sounds fun.
Amy,"Yeah, me, too."
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. Are we really doing this or are we tricking Koothrappali again like with the dinner party?
Leonard,Whatês all this?
Sheldon,"Oh, everything I could possibly need to win the scavenger hunt."
Leonard,You really think heês gonna send us to a bowling alley?
Sheldon,"Well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are? They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams."
Raj,"Okay, everybody. Whoês ready for a scavenger hunt?  each, each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next, the last of which will lead you to the coin. The first team that finds it wins."
Sheldon,He is a born showman.
Raj,Any questions?
Howard,"Yes, to be fair, do people who went to Princeton get a head start?"
Leonard,Itês not funny.
Sheldon,"No, Oh, it actually is if you get the joke. Itês based on the premise that Princeton isnêt a very good school. "
Sheldon,"Oh, see? Now he gets it."
Raj,"Okay, guys, go ahead and divide yourselves into teams of two."
Bernadette,Should we just do couples?
Leonard,Couples sounds great. Or we could mix things up. Maybe pick names out of a hat. Whatever.
Penny,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why donêt you just admit you donêt want to be on a team with me."
Leonard,"I just said, couples sound great."
Penny,"Mm-hmm, yeah, you donêt think Iêm smart enough. You think Iêm gonna be a liability. Even though I totally just used the word liability correctly in a sentence. Yeah."
Leonard,"All right, letês, letês do couples. I want to."
Penny,"No, no. Letês mix things up. I choose Sheldon, and weêre gonna kick your ass!"
Sheldon,Really? The only time Iêm ever picked first for a team and Iêm stuck with the liability?
Amy,Stop that. Penny is not a liability.
Penny,Thank you. Do you want to be on my team?
Amy,Maybe we pick names out of a hat.
Penny,"All right, hurry up and close the door so they canêt hear us. Would you stop pouting? So, you picked my name. Get over it."
Sheldon,"Yes, and do you know what the odds are Iêd pick your name?"
Sheldon,"Itês not hard, one in five. Now you know why Iêm pouting."
Raj,"All right, teams. Get ready to open your first puzzle. Go. Do you see what I did? The first puzzle is a puzzle. Oh, my God, how adorable is that? I wish I had a friend like me."
Sheldon,What are you doing? You have to start with the edges.
Penny,"Well, thereês no right way, Sheldon. I already found a few pieces that fit."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, take them apart and start with the edges. And stop wasting time."
Howard,"Wow, youêre really good at puzzles."
Amy,"I did them all the time as a kid. As my mom used to say, when youêre doing a puzzle, itês like having a thousand friends. She was full of fun lies like that."
Howard,"If it makes you feel any better, my momês just full of pound cake."
Amy,Iêm sorry you got stuck with me. I bet you wanted to be with Bernadette.
Howard,Have you ever played a game with Bernadette?
Howard,Have you ever gone into a steel cage with a wolverine?
Bernadette,"Faster, faster, faster! Do you not know that word? It means more fast!"
Leonard,Stop yelling at me.
Bernadette,"Hey, youêll know when Iêm yelling at you."
Penny,"Ooh, ooh, itês the comic book store. All right, come on, thatês where we have to go."
Sheldon,But we havenêt finished the puzzle.
Penny,"But, it, it doesnêt matter. We know the answer, come on."
Sheldon,"You think you know the answer. But it could be a trick. What if when the puzzleês complete, thereês a sign in the window that says go to the train store?"
Penny,"Okay, itês not gonna say that."
Sheldon,"Well, I hope youêre wrong. I really want to go to the train store."
Howard,Itês the comic book store. Letês go.
Bernadette,"Come on, numb nuts, itês the comic book store."
Penny,"Itês the comic book store, itês the comic book store, itês the comic book store."
Sheldon,Itês the comic book store.
Leonard,Do you think Pennyês mad at me?
Bernadette,Because youêre in the right lane behind a bus and you wonêt go around it? Iêm sure she finds it charming.
Leonard,"No, because I didnêt want her on my team."
Bernadette,Iêm starting to think she dodged a bullet. The slowest bullet in the world.
Leonard,"Geez, I never realized you were so competitive."
Bernadette,"Yeah, I know. Its, itês probably because I grew up with five brothers and sisters so I had to fight for everyÑ Oh, my God, you did not just slow down for a bird, you know they fly, right?"
Amy,I think this is the first time weêve ever actually been alone together.
Howard,"Huh, I guess youêre right. Wonder why that is?"
Amy,"Well, off the top of my head, Iêd say we donêt have a lot in common except for the people weêre involved with. Plus, when we first met, Penny warned me never to get into a car alone with you."
Howard,"Yeah. You know, I bet you and I have more in common than we think."
Amy,Such as?
Howard,I donêt know. Tell me some things you like.
Amy,"Uh, letês see. I like harps, Little House on the Prairie, medieval poetry, medieval literatureÑ"
Howard,"Hey, how about some music?"
Amy,Great. Sheldon never lets me listen to music in the car. He doesnêt want to be mistaken for a gang member. 
Howard,Find something you like.
Amy,"Beatles, boring. Eminem, scary. Weird Al? How old are you? Neil Diamond?"
Howard,"Yeah, I love Neil Diamond."
Amy,I love Neil Diamond.
Raj,"Oh, hey, thanks for letting me use the comic book store as part of the scavenger hunt."
Raj,"Oh, congratulations. Youêre the first team to arrive."
Amy,"Yes, itês not a ruse to make fun of me. Itês a real game and Iêm winning it."
Raj,Your next puzzle is a riddle. And who better to give it to you than The Riddler?
Bernadette,"Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! How am I faster than you? Iêm in heels and I stopped to take a phone call."
Leonard,I have asthma. Back off.
Howard,"Riddle me this. Arrah, Arrah, and gather round, the work of this hero is legion-bound. He multiplies N by the number of He, and in this room the thing youêll see."
Raj,"Good riddle, huh?"
Raj,I invited you to my murder mystery party.
Penny,"Ugh, weêre the last ones here, hurry up."
Sheldon,"It is a marathon, not a sprint."
Penny,People run in a marathon.
Sheldon,Not with a bowling ball on their back.
Leonard,"Hey, Penny, I just wanted to say good luck, and I hope thereês no hard feelings."
Bernadette,"Hey, Romeo. Repair your relationship on your own time."
Leonard,"Relax, itês a hard puzzle. Itês gonna take a while to solve."
Penny,Riddle me thisÑ
Sheldon,Got it.
Penny,"Hey, Princeton, look at that, Team Community College Night School is in the lead."
Sheldon,I thought we were the Lightning Sharks.
Howard,"Hey, you know what this could mean ."
Amy,"Oh, oh, thatês good. Then this would be "
Howard,Thatês it. 
Amy,To the Neil Mobile.
Bernadette,"I knew it, weêre gonna lose."
Leonard,"Wait, I got it. I got it/"
Bernadette,"Congratulations, you got it last. "
Leonard,"Youêre really mean, you know that?"
Penny,"Aha. Okay, letês see. To continue on your quest, leave no stone unturned. Ooh."
Sheldon,The next clue must be hidden under one of these rocks.
Penny,"Oh. Okay. Sheldon, I, Iêve got to ask, how did you figure out that it was the geology lab?"
Sheldon,"Oh, simple, the ‚arrah, ‚arrah in the riddle mean Jan Arrah, a member of the Legion of Superheroes, known as Element Lad. And then the word He, it wasnêt the masculine pronoun, but rather H e, the abbreviation for helium. See where Iêm going with this?"
Sheldon,"Nice try. Now, Element Ladês ability is the power to transmute chemical elements. Helium has an atomic number of two. If you multiply that by the atomic number of N, nitrogen, you get 14, which is the atomic number of? Iêm just funninê you, silicon. And that is the most common element in the Earthês surface. So that narrowed it down to the geology lab or the chemistry lab."
Penny,Wow. I can drink a beer underwater.
Sheldon,"And Iêm sure your parents are proud. Now, finally, the line in this room the thing youêll see was an obvious reference to Fantastic Four member The Thing, whoês made entirely ofÑ"
Penny,Shut up. I solved it.
Sheldon,Those are map coordinates. Got êem. Letês go.
Penny,"Well, wait. Donêt you want to know how I figured it out?"
Sheldon,"No one likes a know-it-all, Penny."
Howard,On the boats and on the planes. 
Amy,Theyêre coming to America. 
Howard,Never looking back again. 
Amy,Theyêre coming to AmericaÑ _
Leonard,"Um, Iêm okay with you driving my car. Iêm not okay with you flying my car."
Bernadette,"Donêt sweat it, my dadês a cop. He can fix things."
Leonard,Uh-huh. Like death?
Bernadette,Your kid may be an honour student but youêre a moron.
Leonard,Pennyês not answering my texts.
Bernadette,Who cares? Focus on the game.
Leonard,This stupid game is why sheês mad in the first place. Iêm telling her Iêm quitting.
Bernadette,Quitting would be the worst thing for your relationship.
Bernadette,Because it would make you seem like something she already thinks you are. 
Leonard,What does she think I am?
Bernadette,How do I put this? Sheês been known to call you a name that usually applies to a lady part. Or a cat. Or a willow.
Leonard,I canêt believe she would say that about me.
Bernadette,If youêre gonna cry about it thereês tissues in my purse. Unless you got some in yours. Big willow.
Howard,"Theyêre coming to America, Theyêre coming to America."
Sheldon,"Okay, another 30 feet."
Penny,"Okay. Oh, itês a bowling alley."
Sheldon,Yes. Yes. My brain is better than everybodyês.
Howard,Love on the rocks. 
Amy,Ainêt no big surprise.
Howard,Just pour me a drink.
Amy,And Iêll tell you some lies. 
Leonard,Call me a lady part. Weêll see about that.
Bernadette,Can you reach the clue?
Bernadette,"Hurry, Sheldon and Penny were right behind us in the bowling alley."
Leonard,Got it.
Bernadette,"Great, climb back up. Come on."
Leonard,"Yeah, Penny might be onto something."
Sheldon,To the planetarium.
Penny,Letês go.
Leonard,To the tar pits.
Bernadette,Letês go.
Amy,Thereês a Neil Diamond concert next month.
Howard,Letês go.
Penny,"Three bags, no oneês opened êem. weêre the first ones here."
Sheldon,Itês dirty laundry. Youêre up.
Penny,Why me?
Sheldon,Because youêve been training for this your whole life. You live in a pile of dirty laundry.
Bernadette,Theyêre here first. This is because you made me slow down for that blind guy.
Penny,"Okay, the clue must be in the bag."
Leonard,The clue must be in the bag.
Penny,Itês just a bunch of pants.
Leonard,Itês just a bunch of pants.
Penny,"You know, Iêm surprised you want to copy my answers since Iêm not even smart enough to be on your team. "
Leonard,"Well, why would you want to be on someoneês team who you like to call a, I canêt even say it in front of Sheldon."
Penny,What are you talking about?
Leonard,You know exactly what Iêm talking about.
Bernadette,"No, she doesnêt. I just made that up."
Leonard,Why would you do that?
Bernadette,"Because you were about to quit like a big, Sheldon, cover your ears."
Sheldon,Iêm not a child. I know the word ninny.
Penny,"Yeah, well, you should have quit êcause Iêm still gonna beat your ass."
Bernadette,Wish I had a man like her on my team.
Leonard,"Hey, I am every bit as much of a man as Penny. Now, letês do this."
Sheldon,"Wait, itês not all pants, thereês one shirt."
Sheldon,"Hey, thatês my shirt."
Leonard,"This one is, too."
Sheldon,"No, no, thatês not mine. It has a big spot on it."
Penny,But wait. So does this one.
Bernadette,Maybe the spotês the clue.
Penny,Sheldonês spot. The coin is in your spot.
Sheldon,"Oh, thatês clever."
Sheldon,Be there in a minute. I just have to pre-soak these.
Bernadette,"Stop her, Leonard, stop her."
Penny,"Well, where the hellês the coin?"
Leonard,Wasnêt the answer Sheldonês spot?
Raj,"Oh, yes, Leonard. Yes, it was."
Bernadette,Then whereês the coin?
Raj,"Yes, exactly. Where is the coin? Why donêt you look in your pockets? I slipped them in there earlier today."
Penny,I donêt get it.
Raj,"Donêt you see? When weêre all having fun together, weêre already winners. Oh, look. See? Even Iêm a winner."
Leonard,Are you kidding me?
Penny,That is the stupidest thing Iêve ever heard. 
Bernadette,You suck so hard.
Raj,"Well, I thoughtÑ Come on, I didnêt want anyone to feel bad at the end of the game. And some of those puzzles were really hard and I didnêt know who was gonna get Penny."
Raj,"Okay, okay, that-that came out wrong, but you have to admit, you all had a wonderful time."
Penny,Run to India.
Raj,I just wanted to do something beautiful.
Sheldon,"Hey, look. I won."
Howard,"Hey, she got the way to move me, Cherry,"
Amy,She got the way to groove me.
Howard,"Cherry, baby"
Amy,"She got the way to move me, honey."
Sheldon,So whatêd you think?
Amy,It was good.
Sheldon,Thatês it? Goodî
Amy,"I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be losing my virginity, I didnêt think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time."
Sheldon,"My apologies. I chose my words poorly. I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. Anyway, thank you for watching it. Itês one of my all-time favourites."
Amy,It was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem.
Sheldon,"Story problem? You, oh, Amy, what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. Iêve watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which I can only watch when itês still light out, but, I defy you to find a story problem. Hereês my jaw, drop it."
Amy,"All right. Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. If he werenêt in the film, it would turn out exactly the same."
Sheldon,"Oh, I see your confusion. You donêt understand. Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip."
Amy,"No, I do, and if he werenêt in the movie, the Nazis would have still found the ark, taken it to the island, opened it up and all died, just like they did. Let me close that for ya."
Penny,Hi. I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays.
Leonard,"Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy were having date night and they donêt need me there to make it awkward. They have each other for that. So, how was school?"
Penny,"Oh, good. Check it out, The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter."
Leonard,You bought my momês book?
Penny,Yeah. Itês on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.
Leonard,"Oh, come on. Not that book. It, itês got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it."
Penny,"Oh, cool. Are there pictures?"
Leonard,"Seriously, please find another book."
Penny,"Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?"
Leonard,"There, thereês chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want, just donêt talk to me about it."
Penny,Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?
Leonard,"It was not a crisis. Apparently, I favoured the left one, she got a little lopsided."
Penny,"Oh, my God, you still go left."
Raj,Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?
Howard,Halle Berry. Why?
Raj,"Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online, and itês one of the questions. And thank you, Iêd kill for that womanês bone structure."
Leonard,Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?
Sheldon,"Iêll tell you why. Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me, so now Iêm trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that."
Howard,Because her life wasnêt enough?
Raj,"Wait, how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders? Itês perfect."
Sheldon,"Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die."
Howard,"Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place. The only reason they got the ark was because Indy found it first."
Leonard,"Actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place."
Penny,"Okay, I know you donêt want to talk about it, but can I just ask you one question about your momês book?"
Penny,I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his momês make-up and wears balloon boobies.
Leonard,"They werenêt boobies, they were muscles. And the make-up was green. I was pretending to be The Hulk."
Penny,You were wearing her bra.
Leonard,That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?
Penny,"Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I think, sometimes, itês good to open up about these things."
Leonard,"Okay, fine. Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk? Because I was always mad at my mom and I wanted to smash my way out of that house."
Penny,"Well, why were you so angry?"
Leonard,"Gee, I donêt know. Maybe itês because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long Iêd keep looking? The answer, by the way, June."
Penny,"Sweetie, Iêm so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better."
Leonard,"I do, too, but thereês not."
Penny,Really? Are you sure about that?
Leonard,"Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student? Just warning you, Iêm gonna go right. Donêt make a big deal out of it."
Raj,"Well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right, here we go, and smile. Okay, uh-uh, that oneês in the bank. How about this? Turn away, and then turn back into it. But when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet."
Raj,"Okay, uh, letês try it again. Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesnêt want to hurt you."
Raj,"Come on. One more time. Yeah, itês, itês a little blurry, but I think that works in your favour. Do you want a beer?"
Raj,"Almost. Oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?"
Raj,"My parentsê money. Uh, what did you put for your best feature?"
Raj,"Come on, dude, youêre being too hard on yourself. Youêve got a lot of good stuff going on."
Raj,"Well, okay, youêre a, youêre a talented artist, you own your own business."
Raj,"Okay, well, can we imply that youêre well-endowed?"
Raj,"Okay, now youêre talking like a winner!"
Leonard,Whatcha doinê?
Sheldon,"Oh, it turns out Amyês beloved Pride and Prejudice is a flawless masterpiece. Heês got too much pride, sheês got too much prejudice, it just works."
Leonard,So youêre looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?
Sheldon,Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke.
Leonard,Mm-hmm. And?
Sheldon,"And I think Iêve got it. Consider, a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. Why do they keep him?"
Leonard,Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didnêt know how big he was gonna be.
Sheldon,"Of course. You know, why couldnêt she just like Ziggy? Yeah? That thingês riddled with plot holes."
Leonard,"Sorry, buddy."
Sheldon,"Ooh, I think sheês a fan of Garfield as well. Oh, darn it, now so am I."
Leonard,Iêll see you later. I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny.
Sheldon,"Wait, hang on. Youêve spent time with Amy. Can you think of anything sheês fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasnêt noticed?"
Leonard,I gotta go.
Leonard,You ready to go?
Penny,"Yep. Hey, and maybe this time you donêt try and talk sports with the guys."
Leonard,Some sports bar. Itês like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?
Penny,"Oh, come on. Every time weêre about to hang out with my friends, you donêt want to. Itês like, Itês too loud, or the bathroomês too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. I meanÑ"
Leonard,"Well, youêre, youêre right. Letês just go."
Penny,"Hey, whatês going on with you?"
Leonard,"Nothing, Iêm fine."
Penny,"All right, hang on. is this still about your momês book?"
Leonard,Not everything is about my mom. 
Penny,"‚Cause if youêre still upset about that, we donêt have to go."
Leonard,Except this is totally about my mom.
Penny,Iêm so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?
Leonard,That sounds nice. Yeah.
Leonard,"Or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom."
Howard,"Leonard, you ready for lunch?"
Leonard,One sec. Hey. Sorry.
Howard,"Hi, Penny."
Penny,"Hi. All right, sweetie. You hang in there today."
Leonard,"Iêll try, but I might be sad again tonight."
Howard,Wow. Sex at work?
Leonard,Leave it alone. Thatês my girlfriend.
Howard,Sorry. 
Leonard,Who just had sex with me at work.
Howard,Damn. Howêd you swing that?
Leonard,"Well, whenever I talk about how awful my mom was, Penny will do anything to make me feel better."
Leonard,"Look, I mean, Iêm not proud of it, but it does work. I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python. Even I was bored, I just wanted to see if sheêd make it to the end."
Howard,You sound kind of proud of it.
Leonard,"I am, Iêm really proud."
Amy,"Hello, Sheldon. Is everything okay?"
Sheldon,Yes. Why?
Amy,"Well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey."
Sheldon,"April 13, a dark night, indeed."
Amy,So what can I do for you?
Sheldon,Iêm calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.
Sheldon,"Yes. You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me. So Iêd like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, Little House on the Prairie."
Amy,That sounds lovely. Why are you rubbing your hands together?
Sheldon,"Um, Iêm putting on lotion. Are you in or not?"
Amy,Of course Iêm in.
Sheldon,"Excellent. Then I shall see you tomorrow. Good night, Dr. Fowler."
Amy,"Good night, Dr. Cooper."
Sheldon,"Good night, indeed. What a rube. Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands?"
Bernadette,You were really quiet during dinner. Is everything okay?
Howard,"Yeah. I guess I was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was."
Bernadette,"Yeah, I bet it sucked. Iêm gonna take a bath, you do the dishes."
Howard,How about I take a bath with you and see what happens.
Bernadette,"Hereês whatês gonna happen. Iêm gonna take a bath, and youêre gonna do the dishes."
Howard,Thatês it? No compassion?
Bernadette,"Aw, poor Howie. We good? Iêm gonna take a bath."
Bernadette,"God, what is going on with you? "
Howard,Iêm sharing my pain.
Bernadette,And Iêm not buying it. Try again.
Howard,Iêm learning to be a man in a culture where itês increasingly difficult to know how?
Bernadette,Strike two.
Howard,"Iêm copying Leonard. When he does this to Penny, they have sex and watch Monty Python."
Howard,"I know. It was dumb, I shouldnêt have done it. And itês making me feel sad. So sad. You know, why donêt you take a bath? Iêll do the dishes."
Raj,"Three, two, one. "
Raj,"Attention all shoppers, my business is open for business!"
Raj,"Oh, cool, it tells you when someoneês reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope thatês not her weight. "
Raj,"Another one. You know, it, itês weird. When theyêre reading your profile, does it, does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?"
Amy,I love Little House. It made me want to live on a farm so much I tried to milk my cat. That tangy bowl of Cheerios was not worth the stitches.
Sheldon,"Well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? Thatês strange, since peanut butter wasnêt introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner."
Amy,Youêre trying to get back at me for what I said about Raiders of the Lost Ark.
Sheldon,"Thatês silly. Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone, since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. This is more like Little House on the Preposterous."
Amy,"Sheldon, weêre in a relationship. When you get angry, just tell me. You donêt need to seek revenge."
Sheldon,"Are you sure? Every time my dad stayed out all night, my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco."
Amy,"Well, thatês not how weêre going to do it."
Sheldon,"Fine. Iêm mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. Except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it."
Amy,I shouldnêt have said it. Iêm sorry.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Amy,Do you feel better?
Sheldon,Yes. But not as good as Iêm going to when I tell you that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays. Heês a cat. He doesnêt have a job.
Leonard,"Hey, I was justÑ what is happening?"
Penny,"Oh, just a little treat. I know youêve been feeling really bad about your mom lately."
Leonard,"Oh, oh, I have. So bad."
Penny,"And I wanted to make you feel better, so I planned something very special for you."
Leonard,"Uh-huh, I can already feel it working."
Leonard,IÑ uhÑ
Penny,Bernadette told me everything. Now you donêt get the left or the right.
Leonard,"Oh, please, Mommy. No, Mommy."
Leonard,I didnêt dream that?
Leonard,"Penny, come back. Iêm sad for real now."
Raj,"In the last two hours, 162 women have read our profiles. How many of them have sent us messages?"
Raj,"Dude, this is, this is brutal. "
Raj,"This is the worst. If weêre gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school."
Raj,"Yeah, anything is better than this."
Raj,I was wrong. This is worse.
Howard,"Wait, wait, if it wasnêt for Indiana Jones, the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse. "
Sheldon,Thatês true. He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing.
Raj,Like a hero.
Leonard,"Although, technically, Indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. He couldnêt even get that done."
Penny,"Awkward silence, Sheldon on his phone, no touching. Somebodyês having date night."
Amy,Itês actually steamier than it looks. Sheldonês looking up the phallic symbolism of root vegetables in Renaissance paintings.
Sheldon,"Oh, no, I got bored with that. Iêm just browsing cuticle scissors on Amazon."
Penny,How do you not tear off his clothes and take him right here on this table?
Sheldon,"If you do that, Iêll scream."
Amy,"Sheldon, I have some exciting news to tell you."
Sheldon,"That makes two of us. My new cuticle scissors will be here in one to two business days. Come on, one."
Amy,Iêve been invited to consult on an experiment at your university for a few months. Isnêt that great? We could have lunch together. We could carpool. 
Sheldon,"You know, riding with Leonard has gotten a little tedious lately. The only car game he ever wants to play is the Quiet Game. And heês terrible at it, I always win."
Amy,"So, youêre okay with this?"
Sheldon,"Well, why wouldnêt I be?"
Amy,"Well, this project would have us working in close proximity to one another. And thereês the vulgar adage that one should not defecate where one eats."
Sheldon,"My father used to say that all the time. That and, um, who does one have to orally gratify to get a drink around here? But what does that have to do with you working at the university?"
Amy,"Sheldon, donêt defecate where you eat means donêt have a romantic relationship in the workplace."
Sheldon,"Huh. Yeah, I always took it literally. Thatês why I have never once moved my bowels in this or any restaurant. Hmm."
Amy,Iêm relieved that you donêt have a problem with us working together.
Sheldon,"Not as relieved as Iêm about to be. Itês a brave new world, little lady."
Howard,Are you crazy? You donêt want your girlfriend at work with you. Hell Clam.
Sheldon,Why not? Hairy Fairy.
Raj,"I think it could be romantic. You know, my parents met at his place of work. "
Leonard,Your fatherês a gynaecologist.
Raj,"I know. What started as a pap smear turned into a date. Which turned into her working there, which turned into marriage, which then turned into hatred, which continues to this day. Two-Eyed Cyclops."
Howard,Would you please tell him this isnêt a good idea?
Leonard,"No, no, I think itêll be great. Maybe next time he gets conjunctivitis at work, she can hold his head and try to put the drops in his eyes. Giant baby."
Sheldon,Thatês a Raging Ogre.
Leonard,"Yeah, I know."
Howard,"Iêm just saying, Iêd never want to work with Bernadette. Can you imagine seeing someone all day long and then youêre supposed to hang out with them after work, too?"
Raj,Hold on. We do that all the time. You and I work together and play together.
Howard,"Yeah, I know, and it drove me into the arms of another woman. Bipolar Bear."
Sheldon,"Well, I appreciate your concern, but I wonêt be seeing any more of Amy than I already do. I assume weêll deduct any extra time we spend together at work from our weekly quota."
Leonard,Please let me be there when you tell her that.
Sheldon,Why? So you can see the look on Amyês face when she hears my top-notch idea?
Leonard,"Please, oh, please, just let me be there."
Bernadette,"So, Amy, what are you gonna be working on at Caltech?"
Amy,Iêm leading a study to see if deficiency of the monoamine oxidase enzyme leads to paralyzing fear in monkeys.
Bernadette,"If theyêre anything like humans, the answerês yes."
Amy,"Wait, youêve, youêve done this experiment on humans?"
Bernadette,"You mean like death row inmates with nothing to lose? No, that would be unethical."
Penny,"You know, not a lot of people know this, but the monoamine oxidase enzyme was discovered by a woman, Mary Bernheim. Thatês right, my phone is just as smart as you guys."
Bernadette,"Heês never gonna stop doing that, is he?"
Amy,I donêt mind. Iêm hoping to put his love of repetition to good use someday.
Sheldon,"Hi. Um, Iêve reconsidered. Uh, you canêt work where I work. Enjoy the rest of your evening."
Amy,Sheldon. I already signed the contract. I cashed a cheque. 
Sheldon,"Mmm, you are not going to come out of this looking good."
Penny,"Sheldon, I donêt understand. I thought you said you were fine with it."
Sheldon,"Well, I was. But that was before Howard explained to me how awful it would be if he had to work with his significant other."
Bernadette,He said what?
Sheldon,"Now, donêt be insulted. He just thinks too much of you would be mind-numbingly tedious. "
Bernadette,"Excuse me, I need to have a chat with my husband."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, now, well, keep it short. From what I gather, brevity is your friend. So, are we good here?"
Amy,"No, weêre not good here. I am working on this project."
Penny,"Yeah, and you canêt tell her what she can and cannot do."
Sheldon,"Last week, you told Leonard he couldnêt wear his Wookie jacket out in public."
Penny,Thatês different. Iêm not going to the mall with someone dressed like a dumb space bear.
Amy,"Sheldon, you donêt have to worry about me bothering you. Iêll be in a different building. And we donêt even have to have lunch together."
Amy,"Yes. Before all things, Iêm a scientist. Iêm just there to do my work and, with a little luck, scare the living crap out of some monkeys."
Sheldon,Hmm. You sure your mothlike personality wonêt be drawn to this blazing fire that is myself?
Amy,More and more sure.
Sheldon,"Well, then, you have my permission."
Amy,I didnêt ask for your permission.
Sheldon,Too late. No backsies.
Howard,"No, no, listen to me. Sheldon misunderstood. What I meant was, if we worked together, thereêd be too much of me for you, not the other way around."
Sheldon,"Howard, if youêre going to lie to your wife, donêt start the sentence with Sheldon misunderstood. Thatês a dead giveaway."
Howard,"Okay, fine. I did say that, and I think itês true. I think if we worked together and lived together, weêd get sick of each other."
Sheldon,"Yeah, but to be fair, he only said the part about him getting sick of you."
Howard,"For the love of God, why?"
Bernadette,What exactly do you think youêd get sick of?
Raj,His only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one.
Howard,Itês nothing in particular. IÑ
Bernadette,Is it my voice? Am I too bossy? What?
Howard,My arm is feeling numb.
Leonard,Nailed it.
Bernadette,"Thatês the wrong arm for a heart attack, doofus. "
Howard,"My point is, Iêm sure there are things about me that would drive you crazy if you had to deal with them all day long."
Bernadette,Like looking me in the eye and lying to me?
Howard,"Oh, well, come on, where am I supposed to look when I lie to you?"
Bernadette,Find somewhere else to sleep tonight.
Sheldon,"If it makes you feel any better, Amy and I are fine. I mean, really good."
Leonard,"So, boys, how was the pyjama party? You guys jump on the bed and sing into hair brushes?"
Raj,"It wasnêt a pyjama party. It was just a couple of bros hanging out, giggling, eating cookie dough and watching Princess Bride."
Howard,"Please, stop talking."
Raj,As you wish.
Howard,"I mean, you know, Sheldon, none of this wouldêve happened if I hadnêt tried to help you."
Sheldon,"Uh, it also wouldnêt have happened if, in the early universe, hydrogen was a little more common or a little less common. This is fun. Your turn."
Leonard,That was kind of icy. You two okay?
Sheldon,"Oh, weêre fine. As Howard advised, sheês merely respecting our professional boundaries."
Leonard,Smart. Take relationship advice from a man who spent last night braiding Rajês hair.
Sheldon,"Yeah, you make a good point. It would appear I was worried for nothing. Look at her, desperately wishing she was over here at the cool table. Donêt worry, little moth. The flame will come to you."
Raj,"Oh, uh, on the off chance that Bernadette doesnêt call back and apologize, how do you feel about Mexican food for dinner tonight?"
Howard,I donêt know. Sounds kind of heavy.
Raj,Thatês êcause you always fill up on chips.
Amy,And this is Dr. Gunderson from Stockholm.
Sheldon,"Ah, Sweden. Yeah, home of my favourite Muppet and, uh, second favourite meatball. Okay, the Nordic reputation for lack of humour is well-founded. Boy, is his name Gunderson or No-Funderson?"
Amy,"Where are we going with this, Dr. Cooper?"
Sheldon,"Oh, please, Iêm your boyfriend. You call me Sheldon. Thatês right, I am in a boy-girl relationship with this cute little lump of wool."
Sheldon,"Itês a physical relationship, too. Hand-holding, hugging, even on hot days. Ow. Okay, hereês a new one. Apparently now we kick each other in the shin under the table. How do you like it when I do it to you? Not so much, huh?"
Amy,"Test subject D7, aka Betsy, fear response study. Image number one, Frenchman on bicycle carrying baguettes. No visible reaction. Image number two, sousaphone. Still no reaction. Okay. Letês kick things up a notch. Image number three, crocodile with a mouthful of monkeys. Okay, now weêre talking."
Sheldon,Dr. Fowler?
Amy,"What do you want, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm done with work, soÑ ugh!"
Amy,"Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry, uh, better?"
Sheldon,"Oh, baguettes. Yes, I like baguettes. What exactly are you doing?"
Amy,Determining baseline fear levels in capuchin monkeys by measuring their response to visual stimuli.
Sheldon,"So, goofing off. As I was saying, Iêm done with work and Leonardês not. So good news, you get to take me home. Play your cards right, Iêll let you drive me past the lot where the buses park at night."
Amy,"I canêt leave now, Sheldon. Iêm very busy. Besides, why would I want to do you a favour after the way you treated me in the cafeteria? Image number four, boa constrictor. "
Sheldon,What on earth are you talking about? My behaviour in the cafeteria was delightful. Maybe your friend Gunderson needs to head over to IKEA and assemble a sense of humour.
Amy,"You embarrassed me in front of my colleagues on my first day here. Image number five, kitten in a teacup."
Sheldon,Aw. Embarrassed you?
Amy,You know what? I donêt have time for this. Find another way home.
Sheldon,Iêm starting to get the sense that youêre angry with me.
Amy,Really? What tipped you off?
Sheldon,"Couple things, actually. Your tone of voice, your body languageÑ"
Amy,Get out.
Sheldon,"Well, now, that."
Amy,"Image number six, woman giving birth."
Leonard,"Itês nine oêclock, where you been?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I had to take the bus home. Fell asleep and missed my stop."
Penny,"Oh, no."
Sheldon,Did you know that Los Angeles has a Little Sri Lanka?
Leonard,I did not.
Sheldon,"Well, I do now. Theyêre a lovely people. Although terrifying when you wake up face-to-face with them. If youêre hungry, I brought home some mutton and coconut milk."
Penny,Whyêd you get that? You hate lamb.
Sheldon,"I was asking for directions. Apparently, there was a communication problem."
Leonard,I thought Amy was gonna drive you home.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I thought so, too, but sheês acting very strangely. I was discussing it with a Sri Lankan fellow on the bus, and he hypothesized that a tiger may have recently run across her shadow. Although he may have just been trying to drum up business for his brother-in-lawês witch doctor practice."
Penny,"Okay, Sheldon, what happened between you and Amy?"
Sheldon,"Well, can you believe she said I embarrassed her?"
Sheldon,But you didnêt even hear the details.
Leonard,"Sheldon, Iêve known you a long time, and Iêm going to tell you this with all the love I can possibly muster. Amyês right. Youêre wrong."
Sheldon,But you donêt even knowÑ
Leonard,Doesnêt matter.
Sheldon,"But, now, but in my defenceÑ"
Leonard,Doesnêt matter.
Sheldon,Youêre not listening to my side of it.
Penny,"Okay, fine, Sheldon. What is your side?"
Penny,"Nope, got to go with Amy on this one."
Howard,"Ooh, shrimp was spicy."
Raj,You want a TUMS?
Howard,You got the tropical fruit kind?
Raj,"No, if I buy those, I just go through them like candy."
Howard,"Tell me about it. One time, I swear I pooped out a stick of chalk.  Iêll get it."
Howard,"Oh, hi."
Bernadette,I may have overreacted.
Howard,"Yeah, well, I didnêt handle it so great, either."
Bernadette,Itês just sometimes I feel like you enjoy spending time with your friends more than with me.
Howard,Thatês not true.
Bernadette,"Itês not? You spend all day together at work, and then you all hang out at night playing games, going to the comic book store. Last week, you two got a couples massage. So, when you said you wouldnêt want to spend that much time with me, it really hurt my feelings."
Howard,"Oh, wow. Yeah, no, I get that. Iêm so sorry. Starting tomorrow, I am turning over a new leaf. Time with you is my number one priority."
Bernadette,Why tomorrow?
Howard,"Well, weêre real close to finishing off the new Batman game."
Raj,"It is awesome. Uh, you should probably go after her."
Howard,Should I go after you?
Howard,Thanks for getting me in trouble.
Sheldon, Amy.
Amy,"Sheldon, what are you doing here so late?"
Sheldon,"I couldnêt sleep because I kept thinking about what happened earlier between us. Also, I had one heck of a bus nap. Oh, speaking of which, do you want some mutton and coconut milk?"
Sheldon,"Well, I cannot give this stuff away."
Amy,What do you want?
Sheldon,"Amy, this isnêt easy to say. All relationships are difficult, but even more so when youêre in one with a person who struggles with everyday social interactions. And frankly, who can strike some people as being kind of a weirdo."
Amy,"Sheldon, youêre not a weirdo."
Sheldon,"I wasnêt speaking about me. I mean, honestly, thereês no telling what will set you off. You know, introducing myself as your boyfriend. Giving you the opportunity to drive me home. Breaking the ice with your colleagues using ethnic humour, the funniest kind of humour."
Amy,Whatês your point?
Sheldon,"My point is, weêre a couple, and I like you for who you are, quirks and all."
Amy,"I like you, too."
Sheldon,"Well, I should hope so. I donêt see anyone else banging on this door to put up with your nonsense. Not even a good-bye? You see, thatês the kind of thing that makes people think youêre weird. Poor kid. She just doesnêt see it."
Bernadette,Iêm not apologizing to Howard. He can come beg me on his knees.
Amy,"Sheldon, too. If I see him at work, Iêm just going to ignore him."
Penny,"All right, donêt worry. I talked to Leonard. He is gonna sit the guys down and set them straight."
Leonard,Laserês warmed up.
Penny,What are you working on?
Sheldon,Canêt talk. In the zone.
Penny,Do you know what heês doing?
Amy,"Could be anything. Last time he was like this, he figured out electron transport in graphene. The time before that, he was making a list of whoês allowed in his tree fort if fe ever gets one. Still canêt believe I didnêt make the cut."
Penny,"Uh, Sheldon, you want to take a break? Your foodês ready."
Leonard,"No, no, what are you doing? Heês both happy and quiet. Itês like seeing a unicorn and Bigfoot at the same time."
Howard,Sorry weêre so late. Bernadette got stuck at work.
Bernadette,Great news. A raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier and now can infect humans.
Raj,Why is that great news?
Bernadette,"In the pharmaceutical business we have a saying, moê infections, moê money."
Howard,"Wait, Maybe you want to wash your little raccoon hands first."
Bernadette,"Oh, calm down. If I had it, Iêd be dead already."
Howard,"Guys, listen up. "
Sheldon,"Canêt listen, zone. Also donêt care."
Howard,Next week is the anniversary of my first date with Bernadette.
Sheldon,Really donêt care.
Howard,"I want to do something special, and I was hoping you guys could be a part of it."
Penny,"Aw, what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?"
Howard,Just putting something in the bank for what horrible thing I do next.
Howard,"Look, sheês gonna be back any second, so hereês the deal. Iêm writing a song, and I was hoping we could all play it for her together."
Amy,"Oh, I love that."
Raj,That is so beautiful.
Sheldon,When did we get to the Cheesecake Factory?
Leonard,Itês really sweet what Howard wants to do for Bernadette.
Penny,"Yeah. Hey, how come youêve never done anything romantic to celebrate our first date?"
Leonard,"Well, for starters, youêve broken up with me so many times, which first date are we talking about?"
Sheldon,"Ooh, somebody call the burn ward. And back to the zone."
Leonard,"And besides, I do romantic things for you all the time. Can you even name one romantic thing youêve done for me?"
Penny,I can name tons.
Leonard,Sex doesnêt count.
Penny,"Oh. I know, what about that bed-and-breakfast?"
Leonard,"Well, I took you there. All you did wasÑ"
Penny,"I know what I did. I bet they had to throw out that rocking chair. You know, I can be romantic if I want to."
Leonard,Itês fine. And also not true.
Penny,"Okay, just you wait and see. Iêm gonna romance your freakinê ass off."
Leonard,Thatês beautiful. Is that Shakespeare?
Leonard,Heêll figure it out when he falls off the roof.
Leonard,"Sheldon, I know youêre in the zone, but do you want some tea? All right, I canêt believe Iêm gonna say this, but you havenêt spoken in hours and Iêm starting to get worried. Please say something."
Sheldon,"Leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius."
Leonard,"Nope, it was better before."
Sheldon,"Look at it. I feel like my mind just made a baby. And itês beautiful. Itês not like human babies, which are loud and covered in goop."
Leonard,"Holy crap, Sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?"
Sheldon,"Did I? Well, that canêt be right. No oneês ever done that before. Except me, because I just did it. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brainÑ"
Leonard,"Yeah, definitely better before."
Howard,So Iêm almost done writing the song for Bernadette. Are you cool playing the cello?
Leonard,"If by cool you mean willing to, yes. If by cool you mean cool, clearly youêve never seen me play the cello."
Howard,Great. Will you play the ukulele?
Raj,Of course. Iêd be happy to shred it on my ax.
Howard,"Or you could just play your tiny, ridiculous guitar."
Raj,Fine. I will melt her heart. And her face.
Sheldon,"Gentlemen. Uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. Now, if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. I donêt care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks. "
Howard,"Seriously, congratulations, Sheldon."
Raj,"Yeah, I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired."
Sheldon,"Oh, well, thank you. Believe it or not, I just learned a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were extremely promising."
Leonard,"Sheldon, thatês incredible."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I know. They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party. Although Iêm pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that. I like China. See, they know how to keep people in line."
Howard,"So, what happens next?"
Sheldon,"Oh, more testing, more success, more fame. Yeah, but donêt worry, I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe Iêve always been."
Leonard,Good to know.
Sheldon,"Now give me that cookie, I discovered an element."
Penny,Thank you so much for coming.
Raj,You called the right person. I believe I have the perfect romantic evening for you to give Leonard.
Penny,"Okay, good, êcause Iêve been really struggling with this."
Raj,"As Iêm sure youêre aware, the quickest way to a manês heart is through hisÑ"
Penny,"Pants, but Leonard says sex doesnêt count."
Raj,"Oh. You poor thing. You have one arrow in your quiver, and you just canêt use it. Fortunately, another pathway to a manês heart is through his stomach. "
Penny,"I donêt know if I want to cook for him. Heês kind of a picky eater. I mean, itês too salty, itês too dry, itês too burnt and frozen at the same time. Okay, come on, what else would sweep you off your feet?"
Raj,"Well, Iêve always had this fantasy that involves dancing. The sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. But boy, oh, boy, does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition."
Penny,"Okay, thatês just the plot for Dirty Dancing. What else would you love? Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayzeês head."
Raj,"Oh, oh, uh, you could, uh, stand outside his window with a boom box in the air."
Penny,Thatês from Say Anything.
Raj,"Look, Iêm a lonely guy, I watch a lot of movies. Look, Penny, if you truly want to be romantic, it needs to come from you."
Penny,"I get that, but why is this so hard?"
Raj,"Well, youêve probably never had to do this stuff êcause youêre young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you."
Penny,"Yeah, Iêm trying to be sad about that. I canêt."
Sheldon,"Letês see, whatês next? Okay, here. This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery."
Amy,I donêt think the Smithsonianês gonna want your marker. 
Sheldon,"And thatês why youêre not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh, guess whoês getting an article written about him in Physics Today? Iêll give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday."
Amy,"Sheldon, Iêm so proud of you."
Sheldon,"Well, you should be. My discovery is spreading like wildfire. Unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean."
Amy,Whatês next?
Sheldon,This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium andÑ
Amy,And what?
Sheldon,"No, no, no, no."
Amy,Whatês wrong?
Sheldon,Iêve made a horrible mistake.
Amy,What are you talking about?
Sheldon,"This table, itês in square centimetres. I read it as square metres. You know what that means?"
Amy,That Americans canêt handle the metric system?
Sheldon,"Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000. "
Amy,But the Chinese team found the element.
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, they shouldnêt have. My calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didnêt know about."
Amy,So you just got lucky?
Sheldon,Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky.
Amy,"You and me both, brother. It doesnêt matter. The element was found because of you, and thatês groundbreaking."
Sheldon,"What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. Iêm not a genius, Iêm a fraud."
Amy,"You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, weêre forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else."
Sheldon,"Oh, great. Now Iêm worse than a fraud. Iêm practically a biologist."
Leonard,"You got to stop beating yourself up over this. I mean, you made a mistake, but it was a happy mistake."
Sheldon,Thereês nothing happy about it. Iêm being given credit that I donêt deserve. 
Leonard,"Oh, people get things they donêt deserve all the time. Look at me with you. "
Sheldon,"No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. Iêve got to find a way to stop this thing."
Leonard,"Buddy, I donêt think you can. I mean, once itês out there, itês out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape."
Sheldon,"You know, frankly, Iêd prefer a sex tape."
Leonard,"You donêt know what a sex tape is, do you?"
Howard,Make sure you guys get to the restaurant by eight. Bernadetteês meeting me there at eight thirty and I donêt want to blow the surprise.
Leonard,Weêll be there.
Raj,"Got it. Now, uh, I have a question about the song. I was thinking at some point I could bust out a little rap."
Raj,"Come on, come on, you havenêt even heard it yet. Leonard, give me a beat."
Leonard,I will not.
Raj,"Oh, please?"
Howard,"No, I want this to be romantic."
Raj,"It will be. I donêt call anyone a ho, and the only time I use the phrase my bitch, Iêm referring to you."
Sheldon,Stop it. Stop celebrating me.
Sheldon,"And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. Youêre fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasnêt the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future."
Raj,"Wait, I donêt understand. They didnêt find the element?"
Sheldon,"Oh, no, they found the element.  No, no, stop it. I donêt need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. How do I make them stop loving me?"
Leonard,Invite them to live with us.
Penny,"Boy, Bernadette is gonna love this."
Leonard,Yeah. It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic.
Penny,"Okay, you know whatês not romantic? Rubbing it in someoneês face."
Leonard,"Actually, it can be, but I told you sex doesnêt count."
Howard,Iêm getting worried about Bernadette. Iêm gonna call and check on her.
Sheldon,The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.
Raj,"Oh, thatês a big deal."
Sheldon,I know. When will this nightmare end?
Leonard,"Hey, I get that you feel bad about all the attention, but still, what you did is amazing. Weêre really proud of you."
Amy,Iêm not.
Sheldon,Youêre not?
Amy,"Sheldon, Iêve been thinking about it, and youêre right. You donêt deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, Iêm embarrassed for you."
Sheldon,Thatês the most romantic thing Iêve ever heard.
Penny,"Damn it, everyoneês better at this than me."
Sheldon,"Congratulations, Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort."
Howard,"Guys, there was an accident at Bernieês lab."
Leonard,"Oh, my God, is she okay?"
Howard,"Yeah, but sheês at the hospital in quarantine."
Amy,Poor Bernadette.
Leonard,"Oh, no."
Sheldon,"I hate to pile on the bad news, but I just got a raise."
Howard,"Oh, my God, Bernie, what happened?"
Bernadette,"Well, letês just say the next time you move a dozen vials of raccoon virus to the fridge, make two trips. "
Howard,Youêre sure youêre okay?
Bernadette,"Yeah, itês just a precaution. If there was a problem, Iêd be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now. Sorry I messed up our date."
Howard,"Oh, donêt worry about it. I brought the date here. Guys, come on in."
Bernadette,Whatês all this?
Howard,"Well, tonight is the anniversary of our first date, and I wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you."
Amy,"Sheldon, get over here."
Sheldon,She might be contagious. Donêt you think Iêm having a rough enough day?
Howard,"If I didnêt have you, life would be blue, Iêd be Dr. Who without the TARDIS."
Sheldon,"Is it me, or does she not look so good?"
Howard,"A candle without a wick, a Watson without a Crick, Iêd be one of my outfits without a dick-ie. Iêd be cheese without the mac, Jobs without the Wozniak, Iêd be solving exponential equations that use bases not found on your calculator making it much harder to crack. Iêd be an atom without a bomb, a dot without the com, and Iêd probably still live with my mom."
Howard,"Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You supported all my dreams and all my hopes. Youêre like uranium-235 and Iêm uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. I couldnêt have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you Bernadette."
Bernadette,"Oh, Howie."
Howard,"If I didnêt have you life would be dreary, Iêd be string theory without any string. Iêd be binary code without a one, a cathode ray tube without an electron gun. Iêd be Firefly, Buffy and Avengers without Joss Whedon. Iêd speak a lot more Klingon, HeghluêmeH QaQ jajvam. "
Howard,"Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. Youêre my best friend and my lover. Weêre like changing electric and magnetic fields. You canêt have one without the other. I couldnêt have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you, Bernadette."
Bernadette,"Howie, that was amazing. Look, Iêm shaking."
Sheldon,"Sheês sick, I knew it. Bye."
Leonard,"I have to say, this is the best Top Ramen youêve ever made."
Penny,"I discovered a secret ingredient. The flavour packet. That sucker is well named. All right, lover boy, get ready, êcause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way."
Leonard,"Stop it, youêre gonna make me cry. All right. You seem pretty confident."
Penny,"Oh, I am. Maybe if you follow this trail, youêll see why."
Leonard,"Oh, rose petals."
Penny,Yes. The most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the flowers.
Leonard,You made the bed? You really are pulling out all the stops.
Penny,"Okay, I gave this a lot of thought, and I finally found something to show you how much I love you."
Leonard,"Oh, wow."
Penny,Itês a first edition of Hitchhikerês Guide to the Galaxy. I remember it was your favourite book growing up.
Leonard,"This is great. It, thank you, itês, so much."
Leonard,Nothing. I love it.
Penny,Somethingês going on. Whatês wrong with it? I remember you saying how great it would be to have a first edition.
Leonard,"Itês true, I did. I did say that. When we were at the used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I bought it."
Penny,"Oh, my God, I am the worst."
Leonard,"No, no, itês okay. Itês really thoughtful."
Penny,"No, itês not. I mean, whatês thoughtful is everything you do. Here, you know what? Look at this. Look, hereês the, the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just because. Hereês the, the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time I slept with you. All 11 pages of it."
Leonard,I canêt believe you saved all this stuff.
Penny,Of course I did. Itês you.
Leonard,Come here.
Leonard,Is that a pregnancy test?
Penny,"Oh, yeah, just the first one. I didnêt save them all."
Sheldon,I canêt believe I read this table wrong. I blame you.
Amy,Me? What did I do?
Sheldon,You distract me. Iêve been distracted since the moment I met you. 
Sheldon,"Well, you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do."
Amy,"Oh, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Amy? Amy? Did you hear what I said?
Amy,"Canêt talk, in the zone."
Amy,Iêve never seen him this happy before.
Leonard,Thatês because youêve never seen him on restock the medicine cabinet day.
Sheldon,Look. A new topical antihistamine with lidocaine. Wow. I canêt wait until I get a rash. 
Leonard,"Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength. I guess they really do read their mail."
Sheldon,"Hey, isnêt that Professor Proton?"
Leonard,"Oh, yeah."
Sheldon,"Look at him, just standing in line like he wasnêt moderately famous 30 years ago. Letês go say hello."
Leonard,"Oh, maybe we shouldnêt bother him."
Sheldon,"Iêm not going to bother him, Iêm going to talk to him."
Leonard,He thinks thereês a difference.
Sheldon,"Arthur? Arthur, itês me, Sheldon Cooper. You may not remember because of your advanced age."
Sheldon,"This is my girlfriend, Amy. Amy, this is television legend Arthur Jeffries. His science show inspired millions of children."
Amy,"Yes, and Iêve heard so much about you. Hey look, weêre wearing the same orthopaedic shoes. I canêt believe I dress like a celebrity."
Leonard,"Dr. Jeffries, hello again. Leonard Hofstadter."
Leonard,"No, sheês not."
Sheldon,"So, what prescription are you getting filled?"
Sheldon,"Wait, I want to guess. Donêt tell me."
Amy,"Sheldon, come on."
Sheldon,"No, no, no. Iêm really good at this. All right, give me a hint. Does it involve difficulty initiating a stream of anything?"
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, letês go mock the people buying homeopathic medicine, you love that."
Sheldon,"But Iêm hanging out with my friend, and weêre having fun. Look how happy he is."
Howard,Bernieês having a girlsê night on Friday at our place. You want to do something?
Raj,"Actually, Iêm busy."
Howard,Doing what?
Raj,Thereês a new sports bar over on Colorado AveÑ
Howard,Youêre going to girlsê night.
Howard,You know theyêre making jewellery right?
Raj,You think they came up with that? They were going to drink beer and play darts.
Leonard,Whatês up?
Howard,Not his testosterone levels.
Raj,Excuse me. I happen to be very comfortable with my masculinity.
Howard,How is that possible?
Leonard,"Hey, I got an email from Professor Proton."
Sheldon,Goody. Whatês it say?
Leonard,"Heês working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes, and wants to know if Iêd take a look at it."
Sheldon,"Thatês strange. That he would come to you for that and not me. Oh, I got two emails from him. Do you have Leonardês email address? And. Never mind, I found it. I canêt believe he picked you over me."
Howard,You donêt want to read a paper by some old has-been who hasnêt done any real science in decades.
Raj,"Yeah, itês nothing to cry about."
Sheldon,Sheldon Cooper does not cry.
Howard,"Itês true, youêd rust."
Sheldon,And to think I idolized that man. And why? At the end of the day heês just another Hollywood phony.
Amy,Is it really worth getting upset about?
Sheldon,"Yeah, they say donêt meet your heroes. Donêt peek behind that curtain of fame and celebrity, because if you do, youêll see them as they really are, degenerate carnival folk."
Amy,"Come on, heês a retired kids show host."
Sheldon,Thatês even worse. Using the sweet candy of science to trick children into loving him. Pervert.
Amy,Have you ever thought about why Arthur didnêt want you to read his paper?
Sheldon,"Yes, I have. And my only conclusion is the prescription he was picking up the other day was for cuckoo pills."
Amy,"Maybe he found you, um, a bit much."
Sheldon,"Thatês kind of a stretch. Look, when it comes to social skills, Iêve mastered the big three. Thereês the coy smile. Thereês the friendly chuckle. Thereês the vocalization of sympathy. Aw. That last oneês tricky, Iêm still working on it."
Amy,"From what I saw the other day, I could understand why he and some people might find youÑ"
Amy,Doesnêt matter.
Sheldon,"No, go ahead, say it. I know what it is. Iêve heard it my whole life. The wordês annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say Iêm annoying."
Sheldon,"Oh, it wonêt hurt my feelings. Go ahead, Amy, say Iêm annoying. Iêm annoying. Iêm annoying. Iêm annoying. Yeah, now, uh, now where are you going? Look, you know you want to say it, say it. Say Iêm annoying. Go ahead, say it. Say it. Say it. Amy, say it. Well, she canêt stand it when Iêm right."
Amy,This is fun. Iêm going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewellery that doesnêt have a list of medications Iêm allergic to.
Raj,"Penny, howês it going over there?"
Penny,"Good, Iêm just having little trouble with the glue."
Amy,How do you not know how to use glue? Did you ditch pre-school?
Penny,"Yeah, but only because I was dating a second grader."
Howard,"Hello, everyone."
Raj,"Okay, let me have it. Letês hear all the Raj is a girl jokes."
Howard,Nope. Bernadette told me it isnêt nice and Iêm not allowed.
Raj,Thank you.
Howard,"So I wonêt be making fun of you, or the things you like, or the fact that you just want to have fu-un."
Bernadette,"Howie, stop. Come on, look at what Iêm making."
Howard,"Oh, thatês actually pretty nice."
Amy,Iêm making a bracelet.
Penny,"Yeah, Iêm just making a mess."
Howard,"You know, instead of beads and glue, you guys can use my soldering iron. Youêd be able to make much cooler stuff."
Raj,"Oh, I think weêre doing just fine, thank you."
Amy,"Actually, Iêd kind of like to try that."
Bernadette,"Me, too."
Howard,Be right back.
Penny,When did I have pistachios?
Sheldon, Arthur. Door knocker. Thatês TV money.
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, did I wake you?"
Sheldon,"Well, I would have been here sooner, but for some reason your home isnêt on this map of Hollywood stars."
Sheldon,Itês been pointed out by my girlfriend that I may have been annoying to you.
Sheldon,"Anyway, I wanted to apologize. I am truly sorry."
Sheldon,"No, no, now that weêve cleared the air, I wanted to discuss another matter with you."
Sheldon,"Well, then, Iêll make this quick. Um, I want to talk about the paper you sent Leonard. Now, I know he said itês promising and heês going to collaborate on it, but now that you and I are friends again, I am at your disposal. And, um, frankly, lending my name and reputation to it will help, because a lot of people think that youêre a washed-up has-been. Or dead."
Sheldon,"So, uh, what do you say?"
Sheldon,"Itês because Iêm annoying, right? I know it is. Say it. Say it. Say Iêm annoying. "
Sheldon,"Say it. Arthur, say it. Say Iêm annoying. Say it. Say it. Iêm annoying. Say it. "
Sheldon,"Well, that really hurt. "
Leonard,"If you would have told me when I was a kid that someday I would be doing science next to Professor Proton, I would not have believed you."
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, Dr. Jeffries, Iêm just excited. This nano vacuum tube idea of yours is, itês really interesting."
Sheldon,"Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur. What an odd coincidence that youêre both here."
Leonard,Why is it odd?
Sheldon,"Because as it just so happens, Iêm also spending the day with a beloved childrenês television science personality. Isnêt that right, new friend and colleague Bill Nye the Science Guy. Sorry, I replaced you with a newer model."
Leonard,"Mr. Nye, hello. Iêm sorry he got you involved in this nonsense."
Sheldon,"No, I said you were teaching someone a lesson. Now letês go."
Leonard,"Oh, uh, weêre making nano vacuum tubes."
Penny,"Hey, guys, what do you think?"
Amy,"Wow, Penny, good job."
Penny,"Thanks. Target, four ninety-nine. Iêm getting a drink."
Amy,What are you working on?
Raj,"Ah, Iêm making a necklace for my mom. "
Amy,Thatês sweet.
Raj,"Yeah, she and my dad are going through a bit of a rough patch, so I wanted to do something to let her know I was thinking about her."
Penny,Whatês going on with them?
Raj,Theyêre just having a little trouble communicating. My dad says itês because the sound of my momês voice makes him want to tear his ears off and sew them over his eyes so he never has to look at her again.
Penny,"Hey, guys."
Howard,Look whoês here to put the Jew in jewellery night.
Bernadette,"Oh, sure, so itês fine when you say it."
Howard,Sorry weêre late. I wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.
Raj,I didnêt know you were coming again.
Howard,"Well, last week was a blast. Plus, I thought you might like having a guy here. "
Penny,It was not funny.
Amy,"So, what tools did you bring?"
Howard,"Everything we need to make jewellery moulds. Hereês some silver, a crucible and an acetylene torch to melt it down."
Penny,"Ooh, that looks like fun."
Bernadette,Maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire.
Howard,"Okay, whoês up first?"
Amy,"Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace?"
Raj,"No, thanks."
Howard,"I was gonna make a necklace for my mom, but unfortunately she doesnêt have a neck. Sheês just chins and fat and feet."
Leonard,"Okay, weêre almost ready to go. Once we bond the wires, we can test the tubes."
Leonard,"Oh, God."
Leonard,Sheldon just sent me a picture of him and Bill Nye getting smoothies.
Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
Leonard,"Oh, uh, you know, because weêre friends."
Leonard,"Wow, you ask really hard questions."
Leonard,"Look, I know he can be aggravating, but what you have to remember is that heês not doing it on purpose. Itês just how he is. But heês also loyal and trustworthy and we have fun together."
Leonard,"He did bite me once. But in his defence, I came up behind him while he was eating, soÑ"
Leonard,"You know what, Sheldon is the smartest person I have ever met. And heês a little broken and he needs me. I guess I need him, too."
Leonard,"Boy, you will not let this go, will you? Oh, jeez."
Leonard,"No, I have to go pick him up. Bill Nye ditched him at the smoothie place."
Howard,"You know, if you guys are interested, thereês a technique where I can take a lock of your hair, refine it into carbon dust and use the hydraulic press at work to turn it into a tiny little diamond with your DNA in it."
Penny,"Oh, thatês amazing,"
Howard,Yeah. See Bernieês engagement ring? That came right off my momês back.
Bernadette,"Heês kidding. If that were true, itêd be so much bigger."
Raj,My name is Howard. I can make your hair into diamonds. My mom is morbidly obese. Everybody love me.
Howard,"Whoa, where is that coming from?"
Raj,Iêll tell you where itês coming from. All you do is make fun of me for coming to girlsê night and now youêre here ruining it for everyone.
Penny,"Raj, cool it, heês gonna make us hair diamonds."
Howard,How am I ruining anything? Iêm just trying to help you make better jewellery.
Raj,But this isnêt about the jewellery. This is about me having a place where I can open up about my feelings.
Howard,Since when canêt you open up with me?
Raj,"There are just some things that I feel more comfortable sharing with the girls, because they wonêt make fun of me or and call me names, or ask me if my Koothrapanties are in a bunch."
Howard,"Buddy, I was just joking around. "
Raj,"Yeah, well, sometimes your jokes hurt. "
Howard,Youêre right. I didnêt realize I was making you feel that way. It was very brave of you to tell me.
Raj,Thank you. It wasnêt easy.
Amy,"Theyêre gonna have sex before Sheldon and I do, I know it."
Sheldon,Iêm surprised to see you here.
Sheldon,Iêll get Leonard.
Sheldon,"If youêre hoping to get in touch with Bill Nye, I canêt help you. Iêve been informed that heês now Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy."
Sheldon,Thank you. It would be an honour.
Sheldon,"Actually, I donêt need that. I hacked into your e-mail account and read it."
Sheldon,"Well, first, I think the fact that you use your birthday as a password is embarrassing. "
Sheldon,"Second, um, I thought your paper was inspired. "
Sheldon,Can I invite you in for tea?
Penny,"Hey, Arthur. How are you?"
Howard,"Oh, hey, buddy, whatês up?"
Raj,"Well, I was feeling bad about how I acted the other night so I made you a little something."
Howard,You didnêt have to do that.
Raj,"Well, it was fun. I used some of the jewellery techniques you taught us. Itês a lightsabre belt buckle."
Howard,"Wow, this is so cool. Thanks."
Raj,Oh gets better.
Raj,"And thatês not even the best part. See? I have one, too. Check it out. You can wear yours and we can have little sword fights whenever we want."
Sheldon,"Yeah, and my eighth favourite episode of Professor Proton was Alka-Seltzer rocket. You said, plop, plop, fizz, fizz, oh, what a blast-off it is. Remember? Remember that? Remember?"
Leonard,He canêt help it. He canêt. He really canêt.
Sheldon,"Oh, wait here. Iêll get some Alka-Seltzer, we can build that rocket, and we can shoot it at Bill Nyeês house. As long as Iêm not within 500 feet of it."
Penny,"Sorry, theyêre both married."
Penny,"Hey, can I ask you a question?"
Penny,"Youêve had this dart board since Iêve known you, but Iêve never seen you play."
Leonard,"Oh, uh, we played, once. I broke a window."
Penny,What window?
Leonard,That one over there.
Sheldon,"Leonard, where are the Skee-Ball tickets?"
Leonard,Skee-Ball tickets?
Sheldon,"Yeah, from when we went to the arcade three years ago? I finally decided what prize I want. Hurry up."
Leonard,"Uh, if I still have them, theyêre probably in the junk box."
Penny,"Ooh, what are you gonna get?"
Sheldon,"None of your business. But when you see me wearing a flower in my lapel later, you are most welcome to sniff it."
Leonard,"Yup, oh, here you go."
Sheldon,"Oh, thank you. Here, get yourself an eraser for your troubles."
Leonard,Oh. I forgot about this. My aunt made it for me when I started college.
Penny,"Aw, did she hate you?"
Leonard,"Why? Because I got an ugly, itchy sweater, and my brother got a car? No, I was her favorite."
Sheldon,I seem to be a few tickets short. Are there more in the box?
Leonard,"Hmm, I think I got them all. Nope, theyêre not in there."
Sheldon,"Well, you barely looked. Let me see."
Leonard,"No, no, no, I, I looked, and thereês, thereês, thereês no more tickets."
Sheldon,"Leonard, let me look in the box."
Leonard,"Okay, okay. Iêm gonna show you whatês in the box. But just promise not to flip out."
Sheldon,Why would I flip out? Is it a spider? Itês a spider.
Penny,"No, if it was a spider, Lenny wouldêve flipped out."
Leonard,"Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed to return this DVD a long time ago, and I know we rented it on your card. But itês been, like, seven years and clearly nothing bad has happened. So in-in-in-instead of being a giant pain in the ass like you always are, what if this one time you just tried staying calm?"
Sheldon,"That seems like a reasonable request. Although so did, hey, Leonard, would you mind returning that DVD?"
Leonard,"Iêm sorry. Iêll, Iêll take care of it."
Leonard,"I mean it, Iêm going to."
Sheldon,I believe you.
Leonard,And youêre going to stay calm?
Sheldon,I said I would.
Leonard,How about that? Sheldonês being reasonable.
Penny,"Yeah, itês freaking me out. Iêm gonna go."
Leonard,"So, when you say youêre not going to freak out about the DVD, hereês what that means. Donêt fixate on it. Donêt wake me up in the middle of the night. Or nag me through the door while Iêm on the toilet."
Sheldon,"Okay, first, talking to you while youêre on the toilet isnêt exactly a picnic for me either, okay? Remember, when you can hear me, I can hear you. And second, you completely disregard how uncomfortable unresolved issues are for me. Itês, itês like, a, an itch in my brain I canêt scratch."
Leonard,When I broke my arm I used to stick a coat hanger down there. You ever try that? Maybe go in through the ear?
Sheldon,You wouldnêt make jokes if you could feel the way I feel.
Leonard,"Well, I donêt know how to do that."
Sheldon,"How about this? I promise I wonêt pester you about the DVD. You can defecate in peace. Thatês a win for both of us. But, until this matter is resolved, I would like you to wear this sweater. With nothing underneath it."
Leonard,Thatês stupid. Why?
Sheldon,You say itês itchy and uncomfortable. I say situations like this make me feel the same way. 
Leonard,"Iêm telling you, try the hanger."
Sheldon,Put it on. Letês share the experience.
Leonard,"You got it. If this sweater shuts you up, Iêm gonna make a fortune selling them to everyone we know. Now all I need to do is head down to the video store and return the DVD."
Sheldon,"Oh, did I forget to tell you? That store went out of business years ago."
Sheldon,"How those nipples feeling, chief?"
Bernadette,"Penny, can we please get our drinks?"
Penny,"Yeah, hang on, just give me sec."
Amy,"At work today, I did an in vivo stereotaxic surgery."
Bernadette,"Cool. At my lab, I performed ten laser capture micro-dissections."
Penny,I scraped gum off the bottom of that table. Only êcause my manager saw me put it there.
Amy,"Oh, my gosh. Thatês the girl that broke Rajeshês heart."
Bernadette,Thatês Lucy?
Penny,I donêt know why but I always pictured her as Indian.
Bernadette,I think that reasonês called racism.
Penny,Iêm gonna go talk to her.
Bernadette,Why? What are you gonna say?
Penny,Iêm not gonna say anything. I just want to check her out. Because she hurt my friend. My Indian friend. Whoês racist now?
Bernadette,You because you just called him your Indian friend.
Penny,"Yeah, well, youêre short."
Amy,Weêre never getting our drinks.
Bernadette,"No, but we knew that."
Penny,"Hey, can I start you off with something to drink?"
Penny,"Okay. Um, youêre Lucy, right? Iêm a friend of Raj Koothrappaliês. Actually Amy recognized you."
Penny,"Oh, you know, heês good."
Penny,"Yeah, this is none of my business. But why did you break up with him in an e-mail?"
Penny,"Yeah, I get that. Iêll go get you your water. When you say easier, you mean easier for you, right? ‚Cause it certainly didnêt make it easier for him."
Penny,"Iêm sorry, this is rude of me. I will go get that water. See, see, see, see. Just now you expressed your feelings to my face. How come you could do that with me, but not Raj?"
Penny,"You know what the worst part is? Youêre sitting here, perfectly happy and heês at home, a blubbering mess."
Penny,"Well, I also said I was getting you water, but look at me still standing here. You know, I may be a bad waitress, but you are a bad person. Now, you want to hear the specials?"
Howard,"So, you can never take it off?"
Raj,Not even to sleep?
Howard,"So, youêre just an idiot?"
Leonard,Itês called proving a point.
Howard,Is the point that youêre an idiot?
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, please. Leonard is trying to walk a mile in my metaphorical shoes. He canêt walk in my actual shoes. He has the feet of a toddler."
Raj,"So, how are you gonna return the DVD if the store went out of business?"
Leonard,"Monday morning Iêll go downtown, look up the ownerês information and send him the DVD. Pay the late fee, and prove to Sheldon that you can have a problem and solve it without acting like a complete lunatic. Ah!"
Howard,And the man impersonating a bear would like everyone to know that only you can prevent forest fires.
Raj,I donêt get it.
Howard,You didnêt have Smokey the Bear in India?
Raj,"Oh, is he anything like, uh, Mun-Mun the Mongoose? He taught us not to play with cobras."
Howard,You had to be taught not to play with cobras?
Raj,You had to be taught not to burn down the forest?
Penny,"Hey, if you guys were hungry, why didnêt you order something at the restaurant?"
Bernadette,"We did, you never brought it."
Penny,"Oh, thatês right. Nachos and a turkey club."
Amy,Not even close.
Penny,"Well, I was too busy standing up for my friend to worry about your, I want to say salmon."
Amy,You want to say sorry.
Bernadette,"So, how are you gonna tell Raj abut what you did?"
Penny,What do you mean how? Whatês the big deal?
Amy,You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.
Bernadette,Then you made her cry and leave.
Penny,"Okay, you guys are overreacting. Raj is gonna appreciate how I had his back."
Raj,"What is wrong with you, Penny? You ruined any chance I had of getting back with Lucy. Now she knows Iêm a desperate mess instead of just being pretty sure.  Itês Lucy. She wants to meet for coffee. I love you, Penny."
Howard,"Hey, whatêre you working on?"
Sheldon,Iêm thinking about how one could use the fact that a rapidly rotating mirror turns virtual photons into real ones as a method of observing dark energy.
Howard,Thatês a pretty cool idea.
Sheldon,Yeah. Itês great youêre here. Iêd love to get an engineerês opinion.
Sheldon,"This chair is squeaky. Now, do I fix it or get a new one?"
Leonard,"Well, Sheldon, it took me all morning, but I found the owner of the video store. And I am happy to report that he died peacefully in his sleep, drunk at the bottom of a pool. Anyway, there is no one to return the DVD to, so this issue is resolved. Ah! And Iêd just like to point out that even though the sweater was uncomfortable, I didnêt use it as an excuse to antagonize everyone around me."
Howard,"You know, you could reimburse the video store ownerês next of kin."
Leonard,Or itês resolved.
Sheldon,"Hey, that next of kin thing sounds pretty good."
Howard,I believe this is yours.
Raj,"Can I ask you guys a question? So, Iêm seeing Lucy tomorrow night, and Iêve never hung out with someone who broke up with me. How do you do it?"
Howard,"You canêt let her know youêre hurting. You know, the key is confidence."
Raj,Why is the key always confidence? How come itês never love handles and flop sweat?
Bernadette,"If this girl hurt you so much, are you sure you want to see her again?"
Howard,"Well, if I may, he has so little self-respect and is so desperate for the smallest crumb of affection, she could literally sleep with his own father in his own bed and post the video to YouTube, and heêd still buy her flowers and ask her to be his bride."
Raj,"Heês right. But in my defence, if we could survive that, we could survive anything."
Bernadette,"Well, if youêre sure you want to do this, itês only coffee, just relax and see what happens."
Raj,"Well, can I say she looks nice?"
Raj,Can I tell her I miss her?
Bernadette,"Maybe, if she asks."
Raj,"Oh, can I show her an oil painting I made of us surrounded by our children and grandchildren?"
Bernadette,Iêd save that for the second date.
Raj,"Good, good. ‚Cause no matter how hard I try, I cannot get the twins to look alike."
Penny,What are you doing?
Leonard,"Oh, Iêm just trying to find the stupid next of kin to this stupid video store owner so I can return the DVD and see the look on Sheldonês stupid face when he sees that I didnêt let this get to me."
Penny,Sheldonês not here. Why donêt you take the sweater off?
Leonard,Thereês a principle at stake.
Penny,Which is?
Leonard,"Oh, I donêt know. Who cares? Look at me."
Penny,"Oh, my God! Is that sweater made of bees? Come on, take it off. I wonêt tell."
Leonard,"No, no, honey, if I take it off, Sheldon wins."
Penny,"Sweetie, every night you donêt kill him in his sleep, he wins."
Leonard,"No, itês, itês almost done. I just, I have to find the next of kin, and send êem the DVD and then just wait for someone with my complexion to die so I can get a skin graft."
Leonard,What is that? What is that for?
Penny,So you can send it to Princeton and get your money back.
Amy,"I must say, Sheldon, youêre handling this DVD business with an impressive amount of maturity."
Sheldon,I donêt know why that surprises you. Iêm a grown man. As should be evident by this sport coat and very real flower in my lapel.
Amy,Is there some kind of new coping mechanism youêre employing?
Sheldon,"The more interesting question you should be asking is, what does this flower smell like?"
Amy,Iêm gonna go with sad. So whatês the story with you and this DVD?
Sheldon,"Thereês nothing to tell. Maybe I purchased a book entitled Donêt Sweat the Small Stuff and I followed its wise suggestions, one of which was stop and smell the flowers."
Sheldon,"Please. Ha-ha, Oh."
Raj,"Hello. Oh, itês so good to see you."
Raj,"Please, sit. I, uh, I got you a cappuccino. I remembered it was your favourite. I also got crumb cake, but I remembered it was my favourite and I ate it. Anyway, uh, how are you?"
Raj,"Well, and I ate all the crumb cake. We both made mistakes."
Raj,"Iêm so happy you asked me here, and I hope we can hang out again sometime. You know, as friends, lovemaking partners, whatever."
Raj,"I think I know the answer to this, but just to be clear, itês not me, right?"
Raj,"This is all your fault, I shouldêve listened to Mun-Mun because Iêve been playing with a cobra and her name is Penny. Why are you so cruel? Do you enjoy my pain?"
Penny,Thereês a girl at the Cheesecake Factory I can set you up with.
Raj,"I love you, Penny."
Sheldon,How is it I can conceptualize a methodology of examining dark matter in the universe but canêt figure out how to fix a novelty squirt flower?
Amy,"I think the real question is, why do you waste your time with cheap, childish pranks?"
Sheldon,Thereês probably a deep reason. Which Iêd be happy to discuss with you over some peanut brittle in a can.
Leonard,"Okay, Sheldon, I am out of options. Video store owner, Nursis Manookian, has no next of kin."
Sheldon,"Well, you seem hot under the collar, or is that the sweater?"
Leonard,"Oh, oh, no, no. Itês because I spent all afternoon at the Armenian church where his funeral mass was held. According to Father Solakian, no one attended. Luckily, my trip wasnêt a complete waste. I lit a candle and prayed for your death but Iêm not Armenian, so it probably wonêt work. This is over, right?"
Sheldon,"Oh, not necessarily. I suggest you look for long-lost relatives either in Armenia or Lebanon."
Leonard,"Listen to me, Sheldon. I am not going to Lebanon to return Super Mario Brothers the movie."
Sheldon,"You know, it might be fun. You love hummus."
Leonard,Why isnêt this bothering you? Isnêt your brain getting itchy? This is on your card. This could be ruining your credit score. Why isnêt this making you crazy?
Sheldon,"Leonard, I have something to tell you, but I want you to promise not to flip out."
Sheldon,"Seven years ago, I found out the DVD was late and I paid for it."
Sheldon,"I was going to mention it at the time, but then I thought, some day, this might be a teachable moment."
Leonard,"Aaaah! I, you, how can, what!"
Amy,"Sheldon, that was diabolical."
Sheldon,I know. And it wasnêt easy. Do you have any idea what itês like to wait for years and never know if youêre going to finally get satisfaction?
Raj,Wow. Youêre even prettier than Penny said. I canêt believe a girl like you doesnêt have a boyfriend.
Raj,"I donêt believe you, youêre lying to me. "
Raj,"Oh, itês okay. I have no morals and Iêm desperately lonely. Iêll be the other man if you want a little something-something on the side."
Penny,What is wrong with you?
Raj,What is wrong with you?
Leonard,The math is all there. Itês not real.
Penny,"Yes, it is."
Sheldon,"Yeah,uh, look, it is scientifically impossible for a person to tip a cow. Even you, with your stocky build and lumberjack shoulders, you couldnêt do it."
Raj,Itês horrible. Why would you push a cow over? Theyêre sacred.
Penny,"Oh, stop it. Iêve seen you eat, like, a million hamburgers."
Raj,"Hey, an animal can be both sacred and delicious."
Penny,"Look, Iêm telling you Iêve done it, okay? I clearly remember the cow standing up and then the cow on its side."
Leonard,Were you drunk?
Penny,I was 16 in Nebraska. What do you think?
Leonard,I think youêre the one who fell over.
Penny,That would explain why the sky was also on its side.
Penny,Howard. Cow tipping. Real or not?
Howard,"Mmm. Iêm gonna say not. Thatês just based on me trying to roll my mom over when sheês snoring. Speaking of that big side of beef, uh, sheês invited all of you to Thanksgiving at her house."
Sheldon,"Mmm. You know, Iêve been told that a bald refusal of an invitation is rude and one must instead offer up a polite excuse, so Iêd love to go, but, unfortunately, that sounds awful."
Howard,"Come on, itêll be fun."
Penny,"Uh, we were actually gonna do it here."
Howard,"Please? Bernadetteês bringing her dad êcause her momês out of town, and I never have anything to say to that guy."
Sheldon,"Oh, since you put it that way, Iêd love to go, but that sounds even more awful."
Leonard,Itêd actually be nice to not hear Sheldon complain about my cooking all day.
Sheldon,"Uh, excuse me, but every year you prepare a terrible meal and every year I criticize it. Do our traditions mean nothing to you?"
Leonard,I want to go.
Penny,"Yeah, me, too."
Raj,Iêm in.
Sheldon,"Ugh, fine, Iêll go. But if her food is delicious, Thanksgiving is ruined, and itês on you."
Sheldon,Do we really have to go to Mrs. Wolowitzês house?
Amy,We do. And I expect you to be on your best behaviour.
Sheldon,Now I know how the African slaves felt. Being dragged from their homes to labour under the yoke of the white man.
Amy,Are you honestly comparing Thanksgiving dinner at Wolowitzês momês with one of the greatest tragedies in the history of mankind?
Penny,"Sheldon, you can have a nice Thanksgiving anywhere. I spent one in Vegas."
Leonard,You did?
Penny,"Yeah, back when I was dating Zack. It was actually more fun than I thought. We gambled, we went to one of those cheesy wedding chapels, we had a really good turkey dinner. Which was surprising, since we were at a strip club."
Leonard,"Wait, you went to a chapel?"
Penny,We had one of those silly fake weddings.
Leonard,"Penny, you know those are real, right?"
Penny,"No, theyêre not."
Leonard,"Yeah, they are."
Penny,"No, theyêre not."
Leonard,"Yeah, they are."
Sheldon,Heês right.
Amy,Theyêre real.
Penny,But it didnêt seem real.
Sheldon,"Let me ask you a question. At any point, was Las Vegas on its side?"
Bernadette,"Hi, Dad."
Bernadette,"Oh, you brought beer for everybody."
Bernadette,You can have a quiet day and watch the game here.
Howard,"Oh, her goutês flaring up. Turns out an apple pie a day does not keep the doctor away."
Howard,"Maybe because that little piggy is being crushed by the barn. She should quiet down soon. I gave her enough pain meds to choke a, well, her."
Bernadette,I guess weêre gonna have to do all the cooking.
Howard,I have a better idea.
Bernadette,"If you think youêre gonna make me do all this by myself, youêre crazy."
Howard,I was gonna make Raj do it all by himself.
Bernadette,"Oh, well, thatês a great idea."
Amy,"No traffic, weêre sailing."
Sheldon,Yes. Like weêre on a ship. Coming from Africa to America.
Amy,"Sheldon, thatês completely inappropriate. You canêt keep comparing yourself to a slave."
Sheldon,"Yes, Miss Amy."
Leonard,I canêt believe youêre married to that idiot.
Penny,"Ugh, would you stop? We just did it as a goof."
Leonard,"Well, a goof or not, youêre actually married. You need to get this taken care of."
Penny,I will. Why are you making this such a big deal?
Sheldon,"Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason. It could be because you said yes to marrying Zack, but every time Leonardês proposed, heês gotten a resounding no. Yeah, thatês just off the top of my head."
Penny,So how do I undo this?
Leonard,Iêm hoping you can get an annulment. Itês just like it never happened.
Penny,"Great, well, what do I have to do?"
Amy,It says here you can get an annulment if any of the following conditions are met. Were you unable to consummate the marriage?
Sheldon,Hah!Penny? Next.
Amy,"Is there any evidence of fraud, bigamy, want of understanding?"
Penny,Want of understanding? What does that even mean?
Amy,"Ding, ding, ding. We have a winner."
Bernadette,Thanks for saving the day.
Raj,"Ah, no problem. It wouldnêt be Thanksgiving without an Indian providing the food. Uh, now, where does your mom keep the Crisco?"
Howard,"Um, I donêt know. Probably in a wad in her cheek."
Bernadette,Iêll help Raj in here. Why donêt you go keep my dad company?
Howard,He doesnêt want me in there. Iêm the creepy little guy who has sex with his daughter.
Bernadette,"Donêt be silly, he loves you."
Howard,Does he?
Bernadette,"Okay, he cares about you a lot."
Bernadette,I do crap for you all the time. Get out there.
Howard,So your wifeês in Arizona with the grandkids?
Howard,"You know, my momês been to Arizona. She rode one of those mules down in the Grand Canyon. Long story short, they had to shoot it. ‚Cause sheês so fat. Iêll get the door while you finish laughing. Hey, guys."
Amy,Happy Thanksgiving.
Sheldon,"It smells wonderful. Is anyone slaving away in the kitchen? Because I, too, knowÑ"
Penny,Here. Thank you for having us.
Howard,Whatês with you?
Leonard,"Oh, sheês mad at me because she just found out sheês married to Zack."
Howard,Really? That dumb-ass she used to date? Thatês hysterical.
Penny,I canêt believe I felt bad for opening this in the car.
Amy,You need any help?
Raj,"Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach that, uh, gravy boat up there?"
Amy,"Uh, sure."
Raj,"Great. That makes one of you. Okay, we have a lot to do and not much time to do it. Bernadette, youêre on corn, gravy and yam detail. Amy, youêre on rolls, cranberries and making sure Bernadette stays away from the marshmallows. Thatês right, I see you. Okay, if you have any questions, Iêll be over here basting my ass off. Focus is key."
Amy,Did you guys know Penny married Zack three years ago?
Howard,You ever play football?
Howard,But I did get tackled in the hallway once. The whole school cheered.
Leonard,"Okay, I found the, uh, court papers that you and Zack need to fill out. Iêll print them when we get home."
Leonard,And we can just put this whole thing behind us.
Penny,Are you done?
Penny,"Look, I get it, I screwed up. Is this all weêre gonna talk about the rest of the day?"
Leonard,Why are you mad at me? Youêre the one that did the stupid thing. Iêm just trying to fix it.
Penny,"Ugh, I need some air."
Leonard,"Wuh, Penny."
Sheldon,"I donêt know the first thing about women, but I would not follow her."
Leonard,How am I the bad guy? Sheês the one who married someone else. Iêm the victim.
Howard,Sounds like Zackês the victim. Youêre sleeping with his wife.
Sheldon,They passed against a nickel defence. They should have run it off-tackle.
Sheldon,My father loved football. He always made me watch it before I was allowed to do my homework.
Penny,"Well, youêll be happy to know I just spoke to Zack and heês willing to sign the court papers. Heês on his way here now."
Leonard,"Wait, you invited him here?"
Leonard,Come on.
Sheldon,"I would throw a quick slant to a wideout, given that the defence is showing blitz."
Howard,"Oh, I love a good blitz, especially with sour cream. Get it? ‚Cause it sounds like blintz."
Leonard,I just donêt understand why you invited him here today.
Penny,"Because you wouldnêt shut up about it. When I called him, he had nothing to do, so I just thought it wouldÑ"
Raj,"Hey, guys, Iêm trying to cook in here."
Penny,"Oh, sorry. Weêll keep it down."
Raj,"No, no, speak up. Iêm about to use the blender, and I donêt want to miss anything."
Leonard,"Well, you might have to cook for one more because she invited Zack."
Raj,"My, my. The plot, like my gravy, thickens."
Sheldon,I donêt care for your motherês bathroom. Thereês not an angle to do oneês business without a clown figurine staring at you.
Howard,Thatês why I sit.
Sheldon,1993. Leon Lett blew the game in the final seconds and the Dolphins emerged victorious. Then I finally got to do my calculus.
Sheldon,So was my dad. And then he did.
Howard,Anyone need a beer?
Howard,Thank God.
Sheldon,He died when I was 14.
Sheldon,So was the man who owned the local liquor store. He cried and cried.
Howard,Here you go.
Sheldon,"No, sir. He did try to give me one for my high school graduation, but I was 11 and my mom said no."
Sheldon,All right.
Howard,"I never had a beer with my dad, either."
Sheldon,Do you mind? Weêre having a moment here.
Amy,I canêt believe Pennyês married to Zack.
Raj,Wonder what she saw in that guy.
Bernadette,"I donêt know. Heês sweet, heês tall, handsome. "
Amy,"Broad shoulders, good hair."
Raj,Hmm. Wonder what she sees in Leonard.
Bernadette,Howês it going out there?
Howard,Sheldon and your dad are bonding and completely ignoring me.
Amy,I know how you feel. Sheldon ignored me for a week when he got that Roomba vacuum. I kick it when heês not looking.
Bernadette,What are they doing?
Howard,Theyêre drinking beer and watching football. 
Bernadette,So why donêt you do that with them?
Howard,They donêt want me.
Bernadette,What do you mean?
Howard,"Well, Sheldon started talking about how his dad isnêt alive any more, and they were toasting, and I tried to tell them about how sad I was when my dad abandonedÑ"
Amy,Zackês here!
Raj,Stir the gravy. 
Bernadette,"Sorry. I really want to hear how sad you are. Iêll be back in like five, ten minutes."
Leonard,Sorry she made you come over here on a holiday.
Penny,"Yeah, okay, great. Can we just get this over with?"
Leonard,"Yeah, uh, you guys have to sign here and here. On Monday, weêll file for the annulment, and this marriage will be over."
Leonard,Why wonêt you sign it?
Penny,We donêt have any kids.
Penny,"Okay, look, Zack, come on. You know neither of us thought this was real. I mean, we were married by an Elvis impersonator."
Leonard,You married him instead of me? Good call. Sign the papers.
Penny,"Hang on. You know what? You have been a jerk about this all day. You always do this, whenever I mess up, youêre right there to make me feel even worse about it."
Leonard,That is not true.
Penny,"Yeah, we couldêve waited till Monday, signed the papers, this all would have been over."
Leonard,Youêre the one who invited him here.
Penny,"Oh, there you go again, just another mistake youêre throwing in my face."
Leonard,"Yeah, well, sheês not gonna be your wife for long."
Penny,Iêm about to. Sign the paper.
Sheldon,"All I know is you can only fit one of her in a car. And thereês the clown that came out of her. I really didnêt want to come here, but this is shaping up to be one of the best Thanksgivings Iêve had in a long time."
Bernadette,"Hey. Howie says youêve been making fun of him all day. Now, both of you apologize right now."
Sheldon,Sheês so tiny. Itês funny when sheês mad.
Amy,"All right, mister, I think you owe Howard and Bernadette an apology."
Sheldon,"Perhaps youêre right. Iêm sorry for my behaviour. Iêve had alcohol, and itês caused me to be inappropriate."
Bernadette,Itês okay.
Howard,Donêt worry about it.
Amy,Thank you.
Sheldon,Ainêt she great? 
Sheldon,"Now, howês about you get us a couple of beers?"
Bernadette,Thanks again for cooking.
Amy,"Yeah, everything was delicious."
Raj,"Well, I couldnêt have done it without my two favourite girls. Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray."
Sheldon,This is a Jewish house. I donêt think they have pigskin.
Penny,"Hey, Iêm sorry about today. And I promise, next time I get married, it wonêt be a joke. Itêll be for love. Or money."
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, too."
Howard,"Mike, thatês the nicest thing youêve ever said to me."
Sheldon,I just vomited on a lot of clowns.
Sheldon,"Thank you. Uh, the university made me come here. I didnêt want to. Uh, big fan of the show."
Sheldon,Who? Give me their names. I bet itês Wolowitz.
Sheldon,Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?
Sheldon,"Yes, yes, Iêd be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry. Everyone laugh at the circus freak. You know, I donêt need to sit here and take this, Flatow. It is because of bullies like you, every day more and more Americans are making the switch to television."
Sheldon,"President Seibert, I donêt know why youêre yelling. Youêre the one who made me go on the radio. I was expecting a professional science interview, not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock. Well, if the university needs money so badly, perhaps you should start a swear jar. Whoa, that oneês worth a dollar."
Amy,"I know you donêt like it, but every time you do an interview, it raises the profile of the university. That translates to funding."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, Iêm not just some trained monkey dancing for coins."
Leonard,Of course youêre not. People love trained monkeys.
Penny,"How can you not be happy? Youêre tall, thin and famous. Oh, my God, Iêm jealous of Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Look, youêre gonna be doing this stuff for a while. Youêre just gonna have to find a way to get used to it."
Sheldon,But none of you know what this is like. Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.
Penny,"Mmm, you clearly havenêt been with me at Mardi Gras."
Bernadette,Want to pause the video game and help me clean up?
Howard,I am cleaning up. Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City.
Bernadette,"Come on, itês your friend whoês coming to stay here."
Howard,"Raj grew up in India. Trust me, heês seen worse."
Bernadette,Howie. 
Howard,I promise Iêll help out the rest of the week.
Bernadette,The rest of the week? You said it was just gonna be a night or two.
Howard,"Yeah, but if I told you a week, would you have said yes?"
Howard,Then you left me no choice.
Bernadette,"I love Raj, but thatês a long time for a house guest."
Howard,"I know, but theyêre tenting his building. He canêt find a hotel he likes that allows dogs."
Bernadette,Heês bringing Cinnamon?
Howard,"For a whole week, the nerve of some people."
Sheldon,"Here comes the Embarrassment Express. With stops at Fraudville, Wonder Blunderberg, and Kansas City. Because itês a hub."
Amy,"Sheldon, can I come in?"
Sheldon,Do you have cookies?
Sheldon,Good. I donêt deserve cookies. Come in. Wil?
Sheldon,Why are you here?
Sheldon,"Certainly. Although, right now, Iêm having a rough time because thereês three people in my room, and itês starting to feel like a discotheque."
Amy,"Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wished you never did."
Sheldon,"Oh, nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad."
Sheldon,How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. Who couldnêt relate to that?
Sheldon,"That just happened to me. Next time youêre stuck for a tweet, feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is."
Amy,"Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things."
Amy,"Uh, weêre trying to cheer him up, soÑ "
Sheldon,I do see what youêre saying. That helps.
Sheldon,Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?
Sheldon,"Oh, great, now, I work the controls, I say all aboard. You sit quietly and watch."
Sheldon,You should probably go.
Howard,Youêre gonna brush your teeth on my couch?
Raj,"No, Iêm gonna brush Cinnamonês teeth."
Howard,Why bother? She spends half the time licking her butt.
Raj,And the other half licking my face. Thatês why Iêm brushing her teeth.
Bernadette,"Hey, guys. Sorry Iêm so late. Did you already have dinner?"
Howard,"No, we were waiting for you."
Bernadette,"Aw, thatês so sweet."
Howard,Yeah. So what do you feel like making?
Raj,"Howard, the poor thing just got home from work. Let me get you a glass of wine. Iêll cook dinner."
Bernadette,"Oh, Raj, youêre our guest."
Raj,Donêt be silly. Sit. You look like youêve had a long day.
Howard,"No, she always looks like that. Because she married an idiot."
Bernadette,"Thank you, Raj."
Raj,"Please, this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here. Now, tell us all about your day."
Bernadette,"Okay, um, well, first, I was late to a meeting êcause I was stuck in traffic."
Howard,"Well, I keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone."
Raj,"Hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans, did I tell you how to fix it? I said, aw, that must hurt, and I rubbed your belly."
Howard,I thought of you the whole time.
Raj,All Iêm saying is thereês a time to just listen. 
Bernadette,Thank you.
Raj,Thereês also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. And itês when youêre ten.
Sheldon,"Hello, President Siebert. Thank you for taking my call. I just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery. Oh, no, no, no, no. No need to thank mNo, thank my friend, Wil Wheaton. For your information, I have nine friends, hmm? Ten if we include you. Nine it is. Ah, itês ten. Iêll count Wolowitz. Hello, friend Leonard."
Leonard,"Hey, youêre in a good mood."
Sheldon,Iêm in a great mood.
Leonard,"Well, youêre about to be in an even better one. I didnêt want to say anything until I knew for sure, but, Iêve been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist."
Sheldon,"Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team? They found it."
Leonard,"Yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. They faked the results."
Leonard,Yes. Do you know what that means? That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.
Sheldon,So no more interviews?
Leonard,"No, itês all over."
Sheldon,I canêt believe it.
Leonard,"Well, youêre welcome."
Sheldon,You robbed me of my greatest achievement.
Sheldon,"Iêm back down to nine friends. Make it eight, Iêm sick of Wolowitz, too."
Leonard,"I, I donêt understand. All youêve done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. I was trying to make you happy."
Sheldon,"By taking away my only claim to fame? Well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends."
Leonard,"Oh, there is no winning with you. And koalas and otters donêt even live near each other."
Sheldon,"Thatês what makes their friendship unlikely,"
Penny,"Hey, whatês with all the yelling?"
Sheldon,Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away.
Penny,"Oh, thatês great. You must be thrilled, "
Sheldon,"Thatês it, Iêm down to seven friends."
Penny,"Heês counting hobbits and superheroes, right?"
Sheldon,"When I thought the element was real, I didnêt want it. But now that Leonard made it not exist, I want it more than anything in the world."
Leonard,"The, the element never existed. I didnêt take it away, science took it away. Be mad at science."
Sheldon,"Donêt you dare use science against me. Science is my best friend. Oh, good, Iêm back up to eight."
Leonard,Will you tell him heês out of his mind.
Penny,"Actually, I get what heês saying."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, nine. Welcome back, buddy."
Penny,"Itês like if youêre dating someone youêre not that into, and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever."
Sheldon,"I have no idea what sheês talking about, but weêre ganging up on you so I agree."
Leonard,"Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? If I donêt publish it, itês just a matter of time before someone else does."
Sheldon,"No, no, of course you have to publish. Thatês your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice."
Leonard,"Fine, Iêll publish."
Sheldon,Can you believe this guy?
Bernadette,Aw! Raj did the dishes.
Howard,How do you know I didnêt do them?
Bernadette,"Because once, when all the knives were dirty, you cut a bagel with your keys."
Raj,"Good morning, everybody. I picked up coffee while I was out. Bernadette, hereês your soy peppermint mocha."
Bernadette,"Aw, you didnêt have to do that."
Raj,"Oh, my pleasure, and donêt worry about your presentation today. Youêre gonna be great."
Howard,"Yeah, youêre gonna knock it out of the park."
Bernadette,What presentation do I have today?
Howard,Just go.
Raj,He loves you.
Howard,What are you doing? Are you trying to make me look bad?
Raj,Iêm just being a good house guest.
Howard,"No, youêre being a better husband than I am. Doing the dishes, getting coffee, knowing about her life, who does that?"
Raj,"Oh, come on, I brought you one, too."
Howard,I donêt want coffee.
Raj,Thatês why I got you hot chocolate.
Howard,Give me that. Just stop showing me up.
Raj,"Howard, listen to me. Youêre a great husband. Yes, your listening skills could use some work. But itês amazing how far youêve come given that youêre an only child raised by an over-protective mom."
Howard,"Um, is this getting weird?"
Raj,Hang on.
Howard,"So, yes."
Leonard,"Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I, I posted my findings."
Sheldon,I saw. And I just posted a retraction of my paper. Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.
Leonard,"These things happen all the time, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.
Leonard,"Come on, donêt give him a hard time."
Leonard,Itês not a big deal.
Leonard,"Okay, Barry, thatês enough."
Sheldon,"No, no, no, thatês okay. I can fight my own battles. Isnêt that right, Bawwy."
Sheldon,"Youêre right, That was uncalled for. I take it back."
Bernadette,"Raj, this dinner was amazing. If youêre here much longer, Iêm gonna have to buy bigger clothes."
Raj,Nonsense. You need a little fattening up. Youêve been looking too skinny lately.
Bernadette,"Aw. Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?"
Howard,"What are you talking about? Remember last week, when I asked you if you were wearing Spanx and you werenêt? Howês that different?"
Bernadette,"Maybe you could try being more thoughtful, like your friend Raj."
Howard,"Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj. "
Bernadette,"Oh, really?"
Howard,"Yeah, yeah. He packed me a lunch this morning. And there was a note inside that said go get êem."
Bernadette,"Like I donêt do enough around here. Now I need to pack your lunch? And by the way, why do you need a note telling you to go get êem? Youêre a grown man, you should know to go get êem."
Howard,"I do know to go get êem, but sometimes itês nice to have emotional support when Iêm going and getting them."
Raj,"Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves? Letês just, you know, all calm down and take a step back."
Bernadette,This is stupid. Why are we fighting?
Howard,I donêt know. I guess I was just feeling like Iêm a lousy husband.
Bernadette,Youêre not a lousy husband. Youêre a great husband. I was the one feeling like a lousy wife.
Howard,Are you kidding? Youêre the best. I know what the problem is. Itês him.
Raj,"Oh, what did I do?"
Howard,You made us feel like weêre not trying hard enough.
Bernadette,"Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage till you showed up."
Raj,"Look, Iêm sorry youêre upset with me, but I just have to say itês nice to see the two of you on the same page."
Howard,"Oh, it does feel good to have you backing me up for once."
Bernadette,I back you up all the time.
Howard,That is notÑ heês doing it again. 
Bernadette,What is wrong with you?
Leonard,I canêt believe they kicked you out. 
Raj,"I canêt believe theyêre still married. Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamonês toothbrush at Howardês. I guess youêre sharing with Daddy again. "
Penny,Bark once if you need me to call PETA.
Sheldon,Whatês that animal doing in our apartment?
Leonard,"Oh, relax, sheês in her crate. She canêt get out."
Sheldon,"I have two words for you, Jurassic Park. This day just keeps getting worse and worse."
Penny,"You know, if it makes you feel any betterÑ"
Sheldon,It probably wonêt.
Penny,Youêre probably right.
Amy,"Sheldon, itês a beautiful night. Why donêt you and I go for a nice walk together?"
Sheldon,"Oh, everything is just sex with you isnêt it?"
Raj,"Sheldon, I think you might find the support youêre looking for if you realize that relationships are a give and take. She can only be there for you as much as you are for her."
Amy,"Thank you, Rajesh."
Raj,"And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon, instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms."
Amy,You should probably go.
Sheldon,"Thank you. Ira, if I may, Iêd like to apologize for my behaviour last week."
Sheldon,"Now, isnêt there something youêd like to say to me?"
Sheldon,I believe I can answer that.
Leonard,He asked me.
Leonard,As I was sayingÑ
Sheldon,"Youêre telling it wrong. Ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. A small town in East Texas, where a young genius namedÑ"
Sheldon,"Thatês right, Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbourês dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. Which, sadly, he couldnêt build because Santa wouldnêt bring him enriched uranium."
Sheldon,What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?
Leonard,"Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me."
Sheldon,"Well, that seems like a snooze. Even for public radio."
Penny,"You know, if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game."
Amy,"A little early for alcohol, isnêt it?"
Sheldon,"You know, I donêt just say smart things about science. I also yodel. "
Amy,Iêll get the vodka.
Penny,"Wow, youêre really good at this."
Amy,"Well, I have an extremely low centre of gravity. Iêm like a pyramid."
Penny,How you doing over there?
Leonard,"Oh, I hope itês just a sprain. I cannot walk into that E.R. with another video game injury."
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon, you want to play next?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I would, but Iêm on my way out."
Amy,Right now? Why?
Leonard,Is someone sick?
Sheldon,Yes. My sisterês uterus came down with a baby.
Penny,"Oh, sheês pregnant? Thatês great. Youêre gone an uncle. Uncle Sheldon."
Sheldon,"No, I will be Uncle Dr. Cooper."
Amy,How come you never said she was pregnant?
Sheldon,"Well, I never told you about my brotherês kidney stone. You want to hear about everything that comes out of my familyês genitals?"
Leonard,"Well, congrats, and itês nice youêre gonna be there for your sister."
Sheldon,Yes. Iêm filling in for her husband whoês recovering from a horrible motorcycle accident. Lucky duck.
Penny,"Wow, so, how long will you be gone?"
Sheldon,"Well, sheês due tomorrow. Although it did take her six years to finish high school, so who knows?"
Amy,Can I give you a ride to the airport?
Sheldon,"Oh, no, thank you, I donêt want to be an inconvenience. Chop-chop, Leonard. We leave in ten minutes."
Leonard,"All right, hereês the deal. Sheldon is gone, so the tree decorating rules are out the window."
Penny,"Yeah, which means we donêt have to use his ridiculous ornament-spacing template."
Leonard,And Iêm happy to report its kickstarter campaign is holding strong at zero dollars.
Raj,"Wait, so Star Wars and Star Trek characters can go on the same branch?"
Leonard,"I know, itês crazy. Welcome to the Thunderdome, people. "
Howard,Iêve never done this before. Itês kind of fun.
Raj,"Yeah, if your mom could see her little Bar Mitzvah boy right now, sheêd have a heart attack."
Bernadette,"Good idea, Iêll take a picture."
Penny,"Honey, Iêm a little strapped for cash this year, so for Christmas I was thinking of giving you this."
Leonard,I love it.
Leonard,But it is what you got me last year.
Leonard,And last night.
Amy,"Oh, itês probably Sheldon. Hi, Sheldon. Everybodyês here, say hi."
Leonard,"Hey, buddy."
Sheldon,The second I go out of town you throw a Christmas party without me? 
Amy,"Yeah, kinda."
Sheldon,Thatês so thoughtful. You guys are the best.
Penny,"Hey, howês your sister?"
Sheldon,<i>She went into labor an hour ago.
Amy,Thatês wonderful. So youêre at the hospital?
Sheldon,"No, she chose to have a home birth because she wants to live in the Stone Age and a cave wasnêt available."
Raj,"You know, many people believe that home births are better because the mother is in a warm, comfortable environment where she can be nurtured by loved ones."
Sheldon,And turn the bedroom floor into an amniotic Slip ‚n Slide.
Sheldon,"Oh, boy. I picked the wrong day to wear my good robot T-shirt."
Raj,If you were having Sheldonês baby would you really want him in the room?
Penny,"Yeah, if heês in the room when theyêre making the baby, Iêll give you ten dollars."
Bernadette,"Hey, I brought over Itês a Wonderful Life if you guys want to watch it later."
Amy,"Oh, I love that movie."
Raj,Iêve never seen it.
Amy,Itês great. Itês Christmastime and Jimmy Stewartês really depressed and heês gonna jump off a bridge and kill himself.
Bernadette,But then he gets to see what the world would be like if heêd never been born.
Penny,"Hey, you ever imagine what that would be like? Not being born?"
Leonard, What do you think?
Amy,"You make jokes about Sheldon, but if it werenêt for him, I donêt think any of us would be sitting in this room right now."
Howard,Really? Sheldon not being here is the main reason Iêm in this room.
Amy,Itês true. None of you would know me. You wouldnêt know Bernadette. You wouldnêt be dating Penny.
Leonard,You donêt know that. Iêve been going to the Cheesecake Factory for years. I could have picked her up.  
Penny,"Oh, you werenêt joking."
Penny,"Okay, sweetie, let me tell you exactly how that would have gone down."
Leonard,Iêm gonna do it. Iêm gonna ask her out.
Howard,"Iêm gonna squirt chocolate milk out of my nipples. Sorry, I thought weêre saying things that are never gonna happen."
Raj,Maybe this time heês going to do it.
Howard,"Hope youêre thirsty, here it comes."
Leonard,Watch me.
Penny,"Hey, you guys ready to order or you need a few minutes?"
Leonard,"I, uh, ah, um, IÑ"
Penny,A few minutes it is.
Raj,"You didnêt ask her out, but that was a lot of sounds."
Leonard,You guys are making me nervous.
Howard,"Fine, then go talk to her on your own."
Leonard,I will. Excuse me.
Leonard,"Hi, uh, um, Iêm Leonard?"
Penny,Really? You donêt sound so sure.
Leonard,"No, I am he. Uh, any, anyway, um, thereês been something Iêve wanted to ask you for a long time. Um."
Penny,Whatês that?
Leonard,"Eh, uh, well, I was wondering, if youêre not too busy, um, uh, if, if youêd be interested in telling me where the restroom is?"
Penny,I think youêre too late.
Leonard,"Come on, I would not have peed my pants."
Howard,She nailed it.
Raj,Sounds about right.
Leonard,"But, you forget, I did ask you out in real life."
Amy,"Which couldnêt have happened if you didnêt live across the hall from her, which couldnêt have happened without Sheldon. Same goes with you guys. If Leonard wasnêt with Penny, she never would have set you up."
Howard,"Doesnêt matter. Bernadette still wouldêve been working at The Cheesecake Factory, and I still wouldêve been working this beefcake factory. You wouldêve been all over me."
Bernadette,"Hey, Penny, can I take that table?"
Penny,"Sure, why?"
Bernadette,The one in the turtleneck is cute.
Raj,"Open wide, here comes the happy train."
Howard,"Mm-hmm, chug-a-chug-a, yum, yum."
Raj,"Oh. Hang on. You got a, you got a little something. Ah."
Bernadette,Never mind.
Raj,"Oh, man, that is so us."
Leonard,"You know, maybe you and I wouldnêt be together, but you wouldnêt have done so great yourself."
Leonard,Because I know exactly the kind of guy you wouldêve ended up with.
Penny,Hey. Did you remember to pay the rent?
Penny,"Hey, he may be an idiot, but at least he didnêt pee himself."
Leonard,"Oh, hold on."
Penny,"Me, too."
Leonard,The end.
Amy,"Hi, Sheldon. Everything okay?"
Sheldon,"No, itês not. Iêve seen things. Lady things."
Amy,Listen to me. That is not the way they usually look.
Sheldon,Doesnêt matter. This is no way to make new humans. People coming out of people. Itês some kind of dirty magic show.
Sheldon,Did you hear that? A mop. I have two PhDs yet somehow Iêm the janitor of my sisterês birth canal.
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon sent us all an e-mail. Happy holidays from Texas. And thereês pictures. Aah! Donêt open them. Do not open them."
Penny,"Oh, come on. Childbirth is a natural, beautiful, uuurgh, itês like someone sawed a cow in half."
Raj,"My fatherês a gynaecologist, I think I can handle it. And, now, Iêm gay."
Bernadette,"You know, I was thinking. Without Sheldon, most of us would have never met, but Penny would still live across from him. "
Amy,"And with Leonard out of the picture, we all know what that would mean."
Penny,We do?
Penny,"Hey, Sheldon."
Penny,Doing laundry?
Sheldon,"Of course Iêm doing laundry. Saturday night is laundry night, and Iêm in a laundry room, so, I believe your inference is justified."
Penny,"Oh, my inference is justified. Sheldon, you are so funny. Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too, because these clothes are so dirty. Almost as dirty as the dirty girl whoês wearing them."
Penny,"Okay, thatês enough."
Raj,Keep going. 
Penny,"So, what do you think?"
Sheldon,"A tad asymmetrical, but nothing to be concerned about."
Penny,"Please, Sheldon. I need you."
Sheldon,To what?
Penny,To take me.
Sheldon,Iêm not taking you anywhere till you put on a shirt.
Penny,"Come on, Sheldon. You and me right here."
Sheldon,"Penny, for the thousandth time, Iêm saving myself for someone special. Perhaps a cute bespectacled neuroscientist with hair the color of mud. "
Penny,I think I know how to change your mind.
Leonard,Thatês enough.
Amy,"Howês it going, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,"Actually, much better."
Leonard,"Oh, good. Is the baby born yet?"
Sheldon,I donêt know. I just got back. 
Amy,Whereêd you go?
Sheldon,"My mother asked me to get some towels. I took advantage of the vague request and went to Bed, Bath & Beyond.  Excuse me, Iêm on the phone. So rude."
Amy,"Hereês another one. Penny, if it werenêt for Sheldon you never would have met comic book legend Stan Lee."
Raj,"At least Leonard, Howard and I would have always been friends."
Bernadette,"Hey, how come you three never got an apartment together?"
Leonard,"We talked about it, but Howard was in a pretty serious relationship with his mom."
Howard,I lived with her to save money.
Raj,"Yeah, you didnêt have to buy groceries êcause you were breast-feeding."
Bernadette,"Aw, so I guess if it werenêt for me, youêd still be living with her, huh?"
Howard,Not exactly.
Penny,"What do you mean, not exactly?"
Howard,"Well, things would be a little different."
Howard,I know youêre starving. The neighbours know youêre starving. Thereês starving people in Africa who know youêre starving.
Bernadette,How is this any different?
Howard,"You didnêt let me finish. Here you go, Mother."
Amy,"Wait, did she die or did you kill her?"
Howard,"Eh, tomato, tomahto. The important thing is sheês dead."
Bernadette,"Hey, so how come you two didnêt move in together?"
Leonard,"Oh, this guy wanted a place of his own because he was sure he was gonna be a ladiesê man."
Raj,"Yeah, I was wrong. But I do think you and I would have had a great time."
Raj,"Come on, Leonard, dinner."
Leonard,Hang on. Why would I be fat?
Raj,"Youêd have no girlfriend to see you naked, youêd try to fill the void with food, and Iêm an enabler who once deep-fried a pancake."
Leonard,"Why canêt you be fat, too?"
Leonard,What do you want to do for dessert?
Raj,I think thereês still half a cake from breakfast.
Leonard,"No, thereês not."
Raj,What are you doing?
Raj,"Yeah, but why are you fat?"
Penny,"Amy, what about you? What do you think youêd be doing if you never met Sheldon?"
Amy,"Itês hard to say, my life would be so different."
Howard,You can say better. Sheldon canêt hear you.
Amy,I donêt know.
Amy,"Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me, thereês tears in the frosting, happy birthday to me. "
Amy,"Howês it going, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,Thatês it. The babyês here. Itês a boy.
Sheldon,"Oh, thank you. I wasnêt sure I was gonna to make it. But my mother gave me some ice chips, my sister told me to breathe, and I just thought to myself, Sheldon, if you can make it through the Green Lantern movie, you can make it through this."
Leonard,"Well, good for you, buddy. Weêll let you get back in there."
Sheldon,"Oh no, no, Iêm not going back in there. That baby is so irritating. He has literally been crying his entire life."
Howard,"Aw, heês already taking after Uncle Shelly."
Amy,"Come on, Sheldon, you should go."
Amy,"Well, you always complain that you never had an intelligent role model growing up, and now you can be one for your nephew."
Sheldon,"Ugh, all right, Iêll go. But from what Iêve seen, his attention span is as limited as his bladder control."
Bernadette,You actually got him to do it.
Raj,"Yeah, you keep saying how much Sheldon has affected all of us, but youêve clearly had an impact on him."
Amy,"If that were true, I wouldnêt still be living alone. Well, not exactly alone. I do have a 50 pound sack of rice with one of Sheldonês T-shirts on it."
Leonard,"Iêm telling you, Sheldon cares for you more than you think."
Amy,I wish I could believe you. I also wish there wasnêt a mouse living in Rice Sheldon.
Leonard,"Hang on, Iêm gonna give you a little early Christmas present. Iêm gonna show you something, but if you ever told Sheldon heêd probably never speak to me again. So, if you want to tell him, thatês fine. Look."
Amy,I donêt understand.
Leonard,He made you his screensaver.
Amy,"Oh. Wow. I had no idea. He is so into me. Wait, wait, whereêd I go?"
Leonard,"Oh, well, itês you, Swamp Thing, Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man, but, look, youêre in the mix."
Amy,I am in the mix. And Iêm the hottest one.
Penny,Whoês that?
Leonard,"Oh, Madame Curie."
Amy,"Thatês fine, sheês dead."
Sheldon,You okay?
Amy,Just really glad youêre back.
Sheldon,"Me, too. I got a lot of TV to catch up on."
Amy,I missed you.
Sheldon,"To quote Han Solo, I know."
Amy,Did you miss me?
Sheldon,I wouldêve preferred to have you there with me.
Sheldon,Or instead of me.
Amy,Did you hold the baby?
Sheldon,I did. 
Amy,And? How did it make you feel?
Sheldon,"Looking into the blank, innocent eyes of a creature that couldnêt begin to comprehend anything I was saying? Basically just another day at the office."
Leonard,Iêm gonna do it. Iêm gonna ask her out.
Howard,And chocolate milk is gonna squirt out of my nipples.
Raj,"Put up or shut up. You make it, Iêll drink it."
Penny,You guys need anything else?
Leonard,"Uh, your phone number and one more cheesecake."
Penny,"Iêm sorry, I have a boyfriend. In fact, there he is now. Ready to go, sweetheart?"
Amy,"This is nice, that we all get to eat together."
Amy,Hmm. Can we maybe put the phones down and have an actualhuman conversation?
Sheldon,"We can, but thanks to Steve Jobs, we donêt have to."
Penny,"Guys, guys, youêre never gonna believe this."
Leonard,What happened?
Penny,I just got a part on a TV show.
Leonard,Thatês great. Guys.
Howard,"Oh, yeah"
Sheldon,"Yay, Penny."
Amy,Whatês the show?
Penny,"Um, NCÑ IIÑ or, you know, NCSTDÑ I donêt know, itês, itês, you know, itês the one with the letters and Iêm gonna be on it!"
Leonard,Thatês amazing.
Howard,Whatês your part?
Penny,"Um, I play a customer in a diner and I flirt with Mark Harmon."
Raj,"Ooh, Mark Harmon, heês a dreamboat."
Leonard,"So it, itês just flirting?"
Penny,"Well, yeah. Why?"
Leonard,"Uh, no reason. I just think itês sexier when things are left to the imagination."
Amy,Heês wrong.
Raj,So I read a study that says a man with a dog is three times more likely to get a womanês phone number.
Leonard,Is it true even when the man lets his dog lick peanut butter off his tongue?
Raj,I donêt see why not. 
Howard,"If youêre really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom."
Sheldon,Why is that funny? Thatês just unhygienic.
Leonard,Itês a joke.
Sheldon,"I donêt think so. I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist. For example, uh, Wolowitzês mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet, or exercise, or both. See? The twist is that people donêt usually change. Well, they donêt."
Penny,"Hey, guys, donêt forget, my episodeês on TV tomorrow night."
Howard,Weêll be there.
Raj,Can we bring anything?
Penny,"Oh, thatês so sweet of you, but I was gonna steal food from here. You know, my treat."
Sheldon,"Wait, if Howardês mother is coming, then you should also steal marbles. Because sheês obese, and hippos are obese, and in the popular board game Hungry Hungry Hippos, they eat marbles. Maybe I need to dumb these down for you. "
Sheldon,"Leonard, do you think Iêm funny?"
Leonard,Do you?
Sheldon,I think Iêm hysterical.
Leonard,I take it back. That was funny.
Sheldon,The philosopher Henri Bergson says itês funny when a human being behaves like an object. 
Leonard,I bet that bit killed at The Chuckle Hut.
Sheldon,"Oh, he didnêt perform stand-up comedy, he was a philosopher."
Leonard,"You know, I think weêre zeroing in on your problem."
Sheldon,"Perhaps Iêll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy, which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time. Unless theyêre German, êcause thatês a tough crowd."
Leonard,Are you set on people laughing with you? ‚Cause if youêre cool with at youÑ
Sheldon,I donêt get it.
Bernadette,"Raj, when you said you were gonna bring a date to watch Pennyês thing tonight, I didnêt think you meant Stuart."
Howard,Really? I never for a second thought itêd be anything else.
Raj,"I almost met someone last night, but I blew it. I was walking Cinnamon and this girl introduced herself, but she was so cute I panicked and said, wouldnêt it be easier if instead of talking we could just sniff each otherês butts?"
Bernadette,"Well, Stuartês cute in his own way."
Raj,Are possums cute?
Howard,"If youêre so intimidated by talking to attractive girls, maybe you should practice by talking to regular people."
Raj,You mean like fatties and uggos?
Bernadette,Or maybe just stop talking.
Howard,"Iêm serious. Go to the mall, talk to anybody, practice, that way when you eventually do talk to a cute girl, it wonêt be so scary."
Bernadette,Or just keep dating the possum.
Leonard,Iêm so proud of you.
Penny,We havenêt even gotten to my scene yet.
Leonard,"I know, but youêre going to be a TV star and you havenêt left me yet. That takes guts."
Sheldon,"I donêt know about you, but Iêm very uncomfortable with all this."
Sheldon,Iêve never seen this show before and now Iêm starting with episode 246? Itês unnatural.
Amy,Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.
Sheldon,All right.
Penny,"Okay, shh, guys, guys, this is it."
Penny,Are you kidding me?
Leonard,Whatês wrong?
Penny,"Well, the diner scene. Whereês my diner scene?"
Sheldon,"Well, donêt ask me. Until I see the prequel, Iêm lost."
Penny,"No, there was supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark Harmon, but itês gone."
Bernadette,What happened?
Penny,They mustêve cut it.
Leonard,"Oh, Penny, Iêm, Iêm sorry. "
Howard,That stinks.
Raj,Iêm sure you were great.
Penny,"This doesnêt make any sense. I mean, I, I thought I did a, a really good job, IÑ Excuse me."
Sheldon,Iêve been studying how to make people laugh. They say that comedy is tragedy plus time. Letês tickle some ribs.
Penny,"No, Dad, I donêt think they cut me out of the show because I was too pretty. No, I donêt need you to come out and kick Mark Harmonês ass. Daddy, I gotta go. I love you. Bye."
Leonard,How you doing?
Penny,"Ugh, this is such a disaster. My parents had all my relatives over. They got one of those six-foot sandwiches, and got my brother a day pass out of rehab and now heês missing and the sandwich is missing, and theyêre probably in Mexico by now. So humiliating."
Leonard,You still got the part. Thatês a huge accomplishment.
Penny,"Yeah, but this was supposed to be my break, okay? People were gonna see me in this show and it was gonna lead to bigger things. More auditions, more parts. Now none of thatês gonna happen."
Leonard,"Honey, you only had, like, three lines. That wasnêt gonna happen anyway."
Leonard,"Oh, come on, no, thatês not what I meant."
Penny,Then what did you mean?
Leonard,"I donêt, look, you know, words donêt always have to mean things."
Penny,I think you meant that you donêt believe in me.
Leonard,"Nope. Uh, uh, I might not know what I meant, but I know that I didnêt mean that. Not this guy. Oh, no way."
Penny,"I want you, right now, to give me your 100% honest opinion."
Penny,Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress?
Penny,So you think Iêll be on TV and in movies and win awards.
Penny,"Yes, honestly."
Leonard,I donêt.
Penny,How could you say that?
Leonard,"I donêt know, I got all confused when you said honestly."
Leonard,"Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful? Of course I do. But isnêt Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful? All right, look, weêll come back to that."
Penny,"No, please. Donêt stop, go on. Tell me how Iêm gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life."
Leonard,"That is not what I said. Look, I think youêre really good. I truly do. But this is an incredibly hard thing that youêre shooting for. I mean, the odds of anyone becoming a successful actor are like a million to one."
Penny,"Wow, thank you."
Leonard,Shouldêve let Sheldon come.
Sheldon,"This is interesting. Apparently, a key component in some forms of humour is the element of surprise. "
Amy,"Well, that makes sense. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation, and patients with brain lesions on theirÑ"
Sheldon,BRAIN LESIONS!
Amy,"Sheldon, you scared me. That wasnêt funny."
Sheldon,Or maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.
Amy,"Okay, the notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd. I mean, humour is a complex neurologicalÑ  Okay, thatês pretty good."
Raj,No pretty girls. The point is to talk to regular people and work our way up to pretty girls.
Raj,"That depends. On any level, do you think sheês hot?"
Amy,I guess.
Sheldon,"Now, would you say ointment is more, equal to, or less funny than kumquat?"
Amy,I donêt think I want to go out with you anymore.
Sheldon,Will you please stop joking around? Iêm trying to figure this out.
Amy,"Sheldon, how many words are you gonna go through?"
Sheldon,All of them.
Penny,You didnêt get your part cut.
Penny,"And you didnêt get your part cut. Yep, bunch of old guys rocking out in a band, all with erectile dysfunction, you didnêt get your part cut!"
Leonard,Hey. Can we talk?
Penny,"We can, but the part of Penny might get cut."
Leonard,"That was really crappy of me. What youêre trying to do is hard, but people do make it, and I really do believe you could be one of them."
Penny,Thank you.
Leonard,"And to show you how much I believe in you, I kind of got you an audition."
Penny,Are you serious? For what?
Leonard,The new Star Wars movie.
Penny,How did you manage that?
Leonard,"Thereês this thing online, you put yourself on tape and just send it in, anyone can do it."
Penny,"Come on Leonard, this is just a PR stunt."
Leonard,"So? Even if it is, you have a huge advantage because youêre an actual actress. Most of the people doing this are just weirdoes and nerds. Wolowitz sent his in two days ago."
Penny,"Really, let it go."
Leonard,"Look, maybe it is a long shot, but sometimes long shots happen. Luke Skywalker was only given one chance to destroy the Death Star. He had to get a torpedo into an exhaust port that was only two meters wide, but with the help of The Force, heÑ wow, I can feel you hating me right now."
Raj,"Yeah, she seems friendly and easy toÑ never mind, sheês gone. You know, maybe talking to people is too hard."
Raj,"I donêt know. Theyêre dressed very stylishly. Theyêre probably stuck-up. This is ridiculous. The next person that walks by, no matter who it is, theyêre the one. Weêre gonna die here."
Howard,Whereês Sheldon?
Amy,Heês home trying to use science to determine the basis of humour.
Bernadette,Thatês interesting.
Amy,"Itês exhausting. Do you have any idea how hard it is to laugh at a knock-knock joke that starts with knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy, knock-knock-knock, Amy?"
Bernadette,"If you want him to stop, sometimes the easiest thing to do is just fake a laugh."
Howard,Fake a laugh? Do you ever do that with me?
Bernadette,"No, of course not."
Howard,"Well, Iêd be able to tell anyway."
Bernadette,I donêt think you would.
Howard,"Please, Iêve made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out.  Yeah? Well, I fake my orgasms."
Leonard,"Yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses? Really? How much for three?"
Leonard,"Yeah, Iêll call you back."
Penny,"Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing. I didnêt mean to call it idiotic."
Leonard,"Well, I donêt think you called it idiotic."
Penny,"Oh. Sorry, I meant to. Anyway, um, I was just upset with myself. I wasnêt mad at you. I just feel like everything is falling apart."
Leonard,Come on. Itês okay.
Penny,"No, itês not okay. Look at me, okay? I took a temp job as a waitress forever ago, and Iêm still doing it. I canêt quit, because guess what? I canêt do anything else. And I finally get my big break, and it goes away. Iêm such a mess."
Leonard,"No, youêre not."
Penny,"Really? ‚Cause this morning at Starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg. And it wasnêt the only one in there."
Leonard,"Okay, listen to me, this is just a minor setback."
Penny,"No, itês not, okay? Iêve been out here for, like, ten years. Iêve nothing to show for it."
Leonard,"Well, you have me."
Penny,Youêre right. I do have you. Mm. Letês get married.
Penny,"Ooh. Leonard Hofstadter, will you marry me?"
Penny,Did you seriously just say um?
Leonard,"Look, you know I love you but, but youêre, youêre drunk and sad and feeling lost."
Penny,"Okay, so, so you donêt want to marry me?"
Leonard,That is not what I said.
Penny,"No, forget it. I take it back. Offerês off the table."
Sheldon,Whoês in the mood to laugh?
Leonard,Really not a good time.
Sheldon,But I used science to construct the perfect joke.
Penny,Iêm gonna go.
Leonard,"Penny, donêt."
Penny,"No, no, I just need to be alone."
Sheldon,"So, a sandwich, a rabbi and yo mama walk into a bar. Where are you going?"
Leonard,To my room.
Sheldon,Should I follow you?
Sheldon,"Leonard, wait."
Sheldon,I forgot to tell you the sandwich is promiscuous.
Raj,Thatês a mirror.
Raj,"Uh, excuse me. "
Raj,"Uh, do, do you like being a mall security guard?"
Raj,"Okay, nice talking to you."
Sheldon,Canêt sleep?
Sheldon,Would you like to talk about it?
Leonard,"Penny proposed, and I didnêt say yes."
Sheldon,Why not?
Leonard,Thatês a good question.
Sheldon,Does that mean the relationship is over?
Leonard,I donêt know.
Sheldon,Why donêt you ask her?
Leonard,Because Iêm afraid to know the answer.
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm sorry."
Leonard,Thatês it? Youêre not gonna make some dumb joke or some inappropriate comment?
Sheldon,"Youêre my friend, and, Iêm sorry."
Leonard,Did you just put a kick me sign on my back?
Sheldon,That wouldnêt be funny at all.
Howard,"Star Wars audition, take one, starring Howard Joel Wolowitz, real-life astronaut. Vader is here, now, on this moon. I felt his presence. Heês come for me. He can feel when Iêm nearÑ"
Bernadette,How many times do I have to tell you to replace the toilet paper when itês empty?
Howard,Iêm in the middle of something.
Bernadette,So am I.
Sheldon,Itês an outrage.
Leonard,I know.
Sheldon,"The university, they think they can do whatever they want. We just have to sit there and take it."
Leonard,"You need to let it go, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get."
Leonard,"Oh, my God, theyêre just making you use your vacation days."
Sheldon,But I donêt want a vacation.
Leonard,"Okay, listen, I donêt mean to diminish what youêre going through, but Iêm a little distracted right now."
Sheldon,"Oh, this again? So, Penny proposed, you didnêt say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?"
Leonard,It doesnêt.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Leonard,Iêm gonna go talk to Penny. 
Sheldon,"Iêm going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas, curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over.  Penny. Sorry."
Penny,"Look, Iêm sorry I didnêt text you back. I just needed some time to think."
Penny,Yeah. Come in.
Leonard,"Look, if you want to break up, just say it."
Leonard,"No, no, no, no. I take it back. Donêt say it. Just, just hate me, but stay with me. It worked for my parents."
Penny,"Listen, I donêt want to break up with you."
Leonard,"Oh. Oh, okay. Good, good. So, itês cool if I cry a little?"
Penny,"Yeah, I probably wouldnêt."
Penny,"Look, you did the right thing last night. I was a mess. I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere."
Leonard,"Look, I get it, and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do."
Penny,"Great, because Iêve been thinking, if I really want this acting thing to work, I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that, I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory."
Leonard,"Wow. That, thatês a big step."
Penny,I know.
Leonard,"So, well, before making any rashÑ"
Penny,I already quit.
Leonard,And I support you.
Sheldon,"Come on, take me to work with you."
Leonard,Youêre on vacation.
Sheldon,Please. What if thereês a big breakthrough in science today and Iêm not there to see it?
Leonard,Do you really think thereês gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?
Sheldon,I was just tricking you.
Sheldon,"Leonard, wait. Take me with you."
Sheldon,Too bad. Iêm coming with you.
Leonard,"Oh, Sheldon, stay."
Leonard,I said stay. Iêm going to work. Do not follow me. 
Bernadette,Hey Stuart.
Bernadette,Sorry. Did I startle you?
Bernadette,"Well, I need a little help. I accidentally destroyed one of Howardês comic books this morning, and was hoping I could replace it."
Bernadette,Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.
Bernadette,Do you have this one?
Bernadette,"Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it before Howie comes home from work."
Bernadette,"Well, heês always saying I should be more careful with my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right."
Bernadette,"You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company. If you can make this happen today, I can hook you up with anxiety medication, antidepressants. "
Amy,"Hello, Mr. Rat Brain. Not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now, are we?"
Howard,Anybody home?
Amy,"Hey, what brings you guys here?"
Raj,"Well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if youêd like to join."
Amy,"Why? Because Sheldonês not here this week, and you donêt think I have any other options? Iêm just kidding. Iêll get my purse."
Amy,"Thatês okay. Uh, Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh. Guys, this is Bert."
Raj,Hey. Good to see you.
Amy,This is so pretty. Bert works for the geology department.
Howard,Youêre both into rock?
Amy,"Oh, you forgot your quartz."
Amy,Heês nice.
Howard,"Yeah, heês nice because he likes you."
Amy,"What?! No, he doesnêt."
Raj,He brought you a pretty rock.
Amy,So? He does that every day. Oh.
Howard,"You know, if youêd rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend Bert, itês totally okay."
Amy,Heês not my boyfriend.
Raj,"Are you sure? Heês tall, pale and awkward. That sounds like your type."
Amy,Should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?
Raj,"Yeah, grow up, Howard. God."
Amy,What do I do? I donêt want to hurt his feelings.
Howard,Maybe the problem is he thinks youêre available. Does he know youêre dating Sheldon?
Amy,I guess it hasnêt come up.
Howard,There you go. 
Raj,And does Sheldon know youêre dating Sheldon?
Amy,Iêm sorry. Who are you dating?
Raj,"Yeah, knock it off, Howard."
Penny,"Oh. Hey, Sheldon."
Penny,You okay?
Sheldon,Iêm on vacation. What do you think?
Penny,Why are you sitting in the stairwell?
Sheldon,Leonard told me to stay.
Penny,"Oh. Well, good boy."
Sheldon,Where are you going?
Penny,"Oh, I have a ton of errands to run. I need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class."
Sheldon,"Well, have fun."
Penny,Okay. You want to come with me?
Penny,"Come on, boy. Come on. Letês go. Letês go. Get in the car. Come on."
Bernadette,"Oh, thatês great."
Bernadette,"Oh, thatês terrible. Whatês the address?"
Bernadette,"Oh, thanks, but I donêtwant you to close up. I mean, wonêt you lose business? Sorry. That was mean."
Amy,Penny really quit The Cheesecake Factory?
Howard,"So, what is she doing today?"
Leonard,"I donêt know. She already thinks I donêt support this, so if I call, it might look like Iêm checking up on her."
Raj,"Well, do you support this?"
Leonard,Of course I do. Sheês a great actress. Iêm proud sheês taking this risk.
Amy,Thatês nice.
Leonard,You bought that? Great. I got to call her before I forget how I said it. Hey.
Penny,Hi. Whatês up?
Leonard,"Oh, howês it going? You taking Hollywood by storm?"
Penny,"Actually, Iêm at The Cheesecake Factory."
Leonard,"You got your job back. That is great news. I didnêt want to say anything, but you are making the right choice. To plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane."
Penny,Yeah. Iêm just returning my uniform.
Leonard,And I support you.
Sheldon,Okay. Iêm inside the CERN super collider.
Sheldon,Wow. Didnêt see that coming.
Sheldon,Let me guess.
Sheldon,What was I gonna do? Two ins in a row? Whereês my lemonade?
Penny,I didnêt get it.
Sheldon,"A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress, to forget my order one last time."
Penny,Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?
Sheldon,Do you see me drinking lemonade?
Penny,Iêm serious.
Sheldon,Why do you ask?
Penny,Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?
Sheldon,"No, I donêt think you are. "
Sheldon,"The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist, I didnêt take some other job in case it didnêt work out. Which wasnêt easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year."
Penny,Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why canêt Leonard understand it?
Sheldon,"Because heês not like us, Penny. Weêre dreamers."
Penny,"Yeah, I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car."
Amy,"Hello, Bert."
Amy,"Listen, um, Bert, before you say anything else, I, I have a boyfriend."
Amy,Werenêt you?
Amy,"Thatês very nice of you, but I do have a boyfriend."
Amy,"No, thatês not true. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like, way worse than you."
Amy,Donêt say that. 
Amy,"No, Bert, come on. Iêd love to go to the mineral show with you."
Amy,"No, itês not."
Bernadette,"No, thanks."
Bernadette,I donêt think I like the way youêre treating my friend.
Bernadette,"Not from you. Letês go, Stuart."
Howard,The mineral and rock show? That would be awful even without Bert.
Amy,So what am I supposed to do now?
Raj,Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?
Amy,"This isnêt funny. Iêm gonna have to tell him the truth, that even if I didnêt have a boyfriend, I wouldnêt be interested in him."
Howard,"Oh, Iêve heard those words so many times. From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel."
Raj,"Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury."
Howard,"Marci Grossman, Lisa Mazzarino."
Raj,Megan Pincus.
Howard,Tammy Cho.
Raj,"Oh, who was that girl from our Starbucks?"
Howard,Arlene Russel.
Raj,Yes. Arlene. She wrote no way on both our cappuccinos.
Howard,Poor Bert. That guyês got a rough afternoon ahead of him.
Amy,"Well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasnêt interested?"
Raj,"I guess, uh, Iêd like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, I was wrong. I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way."
Howard,Thatês how you reject a guy.
Amy,"Okay, I donêt have time for this. Iêm just gonna go find him and be brutally honest."
Howard,"No, donêt."
Raj,Heêll be so upset. Heêll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes.
Howard,You want us to talk to him?
Amy,Really? You would do that?
Raj,Sure. Weêve both been in his shoes. Weêll let him down with compassion and respect.
Amy,Thank you.
Howard,Letês go.
Raj,"So we tell him sheês a lesbian, right?"
Howard,Of course we tell him sheês a lesbian.
Penny,"And hold three, two, one. Very good. Now letês try Warrior 2. And hold."
Sheldon,Iêve read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals.
Penny,"Yeah, well, I donêt think weêre gonna get to do that today."
Sheldon,Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze.
Leonard,"Oh, hey."
Penny,And now we go to Reverse Warrior.
Leonard,How did she get you to do yoga?
Sheldon,"Well, to be honest, I thought she said Yoda."
Penny,"Iêm helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me."
Leonard,"Oh, how many times do I have to say it? I support you."
Penny,"Sheldon, take a break."
Penny,"Okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?"
Leonard,"Fine. Iêm not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didnêt you ask me before you did it?"
Penny,"Oh, so now I need your permission? Would you have asked me before you quit your job?"
Leonard,"Yes. I thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together. If Iêm wrong, then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship weêre actually in."
Penny,"Yeah, well, maybe we do."
Sheldon,Iêm willing to if you guys are.
Leonard,Can we please have some privacy?
Sheldon,"Y, Iêm as much a part of this relationship as you two, and I think itês high time we put all our cards on the table. For example, where is this going? Are you two ever getting married? And, if so, where will we all live? Have you thought about that?"
Penny,"Okay, wait. What are we doing?"
Leonard,"For some reason, weêre planning a future where we both live with Sheldon forever."
Sheldon,Good. Now weêre getting somewhere.
Penny,"Look, I know you think Iêm being reckless, and you might be right, but I need to take this shot."
Sheldon,"Yeah, no kidding. Despite what it says on her r_sum_, she is no longer 22. "
Leonard,"I swear, I am on your side. "
Penny,"You keep saying youêre on my side, but you donêt act like it."
Sheldon,"He does that to me, too. Why do we put up with it?"
Leonard,"Listen, I could never do what youêre doing, okay? I would be terrified."
Penny,"Well, itês scary for me, too."
Sheldon,Iêm fine with it.
Leonard,"My point is, just because I couldnêt do it doesnêt mean you shouldnêt. And Iêm proud of you. "
Penny,Okay. Thank you.
Sheldon,"Well, to celebrate this reconciliation, letês all share a milk shake. Uh, Penny, youêll need a straw."
Bernadette,"Yes, I am, thereês a few more things I want to say to you. Stuartês store is just fine, and heês a much nicer person than you are, and if you still have that comic, Iêd like to buy it right now."
Bernadette,"No, I donêt want a latte. I want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone. "
Bernadette,"Well, that sounds even better."
Raj,Weêre sorry Amy didnêt want to go.
Howard,"Really, really sorry."
Howard,T-minus 60 seconds.
Raj,"Oh, it all comes down to this."
Leonard,"Oh, Iêve got butterflies."
Sheldon,"Donêt get soft on me, Hofstadter. I will slap those glasses right off your face."
Penny,Whatês going on?
Leonard,Hey. Weêre about to buy tickets for Comic-Con.
Howard,T Minus 45 seconds.
Leonard,"They sell out incredibly fast, but as long as one of us gets in, we can buy passesÑ"
Sheldon,"Good Lord, this is not the time for flirting, keep it in your pants."
Penny,This is a whole lot of weird before coffee.
Howard,T-minus 30 seconds.
Raj,"Oh, I have to go to the bathroom so bad."
Sheldon,"Every year. I told you, wear a diaper."
Raj,And I told you I get diaper rash.
Howard,15 seconds.
Leonard,"Well, this is it, this is it. This is it."
Howard,"Five, four, three, two, one. "
Sheldon,"Itês live. Go, go, go, go, go."
Raj,Anyone in?
Leonard,Not yet. 
Sheldon,Do not stop refreshing your screens.
Penny,"Yeah, this is not gonna be enough coffee."
Howard,Itês been ten minutes. Weêre running out of time.
Penny,To be cool? Yeah.
Leonard,"I did it, I did it, Iêm in the queue."
Sheldon,Yay! And they say firefighters are the real heroes.
Raj,"Uh, what number in line are you?"
Leonard,"Uh, fifteenÑ"
Leonard,Ñthousand two hundred and eleven.
Raj,"Oh, they only have Thursday and Sunday passes left."
Leonard,"Oh, Thursdayês gone. Just Sunday left."
Sheldon,"Oh, Sundayês the worst. Everybodyês leaving, most of the good panels are over, and the only T-shirts they have left are small and XXXXL."
Leonard,Sundayês gone.
Sheldon,"Not Sunday, I love Sunday."
Raj,So thatês it? Everythingês sold out?
Howard,I canêt believe weêre not going.
Sheldon,"Itês okay. You know, there, thereês always WonderCon in Anaheim, you know? That, thatês just as good. Excuse me."
Penny,"Oh, guys, this is really sad. And in a different way than it was twenty minutes ago."
Sheldon,I canêt believe we wasted all that time on our Hulk costumes.
Penny,You were all going as the Hulk?
Howard,"Not the same Hulk. Ferrigno, Bana, Norton and Ruffalo."
Raj,We would have been the angry green belles of the masquerade ball.
Penny,And weêre back to the first kind of sad.
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I have the solution to our Comic-Con problem. We donêt need them. Iêm starting my own convention."
Leonard,"Sheldon, just buy scalped tickets with us."
Sheldon,"I told you. Buying scalped tickets is against the rules. If you get caught, you get banned from Comic-Con for life. Life, Leonard. Youêre gonna feel pretty silly when weêre 80 years old, and you have to drive me down there and then wait in the car for three days."
Leonard,Do what you want. Weêre getting scalped tickets.
Howard,I already found a guy online whoês willing to sell.
Sheldon,How do you know this isnêt a sting operation set up by the Comic-Con police?
Leonard,The same way I know that the people in the TV set canêt see me.
Howard,"Sheldon, just come with us. Youêre not gonna make your own convention."
Sheldon,"You know, there was a time when Comic-Con didnêt exist at all until one lone dreamer with a unique vision made it happen. And you mark my words, Iêm gonna rip that guy off."
Sheldon,"Yes, Iêm starting my own comic book convention, and I thought that your client, Robert Downey Jr., would be perfect to appear on our first panel. Oh, well, now, why are you saying no? You havenêt even asked him yet. You know, excuse me, but I sat through Iron Man 2. I believe he owes me two hours of his time. They hung up on me."
Leonard,"Did you tell them that youêre holding your convention at a Marie Callenderês, and that every panellist gets a free slice of pie?"
Sheldon,I didnêt even get to that part.
Leonard,"Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton thinks this is a waste of time."
Sheldon,"Not true. Wil thinks this is a great idea. He was just concerned that he wasnêt a big enough celebrity to headline such an amazing event. Also, thatês the same day that he shampoos his beard."
Leonard,"Sheldon, buddy, I just donêt think this is going to come together for you."
Sheldon,You donêt know that. I still have plenty of solid leads on this list.
Leonard,Good luck.
Sheldon,"No, wait. I need you to call Stan Lee, Leonard Nimoy and Bill Nye the Science Guy, êcause, legally, Iêm not allowed to. Oh, and, also, Carrie Fisher, you know, êcause I hear he can be pretty nuts."
Penny,I canêt believe Leonard is spending hundreds of dollars on scalped tickets. 
Amy,"Last week, you spent that on a little dress. "
Penny,"Yeah, but those tickets only get him into Comic-Con. That dress gets me into anywhere I want."
Bernadette,Those tickets were pretty expensive. I had to give Howie an advance on his allowance. Now heês never gonna put his toys away.
Amy,"Why canêt they do something sensible like Sheldon and start their own comic book convention? Also, who wants to throw me out that window?"
Bernadette,"Well, while theyêre acting like teenagers, we could do something grown-up."
Amy,Oh. You mean like a museum?
Penny,"Yes, like a museum, but anything else."
Bernadette,"Oh, I know. Thereês a nice hotel not far from here where they do afternoon tea."
Amy,"Ooh, afternoon tea, how sophisticated of us."
Penny,"Oh, all right, if weêre gonna be fancy, I should probably put on clean underwear."
Bernadette,"La-dee-da, look who has clean underwear."
Penny,"No, weêre gonna stop at Target on the way."
Raj,"Hey, since Sheldonês not going to Comic-Con, maybe we could find a cool trio to dress up as."
Leonard,"Mmm, what if we go as The Fantastic Four, and just tell people that the Invisible Girl is standing there with us."
Howard,"Oh, and I thought our days of pretending to be with women who donêt exist were over."
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I am one step away from securing a huge guest for my convention."
Leonard,Does that step include chloroform and a roll of duct tape?
Sheldon,"I donêt think that will be necessary for Mr. James Earl Jones. You heard me. The voice of Darth Vader, the Lion Kingês dad, and FYI, the guy who says, This is CNN. Which also sounds like Darth Vader."
Raj,How are you gonna get James Earl Jones?
Sheldon,"Simple. Earlier today, he tweeted that heês looking forward to going to his favourite sushi restaurant for dinner. I googled an interview from four years ago which was conducted in his favourite sushi restaurant. Thatês where heêll be, and thatês where Iêm going, andÑ"
Howard,And thatês where Darth Vaderês gonna pour soy sauce on your head.
Leonard,"Sheldon, I donêt care if you get scalped tickets with us or not, but please donêt be creepy and go stalking this poor guy. Youêre gonna get in trouble."
Sheldon,"Youêre the ones who are going to get in trouble. Youêre buying non-transferable tickets. And from a stranger, no less. Not only can you get banned from Comic-Con, if caught, you could be charged with petty theft. You think about that while Iêm warning James Earl Jones about the danger of posting his location on Twitter. He got lucky this time. There are some weirdoes out there.  Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badum. Bom, bom, badala, baba, badalum, bom, badala, bom, bom, forgot my keys, bom, bom, bom, bom, badum, bom, badumÑ "
Howard,"Okay, great. Bye. Our friendly neighbourhood scalper says heês running late."
Raj,Does he sound like a criminal?
Howard,What do you mean?
Raj,"You know, did he say things like, youse guys, or, listen here, see?"
Leonard,"Yes. He, heês late because heês on his way here from 1940."
Raj,"Iêm just saying, we donêt know who this guy is. What if he wants to steal our money or our kidneys, or make a suit outof our skins?"
Howard,Why would someone want to make clothes out of your skin?
Raj,I donêt know. Maybe êcause dark doesnêt show the stains?
Leonard,"Well, now youêre making me wonder if we should have met him at a neutral location."
Howard,Why do you think I told him to come to your place?
Amy,There sure are a lot of little kids here.
Penny,I canêt believe we thought this would makes us feel grown up.
Bernadette,I canêt believe the waiter thought I was your daughter.
Amy,"Well, last time I got dressed up and had tea was when I was five. Just me, my teddy bear, Raggedy Ann and my hamster. "
Bernadette,Thatês cute.
Amy,It was. Till my hamster ate all her babies. It got less cute really fast.
Bernadette,Should we leave?
Penny,"Well, thereês a bar in the lobby."
Bernadette,I could go for a drink.
Amy,"Aw. Drinking in the afternoon, just like her mommy."
Sheldon,"Thank you. My friend Leonard said if I bothered you while you were eating, youêd think I was a creepy stalker."
Sheldon,"He is, Mr. Earl Jones, he is."
Raj,"Okay, so, Iêm on a Comic-Con message board, and thereês a post from a guy where he says he got caught using someone elseês badge, and Sheldon was right, he did get charged with petty theft. Guys, if I go to jail dressed as the Human Torch, that might send the wrong message."
Leonard,Maybe this isnêt a good idea.
Howard,I can text the guy and tell him we changed our minds.
Raj,Do it.
Howard,Okay. Weêre officially not going to Comic-Con.
Leonard,Hold on. We always do this. 
Howard,Do what?
Leonard,"Chicken out. Weêre, weêre so afraid of getting into trouble that we never do anything wrong."
Raj,Thatês êcause weêre the good guys.
Leonard,Even Batman breaks the rules. 
Raj,You know I struggle with Batman.
Leonard,"I say, this one time, instead of wimping out, letês be badasses."
Raj,"Okay, Iêll be a badass, but only if you pinky-swear to be one, too."
Leonard,"Howard, you in on this?"
Howard,No need. Iêm breaking rules all the time. 
Leonard,Name one.
Howard,Last night. Drank my Pepto straight out of the bottle.
Raj,What about that little cup they give you?
Howard,Yeah. What about it?
Raj,Are you impressed by that?
Leonard,A little.
Raj,"Yeah, me, too."
Sheldon,"Me, too. But he wasnêt, was he?"
Sheldon,So messed up.
Penny,"So, afternoon tea was a bust."
Amy,"On the bright side, every six-year-old there was jealous of my tiara. Not gonna lie, it felt good."
Penny,"Let me ask you a question, when did you guys start feeling grown up? ‚Cause I am not sure I do."
Bernadette,"Honestly, I thought when I got married I would, but I still kind of feel like Iêm pretending. It doesnêt help that most of my clothes come from Gap Kids."
Penny,"Okay, so Iêm an adult, and the other day I saw an old man slip and fall down, and I laughed. I mean, I laughed hard. Like, like, out loud. If he was conscious, he wouldêve heard me."
Penny,"I know. One of the tennis balls came off his walker and bounced right off his head. I mean, I, I almost wet myself. I guess you had to be there."
Amy,I think I have you both beat. Imagine trying to feel like a grown-up when youêve never even been with a man.
Penny,"Okay, sex is not what makes you a grown-up."
Bernadette,Yeah. Or youêd be the oldest one here.
Penny,Really? Is that how you talk to your mother?
Howard,He just parked. Heês on his way up.
Leonard,Good. This is exciting.
Raj,It is. I feel alive.
Leonard,"Yeah. What if we do get caught, who cares? So we get banned from Comic-Con."
Raj,Maybe slapped with a fine.
Howard,"Oh, no. Iêd be an astronaut and a bad boy, how will women keep their pants on?"
Raj,"Uh, maybe itêll come up when I apply for citizenship. Oh, crap, what if it comes up when I apply for citizenship? "
Leonard,I wonder if weêd have to disclose something like this when we apply for grants.
Raj,"Heês gonna be here any second, what should we do?"
Howard,"Okay, you guys are such babies. Iêll handle this. If he thinks weêre not home, heêll go away."
Raj,I thought you were a badass.
Howard,"I lied about the Pepto, I always use the little cup."
Sheldon,"Is it true, as a child, you were a stutterer and were functionally mute for eight years?"
Sheldon,Oh. Is it true they used scuba gear to create the sound of Darth Vader breathing?
Sheldon,Oh. Is it true that you were pre-med in college and you almost became a doctor?
Sheldon,"Oh, James, I could listen to your stories all night."
Penny,"I mean, really, whatês so great about being grown up?"
Bernadette,"Well, for starters, weêd be splitting this check three ways."
Penny,"Iêm serious. Who wants to do all that stuff? Have insurance, pay mortgages, leave one of those little notes when you hit a parked car."
Amy,I told you it was Penny.
Penny,"Oh, come on, it wasnêt me. Anyone could have knocked your mirror off, or whatever happened."
Amy,"Maybe the guys are right. I mean, we spent the whole night trying to be mature, and it was kind of boring. Iêm sure theyêre having more fun than we are."
Howard,"Oh, God, I could really use exactly two tablespoons of Pepto right now."
Sheldon,"Hey, Los Angeles. Iêm on a Ferris Wheel with Darth Vader. And heês nicer than you think."
Sheldon,"In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion sleeps tonightÑ"
Sheldon,"Bring it home, Mufasa. Eee, eee, eee, eee, eee, um, um-a-weh."
Sheldon,I donêt understand what weêre doing.
Sheldon,Whose house is this?
Sheldon,Okay. But I think it could have ended with the karaoke.
Sheldon,Oh. How much does it cost to get them off my lap?
Sheldon,"Oh, right. Well, my friends and I couldnêt get into Comic-Con this year, and I was trying to start my own convention, and I was going to ask if you would be a panelist."
Sheldon,Ay-yi-yi. 
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, whoês Angie Dickinson?"
Amy,"Item 28, your pet name for me. Timeês running out on this. You need to make a decision."
Sheldon,I submitted you a notarised list. 
Amy,"Iêm sorry, but Gollum and Flakey are not acceptable."
Sheldon,"Well, you donêt like Princess Corncob, you donêt like Fester, youêre just impossible to please."
Amy,"Weêll come back to that one. This brings us to the final item in our annual State of the Relationship Summit. Item 29, Valentineês Day."
Sheldon,"Ah, the worst for last. Hmm. Classic Flakey."
Amy,"Before you get upset, I believe Iêve come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy."
Sheldon,"People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead, end with one."
Amy,I propose we spend a weekend at a bed-and-breakfast in Napa Valley.
Sheldon,"I hate every word in that sentence. Including in, at, we and a."
Amy,"Come on, Sheldon. Why not?"
Sheldon,"For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table."
Amy,"One step ahead of you, Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us."
Sheldon,"Oh, very well. What are the sleeping arrangements? Weêve only been dating for three years. If we were to share a room, people might talk."
Amy,I got you your own room. 
Sheldon,What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?
Amy,It doesnêt. I know it makes you feel like youêre bathing inside a monster.
Sheldon,"Look, I appreciate the effort, but Iêm still unclear how this trip is supposed to be enjoyable for me."
Amy,Weêre going to have Valentineês Day dinner on a fully functioning vintage train.
Sheldon,Vintage? Be specific.
Amy,An Alcoa FA-4 diesel locomotive leading a train of meticulously restored 1915 Pullman first-class coaches.
Sheldon,"Wow. Iêm feeling the urge to hug you. And one, and two, all right, Gollum, weêre good."
Bernadette,Are you sure you guys donêt want to come with us to Napa? You could probably still get a room.
Penny,"No, I think weêre just gonna have a quiet weekend at home."
Leonard,"Plus, Iêm not sure itês a great idea to take Penny to where wine comes from. Itês a joke. Oh, come on. We bust on each other. I wear dorky glasses, you might have a problem, itês all for laughs."
Penny,That would really piss me off if I didnêt have a buzz going on.
Sheldon,"Howard, which pocket watch will you be wearing for dinner on the train?"
Howard,"Iêm sorry, what?"
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm afraid if we wear the same pocket watch, it will be embarrassing."
Howard,I donêt own a pocket watch.
Sheldon,"Oh, my. Well, then my apologies for bringing up this sore spot."
Raj,"Since you two are gonna be around for Valentineês, would you mind watching Cinnamon?"
Penny,"You have Valentineês plans? Which came out sounding way more surprised than I meant. Here, let me try that again. You have ValentÑ See? I canêt do it."
Raj,I donêt have plans which is why I booked time on the big telescope that night.
Amy,"Well, an evening looking at the stars, thatês still kind of romantic."
Raj,Except Iêll be alone.
Amy,Iêm trying to put lipstick on a pig here. Work with me.
Leonard,Weêd be happy to watch Cinnamon.
Raj,"Thank you. Oh, and Iêd like for at least one of us to see some action, so if you guys happen to have sex, itês cool if she stays in the room."
Penny,"Hey, same goes for the two of you with Amy."
Amy,"What do you think, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,Itês magnificent. This is going to be the best Valentineês Day ever.
Amy,Iêm so glad you like it.
Sheldon,"Iêm prepared to say I love it, as soon as I confirm there are no hobos aboard."
Penny,Happy Valentineês Day.
Leonard,"Ooh, flowers and chocolates? Somebodyês trying to get me out of my panties."
Penny,Donêt be surprised if you find five chocolates missing and three gross coconut ones with a bite taken out. It came that way when I bought it.
Leonard,"Got you a little something, too."
Penny,"Aw, jewellery. Oh, my God, Lakers tickets?"
Leonard,"It gets better. Instead of me, you can take someone who will actually enjoy it."
Penny,Aw. You are the best boyfriend ever.
Leonard,"Thank you. Seriously, please donêt make me go."
Penny,Should we take this little party to the bedroom?
Leonard,"Mm, donêt have to, we have the whole place to ourselves."
Penny,"Oh, thatês true. "
Leonard,"In fact, if you want, we can do it right here on Sheldonês spot."
Penny,That is the least sexy thing anyoneês ever said to me.
Leonard,To the bedroom.
Sheldon,"Uh, I do. Uh, does this train car have the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?"
Sheldon,"Oh, of course. Um, is the seafood risotto being served on a train car with the original link-and-pin coupler or the Miller Hook and Platform?"
Amy,"Uh, I think weêre gonna need a minute."
Sheldon,Get out of town.
Howard,"Fun fact, Iêm gonna jump off this train."
Leonard,"Hey, Cinnamon, guess who just did it human style."
Penny,"Oh, my God."
Leonard,"Itês a little late, but Iêll take it."
Penny,"No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates. Thatês really bad for dogs."
Leonard,"Oh, crap. What are we gonna do?"
Penny,We gotta get her to a vet right now.
Leonard,"I donêt have a vet. I have a podiatrist, an optometrist, an allergist, a dermatologist, a urologist. Youêd think Iêd have a vet."
Penny,Okay. Thereês one not far from here. Come on. Letês go.
Leonard,Okay. Koothrappali was right. We should have let her watch.
Sheldon,"Do another one, do another one."
Sheldon,"Itês like thereês a train in your mouth. Howard: Oh, yeah. Iêve got one. Um, the Amtrak Wolverine coming into Chicago. Bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch, bwch-wch-wch-wch-wch-wch. Ooo-ooo."
Amy,See if you guys can guess this one. Bang. Splat. Thud.
Sheldon,How many trains have you been on?
Sheldon,Wow. Your lifeês amazing.
Amy,Why do I even try?
Bernadette,Iêm gonna fix this right now.
Howard,Okay. Just make it look like an accident.
Bernadette,Excuse me. You are at Valentineês dinner with your girlfriend. Now get back over there and be with her.
Sheldon,Youêre right. That was insensitive of me. I have to go back to my table now. You should join us.
Bernadette,Great. Now thereês two of êem.
Penny,A whole box.
Leonard,"Well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it before you gave it to me. "
Penny,So the point is I may have saved her life.
Leonard,Maybe to her.
Penny,"Uh, something like this. I donêt know. It came free with a full tank of gas."
Leonard,Really? Do you know how much those Lakers tickets were?
Penny,Do you know how much gas is?
Raj,"Oh, my God, Cinnamon, are you okay? I canêt believe you two. You do whatever it takes to save her life. If she needs new organs, Iêll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts."
Raj,"Owner, father, soul mate, and if anything happens to her, your worst nightmare."
Raj,"Okay. Okay, thank you. Oh, if sheês scared, you can sing to her. She likes Katy Perry. Oh, but donêt do Firework, that gets her all riled up."
Sheldon,Trick question. There never was one.
Sheldon,In what world is a four-four-six-four a four-ten-four? 
Howard,"A world I donêt want to live in. Seriously, I no longer want to live in this world."
Sheldon,"I may never stop thinking about it. Amy, what are the odds we run into this guy?"
Sheldon,I never want this day to end.
Amy,Itês feeling like it never will.
Sheldon,Come on.
Raj,"As if Valentineês Day wasnêt bad enough, you try to kill my dog? And with cheap chocolate, no less?"
Penny,It wasnêt cheap. It was free.
Leonard,Weêre really sorry. It was an accident.
Penny,"Yeah, we werenêt even out of the room that long."
Leonard,"Oh, no, come on. It was a while. It was a while."
Raj,"Oh, is Cinnamon gonna be okay?"
Raj,"All right. Uh, would, would it be okay for me to see her? Weêre usually in bed by now, and I want her to know that Iêm here. Yes, we sleep together, and sometimes we spoon."
Raj,Thank you.
Raj,"Oh, yeah?"
Penny,I think thereês something going on between the two of them.
Leonard,"Maybe, but you also think nine minutes isnêt a while, so what do you know?"
Howard,You okay?
Amy,Why? Because my boyfriendês off playing choo-choo with some weirdo?
Howard,"Well, to be fair, theyêre both weirdos."
Amy,I donêt know what made me think tonight would be any different.
Bernadette,"Well, just the fact that you got him up here still says a lot. To be honest, I bet Howie 200"
Howard,Iêm going to the Lego store to get a big-ass R2-D2.
Bernadette,See? Itês not just Sheldon. Theyêre all idiots.
Howard,Sheês right. 
Bernadette,"So, your boyfriendês a fixer-upper. Most of them are. I mean, look at this guy. You think he came like this? When I met him, he was a hot, goofy mess. Now, heês been to space. Thatês all me."
Howard,I had a little to do with it.
Bernadette,"Oh, sure you did. Whoês Mamaês big space man?"
Howard,I am.
Leonard,"Theyêve been in there, like, half an hour."
Penny,"Yeah, for future reference, thatês a while."
Leonard,How long should we stay?
Penny,I donêt know. Iêm kind of hungry.
Leonard,I saw a Thai place next door.
Penny,Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey.
Leonard,Howês she doing?
Penny,How is everything?
Raj,Sheês gonna be okay; theyêre gonna let me take her home.
Penny,"Oh, good."
Raj,Oh. Thank you for taking such good care of my little girl.
Leonard,"Yes, thank you for all your help."
Penny,Yeah. Iêm sorry if you didnêt think we were taking it seriously. We love animals.
Howard,I love you so much.
Bernadette,"I love you, too."
Sheldon,The conductor and I have the same pocket watch. 
Sheldon,"Dare I say loco? Oh, and, Amy, guess what? The conductor said as soon as he gets off work, he can come back to the bed and breakfast and play his banjo for us."
Amy,"Okay. I need to speak to my boyfriend in private, like, right now."
Howard,Thereês a car with a glass roof. Want to go look at the stars?
Bernadette,"Oh, that sounds so romantic."
Amy,"Oh, give it a rest."
Bernadette,Letês go.
Amy,Why are you still here?
Sheldon,Excuse me. I think youêre being a little rude.
Amy,Iêm being rude? Youêve been rude to me this entire evening.
Sheldon,How is that possible? Iêve hardly spoken to you since we got on the train.
Sheldon,I get it.
Sheldon,What is your problem?
Amy,Itês Valentineês Day. Weêre supposed to be having a romantic weekend.
Sheldon,"Oh, really? Because I remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy. Did you mean that, or were you just trying to trick me?"
Amy,"Fine, itês true. I deserve romance, and I didnêt know how else to make it happen."
Sheldon,"Well, if you want romance, then letês have romance. Oh, look, thereês wine. Mmm. Grape juice that burns. Uh, now letês gaze into each otherês eyes, hmm? You blinked. I win."
Sheldon,"Letês see. Whatês next? Oh, kissingês romantic."
Amy,That was nice.
Sheldon,"Good. Um, the conductor said if I come back to the engine room, heêd show me how to bring the train through a crossing."
Amy,"Okay, have fun."
Sheldon,Do you want to come with me?
Amy,Really? I do.
Raj,"There you go. All cozy wozy. Here, letês see what the doctor says to keep an eye out for. Hmm. Rajesh, I was dreading Valentineês Day. Thank you for spending it with me. Yvette. Cinnamon, she-she gave me her phone number. If Iêd known it was that easy, I would have considered poisoning you months ago. Oh, what should I say? Oh, I know. Iêll point out her nameês Yvette, and that sheês a vet. Thatês hysterical. Sheêll love it."
Leonard,"Oh, hey. Youêre back. How was your trip?"
Sheldon,It was wonderful. 
Leonard,Great. What did you do?
Sheldon,"I made a new friend who likes trains as much as I do, uh, I kissed Amy on the lips, and, uh, the conductor played his banjo for me. Good night."
Leonard,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Iêm gonna need more details."
Sheldon,"Oh, well, my new friendês name was Eric. Um, Amy lips tasted like the brownie we had for dessert. Oh, and the banjo-playing conductor was missing a finger, but he made up for it with his can-do attitude."
Leonard,"No, hang on. Hang on. Are all those things equal to you?"
Sheldon,Hmm. It never occurred to me to pick a favourite.
Leonard,"Well, give it a go."
Sheldon,I canêt answer that without collecting additional data.
Leonard,Additional data. You dog.
Sheldon,"Iêm not sure how listening to other nine-fingered banjo players makes me dog, but all right."
Howard,Iêm thinking about growing a goatee.
Raj,"Oh, actually thatês a Van Dyke. A goatee is just hair on the chin."
Leonard,"Oh. Wait, then what is it if you just have hair up here?"
Raj,You mean a moo-stache?
Howard,He said it.
Raj,"Ha-ha, very funny. Make fun of the foreign guy. For your information, there are four times as many Indians as there are Americans, so the way we say it is right."
Howard,Say what?
Howard,He said it.
Bernadette,"Guys, youêre being childish."
Sheldon,"Yeah, sheês right. Youêre grown men, the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches."
Amy,"Hey, you were funny on purpose, good job."
Penny,"Hi. Sorry Iêm late, I was at an audition."
Leonard,"Oh, Iêm sorry."
Sheldon,Youêll get êem next time.
Penny,"How about instead of assuming I failed, you ask me how it went?"
Leonard,Sorry. How did it go?
Penny,Just shut up.
Raj,"Here, you can have your seat."
Penny,"No, no, no, stay there. Iêm fine on the floor."
Bernadette,Have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table?
Amy,Yeah. You actually do have room for one up there.
Raj,"Oh, sure, I sit on the floor for years, no one cares. The pretty white girlês there ten seconds, and suddenly weêre all running to IKEA."
Sheldon,No one is running anywhere. Weêre not getting a dining room table.
Leonard,"I know you donêt like change, but itês not a terrible idea."
Penny,"Yeah, you guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?"
Sheldon,Do you want the long answer or the short answer?
Howard,"Hey, how come we never get that option?"
Sheldon,"Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system, if the equations describing its behaviour are non-linear, a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result."
Leonard,Waah. I donêt want a table.
Leonard,"Hey, Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room table. You want to come with us?"
Sheldon,"You know, Iêd love to, but, um, Iêm too busy falling back in love with Windows 98."
Leonard,"Seriously? You havenêt used this desk in years. The second I want to get rid of it, youêre up here working?"
Sheldon,"I canêt talk right now, I have several thousand updates to install."
Leonard,Are you really gonna sit here all day?
Sheldon,"Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhikerês Guide to the Galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home."
Leonard,"If youêll recall, the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway."
Sheldon,"Itês a made-up story, Leonard, I donêt even know why youêre talking about it."
Leonard,Iêm putting all this stuff in storage. We donêt need any of it.
Sheldon,"You, how can you say that? You show me one thing in here we can live without."
Leonard,"Oh, hang on. Check your in-box."
Sheldon,Wait. Is this really worth it? Weêve lived together for years with nary an argument.
Sheldon,"But we start talking about a table, and suddenly weêre at each otherês throats."
Leonard,Nary an argument? Nary?
Sheldon,"Well, that means not one, or not any. Maybe instead of a table, you should buy a dictionary. Well, I donêt know if I won that, but at least heês upset."
Howard,Check it out.
Raj,Magic wand TV remote?
Howard,"Yeah, I can control all sorts of stuff."
Raj,Did Bernadette think it was cool?
Howard,Not when I said mute and pointed it at her face.
Raj,"Oh, uh, let me try. Uh, channelis changeroni. This might be my second favorite brown magic wand."
Howard,"Well, thatês the last time I play with that.  I have to take this. Hello? 00:04:24,137"
Raj,"Uh, off. And on. And the Oprah Network. This is so much better than watching TV like a muggle."
Howard,Okay. Thank you. Weêll be in touch. Youêre not gonna believe this.
Raj,Whatês going on? Oh. Wait. On. And off. Whatês going on?
Howard,That was NASA. They want me to go back up to the space station.
Raj,Wow. What did you tell them?
Howard,I told them Iêd be honoured.
Raj,"A second trip to space, Iêll miss you."
Howard,"And Iêm gonna miss you, too."
Raj,"And I just want you to know, Iêm happy to look in on Bernadette while youêre gone."
Howard,Thank you.
Raj,"And if anything were to happen to you, we will name our first born son Howard. Iêm just kidding. Weêll name him Dalib, after my grandfather."
Penny,"Ooh, this one looks nice."
Leonard,Sheldon doesnêt like reclaimed wood.
Penny,Why not?
Leonard,Heês afraid the original owners will come back.
Penny,"Yeah. Well, Sheldonês not here."
Leonard,"Well, he is here. So unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller, thereês nothing I can do about it."
Penny,"All right, sweetie, youêre paying for this table, and itês your apartment, too."
Leonard,"I know, butÑ"
Penny,No buts. You got to stop letting him boss you around.
Leonard,"Youêre right. I mean, he decides what TV shows we watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. I wanted Frodo, but we canêt both have Frodo, so guess whoês stuck with Samwise Gamgee."
Penny,"See? Right there. Youêre a grown man, you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want. Wish you wouldnêt, but one problem at a time."
Leonard,"You make a lot of sense. I like this table, and Iêm getting it."
Penny,Really? This one?
Leonard,That one? Damn right I like that one.
Howard,Good news. Someone in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket.
Bernadette,Fine. Can I at least shower first?
Howard,"No, not that. Although you already agreed to it, so no take-backs."
Bernadette,What are you talking about?
Howard,"Sit down. NASA called. The telescope mount I installed on the space station got damaged, and they want me to go back up and fix it."
Bernadette,"Wow. Well, what did you say?"
Howard,What do you think I said? I said yes. Why do you look surprised?
Bernadette,"Well, itês just, after last time, I didnêt think youêd ever want to go back."
Howard,Are you kidding? It was the greatest experience of my life.
Bernadette,Really? ‚Cause I kind of remember a lot of complaining and wishing for it to be over.
Howard,I think you have me confused with whatês gonna happen when you get out of that shower.
Leonard,"Hey, all set. What do you think? Thereês plenty of room for everybody, a view out the window."
Sheldon,My spot on the couch has a great view of a window. Sometimes I can see space battles through it. Itês called a TV.
Penny,"Give it a chance, Sheldon, you might actually like it."
Sheldon,Youêre absolutely right. Nope.
Penny,"Well, you canêt say he didnêt give it a fair shot."
Sheldon,"So, when can we get rid of it?"
Leonard,Weêre not.
Sheldon,"What about the roommate agreement? It specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the Furnishing Committee. Which only sits on alternate years. Yeah, and by the way, it sits over there."
Penny,"Come on, that is ridiculous."
Leonard,"Sheês right, a committee that important should meet more often."
Penny,Thatês not what Iêm saying.
Leonard,Oh. This is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life?
Sheldon,Okay. I think weêve found the problem here. Itês not the table at all. Itês you.
Leonard,"Well, itês always me, take one for the team."
Sheldon,"I have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will, and then you came along and reshaped him, with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals."
Penny,Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?
Leonard,Fancy sounds like a compliment.
Penny,"Okay, I have not tried to change Leonard. Thatês just what happens in relationships. Look how much Amyês changed you."
Sheldon,Thatês not true.
Penny,"Oh, please. When I first met you, you were incapable of touching another human being. Now youêre holding hands, youêre going on dates, you even made out with her on a train."
Sheldon,She told you?
Penny,"Of course she told me, itês the most interesting thing thatês ever happened to her in her entire life."
Leonard,"Youêre too close to it, but Amy has had a huge impact on you."
Sheldon,"Youêre right. Without realizing it, Iêve allowed that woman to alter my personality."
Leonard,"Mm, Sheldon, you didnêt have a personality, you just had some shows you liked."
Sheldon,"No, Iêve changed. Like the frog whoês put in a pot of water thatês heated so gradually he doesnêt realize heês boiling to death."
Penny,Or youêre the frog whoês been kissed by a princess and turned into a prince.
Leonard,"Or youêre just a tall, annoying frog."
Sheldon,Excuse me. I have to break up with my girlfriend.
Penny,"Oh, Sheldon, wait."
Sheldon,"Youêve opened my eyes to the truth. Amy has made me a more affectionate, open-minded person. And that stops now."
Leonard,"Well, we should call her."
Penny,"Yeah, mm-hmm. Amy, itês Penny. Hey. Just a little heads-up. Leonard bought a dining room table. Yeah. Sheldonês breaking up with you."
Sheldon," Amy? Iêll get right to the point. I think we need to end this relationship, so just sign this with your finger, and, uh, please donêt cry on my iPad, I didnêt get AppleCare."
Amy,"Iêm not surprised you want to end the relationship. Iêm a little surprised you didnêt get AppleCare. Anyway, enjoy your life. Where do I sign?"
Sheldon,"At the bottom. I must say, Iêm relieved youêre not making more of a scene out of this."
Amy,"Oh, Iêve already moved on. Besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me."
Sheldon,It doesnêt?
Amy,Of course not. This is just Leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship. Heês manipulating you like he always does.
Sheldon,"Wait, wait, now, hang on. You think he manipulates me?"
Amy,"All the time. And he knew that, as your girlfriend, I wasnêt gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment. I mean, a table? Come on?"
Sheldon,It is hideous.
Amy,"Well, thankfully, I wonêt have to see it, êcause I wonêt be your girlfriend anymore. Amy Farrah Fowler. Why, yes, I would like to take a survey."
Sheldon,Wait. You were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table?
Amy,Of course I was.
Sheldon,Wait. How do I know that youêre not manipulating me right now?
Amy,"I think if I were manipulating you, youêd be smart enough to see it."
Sheldon,How do I know youêre not saying that as part of the manipulation?
Amy,"I think youêd be smart enough to see that, too."
Sheldon,"Okay. Iêm sorry I gave you such a hard time, I just had to be sure."
Raj,Itês pretty exciting that NASA wants to send Howard back up.
Bernadette,"Yeah, exciting. Can I ask you something?"
Bernadette,He hated that entire experience. Does it make me an awful wife if I donêt think he should do it again?
Raj,Not at all. Heês forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. Itês like me in those moments when I miss India.
Bernadette,So youêll talk to him?
Raj,Why me?
Bernadette,"Well, Iêm his wife, I donêt want to ruin it for him."
Raj,"Thatês the dynamic, Iêm the fun one, youêre the buzzkill."
Bernadette,Since when am I the buzzkill?
Raj,Do you think this is cool?
Bernadette,"No, I think itês stupid."
Bernadette,"Youêre right, itês great."
Leonard,"Oh, hey. You guys didnêt break up."
Sheldon,"Sorry to disappoint you, but Amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me."
Amy,Which you also figured out by yourself.
Sheldon,Which I also figured out by myself.
Penny,"Well, Iêm glad youêre still together."
Sheldon,"Yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our relationship."
Amy,Which is stronger than ever.
Sheldon,"Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was."
Howard,"But it got the way it was through change. The-the-the spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only exists because, despite your objections. I bought this couch. Me. So explain why that change was bad and this change was good."
Amy,You donêt need to explain yourself to him.
Sheldon,I donêt need to explain myself to you!
Amy,Youêre sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me.
Sheldon,Keep the table. We donêt use that space.
Amy,"Damn it, I got cocky."
Howard,"Hey, Bernie. Iêm home. Hello."
Bernadette,"Hi, honey."
Howard,Whatês going on?
Bernadette,Maybe you should have a seat.
Howard,"Um, okay. I know my momês not dead, thereêd be balloons."
Raj,"Um, okay. First off, know that we all love you and cherish you."
Raj,"Oh, of course."
Howard,Massimino? Why are you here?
Howard,You donêt think I did a good job up there?
Bernadette,"I think what weêre all trying to say is, you donêt seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for you."
Raj,Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.
Howard,"Fine, maybe I was a little scared."
Howard,Youêre supposed to do that.
Howard,Hang on. That was just me joking around.
Howard,"Come on, how is that not a joke? You got to get me out of this. Shoot me in the foot."
Bernadette,Donêt forget all the other astronauts picking on you.
Raj,"And how you threw up in zero gravity, and it floated back in your mouth. And you threw up again. And so on and so on."
Howard,"Okay, so I wasnêt exactly John Glenn up there, but Iêve changed. Iêm a different man now. Yeah, and Iêm a little insulted that you guys donêt think I can handle it."
Howard,Youêve got to get me out of this.
Howard,Check my blood pressure again. I can get it higher. just give me a second.  
Howard,"Hi, Ma. How are you?"
Howard,"Go, go, go."
Raj,"Howard, Iêm so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts."
Howard,"Oh, me, too. I mean, the doctor was willing to fudge the results, but it just seemed so darned dishonest."
Leonard,But the mission wouldnêt be for at least a year. Isnêt that enough time to get your blood pressure underÑ
Howard,"Look, my blood pressureês too high, okay? Drop it."
Penny,"You know, my aunt changed her diet, and in a few months, sheÑ"
Howard,"Went to space? I donêt think so. Now, pass the soy sauce. Hey, not the green one, the red one."
Penny,"Sheldon, Amy, will you please come join us?"
Bernadette,"Yeah, itês fun up here."
Leonard,So why are you trying to ruin it?
Sheldon,"No, thanks. Weêre fine. I mean, if you people want to eat at the table, then thatês what you should do. I like eating down here because this is how weêve always done things. But if those days are gone, theyêre gone. It just makes me sad."
Bernadette,Now I feel bad.
Leonard,"Oh, donêt anthropomorphize him, heês got big eyes, but his feelings are not like ours."
Bernadette,"No, it just seems silly for us to sit in two groups."
Leonard,"Well, itês not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big, evil baby."
Bernadette,Look at Amy down there. Should we go?
Penny,"Yeah, letês go."
Leonard,"But Penny, this was your idea. You said that I should stand up to him."
Penny,"Forget it, Leonard. Itês over."
Raj,Screw that! I sat on the floor for seven years. Iêm staying right here.
Bernadette,"Come on, Raj, itês not the same without you."
Raj,Fine. But no more making fun of how I say tings.
Howard,You mean tings like moo-stache?
Sheldon,"Well, isnêt this nice. Sometimes the baby wins."
Bernadette,"Raj, your tagês sticking out."
Raj,"Thank you. That was the closest Iêve come to sex in, like, two years."
Bernadette,Now I feel a little gross.
Raj,Youêre only making it seem more real for me.
Howard,"Hey, thatês my wife. If anyoneês gonna make her feel gross about sex, itês me."
Raj,Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?
Sheldon,How about Pennyês depressing acting career?
Leonard,"Hey. I mean, itês been a little tough, but Pennyês following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing."
Penny,"Aw, thank you."
Howard,Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?
Raj,Is that a real book? I would totally read that book.
Amy,Can I borrow it when youêre done?
Penny,"Well, Iêll have you guys know I turned down a part in a movie last week."
Leonard,Why would you do that?
Penny,Because it was crap. Itês a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.
Bernadette,Serial Ape-ist? I thought you died in that.
Sheldon,She does. 42 minutes in.
Raj,"While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters."
Sheldon,I have an eidetic memory. I donêt know what his problem is.
Penny,"Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the apeês DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet."
Sheldon,"Am I missing something, or isnêt that the part she was born to play?"
Leonard,So are you really not gonna do this movie?
Penny,"Well, I donêt think itês the kind of part thatês good for my career."
Leonard,"Well, but donêt a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?"
Penny,"Okay, I donêt think Meryl Streep ever had to say _Must keep gorilla hands from killing again!î"
Raj,"If she did, it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong."
Leonard,"I donêt know anything about show business, so if you think itês reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, Iêm sure you know what youêre doing."
Amy,I think weêre gonna go.
Sheldon,Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We didnêt get to tap the juicy vein that is Howardês.
Howard,"Hey, I work at the same university you do."
Sheldon,"Yes, and Hawkeyeês in the Avengers, but no one ever says help, Hawkeye."
Bernadette,Can I ask you something? Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?
Penny,"Oh, Iêm sure he does it out of love. The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices."
Amy,I think weêre gonna go.
Leonard,"No, no, no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that youêd rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now itês a fight."
Sheldon,"Well, with that sorted out, Iêm happy to answer your question, Bernadette. Howard started it."
Howard,I didnêt do anything. I was just sitting here.
Sheldon,"I wasnêt referring to this evening. Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman."
Raj,Ha-a-a. Still funny.
Bernadette,That was ten years ago.
Sheldon,"Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over."
Howard,The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. Thatês funny.
Raj,I was there. It was funny.
Sheldon,"In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny. Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth."
Amy,Thanks for walking me to my car.
Raj,"Actually, itês for both of us. Last night, I watched West Side Story, and Iêm a little freaked out by street gangs."
Amy,Why canêt Raj find a girl? The mystery continues.
Raj,"I donêt appreciate your sarcasm, but weêve still got two blocks to go, so Iêll put up with it."
Amy,Whatever happened with your online dating?
Raj,"No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile."
Amy,"Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too. Once, I even dropped in on my OBGYN just to get some human contact."
Raj,It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.
Amy,Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.
Raj,"Youêve kissed, like, once in three years."
Amy,Thatês true. Do whatever you want.
Howard,"Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends."
Sheldon,Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.
Howard,"Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and she made some great points. You and I have known each other a long time, and I didnêt hear the rest êcause she took her bra off."
Sheldon,Very well. How do you propose we move forward?
Howard,"Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other."
Sheldon,"Thatês a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it."
Howard,"Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend. They gave me two tickets. Bernadette canêt go. You want to come with me? You can visit your mom, and Iêll show you around the space centre."
Sheldon,I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in Houston and youêve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?
Sheldon,Iêm glad because I would not have seen that coming.
Raj,"Amy, I could use some help."
Amy,Oh. Let me guess. Thereês an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.
Raj,"I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girlês profile. Sheês amazing."
Amy,"Oh, sheês cute. And smart. Phi Beta Kappa."
Raj,"And judging by her lack of Adamês apple, sheês been female her entire life. I like that in a woman."
Amy,"Great, so what do you need me for?"
Raj,"Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I wanted to run it by you first."
Amy,All right.
Raj,"Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower."
Raj,"I know. Powerful stuff, huh?"
Amy,"Youêre supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and creepy."
Raj,"Okay, Iêm getting some mixed messages here."
Amy,"Just say something normal like, I saw your profile. Looks like we have a lot in common, letês get a cup of coffee sometime.î"
Raj,Yes. Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips. Or you just write it for me.
Amy,Iêm not gonna pretend to be you.
Raj,"I donêt want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my, uh, online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up."
Amy,"Well, what would I say to her?"
Raj,"Just tell her what Iêm really like. And, if you think itêll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. Use your own words."
Sheldon,Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.
Penny,"Oh, itês no problem. Is everything okay?"
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm fine. Itês just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip. Thereês the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America."
Penny,"Remember the old days when I wouldêve said something dumb like why? Uh, that doesnêt sound good."
Sheldon,Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?
Sheldon,"Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. Penny, your check engineÑ"
Penny,"Yeah, I know itês on, Sheldon. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I cannot afford this right now."
Sheldon,"Maybe itês just something minor. Ooh, good news, the light just went out."
Leonard,Are we playing individual or teams?
Raj,Teams are fun.
Sheldon,"Oh, in that case, Iêd like to be partnered with my good friend Howard."
Raj,But Iêm always on Howardês team. Weêre best friends. The kind who finish each othersÑ
Howard,I really donêt think we do thaÑ
Raj,Do that. See?
Penny,"Oh, hi."
Leonard,"Oh, howêd it go at the mechanic?"
Penny,Not great. Can I talk to you for a sec?
Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
Raj,Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?
Howard,Isnêt it a little late to get plane tickÑ
Raj,Plane tickets? Yeah.
Howard,Will you please stoÑ
Raj,Stop that? Okay.
Penny,"I donêt know what to do. My car threw a rod and itês totaled. I canêt afford a new one, I have no job, and now I canêt drive to auditions."
Leonard,"Iêm so sorry. I know itês a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?"
Penny,I did. I called them. The partês gone. They gave it to someone else. Now that girlês gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.
Leonard,"At least they talked about you on Letterman. Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go."
Penny,"How? Unlike me, you have a job. Iêm just gonna have to go back to being a waitress, like I will be for the rest of my life."
Sheldon,"Leonard, would you wrap it up? Weêre waiting on you."
Penny,"Iêm sorry, is the fact that my lifeês falling apart interfering with your board game?"
Sheldon,"It is. You were wrong, friend Howard. She completely understood."
Raj,"Hey, you busy?"
Amy,Whatês up?
Raj,Have you heard back from Emily?
Amy,I have.
Raj,Great. And?
Amy,And Iêm afraid she doesnêt think youêre right for her.
Raj,"I give you one simple thing to do, contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it."
Amy,"I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didnêt write to her yourself. She thought it made you seem too shy and passive."
Raj,"Iêm not too shy and passive. You write her back and tell her I said that. You know, when you have a second."
Amy,"Look, Iêll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night."
Raj,Whatês happening tomorrow night?
Amy,Iêm meeting her for coffee.
Amy,"Well, we just, we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off."
Raj,"I find a girl I like, and youêre stealing her?"
Amy,"We just ended up having a lot in common. We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, weêre both hardcore into quilting."
Raj,Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.
Howard,Thatês Sheldon. He says heêll be down in a minute.
Bernadette,What are you doing?
Howard,"Oh, heês not coming out until he sees proof you donêt have an air freshener in your car."
Bernadette,This is gonna be a long weekend for you.
Howard,Youêre the reason Iêm doing it.
Bernadette,I said to stop insulting each other. I didnêt tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.
Howard,How do I know what you said? Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.
Howard,"Hey, buddy."
Bernadette,You excited for Texas?
Sheldon,"Oh, very much so."
Howard,Itês not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.
Sheldon,"Oh, whoês the real astronaut?"
Howard,Buzz Aldrin.
Sheldon,Oh. Yay.
Sheldon, Howard?
Howard,What now?
Sheldon,I have to go to the bathroom.
Howard,You just went to the bathroom.
Sheldon,"But I didnêt use it because it didnêt seem safe. Despite all my e-mails, the toilet didnêt have a seatbelt."
Howard,"Well, it still doesnêt."
Sheldon,"I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago."
Sheldon,Why are you getting annoyed?
Howard,"Iêm trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things."
Sheldon,Like when?
Howard,"When? How about in the car? Iêm an astronaut, and you know it. You just donêt like admitting it, because youêre jealous."
Sheldon,"Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me."
Howard,Thank you.
Sheldon,Because it made me realize theyêll just send anyone up there. Arenêt you going to let me out?
Sheldon,But I still need to use the bathroom.
Howard,Here you go. Be creative. Whatês the matter? Scared of a little turbulence?
Sheldon,"No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. Iêm not scared at all. Oh, apple juice, stay where you are."
Howard,"Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one."
Sheldon,I take it back. Iêm scared of turbulence!
Howard,Iêm gonna need that bag back.
Leonard,You sure you want to do this?
Penny,"Yeah. Why wouldnêt I want to get my old job back? Itêll be fun to see everyone. I havenêt talked to them since I said I quit, see you at the Oscars, bitches. Come on, letês just get this over with."
Leonard,"Letês get this over with. Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex? Iêm just, Iêm trying to lighten the mood."
Penny,I know. Thank you.
Penny,Itês just so humiliating.
Leonard,So humiliating? Am I driving you to the Cheesecake FactoryÑ? Iêm sorry. Iêll. Iêll stop. Iêll stop.
Leonard,"Come on, donêt look so sad. You never know whatês gonna happen. Maybe tonight will be great."
Penny,"Sweetie, I know youêre trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but itês making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you. This isnêt your car."
Leonard,I know. I thought weêd take yours.
Penny,I donêt understand.
Leonard,"Itês nothing fancy, but itêll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you donêt have to go back to waitressing."
Penny,I donêt know what to say.
Leonard,Donêt say anything.
Penny,"Oh, my God."
Leonard,"I mean, you could say thank you. I did just buy you a car."
Amy,"Look, I admit that itês odd that Rajesh didnêt write to you himself, but if you get to know him, youêll see heês just a sweet, regular guy. As a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty."
Raj,"Hello, Emily."
Raj,"Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy. Let me ask you something. Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say, hey, dew-kissed flower, whatês up?"
Raj,"Uh, okay, thatês a separate issue. Letês put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing."
Amy,Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?
Raj,"Not my best first date. Yeah, but not my worst, either."
Sheldon,Iêm sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you.
Howard,"Iêm sorry, too. Itês all my fault."
Sheldon,"If you werenêt my friend, thereêd be a hole in my life."
Howard,"Thank you, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled. But not as big.
Howard,Itês over.
Howard,Should we stop holding hands now?
Sheldon,In a minute.
Howard,"Okay, good."
Amy,Should you really be sitting in Sheldonês spot?
Raj,"Heês in Texas, heêll never know."
Penny,I wouldnêt be so sure about that.
Leonard,"Yeah, he has a very sensitive butt. Well, itês true. Once I saw him sit on a bunch of loose change and add it up."
Raj,Have you heard from Howard?
Bernadette,I did. His talk at NASA went great.
Penny,Sheldon didnêt heckle him?
Bernadette,"No, in fact, he was so well-behaved, Howie bought him a Buzz Aldrin bobble head and astronaut ice cream."
Amy,"Oh, hi."
Bernadette,"Hi, Stuart."
Raj,"Hey, Stuart!"
Raj,"Good. Sheldonês out of town, so we can do whatever we want. We even ordered from the Thai place he doesnêt like."
Penny,Disgusting. Do not tell him.
Leonard,What do you guys want to do tonight?
Amy,I donêt know.
Bernadette,"Well, I told Howie if I wasnêt busy, Iêd spend the night at his momês. So for Godês sake, think of something."
Raj,Stuart? Are you okay?
Leonard,"Oh, my God, Stuart?"
Penny,"Oh, my God, you guys need to do something!"
Leonard,Calling 911.
Raj,"Well, itês too late."
Leonard,What do you mean itês too late?
Raj,Heês been murdered by someone in this room.
Penny,"Oh, my God."
Leonard,"Oh, come on."
Raj,Welcome to another classic Koothrappali murder mystery dinner.
Amy,Iêm leaving.
Raj,You canêt leave. Youêre a suspect in the mysterious murder of Stuart Bloom.
Bernadette,I didnêt know his last name was Bloom.
Amy,"Yeah, itês Bloom."
Penny,Are you really gonna lie on the floor and pretend to be dead all night?
Penny,Are you gonna make us pretend to be a bunch of lame characters with silly accents?
Raj,"Lame characters with silly acÑ, what kind of actress are you?"
Penny,"Youêre right, Iêm sorry. Sounds like fun."
Raj,Thank you.
Penny,That kind of actress. This sucks.
Leonard,"Come on, guys. Raj put a lot of effort into this. And thatês great. Itês not sad, itês great."
Amy,I think it might be fun to be someone else tonight.
Raj,"Actually, youêre all just gonna be yourselves."
Amy,"Oh, ugh."
Bernadette,"All right, if Iêm doing this, Iêm playing to win, so just to be clear, if weêre ourselves, that means one of us killed Stuart?"
Raj,"Very good, Bernadette. You are a regular Byomkesh Bakshi."
Bernadette,"What is that, like, the Indian Sherlock Holmes?"
Raj,Or is Sherlock Holmes the English Byomkesh Bakshi?
Amy,"According to Wikipedia, Sherlock Holmes came first."
Raj,"Great, everyoneês a Byomkesh Bakshi. Now, here are some secret facts about each of you, including whether you are the murderer. Throughout the game, feel free to ask each other questions to uncover clues."
Penny,"Got it. Hey, whoês the murderer?"
Raj,Any question but that.
Penny,"Sorry. Hey, whoês not the murderer?"
Bernadette,What do you care? Youêre dead.
Sheldon,Thank you for my bobble head.
Howard,Thank you for not making fun of me during my speech.
Sheldon,It wasnêt easy. Was it Buzz?
Howard,We canêt show up to your momês empty-handed. We should bring something.
Sheldon,I already am. Iêm bringing the gift of knowledge.
Howard,"Oh, boy."
Sheldon,"Despite what her Bible says, recent archaeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didnêt exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later."
Howard,I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful.
Bernadette,"So, what happens next?"
Raj,I canêt tell you that. But perhaps the killer dropped a fun and imaginative clue somewhere in the apartment.
Penny,"Ooh, Iêm gonna check the fridge, and see if there are any clues inside a beer."
Amy,"Hey, I found something. It looks like a little man with a briefcase."
Leonard,"Oh, no, no. Thatês Clarence Darrow. Itês from a game Sheldon made up called Chutes and Lawyers. You slide down a chute and then work your way back up through the appellate system."
Raj,"Well, unlike that, my games are much more fun."
Penny,"Okay, can I ask you something? Why do you like making us do this stuff?"
Raj,"Well, I guess it goes back to when I was a fat kid in India, and didnêt have any friends."
Bernadette,I didnêt know you were fat.
Raj,"Yeah, I was. I was 200 pounds by the time I was in middle school. Kids were mean. Cows may be sacred there, but it doesnêt help if you look like one. Anyway, I was pretty lonely, so I had to make up my own stories and games, and I promised myself if I ever made any friends that, that I would play those games with them."
Amy,That is so sweet.
Leonard,Iêve seen old pictures of you. You were never a fat kid.
Raj,"No, I was svelte as a gazelle. A gazelle blessed with a flair for storytelling."
Bernadette,"Hey, what about this? It looks like a receipt."
Amy,Whatês it for?
Bernadette,For a cup of coffee. But itês dated 20 years from now.
Raj,From the future? How fun and imaginative.
Leonard,So one of us came back from the future to murder Stuart?
Leonard,Does the gazelle with a flair for storytelling know heês just ripping off Terminator?
Raj,"Does the smart-ass know that Terminator was actually ripped off from an Outer Limits script called Demon With a Glass Hand, by Harlan Ellison?"
Leonard,"Oh, does the gazelle know that according to Harlan Ellison, it was not ripped off from Demon With a Glass Hand, but was ripped off from another Outer Limits script he wrote called The Soldier?"
Penny,Iêm gonna need another clue.
Howard,"Okay, give me the flowers and pie."
Sheldon,"But if we show up and youêre holding them, sheêll think theyêre only from you."
Howard,They are only from me. You said the gift of you was enough.
Sheldon,"Yes, but now that Iêve seen what the gift of me with flowers and pie looks like, thereês no going back. Boy, I canêt wait to see the look on her face. Weêre leaving right now."
Howard,Whatês wrong?
Howard,"Sheldon, tell me whatês going on."
Sheldon,I saw my mommy with a naked man and she was trying to be a mommy again.
Howard,You ready to talk about it?
Sheldon,Iêm not nearly drunk enough. Okay. Do you have any idea what itês like to see your mother ravaging someone?
Howard,"Does a brisket count? Iêm sorry, buddy, thatês rough. But didnêt she know we were coming?"
Sheldon,I wanted to surprise her. What am I supposed to say to her after something like this?
Howard,"Well, did she see you in the window?"
Howard,Then donêt say anything.
Sheldon,"I have to. How can we ever hope to have a healthy relationship if I donêt tell her how disappointed I am, and that Iêll never forgive her?"
Howard,"Well, donêt do it on the phone."
Sheldon,"No, Iêm just going to tell her Iêm coming so she can give that good time Charlie the heave-ho."
Howard,"Thatês some tough talk, I may need to cut you off."
Sheldon,"Yeah, maybe you better, I took a pretty big sip."
Howard,"Look, sheês a grown woman. And, and your dadês been gone a long time. Maybe this is none of your business."
Sheldon,"I beg to differ. I used to live in those genitals. And if someone wants to move into my old room, I should at least get a vote."
Raj,"Okay, murder suspects, Leonard has found the time machine the killer mustêve used. Youêre all inside it, and we hurtle through the very fabric of time. And welcome to 20 years in the future. Hey, you guys just time-travelled. Stop looking so bored."
Penny,"Well, my beer isnêt flat and my rackês not saggy. So far, the futureês great."
Raj,"Fine, just try not to look too alive."
Bernadette,So one of us went back in time to kill Stuart?
Amy,But why?
Raj,Perhaps this will help. Here are some facts about yourselves in the future that might contain a clue.
Amy,"Hey, I won the Nobel Prize in physiology, then I used the money to buy Stuartês comic book store, and close it down so Sheldon would pay attention to me. Not the worst idea."
Penny,"Hey, Iêm a famous actress living in London."
Leonard,"Hmm, Iêm a professor at Stanford."
Bernadette,So I guess you two are making it work long distance.
Raj,"Oh, no. In this game, as your careers both took off, you drifted apart. Kind of like how future me lost touch with you guys after I became boy toy for the wrinkled, but still flexible, Madonna."
Amy,"What does your card say, Bernadette?"
Leonard,"Uh, uh, uh, hang on. Do you think weêd really drift apart if we both became successful?"
Penny,"Of course not. If I became a famous actress and had to move, you would just come with me."
Leonard,"But if I get a chance to be a tenured professor, I might not have that much choice in where I end up."
Penny,"Yeah, but if I become a successful actress, we wouldnêt need the money."
Leonard,"Well, you donêt go into science for the money."
Bernadette,"Speak for yourself. Last month, my company both invented and cured Restless Eye Syndrome. Ka-ching, ya blinky chumps."
Penny,"So, wait, if my career took me somewhere else, you might not go?"
Amy,"Dun, dun, dun. He started it."
Raj,"Okay, okay, guys, new back stories. Uh, Penny and Leonard, you two lovebirds are super successful and living in New York. Uh, youêre an actress, youêre a professor and you have three beautiful kids."
Penny,Really? You think Iêm putting this body through three kids?
Sheldon,"Okay, letês do this."
Howard,Good luck.
Sheldon,"You, arenêt you gonna come with me?"
Howard,While you confront your mother about her sex life? Iêd rather go back to that bar in ass-less chaps.
Sheldon, Mother?
Sheldon,I saw you having naked sex.
Sheldon,"Earlier, I came here to surprise you. I looked in the window and I saw you with a man."
Sheldon,Can you recommend a surface you havenêt had coitus on?
Sheldon,Who was he?
Sheldon,How long have you been involved with him?
Sheldon,"And of those few months, how long have you been a demented sex pervert?"
Sheldon,"Perhaps not. But it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life, and then desecrates one of Ethan Allenês finest sofas."
Sheldon,Or what?
Sheldon,Thatês ridiculous. I am a grown man. I am a professional scientist. And I currently occupy the moral high ground.
Sheldon,But I occupy the moral high ground.
Sheldon,But Iêm a professional scientist.
Sheldon,Iêm a grown man.
Raj,Can we please get back to the game?
Leonard,In a minute. I donêt understand why any success you have in acting is more important than any I have in science.
Penny,"Okay, if you do something cool in science, you might change the world. If I become a famous actress, Iêm not gonna tell you why movie stars are the best. They just are."
Amy,Iêm surprised you guys never talked about this stuff.
Leonard,Like you and Sheldon have everything figured out?
Amy,"Actually, our relationship agreement covers a wide array of scenarios, including career changes, financial instability, intelligent dog uprising. FYI, we plan on selling out the human race hard."
Penny,"In 20 years, who knows whatêll happen with any of us?"
Penny,You do?
Penny,Thatês so sweet.
Bernadette,What the hell?
Amy,Excuse me?
Penny,"Ah-da-da-da-da, let the dead man talk. So, why do you think that?"
Penny,"Aw, Stuart. Now I feel bad for murdering you."
Raj,"Oh, come on."
Bernadette,"Penny did it, I win. Suck it, jackasses."
Howard,"Hey, can I come in?"
Sheldon,Apparently any man is welcome in this house. Why not you? I thought you were waiting in the car.
Howard,"That was an hour ago, Sheldon. A Jew sits in front of a house in Texas that long, For Sale signs start to go up. I take it things didnêt go smoothly with your mom."
Sheldon,Iêm not sure how weêre going to get past this.
Howard,"You know, I, I sort of went through something like this myself."
Sheldon,"Howard, weêve all seen your mother naked. That woman needs to learn how to tie a robe."
Howard,Iêm talking about when my mom started seeing someone a couple of years after my dad left.
Sheldon,I didnêt know she did.
Howard,"Yeah, she was dating this guy, and I was kind of a jerk to her about it."
Sheldon,What did you do?
Howard,"Well, letês just say it was the most vicious bar mitzvah speech in the history of Temple Beth El. Anyway, she broke up with him. And sheês basically been alone ever since. She never said it, but I always felt I was the reason why."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry. Although, based on your story, you absolutely were the reason why."
Howard,All Iêm saying is you might not want to get in the way of your momês happiness.
Sheldon,You may have a point. I love my mother. Even if she fornicates like a demonic weasel.
Howard,And the healing begins.
Sheldon,I am.
Sheldon,"I think what most upsets me about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy. Doesnêt this contradict all the religious rules youêve been espousing your whole life?"
Sheldon,Then why are you doing it?
Sheldon,"Well, this is confusing for me. But I donêt want to stand in the way of your happiness. So, Iêll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance."
Sheldon,"Mother, if youêre going to conduct your life in this fashion, then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman. You know, itês not all sock hops, soda jerks and segregation anymore."
Sheldon,"My point is that youêre going to need to be careful. You used to be protected by your pre-Enlightenment mythology, but now youêre going to need a stronger friend named latex."
Sheldon,"Well, someone has to."
Sheldon,"No, donêt look to Him. Heês mad at you right now."
Penny,"Oh, come on, donêt pout. Iêm sorry I ruined your game."
Raj,"Iêm not pouting, Iêm brooding. Which is how sexy men pout."
Amy,It actually was kind of fun.
Raj,Youêre just saying that.
Bernadette,I liked the time travel element.
Raj,Thank you. I thought it was inspired.
Leonard,It was. By Terminator.
Bernadette,"Well, I hope 20 years from now, we really are all still together and still friends."
Leonard,"Of course. Well, hey, how about this? Whether weêre friends, not friends, scattered around the world, no matter what, letês all promise to meet in front of this building exactly 20 years from tonight at 8:00 p.m. and have dinner like we always do."
Penny,I love it.
Leonard,Putting it in my phone right now.
Penny,"Yeah, me, too."
Raj,And itês done.
Penny,"Yup, weêre all in."
Leonard,"All right, Iêll see you guys in 20 years."
Sheldon,"Boy, do I have to urinate."
Leonard,If only there were a solution to that.
Sheldon,Seriously. I feel like Iêve got a fish tank in my pelvis.
Leonard,So go to the bathroom.
Sheldon,I canêt.
Leonard,Why not?
Sheldon,"Because Iêm trying to decide between getting an Xbox One or a PS4. Oh, pee, whyêd I say that?"
Leonard,"Forgive me for asking a stupid question, but why are you being stupid?"
Sheldon,"Iêm not being stupid. Iêm employing the work of Dutch researcher, Mirjam Tuk, who found that people with full bladders make better decisions."
Leonard,Why did I pee before I decided to move in here?
Leonard,"Hey. Oh, howêd the audition go?"
Penny,I killed it. I was even able to cry real tears right on the spot.
Leonard,"Oh, thatês great."
Penny,"I know. Next time I get pulled over for a speeding ticket, here come the waterworks."
Sheldon,Here come the waterworks.
Leonard,Arenêt you gonna ask?
Penny,"What is this, my first day?"
Bernadette,Can I get your opinion on something that happened at work today?
Penny,"Yeah, sure."
Amy,Of course.
Bernadette,"Okay, well, I did something that will either make me look like a lovable goof or a horrible monster damned to spend eternity in hell."
Amy,Iêm sure itês lovable.
Penny,Iêm gonna go with monster. What do you got?
Bernadette,"Well, thereês this lady in our office whoês retiring, and they were passing around one of those big cards for us to sign."
Bernadette,But no one told me she was in a horrible car accident over the weekend and what I was signing was not a retirement card but was actually a get well card.
Penny,Iêm liking my odds here.
Bernadette,"So on the card, in the hospital, next to the woman whoês clinging to life are the words, _Hey, Vivian. You deserve this. And at least with you gone, no one will steal my yoghurt out of the fridge.î"
Bernadette,_LOL.î Smiley face.
Amy,"Oh, my gosh."
Bernadette,_P.S. Good luck wherever you wind up.î
Penny,"Oh. Why didnêt I put money on this?  Hey, thatês my agent. If I got the part, itês still the second best thing Iêve heard all day. Hello?"
Bernadette,Am I a terrible person?
Amy,"No, it was a mistake."
Bernadette,Am I a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card?
Amy,Now I think youêre flirting with the line. Good news?
Penny,"No, I didnêt get it."
Bernadette,Iêm so sorry.
Amy,Youêll get offered something soon.
Penny,"I kind of did. The part in that awful horror movie I passed on came back around. Apparently, itês mine if I want it."
Bernadette,Are you gonna take it?
Penny,I donêt know what to do.
Amy,"Maybe youêll get hit by a car and die. LOL, right?"
Raj,"Hey. Emily, right?"
Raj,"I, I donêt know if you remember me."
Raj,"Yes, Rajesh Koothrappali. Look, uh, I just, I wanted to say Iêm sorry. Okay? You were, like, the coolest person I ever found online, and I got really nervous and I, I just blew it."
Raj,"Well, give me a chance, you donêt even know me."
Raj,"Ah, really? Thank you. Fate has given me a rare second chance, and I swear to Vishnu Iêm not gonna blow it. Or normal words followed by a charming smile."
Sheldon,"So, first there was PlayStation, aka PS1, then PS2, PS3 and now PS4. And that makes sense. Youêd think after Xbox, thereêd be Xbox 2. But no, next came Xbox 360. Hmm? And now, after 360, comes Xbox One. Why one? Maybe thatês how many seconds of thought they put into naming it."
Amy,"Can you get the butter, please?"
Sheldon,"You know, however, with the Xbox One, I can control my entire entertainment system using voice commands. Up until now, Iêve had to use Leonard."
Amy,Then get the other one. Pass the butter.
Sheldon,Get? Hang on. I donêt feel like youêre taking this dilemma seriously.
Amy,"Fine, Sheldon. You have my undivided attention."
Sheldon,"Okay, now, the PS4 is more angular and sleek-looking."
Amy,No way.
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, itês true. But the larger size of the Xbox One may keep it from overheating."
Amy,"Well, you wouldnêt want your gaming system to overheat."
Sheldon,"No, see? Well, you absolutely would not. And furthermore, the Xbox One now comes with a Kinect included."
Sheldon,"Yes. Not sold separately. Although the PS4 uses cool new GDDR5 RAM, while the Xbox One is still using the conventional DDR3 memory."
Amy,Why would they still be using DDR3? Are they nuts?
Sheldon,See? Thatês what I thought. But then they go and throw in an ESRAM buffer.
Amy,"Whoa, whoa. Wait a second. Whoês they?"
Amy,Youêre kidding.
Sheldon,"No, I am not. And this ESRAM buffer should totally bridge the 100-gigabit-per-second bandwidth gap between the two RAM types."
Amy,This is a nightmare. How will you ever make a decision?
Amy,Please pass the butter!
Penny,"Okay, itês not me, right? This script is terrible."
Leonard,"Yeah. I had higher hopes for a movie called Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill. You know, itês still possible for you to be good in a bad movie."
Penny,"Okay.  Sometimes I feel like I can control the killer gorilla instinct inside of me, but then I see these bananas and I just want to eat them and then kill people. What am I gonna do?"
Leonard,"Well, for starters, I wouldnêt eat the bananas."
Penny,"No, come on. This is serious."
Leonard,"Uh, uh, does it at least pay well?"
Penny,Less than I was making at The Cheesecake Factory.
Leonard,What does your agent think?
Penny,Sheês thinking of taking a job at The Cheesecake Factory.
Leonard,"You know what, why donêt you just do it? Youêll go have fun for a few weeks, make some money, and who knows what it might lead to?"
Penny,"Okay, look, here, page 58. I oil-wrestle an orang-utan in a bikini."
Leonard,"Just to clarify, which one of you is wearing the bikini?"
Penny,Both of us.
Leonard,So itês a family film.
Sheldon,Thank you again for dinner.
Amy,Youêre welcome.
Sheldon,Good night.
Amy,"Uh, itês date night. Arenêt you, uh, forgetting something?"
Sheldon,"Oh, of course.  Did I mention the PS4 controllers light up?"
Sheldon,"Well, they do."
Raj,"And then after coffee, we went for a walk and she told me she always thought people from India were exotic and mysterious. So, with my mouth, I said, weêre just like anybody else, but with my eyes, I said, straight up, Red, hop on my flying carpet."
Leonard,"So, are you gonna see her again?"
Raj,"Yeah, we have plans this weekend. And if itês a clear night, Iêm gonna lay some romantic astronomy on her."
Penny,"Okay, like what? Show me."
Raj,I canêt do that to Leonard. This is some powerful panty-dropping stuff.
Leonard,You have my blessing. Go for it.
Raj,"Okay. Penny, two of the brightest stars in the night sky are Altair and Vega. And it is said they were deeply in love but forever separated by the celestial river of the Milky Way."
Penny,"Oh, thatês sad."
Raj,"It is. But once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month, Vega cries so hard that all the magpies in the world fly up and create a bridge with their wings so the two lovers can be together for a single night of passion."
Leonard,"Okay, thatês enough."
Sheldon,"Quick poll, PS4 or Xbox One? Raj?"
Raj,"Uh, Xbox One."
Howard,Both great.
Bernadette,I like the Wii.
Sheldon,"Thanks, Grandma."
Raj,"Oh, my goodness."
Leonard,Whatês up?
Raj,I just got an e-mail from my ex-girlfriend Lucy. She misses me and wants to get together.
Leonard,"Two women at the same time? Nice job, playa."
Leonard,Was it the two women thing or the playa? It was the playa.
Raj,What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to choose between Emily and Lucy?
Howard,Why do you have to choose? Date both of them.
Raj,"I canêt date two women at once. Zero women, thatês my sweet spot."
Penny,"Unless youêre sleeping with one of them, seeing other people isnêt a big deal."
Raj,"But what if one of them asks me what I was up to the night before and I was with the other one? Then, what, do I lie?"
Bernadette,"What do you mean, yes?"
Howard,"What do you mean, yes?"
Bernadette,Were you seeing other women when we started dating?
Howard,Were you seeing other men?
Leonard,Were you seeing other men?
Leonard,Arenêt you gonna ask me?
Penny,"Come on, really?"
Leonard,Thank you so much for letting us pick your brain.
Penny,"Well, Iêm having an impossible time getting my career off the ground, and I got offered a role in this crappy horror movie, and I just donêt know if I should take it."
Penny,I wouldnêt exactly call Star Trek embarrassing.
Penny,"Me, either."
Leonard,"So, what do you think, is there a professional downside to doing it?"
Penny,"Yeah, beam me up. I love it."
Penny,Thatês what Iêm afraid of.
Leonard,Sounds rough.
Leonard,"Okay, this was helpful."
Raj,Any news on your co-worker whoês in the hospital?
Bernadette,"Poor thing, she was in surgery for 18 hours. Sheês alive, but sheês still in critical condition."
Raj,"Oh, no."
Bernadette,"The one bit of good news is they put her in a medically induced coma before she read the card. So, you know, silver linings."
Howard,Were you like this when I married you?
Leonard,"Donêt worry about it, buddy. Okay, bye. That was Wil, heês feeling a lot better. Apparently, heês 12-down in the TV Guide crossword puzzle."
Raj,Did he help you make a decision about the movie?
Penny,Did you figure out what youêre gonna do about the two girls?
Raj,"As a matter of fact, I did. Iêve spent so many years living in fear, saying no to new experiences, but from now on, Iêm gonna say yes, yes to love, yes to adventure, yes to life. Whatever it may be, the answerês going to be yes."
Howard,"Heês gonna die alone, right?"
Amy,"Iêm proud of you, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"You know, Iêm proud of me, too. Iêve done all my research, I conducted an informal poll, and Iêve arrived at the rock-solid certainty Iêve made the right choice."
Amy,"Well, thatês got to be a good feeling."
Sheldon,"Oh, it is. Although."
Amy,"Oh, crap."
Sheldon,I had the same feeling when I made my dad buy a Betamax instead of a VHS.
Amy,You were just a little kid.
Sheldon,"Yeah, a little kid who picked the wrong format to record The MacNeil/Lehrer Report. Now I also was certain that HD DVD would win out over Blu-ray."
Amy,How old were you then?
Sheldon,"Old enough to know better. You know, and now that I think about it, I stood in front of a case of iPods and I bought a Zune."
Amy,Whatês a Zune?
Sheldon,"Yeah, exactly. Itês an MP3 player brought to us by the makers of Xbox."
Amy,"No, what are you doing? No, no, pick that back up. You know itês good. You did the research."
Sheldon,But what if Iêm wrong?
Amy,You know what? How about I buy it for you? How about I buy you both?
Sheldon,You know I only have one slot available in my entertainment centre.
Amy,Then Iêll buy you a new entertainment centre.
Sheldon,"Well, yeah, okay, sure. But which one?"
Amy,"How about this? Iêve heard that if you flip a coin, it will tell you how you actually feel. Because youêll either be disappointed or excited by the outcome."
Amy,"So, heads itês PS4, tails itês Xbox One."
Sheldon,"All right, Iêll try."
Amy,What is it?
Sheldon,A quarter.
Amy,Could have given it back to me. That was a choice.
Raj,"You look, you look really pretty tonight."
Raj,"Thank you. Thanks, thanks. Iêm sorry. I canêt do this. My, my ex-girlfriend e-mailed me, and Iêm seeing her Saturday, And Iêm glad you like it, itês from J. Crew."
Raj,"My friends told me it was okay to see more than one person at a time, but it, it feels like Iêm being deceitful."
Raj,"I, I have no idea. What would you do?"
Raj,"Well, to be honest, we only went on four dates, hugged twice, kissed once, and there was a handshake loaded with sexual innuendo."
Raj,"Are you, are you sure? Because this is the part of the night where Iêve said something stupid and the girl usually leaves."
Raj,"Yeah, but now you make me wonder whatês wrong with you."
Raj,Really? Because Iêm dating two women is basically the only cool thing I can say about myself.
Sheldon,"On the one hand, the Xbox One has a better camera, but the PS4 has a removable hard drive. Thoughts?"
Amy,I canêt feel my legs.
Sheldon,But I havenêt decided yet.
Amy,"Letês get you some food. You, Youêll feel better after you eat."
Amy,"What-what do you want, like, Thai food? A burger?"
Sheldon,"I donêt know. Hey, look, a quarter."
Penny,Great. Not like regret at all.
Leonard,"I got to tell you, the more I read about the primordial gravity wave discovery, the more excited I get."
Raj,I know. Being an astrophysicist right now is like being a rock star.
Howard,Only without the sex.
Raj,"Yeah, literally, none of it."
Leonard,"What do you think about it, Sheldon?"
Raj,"Are you kidding me? This may be the biggest scientific breakthrough of our lifetime. How can you, as a theoretical physicist, not care about this?"
Sheldon,"Maybe itês because Iêm not an elitist. What Iêd like to know is, how does this gravity wave breakthrough help the man on the street? You know? Whoês looking out for Joe six-pack and all his quantum physics concerns?"
Leonard,"Oh, my God, youêre jealous."
Sheldon,Why would I be jealous?
Leonard,"Oh, I donêt know. Maybe because the origin of the universe just got proven, the Higgs field just got proven, and youêve been working on string theory for the last 20 years and youêre no closer to proving it than when you started."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, Iêve had a lot on my plate. We happen to live in a golden age of television."
Sheldon,Really? Did they find evidence to support extra dimensions or supersymmetry?
Sheldon,Why would you do that? Youêre a string theorist as well.
Sheldon,Do you think heês right? Am I wasting my life on a theory that can never be proven?
Howard,Maybe. But how great is Game of Thrones?
Penny,"Hey, youêre up early."
Sheldon,I couldnêt sleep.
Penny,I told you those Walking Dead pillowcases were a bad idea.
Sheldon,"No, thatês not it."
Penny,Is something bothering you?
Sheldon,"Yes, but you wouldnêt understand."
Penny,"Oh, come on, try me."
Sheldon,"All right. Iêve devoted the prime of my life to string theory and its quest for the compactification of extra dimensions. Iêve got nothing to show for it, and I feel like a fool."
Penny,"Okay. I get it. I mean, not all the jibberjabber in the middle, but I know what itês like to put your heart and soul into something and get nothing out of it."
Sheldon,You mean your acting career?
Sheldon,Your relationship with Leonard?
Sheldon,Your failed attempt to go back to college?
Penny,"Iêm saying you and string theory sound like a relationship, and I know what itês like to be in one and realize itês never gonna turn out the way you want."
Sheldon,"I said Leonard, you said no."
Penny,Iêm talking about other guys.
Sheldon,"Okay. Well, what do you do?"
Penny,"You have to have the courage to end the relationship. You know? Break it off, shake hands, walk away."
Sheldon,I donêt know if I can do that.
Penny,"I know itês hard, honey, but in the end, thatês how you grow."
Leonard,"Penny, have you seen my good inhaler?"
Sheldon,"Break it off, shake hands, walk away."
Leonard,"Hey, howês dating two women going?"
Raj,"Um, kind of hit a bump. When I was honest and told Emily she wasnêt the only person I was seeing, it went great. So I tried the same thing with Lucy."
Raj,"She had mixed feelings. But when I said, Emily was cool with it. Emilyês the best. Why canêt you"
Leonard,Women. Who knows whatêll set êem off?
Raj,At least now I can focus all my energies on just one girl.
Howard,I hope I get to meet her as soon as possible.
Raj,Why the rush? She isnêt going anywhere.
Howard,She is. But I like that attitude.
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, is anybody interested in my old string theory books?"
Raj,Youêre really going to do this?
Sheldon,"I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out that what Iêm going through is essentially a breakup. And according to Cosmopolitan magazine, one of the most effective techniques for moving on is to get rid of all reminders of the relationship."
Howard,Youêre reading Cosmo?
Sheldon,"Yes. As it turns out, thereês an article on how to get over a breakup in literally every issue. Anyway, it suggests that I set these on fire, but the smell of burning books reminds me of church picnics in East Texas."
Howard,Whatês this?
Sheldon,"Oh, thatês just a doodle of a hyperelliptic Riemann surface."
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. Wasnêt that the basis of your postdoc fellowship?"
Sheldon,"It was. This seemed so elegant at the time, but now I realize I was just a simple country boy seduced by a big city theory with variables in all the right places."
Raj,Itês going to be okay.
Sheldon,"I know. As hard as this is, I have to move on. I canêt keep postulating multidimensional entities and get nothing in return. I have needs, too."
Howard,"So, you and Emily still together?"
Howard,I spoke to Bernadette. Sheês free tomorrow night.
Raj,"Oh, okay, great. But if weêre really gonna do a double date, then we have to go over some ground rules about Emily."
Howard,"Like when it turns out sheês made of rubber, I donêt say anything?"
Raj,Sheês very real.
Howard,"Oh, thatês what it says on the box. Right next to dishwasher safe."
Raj,See? This is exactly the kind of thing Iêm worried about you saying in front of her.
Howard,I promise Iêll be on my best behaviour.
Raj,You better be. No jokes about how close I am with my dog. Or the truth about how close I am with my dog.
Howard,You got it.
Raj,No jokes about the year I took ballet.
Howard,You took ballet?
Raj,"God, you never listen."
Leonard,Are you sure you want to do this?
Sheldon,The magazine articles suggest that one of the ways to get over a breakup is a new look.
Leonard,"What about your old look, well-groomed ventriloquist doll?"
Penny,"Oh my God, I do look like that."
Sheldon,You stop it.
Penny,"So, how do you want me to cut it?"
Sheldon,"Oh, how about Bill Gates meets Nikola Tesla?"
Leonard,"So, business in the front, science in the back."
Penny,Or I donêt cut it and maybe just style it a little.
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm in your hands. Do a good job and Iêll tell you Cosmoês ten dynamite tips to enjoy your PMS."
Penny,Can you keep him quiet? Maybe jangle some keys in front of him?
Leonard,"That doesnêt work any more. He just thinks Iêm taking him to the doctor. So, now that youêre no longer invested in string theory, what are you gonna pursue?"
Sheldon,"Oh, there are so many exciting areas. Black holes, dark matter."
Penny,"Oh, Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didnêt really understand it."
Sheldon,Donêt feel bad. Neither does he.
Penny,"Okay, what do you think?"
Sheldon,Have you ever even seen a picture of Tesla?
Leonard,"It actually looks good, Sheldon."
Penny,Doesnêt it?
Sheldon,"I suppose I could see myself in a scientific boy band. Of course, Iêd be the dreamy one and the smart one."
Amy,Sorry Iêm late. What did you do?
Penny,"I gave him a new look. Itês cute, huh?"
Amy,"Yeah, itês cute. Thatês the problem. I donêt need other girls to see him walking around like sex on a stick."
Sheldon,Sheês right. Iêm too hot.
Bernadette,Iêm excited to meet Emily.
Howard,"Me, too. I just hope he doesnêt blow it."
Bernadette,Why would you say that?
Howard,"Because heês Raj, thatês his thing. Beckham can bend it, Ralph can wreck it, Raj can blow it. Look, I donêt want it to happen, but odds are heês gonna find a way toÑ Oh, crap, I know that girl."
Howard,"In a bad way, very bad."
Raj,"Hey, guys."
Howard,"Whatever you hear tonight, just remember I love you. Hey."
Raj,"Emily, these are my good friends, Howard and Bernadette. Guys, this is Emily."
Howard,"Uh, no. I, I donêt, I donêt think so."
Howard,"Well, you sure donêt. You I know, you I know, you? Total stranger. Even if you had yummy candy, I would not get in your van."
Howard,That must be it.
Raj,Since when do you go to spin class?
Howard,Wow. Now who doesnêt listen?
Amy,"Sheldon, your foodês getting cold. What are you doing?"
Sheldon,"Oh, looking through my textbooks for a new field of inquiry. Why do we have a geology book? Leonard, did you throw a childrenês party while I was in Texas?"
Penny,Wait. Whatês wrong with geology?
Sheldon,"Let me put this in a way youêll understand, Penny. You remember how you explained to me that the Kardashians arenêt real celebrities? Well, geology is the Kardashians of science."
Sheldon,Have you considered studying standard model physics?
Sheldon,"You want me to give up string theory for something thatês less advanced? You know, why donêt you break up with Penny and start dating a brown bear?"
Penny,Like you could get a brown bear.
Leonard,"Hey, Iêve got a good job. I could buy salmon. You donêt know."
Amy,Maybe you could make your new field of study the calculation of nuclear matrix elements.
Sheldon,"Oh, please. If I wanted to take up a fad, Iêd get a tramp stamp."
Leonard,What about loop quantum gravity?
Sheldon,"Oh, Duchess, look at me. My quantum gravityês positively loopy."
Penny,Whoês the duchess?
Leonard,One of the people that lives in his head.
Amy,I hope heês this distraught if he ever breaks up with me.
Leonard,"Well, if he does, Iêll see if my bear has a friend."
Penny,"Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new? I mean, why donêt you take your time, enjoy your freedom? Maybe something new to study will find you."
Sheldon,"Thatês actually not bad advice. You know, I didnêt seek out string theory. It just hit me over the head one day."
Amy,How does that happen?
Sheldon,A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.
Penny,"Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?"
Sheldon,"Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice thatês been predigested by a fungus?"
Penny,And you wonder why other children beat you with books. Cheers!
Bernadette,"Emily, what do you do?"
Raj,"Mmm, and you know what that means. Someoneês skinês about to be softer than ever."
Raj,"Oh, uh, Howard was an astronaut. Maybe thatês where you saw him."
Howard,"It was the most incredible experience of my life. Up there in the space station, youêreÑ"
Howard,Can I finish my astronaut story?
Howard,Please donêt say it.
Howard,Please donêt say it.
Howard,Youêre saying it.
Raj,"Wh, what happened?"
Bernadette,"Yeah, what happened?"
Howard,"Okay, Iêll say it. I was on the way to pick her up. My stomach felt a little funny. When I got there, I asked if I could use her bathroom."
Bernadette,Please donêt say it.
Howard,"One roll of toilet paper and 20 minutes later, I was so humiliated, I snuck out the window and never saw her again."
Howard,"Iêm sorry. I tried to unclog it, but you didnêt have a plunger, and water was spilling out everywhere."
Howard,"Look, I have felt terrible about this for years, and Iêm glad I have the opportunity to tell you just how sorry I am."
Raj,Get it? Because you clogged up her bathroom like a radioactive monster!
Howard,"Yeah, yeah, I get it."
Howard,"Well, hey, itês not like cotton candy comes out of you."
Amy,"Come on, letês get you to bed. Youêve had a lot to drink."
Sheldon,No more than Penny.
Amy,Thatês what Iêm saying.
Sheldon,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Empty room. If somebody says come in, Iêm gonna freak out."
Bernadette,"So, Emily, why did you decide to specialize in dermatology?"
Bernadette,"Youêre kidding, right?"
Raj,"Sheês scary, but itês a cute scary."
Howard,"Can I say just one more thing? I had some kind of food poisoning that day. Sure, in retrospect, gas station sushi, maybe not the best choice. Nor was climbing out your window and running away. But I think we can all understand how humiliating that was, and Iêd really appreciate it if we could move on."
Bernadette,"Howie, we moved on a long time ago."
Howard,Iêm just sayingÑ
Bernadette,We moved on.
Howard,Okay. Fine.
Bernadette,Howês your soup?
Howard,"Ah, itês all right. They couldêve filled the bowl a little more. Excuse me."
Bernadette,Where are you going?
Howard,I need some fresh air.
Sheldon,"Oh, no. What have I done?"
Leonard,How you feeling?
Sheldon,Not so good.
Leonard,Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?
Sheldon,Itês not my friend. Nothing happened.
Leonard,I donêt know. I heard you reading pretty loud last night.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord. Whereês Amy?"
Leonard,"After she put you to bed, she went home."
Sheldon,"Oh. I should call her and apologize. Oh, no."
Sheldon,"Apparently, I called Stephen Hawking last night."
Sheldon,"Hawkman. Itês your old buddy Sheldonoscopy. How come you didnêt pick up the phone? Oh, right. My bad."
Howard,Youêre awful quiet. Everything okay?
Sheldon,Not really. I had a bit of an embarrassing evening.
Howard,"Ugh. Me, too. What happened?"
Sheldon,I drank alcohol and may have left an unfortunate voice mail for Stephen Hawking.
Howard,I wouldnêt worry about it. Heês got a pretty good sense of humour.
Sheldon,"Oh, I hope so. What happened to you last night?"
Howard,"Oh, well, turns out Iêd already met the girl Raj is seeing when I did a number on her bathroom. And that number was two."
Sheldon,"Well, you know, Iêve always been a fan of a story told by Attar of Nishapur, about a king who assembled a group of wise men to create a ring that would make him happy when he was sad. And that ring was inscribed with the phrase, this too shall pass."
Howard,"Get out of here, Barry."
Sheldon,Clogzilla. Thatês pretty funny. I donêt think thatês gonna pass.
Sheldon,"Itês me again. I gave up string theory. You should give up black holes, and we can totally solve crimes together."
Sheldon,Do you know whatês great? Geology. Oh. Look at this geode. Thatês fun to say. Gee-ode. Gee-ode.
Sheldon,Gee-ode. Gee-ode. I kiss girls now.
Sheldon,"Hey, guess who I am. Beep bop boop bop. Iêm you. Get it?"
Sheldon,"Are you mad at me? Oh, no, youêre mad at me. Iêm so sorry. Beep bop boop bop."
Sheldon,"Thiospinel sulfide. Thiospinel sulfide. Thatês even more fun than gee-ode. Hey, did you see The Lego Movie?"
Penny,"So, weêre about to shoot this scene in the movie where the killer ape DNA is slowly taking over my body."
Penny,"But I realize theyêre gluing fur everywhere except my cleavage. So, I asked the director why and he says, itês important to the story that my boobs be the last things to turn ape."
Leonard,Itês sweet that he thinks thereês a story.
Penny,"Oh, and thereês not even a bathroom on set. I have to go to the gas station across the street. I mean, I was dressed like half an ape and still not even close to the most disgusting person in there."
Sheldon,"Leonard, I could use your assistance."
Leonard,Sure. Whatês up?
Sheldon,"Well, now that Iêve given up string theory, Iêm struggling to find my next area of focus. So, in your professional opinion, which of these areas do you think is the most promising?"
Leonard,"Huh, well, I think thereês some really innovative stuff going on in dark matter."
Sheldon,Thatês helpful. Okay. Of these four areasÑ
Penny,"Sheldon, what did we say about being a nicer friend?"
Leonard,Thank you.
Penny,"Leonard, what did we say about being a gullible weenie?"
Sheldon,It is just so frustrating.
Penny,"‚Cause youêre trying too hard. You need to do something else, get your mind off it."
Leonard,Hey. How about we bring back Anything Can Happen Thursdays?
Penny,"Hey, thatês good. Whyêd you guys stop doing that?"
Leonard,You made fun of us. Said it was stupid.
Penny,"Yeah. Sounds like me. Come on, Sheldon. What do you say?"
Sheldon,All right. I officially reinstate Anything Can Happen Thursday.
Leonard,"Great, what do you want to do?"
Sheldon,I donêt know. What do you want to do?
Penny,I donêt know. What do you want to do?
Leonard,Iêm starting to remember the problem with Anything Can Happen Thursdays.
Sheldon,"Hmm, what can we do thatês fun?"
Leonard,What can we do thatês different?
Penny,What can we do thatês free?
Sheldon,"Oh, got it. We order a pizza."
Penny,Are you kidding? Thatês what you always do. Think harder.
Sheldon,"Youêre right. Youêre right. Got it. We order calzones, cut them open, eat them like pizza. All right, all right, Iêll shake the brain bush one more time, see what falls out. Got it. Thereês a live-action role-playing group that meets every Thursday night in Griffith Park and re-enacts battles from Lord of the Rings."
Penny,"Uh, tell me more about this calzone idea."
Leonard,"You know what? Why donêt we just ease into this. Let, letês go for a walk and, and, and see if we find a new restaurant."
Sheldon,Any chance that restaurant is near Griffith Park?
Sheldon,All right.
Leonard,"Raj and Howard are at Howardês momês, but should we call the girls and see if they want to come?"
Penny,Bernadetteês working late.
Sheldon,Amyês sick.
Leonard,Aw. Whatês wrong with her?
Sheldon,"Well, she talks a lot. She always wants to hold hands."
Leonard,Thatês not what I meant.
Sheldon,"Well, if you were referring to her illness your question should have been, what ails her?"
Leonard,What ails her?
Sheldon,Oh. Who knows?
Penny,"Come on, anything can happen. We can push him down the stairs."
Howard,Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out.
Raj,No problem. Howês your mom feeling?
Howard,"Okay, but sheêd feel better if she took her medicine."
Raj,"You know, when Cinnamon wonêt take her medicine, I hide it in a piece of cheese."
Howard,"Good idea. We can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to Cinnamon, and then my mom can eat Cinnamon. So what do you feel like doing?"
Raj,I was thinking we could watch a DVD.
Howard,"Well, my mom doesnêt have a lot to choose from. Unless you want to watch the video of her colonoscopy. Spoiler alert, 20 minutes in they find a prune pit."
Raj,"Actually, how do you feel about watching House of 1000 Corpses?"
Howard,A straight-up gore-fest? You hate this stuff.
Raj,"I do, but for some reason, Emily loves it and wants to watch it with me tomorrow, so I thought if I start with you first, then I could act cool about it with her."
Howard,"Thatês actually not a bad plan. I can sit through the colonoscopy now, but that first time I was like, oh my God, a prune pit."
Raj,"Uh, so, youêll watch it?"
Raj,Youêre a good friend. I owe you one.
Raj,Not that one.
Sheldon,"So, weêre just randomly choosing a restaurant without researching it online?"
Sheldon,"Great. You know, this is how Anything Can Happen Thursday turns into It Wonêt Stop Coming Up Friday."
Leonard,"Hey, how about that Asian fusion place?"
Sheldon,Fusion and Asians? Iêm trying not to think about science.
Penny,What the hell? Sheês not working late.
Sheldon,And Amy doesnêt look sick.
Penny,Why would they lie to us?
Sheldon,Thatês a good question.  Amy and Bernadette. Why did you lie to us?
Raj,"Hey. Listen to this. Murder, cannibalism and satanic rituals are just a few of the thousand plus horrors that await."
Howard,"I just helped my mom out of the tub, so, Iêm one slippery horror ahead of you."
Raj,Youêre a good son. I donêt know how you do it.
Howard,"Beach blankets, my friend, itês all about beach blankets."
Raj,"All right, letês get this over with. Ew, itês got someoneês hair on it."
Howard,"Oh, yeah, youêre gonna do great with this movie."
Penny,Youêre not working late. Why did you lie to me?
Sheldon,"And Amy, you told me you were sick, but you look just as pale and tired as always."
Amy,"Iêm sorry, I just needed a break from hearing you obsess about what to do after string theory."
Bernadette,We kind of just wanted one night where we didnêt have to hear about how miserable you are making this movie.
Amy,But none of that means we donêt love you.
Penny,I havenêt been complaining that much about the movie. Have I?
Leonard,I also love you.
Penny,"Well you know what? Maybe I need a break from all of you. Come on, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Where are we going?
Penny,"Weêre gonna have Anything Can Happen Thursday, youêre gonna tell me all about your science stuff and Iêm gonna complain about my movie, and weêre gonna support each other because thatês what friends do."
Sheldon,"Okay. ‚Cause if I had to pick now, Iêd probably go with dark matter becauseÑ"
Penny,Shut up.
Penny,Whatês wrong?
Sheldon,I donêt understand my food. Chinese noodles with Korean barbecue in a taco.
Penny,Itês fusion.
Sheldon,My mother would lock her car doors if she had to drive through this hodgepodge of ethnicity.
Penny,Think Iêve been complaining too much about the movie?
Sheldon,Not at all.
Penny,Thank you.
Sheldon,"But to be fair, when you talk, most of what you say sounds like, wah, wah, wah, clothes, wah, wah, wah."
Penny,"Hey, I donêt understand why youêre not upset with Amy."
Sheldon,I am. So much so that Iêm gonna bring her here for dinner on our next date night.
Raj,"Okay. So, in the last 20 minutes, weêve seen a crazy woman kissing a fetus in a jar. Weêve seen a guy cut in half and sewn to a fish."
Howard,And the brutal dismemberment of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.
Raj,"On the bright side, she didnêt even notice the pill. Why does Emily like this stuff? Do you think thereês something psychologically wrong with her?"
Howard,What difference does it make?
Raj,What do you mean?
Howard,"Oh, come on, she could have a freezer full of ex-boyfriendês body parts and youêd still go out with her."
Raj,I do like that the ex-boyfriendês out of the picture.
Amy,I feel so bad about lying to Sheldon. How am I gonna make it up to him?
Bernadette,"Iêd tell you what I do with Howard, but I donêt think dressing up like a Catholic schoolgirl is gonna work with Sheldon."
Leonard,Heêd probably give you homework.
Amy,Did you lie to Howard about tonight?
Bernadette,Of course.
Amy,And you donêt feel guilty about it?
Bernadette,"Between Pennyês gorilla movie and Howardês gorilla mother, I had no choice."
Leonard,Thankfully Penny and I have a relationship based on honesty. I donêt lie to her.
Bernadette,"Oh, we know you donêt lie to her."
Penny,"Thank you. Hey, maybe the answer to your career question is in one of these."
Sheldon,"Penny, thereês only one cookie with something in the middle that solves lifeês problems, and thatês an Oreo. Or a Nutter Butter, if youêre in a pinch."
Penny,"Come on, open it. I bet it says something great."
Sheldon,"This is Asian fusion. For all you know, thereês a tiny Chihuahua in here."
Penny,"Fine, Iêll go. Hmm. People turn to you for guidance and wisdom. Yeah, thatês a good one."
Sheldon,"No, itês not."
Penny,How is that not good?
Sheldon,"Turn to you for wisdom? Clearly, that cookie is mocking you. Youêd never hear that kind of sass from a Nutter Butter."
Penny,"Uh, since youêre paying for dinner, Iêll let that slide. Open yours."
Sheldon,Have you ever paid for a meal?
Penny,Not with money. Read.
Sheldon,Your warm and fun-loving nature delights those around you.
Penny,"Oh, try again."
Howard,"Let me get this straight. So, he kills this girlês father, cuts off the guyês face, and is wearing it as a mask while he makes out with her."
Raj,Iêm just gonna say it. Thatês not okay. Why canêt I be in a relationship with a girl who likes The Sound of Music?
Howard,"Raj, you are the girl in the relationship who likes The Sound of Music.  Hey, Penny. Whatês up? No, Bernieês working late. Really? Thanks for telling me."
Howard,Iêm having sex with a Catholic schoolgirl tonight.
Penny,"Oh, I think I see our next stop."
Sheldon,"You canêt be serious. If I wanted to waste my time on nonsense, Iêd follow Leonard on Instagram."
Penny,"No, come on, tonight we are trying new things."
Sheldon,Oh. Thatês a lot of incense. Or someone set a hippie on fire.
Bernadette,"Yeah, honey, Iêm still stuck at work. Really? Penny said that? Okay, itês true. Iêm sorry. Iêll see you at home. Yeah, yeah, Iêll put it on."
Leonard,You and I never just hang out like this. Why is that?
Amy,"I know, itês weird, right?"
Leonard,Yeah. We should do it more often.
Amy,"Oh, no. I mean, this is weird right now."
Leonard," Ah, itês Penny."
Amy,Is she still mad?
Leonard,"Oh, doesnêt seem like it. She got Sheldon to go to a psychic with her."
Amy,"A psychic? He considers them not just mumbo jumbo, but extra-jumbo mumbo jumbo."
Leonard,"Well, Penny can be very persuasive. Sheês gotten me to do a lot of things I wouldnêt normally do."
Amy,Because she has sex with you.
Leonard,"Yeah, she does."
Amy,"Can I confess something? Once in a while, I get a little jealous of how close Penny and Sheldon are."
Amy,"I mean, not in a romantic way. Itês just, she really has some sort of connection with him."
Leonard,"Well, well theyêve known each other a long time, and Penny grew up around horses, so she knows how to approach him without making him skittish."
Amy,"Donêt get me wrong, Iêm glad theyêre friends. I just wish heêd be that comfortable around me already."
Leonard,"Well, it took him a long time to get comfortable around me, too."
Amy,Really? What did you do?
Leonard,Something terrible in a former life? I donêt know.
Bernadette,"I gotta go. Penny ratted me out. FYI, sheês getting you a watch for your birthday with money she took out of your wallet."
Sheldon,"I donêt mean to be rude or discourteous, but before we begin, Iêd just like to say there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support clairvoyance of any kind. Which means, and again, no insult intended, that youêre a fraud, your profession is a swindle, and, uh, your livelihood is dependent on the gullibility of stupid people. Again, no offence."
Penny,"All right, Sheldon, just ask your question."
Sheldon,"Okay, I just did. What was it?"
Penny,"Oh, for Godês sake. Look, heês a physicist whoês trying to figure out what his next field of study should be."
Sheldon,"For your information, I was asking her about the next Star Trek movie."
Penny,"Okay, I can answer that one, Iêll be bored."
Sheldon,Thatês an easy guess. Iêm clearly an annoying person and have problems with both genders.
Penny,"Oh, oh, here we go."
Penny,"Yes, yes, your spirit guides are on fire."
Sheldon,"The majority of people have dark hair. Even you, at one time."
Sheldon,"Ha. The opposite. Sheês a neurobiologist, and Iêm a theoretical physicist. My spirit guides can go suck an egg."
Penny,"Oh, he does. He so does. What should he do?"
Penny,"Sheldon, do you hear that? I mean, Amy is the key to your happiness."
Sheldon,"You know what this is? Yeah, and I reserve this word for those rare instances when itês truly deserved. This is malarkey."
Penny,"Wow, you really struck a nerve. Iêve never heard him use the M word before."
Raj,"Here we go, House of a 1,000 Corpses."
Raj,"Actually, I have to tell you something. These kind of movies really arenêt my thing, so, last night, I watched it just to see what I was getting myself into."
Raj,"And I have to be honest, I thought it was disturbing and weird, and it made me wonder what it says about someone who enjoys it."
Raj,"Then, why do you watch these things?"
Raj,And play.
Sheldon,Hello. I didnêt expect you this evening.
Amy,"Well, I was just feeling so bad about lying to you the other night, I wanted to make it up to you."
Sheldon,"And how do you propose to do that?  Unless you have Gravity on Blu-ray under that skirt, I donêt know where youêre going with this."
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, Star Wars Day is rapidly approaching. We should finalize our plans."
Penny,"Thatês a real thing? What is it, Star Wars Christmas?"
Howard,Donêt be ridiculous. Thatês Wookiee Life Day.
Penny,"So, when is it?"
Leonard,"Uh, well, itês not May the fifth, and itês not May the third. Itês May the fourth."
Sheldon,Get it?
Raj,May the fourth be with you?
Leonard,May the force be with you. Get it?
Penny,"Oh, no. This face wasnêt because I didnêt get it."
Sheldon,Come in.
Leonard,"Hey, you got a second?"
Sheldon,"Yes. Actually, Iêm glad youêre here. Iêm working on the Star Wars Day schedule. Now, I have a window built in after Phantom Menace for complaining, but Iêm worried an hour wonêt be enough time."
Leonard,"Sheldon, Iêve got some bad news."
Sheldon,What is it?
Leonard,I just read online that Arthur Jeffries passed away.
Sheldon,Professor Proton is dead?
Leonard,"Sorry, buddy."
Sheldon,What are you doing?
Leonard,Comforting you?
Sheldon,"Your heart might be in the right place, but your head, chest and arms certainly arenêt."
Leonard,"Anyway, the, the funeralês on Sunday."
Sheldon,"But, thatês Star Wars Day."
Leonard,"Yeah, um, of all the things about this that are sad, that might not be number one. You okay? I know he meant a lot to you."
Sheldon,Iêm fine.
Leonard,Okay. Yet he cried when they changed the Raisin Bran box.
Amy,Watching your old friend?
Sheldon,"Hmm. Yes. Look at him, Amy. Itês such a shame. Struck down in the prime of my life."
Amy,Do you want me to go to the funeral with you?
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm not going to the funeral."
Amy,Why not?
Sheldon,"All those people blowing their noses. You canêt tell the sick from the sad. Mm. Iêll be at home celebrating Star Wars Day, as planned."
Amy,Are you sure you donêt want to go say good-bye?
Sheldon,"Amy, mourning the inevitable is a complete waste of time."
Amy,And watching a bunch of goofy space movies youêve seen hundreds of times isnêt?
Sheldon,"If we were in a physical relationship, you just lost sex tonight."
Penny,"Hey, guys."
Raj,"Hey, Penny. Happy Star Wars Day."
Raj,Can I make you breakfast? Admiral Ackbarês Snack Bar is open for business.
Penny,"No, thanks. Leonard and I are just going to the funeral."
Howard,You sure. Not even coffee? We have R2-Decaf. Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?
Raj,And if youêre not in the mood for coffee I can always make you a Chai Tea-3PO.
Penny,"Oh, I get it, like C3PO. What happened to me?"
Raj,"Hey, uh, Sheldon, you want anything?"
Sheldon,"Uh, no, thank you."
Howard,Youêre being so quiet. Are you upset or are you just rebooting?
Sheldon,Iêm fine.
Penny,"Sweetie, are you sure you donêt want to come with us to the funeral?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I appreciate the offer, but Arthur is gone and thereês nothing I can do about it. When Darth Vader struck down Obi-Wan, did Luke cry like a baby and go to his funeral?"
Penny,"No, he blew up the Death Star. Why do I know this?"
Sheldon,"Arthur Jeffries was a scientist. Iêm sure he didnêt care about silly superstitions like funerals. You know, if he were here, I think heêd say enjoy Star Wars Day."
Leonard,"He was 84, heêd say whereês my pudding?"
Raj,"Before you go, at least let me pack you some Attack of the Scones for the road."
Penny,"Oh, like Attack of the Clones. We are leaving right now."
Amy,Arthur passing away was harder on Sheldon than heês ready to admit. Really hoping this will cheer him up.
Bernadette,"Me, too. Although, it mightêve been thoughtless of us to bake a Death Star cake."
Amy,"No, it combines two of Sheldonês favorite things, chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button."
Bernadette,"Well, anyway, itêll be a nice surprise for the boys. And Howie doesnêt think I take his interests seriously, so hopefully this will keep him fooled for a while."
Amy,"Okay, letês get the fondant and start decorating."
Bernadette,This is pretty cool. You donêt see too many spherical cakes.
Amy,I wonder why that is.
Penny,I have a confession to make.
Penny,Iêve never been to a funeral before.
Penny,"I just never knew anyone that died. I had a pet pig when I was a kid. I mean, when he died, we didnêt have a funeral, we had a barbecue."
Leonard,"Yeah, we wonêt be eating Arthur tonight."
Penny,"I didnêt know him very well, but I still really liked him. Itês weird that heês just gone."
Leonard,I know.
Penny,I feel like I want to cry.
Leonard,"Oh thatês, thatês fine. Go ahead."
Penny,I canêt do it with you staring at me.
Penny,"No, Iêm dry. Youêre a big crybaby, you start, Iêll join in."
Leonard,I am not a crybaby.
Penny,Toy Story 3?
Leonard,"The toys were holding hands in a furnace. Look, Arthur lived a full life. And he inspired a lot of people. Sure, he, he was my childhood hero, but the fact that I got to work with him, side by side, before he died was, it was, it was a gift."
Penny,It was a gift. Thank you for being the emotional one in this relationship.
Leonard,I got your back.
Sheldon,"Okay, here we go. Episode I: The Phantom Menace."
Raj,"Ugh, letês get this over with."
Howard,"Since we all agree Episode I isnêt our favourite, maybe we just skip it this time."
Sheldon,"Howard, I think you of all people should avoid espousing the principle that if something is not our favourite we should just get rid of it."
Raj,"You know, I heard of this way of watching the movies called the Machete Order, where you watch Episodes IV and V, then skip Episode I, watch II and III as a flashback, and then finish with VI."
Howard,"Okay, so youêd lose most of Jar Jar, all the trade route talk and the boring senate hearings, which are like watching C-SPAN with monsters."
Sheldon,Get rid of the trade route part? Then how would Palpatine get Chancellor Valorum kicked out of office? How would he get himself elected? How? Can we get through one holiday without you saying something ridiculous?
Raj,It was just a suggestion.
Sheldon,"Well, you know what else was just a suggestion? Why donêt we change the Raisin Bran box? Hmm? And you know who got hurt by that? Every single person who eats breakfast."
Howard,I think heês taking this Professor Proton thing pretty hard.
Raj,Should we try to console him?
Howard,Or should we respect his privacy in this moment of grief?
Raj,By staying here and watching the movie.
Howard,Thatês what good friends would do.
Howard,"Well, at least without Sheldon here, we got to start with Episode IV."
Raj,"Mm, true. I do feel guilty about him."
Howard,"Me, too."
Raj,Maybe we should see how heês doing.
Raj,But after the cantina scene.
Sheldon,"Look at Arthur, cracking up at a joke I told him. Iêll never hear that laugh again."
Sheldon,Arthur. I thought you were dead.
Sheldon,Why are you here?
Sheldon,I know why. Youêve come to me because youêre my Obi-Wan.
Sheldon,"Wow. Uh, youêre dead, so Iêm going to let that slide. Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars. After his physical demise, he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form."
Sheldon,You must be here to give me advice.
Sheldon,Those are your Jedi robes.
Sheldon,Be careful with that.
Leonard,"So, what did you think of your first funeral?"
Penny,"Well, I donêt want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer."
Leonard,"Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house."
Penny,You think about dying?
Leonard,"Mm. Well, I think more about if Iêd have any regrets."
Penny,What would you regret?
Leonard,"Mm, you know, that I didnêt travel more, take more risks, learn another language."
Penny,You know Klingon.
Leonard,Thatês true.
Penny,"No, I meant that as a regret."
Leonard,I just thought of one more.
Penny,Whatês that?
Leonard,I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.
Penny,"Well, it just wasnêt the right time."
Penny,And this is also not the right time. Do not propose.
Penny,I know that face. Thatês your propose face.
Leonard,I was not gonna propose. Itês already two to one.
Penny,Whatês two to one?
Leonard,"I proposed twice, you proposed once. Two to one."
Penny,"Oh, my. Itês not a contest."
Leonard,I donêt know what youêre upset about. Iêm the one whoês losing.
Penny,Okay. Fine. Would you feel better if I propose so you could turn me down again?
Leonard,"Yeah, I think I would."
Penny,"Okay. Leonard, will you marry me?"
Penny,"No, donêt you dare. You reject me right now and tie things up."
Leonard,Itês just such a big decision. I donêt want to have any regrets.
Amy,Did you ever watch Professor Proton when you were a kid?
Bernadette,"My dad controlled the TV, so unless someone was a Texas Ranger, Jake or the Fatman, we didnêt see it."
Amy,"I never watched him, either, but he seems to be the reason that Sheldon got interested in science."
Bernadette,"Not me. I got into science êcause I was always the smallest kid in school, so I thought if I became a scientist, I could invent a formula that made me taller."
Amy,Thatês cute.
Bernadette,"Yeah, I thought it was working for a while, but then I found out my brother was just lowering the pencil marks on the door frame. How about you?"
Amy,"Oh, I guess it must have been back when I was in the Girl Sprouts."
Bernadette,Girl Sprouts?
Amy,My mom made it up as an alternative to the Girl Scouts. She didnêt want me selling cookies on some street corner like a whore.
Bernadette,How did that get you into science?
Amy,"Oh, I went to the library and took out a book on biology to see what whores did."
Leonard,"On the one hand, if I say yesÑ"
Penny,This isnêt funny anymore. Just say no so weêre done with this. Will you marry me or not?
Leonard,"Ooh, interesting. Did you just propose to me again?"
Leonard,"Really? Because I just heard will you marry me? Thatês two proposals, one day. Sounds like someone wants to spend the rest of her life telling people how to spell the name Hofstadter."
Penny,You know what? Fine. Do whatever you want.
Leonard,"Hey. Penny, donêt get upset. Here. I love you, but, no, I will not marry you."
Penny,Thank you.
Leonard,"Now, about that second proposal. On the one handÑ"
Sheldon,This is the swampland of Dagobah. Itês where Luke was trained in the ways of the Jedi.
Sheldon,"When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice. So, um, what do you got for me?"
Sheldon,Thatês it? I thought thereêd be more of a reason why youêre here.
Sheldon,I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.
Sheldon,"Oh, no. Iêve already had to say good-bye to 11 Dr. Whos."
Sheldon,"Of course, my grandfather died when I was five. My father died when I was 14."
Sheldon,"And now youêre gone, too. Itês like all the men Iêve looked up to have gone away."
Sheldon,But I do appreciate them.
Leonard,"Hey, buddy. Heard youêre having a rough day. You all right?"
Sheldon,Iêm okay. How was the funeral?
Leonard,"It was nice, you know. A lot of people showed up, told some great stories about him. Did you know that Arthurês son is a high school sciÑ?  Hey, the guys are about to start Jedi. You want to go watch?"
Sheldon,I do. After I make them go back and watch one through five first.
Leonard,"Sheldon, that, thatêll take us all night."
Sheldon,"Thatês true. Oh, itês a good thing I had a nap."
Howard,"Boy, some of the physical comedy with Jar Jar is a little tough to watch."
Leonard,At least they toned him down in the second one.
Penny,"Yeah, he is pretty stupid."
Raj,"Hey, we can say it. You canêt."
Amy,"Hey, guys."
Bernadette,Happy Star Wars Day.
Sheldon,Wow. A Death Star cake.
Amy,Yeah. We were hoping it might cheer you up.
Bernadette,"And even though it meant we had to miss the movies, we could still be part of the fun."
Howard,"Well, you didnêt miss anything. We just started over."
Bernadette,Son of a bitch.
Sheldon,Youêre back.
Sheldon,Thatês nice.
Sheldon,Why do I need you now?
Sheldon,Not at all.
Bernadette,Almost there. Youêre doing great.
Howard,"Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box."
Raj,Please hurry.
Howard,The doctor says you need to get exercise.
Howard,Crushing my will to live isnêt exercise.
Raj,"If she isnêt gonna use it, then why are we doing this?"
Howard,Sheêll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham.
Raj,All right. Now what?
Bernadette,We set it up in Howieês old room.
Raj,Do you know how to set it up?
Howard,"Please, Iêm an MIT-trained engineer. I think I can handleÑ Ma, look out."
Raj,So sheês gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.
Leonard,Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.
Amy,Should we do something for her?
Sheldon,I know. Letês go see the new Spider-Man movie.
Amy,"Sheldon, weêre talking about your friendês mother. She got hurt."
Sheldon,"I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. Itês called reading the room, Amy."
Leonard,"Hey, how were things on the set?"
Penny,"Uh, pretty good, actually."
Raj,So the movieês not as bad as you thought?
Penny,"Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining about it, Iêm just gonna go in every day and give it my all."
Amy,Good for you.
Penny,Thanks. Thereês no reason why I shouldnêt be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyoneês ever seen.
Leonard,I donêt know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindlerês List is tough to beat.
Sheldon,"Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust."
Leonard,"It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon."
Sheldon,I know.
Howard,"Okay, sheês all settled in the guest room."
Bernadette,Maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.
Howard,You mean a forklift?
Howard,Iêm sorry. I just canêt deal with this right now.
Bernadette,Taking care of your own mother? How can you say that?
Howard,"Bernie, sheês gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks. Are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to the toilet?"
Bernadette,I would do it for my mother.
Howard,"Yeah, of course you would, youêre a loving person. Iêm what my people would call a putz."
Bernadette,"Look, Iêm not crazy about the idea, but what other choice do we have?"
Howard,We get a nurse. Preferably someone from a third world country whoês used to suffering and unpleasant smells.
Bernadette,Youêd hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you? Thatês so cruel.
Howard,Not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland.
Howard,Sounds like a job for a loving person. Would you like me to play some Polish music while you carry her to the toilet?
Bernadette,You are a putz.
Howard,As advertised.
Sheldon,Thanks for coming with me.
Raj,Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Arenêt you gonna get 3-D glasses?
Sheldon,I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.
Raj,Is that a real thing?
Sheldon,"Well, until they invent nose condoms, Iêm not finding out."
Raj,"Emily, Hey."
Raj,"Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, youêre the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?"
Raj,Are you here alone?
Raj,"What do you mean, not really?"
Raj,"Yeah, okay."
Sheldon,"That was awkward, right?"
Sheldon,Is it because sheês dating you but was out with that other fellow?
Sheldon,Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.
Penny,Go away. Just go away.
Penny,What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?
Penny,"Life? What life? Look at me, Iêm a monster. And now I have blood on my hands, or paws. I donêt know."
Penny,"I love you, too. But Iêm afraid I love killing more. Like, one day, I might actually try and kill you."
Penny,"Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I think I could do it better."
Penny,"Well, I care. I mean, look, if weêre gonna do this, why not try and make it something weêre actually proud of?"
Leonard,"Whoa, whoa, hang on. Thereês no need to insult her."
Leonard,Iêm her boyfriend.
Leonard,"A little, yeah."
Penny,You canêt do that. Heês with me.
Penny,You canêt fire me. Iêm the star. Iêm the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster.
Raj,Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldnêt sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.
Sheldon,"Oh, quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare Iêve learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I donêt have all the ingredients to make chai tea."
Raj,You donêt have to make me anything.
Sheldon,"No, I do. Youêre upset about Emily and youêre Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?"
Raj,"Sorry, I left them in my turban."
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. Thatês close enough. You know, Iêm curious, why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?"
Raj,Wouldnêt you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?
Sheldon,Canêt happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.
Raj,"But you donêt have sex with her, either."
Sheldon,"Slick, huh?"
Raj,"To be truthful, Emily and I havenêt dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other."
Sheldon,Have you had intercourse?
Sheldon,"Well, stick to your guns. There will be a lot of pressure."
Howard,Itês like the worldês fattest cuckoo clock.
Bernadette,"You know, youêre always talking about having a baby someday. This is exactly what itês gonna be like."
Howard,"No, itês not."
Bernadette,"Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. Weêre even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own."
Howard,Maybe youêre right. Anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.
Bernadette,"Iêm just telling you now, if we do have kids, donêt expect me to do all the work."
Howard,"Hey, Iêm a very paternal person. Iêd be excellent at taking care of a baby."
Howard,"Iêm coming, you big baby."
Penny,"You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass."
Penny,"Yeah, well, itês easy for you to say. You used to be famous."
Penny,"All right, Iêm sorry, youêre famous."
Penny,"God, what am I doing with my life?"
Leonard,You having second thoughts about acting?
Penny,"You were on set, you saw what it was like."
Leonard,"Yeah, but itês not always that bad."
Penny,"Oh, really?"
Leonard,"What about when you did, uh, Anne Frank at that cute little theater?"
Penny,It was over a bowling alley.
Leonard,"Yeah, but there was ample parking."
Penny,Are you done?
Leonard,And you were so good in the TV commercial.
Penny,It was for haemorrhoid cream.
Leonard,And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.
Penny,"Leonard, you are really not cheering me up."
Leonard,Come on. How can you be sad when youêre going home with all five-foot-six of this?
Penny,"Hmm. You think youêre five-foot-six, thatês funny."
Raj,"I donêt understand it. Iêm a nice guy, I have a great job, Iêm well-educated, come from a good family. Why donêt women want to be with me?"
Sheldon,"An interesting question. Well, good night."
Raj,Donêt send me home. I canêt be alone right now.
Sheldon,Thatês your problem. You canêt be alone.
Raj,What do you mean?
Sheldon,How many women have you had dates with?
Sheldon,How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?
Raj,Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?
Raj,Iêll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.
Sheldon,"Well, now do you see the problem?"
Raj,"Maybe. I, I donêt know.Itês late, I should, I should go. Look, I do get what youêre saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone."
Sheldon,"I was trying to suggest chemical castration, but itês my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night."
Bernadette,"Howie, Iêm back!"
Howard,"Shh, I just got her to sleep."
Howard,What took you so long? The grocery store is a few blocks away.
Bernadette,They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go to a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.
Howard,Then why do I smell coffee on your breath?
Bernadette,"So what? After two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha."
Howard,"A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen."
Bernadette,Queen? Iêve been killing myself here.
Howard,"Well, whose fault is that? I wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, Iêm nice, I want to take care of people."
Bernadette,Iêm glad I got that mocha. And you know what else Iêm glad about? I bought you a brownie and I ate it in the car.
Howard,Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again.
Raj,"Of course. Please, come in."
Raj,"Uh, look, you and I havenêt made any commitments to each other."
Raj,Itês okay.
Raj,"Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but thatês my issue, not yours."
Raj,"Thank you. Not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen."
Raj,"Well, me, neither."
Raj,"Okay. Please. So, uh, you, you have tattoos?"
Raj,I donêt. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.
Raj,"Itês a piercing. So, uh, how many tattoos?"
Raj,"Itês, uh, been a long time since Iêve seen a girlês really not her shoulder."
Raj,"But, uh, before I take my shirt off, I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches."
Penny,"Oh, my God. What a day."
Leonard,Can I get you anything?
Penny,I need to start making some smart decisions.
Leonard,With your career?
Penny,With my life.
Leonard,Like what?
Penny,I donêt know. We could get married.
Leonard,"Come on, be serious."
Penny,I am.
Leonard,"Why? Because Iêm a, a smart decision?"
Penny,"Well, yeah."
Leonard,So Iêm like a bran muffin.
Penny,"No, thatês not what Iêm saying."
Leonard,"No, itês exactly what youêre saying. Iêm the boring thing youêre choosing because Iêm good for you."
Penny,"What does it matter? The point is, Iêm choosing you."
Leonard,"Well, it matters a lot. I donêt want to be a bran muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something youêre excited about even though it could give you diabetes."
Penny,"Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want."
Leonard,"No, no. No, itês too late. Iêm your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon."
Penny,You know what? Forget it. I never shouldêve brought it up.
Leonard,"You know I want to marry you, but youêre only doing this because you got fired and youêre feeling sorry for yourself."
Penny,"Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? I finally realize I donêt need to be famous or have some big career to be happy."
Leonard,Then what do you need?
Penny,"You, you stupid Pop-Tart."
Leonard,Oh. Then I guess Iêm in.
Penny,Really? You guess youêre in?
Leonard,"Not like, I guess Iêm in. Like I guess, Iêm in!"
Penny,Okay. Leonard: Cool.
Leonard,"So is that it? Are, are we engaged?"
Penny,"Yeah, I think so."
Leonard,All right.
Penny,Whatês wrong?
Leonard,Iêm not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.
Penny,"Yeah, it kind of does, huh?"
Leonard,"Oh, I know. This might help."
Penny,Where did you get a ring?
Leonard,"Iêve had it for a couple years, not important. Penny, will you marry me?"
Penny,"Oh, my God, yes."
Leonard,This would have been so much more romantic if you didnêt have monkey hair on your finger.
Howard,How you feeling?
Bernadette,"Last night was a little rough, but I think weêre gonna get through this."
Howard,Iêm proud of us.
Bernadette,"Me, too."
Bernadette,You were right.
Howard,Welcome to Team Putz.
Leonard,Howês your mom holding up?
Howard,"Sheês doing okay, but we just lost another nurse."
Amy,How many is that now?
Howard,"Two, and I know what youêre thinking, sheês eating them."
Bernadette,"Sheês just so impossible, they keep quitting."
Sheldon,"So, whoês watching her now?"
Howard,A bowl full of M&Mês with a few Ambien tossed in.
Raj,"What up, guys?"
Leonard,"Okay. Well, now that everyoneês here, Penny and I have some big news. Weêre engaged."
Raj,And I thought me having sex with Emily was gonna be the big news.
Leonard,"Hey, hey, what the hell?"
Bernadette,You guys propose all the time. This never happens.
Penny,Youêre right! Yay!
Raj,"Boy, Iêm so hungry today. I wonder why?"
Howard,Because you had sex the other night?
Raj,"You know what? That may be it. By the way, it isnêt like riding a bike. Like, I fell off a few times."
Leonard,"Hey, buddy."
Leonard,You okay?
Sheldon,I just got called into President Siebertês office. The university wonêt let me switch my field of study to inflationary cosmology. Theyêre forcing me to continue with string theory.
Sheldon,"He said itês why they hired me, itês, itês what my grant was designated for, and that everybody has to do things they donêt want to do. He then gave an example of something he had to do, even though he didnêt want to, which was look at my stupid face."
Leonard,"Thatês a rude thing to say, out loud."
Sheldon,"Itês an outrage. Honestly, Iêm tempted to leave the university."
Howard,"You know, if youêre really serious about that, I hear there are some exciting opportunities in home care for the old and fat."
Leonard,"Whatever you do, just donêt make any rash decisions."
Sheldon,I donêt know. I am really aggravated.
Raj,"When Iêm feeling low, I have sex with a girl. But thatês just me."
Howard,"Oh, come on, give her a chance."
Bernadette,"I know youêve only been here a day and a half, but youêre like part of the family. I donêt think the service is gonna send any more people."
Howard,"Yeah, maybe itês time we just release Ma back into the sea."
Bernadette,Thatês not helpful.
Howard,"Well, then, we may need to get used to the idea that weêre gonna be living here the next few months."
Bernadette,But we have jobs. We canêt baby-sit her 24 hours a day.
Howard,"Well, what if we use our vacation time?"
Bernadette,"I wanted to go to Hawaii, not hell."
Howard,I donêt know what else we can do.
Bernadette,"Howie, I love you, and as your wife, your mother is every bit as much my problem as she is yours, so, I want a divorce."
Leonard,"Hi, Mom. I have some exciting news."
Leonard,"Before I tell you, will you promise to try and be happy for me and keep any concerns you have to yourself?"
Leonard,I hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me.
Leonard,You know what? Itês probably fine.
Leonard,Iêm your son. What about the fact that sheês good enough for me?
Leonard,"Thanks, Mom."
Leonard,"Yes, it would."
Penny,"No, Mom, itês the same guy Iêve been going out with for the past two years. Yeah, the scientist. Well, itês complicated. I mean, he works with lasers and atomic magnets. No, I did not see it coming. No, we did not set a date. No, I am not pregnant. Yeah, this is a first for our family. All right, tell Dad I love him. I gotta go. All right, bye."
Amy,Atomic magnets?
Penny,Shut up.
Bernadette,"Sorry Iêm late. The leaf blower broke, so I had to hand-dry my mother-in-law."
Penny,You want some wine?
Bernadette,"Thanks. Little warning before you jump into this marriage business. Youêre not just marrying him, youêre marrying his family."
Penny,I think Leonardês momês okay with me.
Bernadette,"It doesnêt matter if sheês okay with you. The question is, can she go to the bathroom by herself? Hit me again."
Amy,"So, what are the living arrangements gonna be?"
Penny,"Well, havenêt really talked about it yet, but I figure at some point, Iêll move in with him, or heêll move in with me."
Amy,"Well, with you not working, that makes financial sense."
Bernadette,Youêre not working. How would you like a job in home health care?
Penny,Not a chance.
Bernadette,Please. Iêm desperate.
Bernadette,Iêll pay you anything you want.
Penny,"Okay, then, yeah."
Penny,"No, keep your money."
Bernadette,I couldêve ridden a bull longer than that.
Leonard,What you working on?
Sheldon,"Iêm writing an appeal to the Faculty Senate, so that I can move on from string theory."
Leonard,Oh. Howês it going?
Sheldon,"You tell me. Dear Esteemed Colleagues, as you may know, I have requested to change my field of study. My decision to do so is, I believe, in the best interest of science. At your convenience, Iêd be happy to explain it to you in words youêll understand."
Leonard,Itês nice that you called them esteemed.
Sheldon,Youêre right. Iêll take that out.
Leonard,"So, listen, there was something I was hoping to float past you."
Leonard,"Now that Penny and I are engaged, I thought we might want to talk about our living arrangements."
Sheldon,"Of course. Sheês spent many nights here, and youêre worried about preserving the myth of her virginity before the wedding."
Leonard,Iêm not.
Sheldon,"Good, because not only has that ship sailed, if it hit an iceberg, countless men would perish."
Leonard,"Actually, this is about where she and I are going to live."
Sheldon,What do you mean?
Leonard,"Well, well, we might want to live together."
Sheldon,"Oh, yeah, well, Iêve already given this some thought, and Iêm willing to let Penny live with us one day a week for a trial period. Now, obviously, not when sheês made cranky by the shedding of her uterine lining."
Leonard,Thatês very sweet. But we were thinking more of us maybe living together withÑ not you.
Sheldon,I donêt understand. How could we all live together if Iêm not there?
Leonard,"Look, I, I know this is, this is change, and that sounds scary."
Sheldon,Where are you going to go?
Leonard,"I donêt know. We just started to think about this. Maybe Iêll move in with Penny, or maybe she and Iêll take this place, and you can move across the hall."
Sheldon,Move across the hall? Did you take a marijuana?
Leonard,"No, I did not."
Sheldon,Did you get hit on the head with a coconut?
Sheldon,"Well, then, Iêm all out of guesses. Me move across the hall. Why would you even suggest such a thing?"
Leonard,"Because I love Penny, and want to give her the life she deserves."
Sheldon,I see. Youêre putting your future brideês happiness above mine.
Leonard,"Well, yeah."
Sheldon,How dare the university force me to go back to string theory?
Amy,They just donêt appreciate you.
Sheldon,"Yeah, and on top of that, Leonard has the audacity to suggest that now that he and Penny are engaged, he may not want to live with me any more."
Amy,"Here, I made you some Strawberry Quik."
Sheldon,"I have real problems here, Amy. I canêt be mollified with a beverage designed for children. Mmm, yummy."
Amy,"You know, this might work out for the best. I mean, youêre always complaining about what a terrible roommate Leonard is. Like how he turns up the thermostat when youêre not there."
Sheldon,"Ugh, itês like walking into the Amazon. And not the good Amazon with one-day shipping. The awful one with birds and snakes."
Amy,You hate the sound of all those keys on his key chain.
Sheldon,"Four keys! Who does he think he is, a warden?"
Amy,See? Maybe youêll love living alone.
Sheldon,I donêt know. Perhaps.
Amy,"And if it turns out you donêt, you and I could live together."
Sheldon,"You andÑ oh, sure, and while weêre at it, why donêt we get engaged, too? Why donêt we get a little house, start a family? Enjoy our sunset years together? Do you hear yourself, woman?"
Amy,"Sheldon, it was just a thought."
Sheldon,"Hereês a thought. Youêre not moving in, Leonardês not moving out, everything stays exactly the way it is. And by the way, I saw you make this Strawberry Quik with syrup, youêre supposed to use the powder."
Amy,It tastes the same.
Sheldon,The syrup tastes better and I donêt like it.
Penny,This is so sweet. You never cook for me.
Leonard,"Well, you cook for me all the time and, ugh."
Penny,"If you donêt like my cooking, why havenêt you ever said anything?"
Leonard,Itês hard to talk with so much heavy chewing to do.
Penny,Sorry. Iêll get better.
Leonard,"I know youêll try. So, should we talk about setting a date?"
Penny,"Well, Iêd like to pick one that works with my brotherês schedule."
Leonard,Okay. And when would that be?
Penny,"Uh, 12 to 18 months from now, depending on good behaviour."
Amy,"Hi, is Sheldon here?"
Leonard,"No, I thought he was with you."
Amy,"He was, but he stormed off and now he isnêt answering his phone."
Leonard,What happened?
Amy,He was really angry that you suggested he move out.
Amy,I also mentioned that he and I could live together but he was too mad at you to realize what a great idea that is.
Leonard,"Well, heês been having a couple of tough days. Iêm sure heês fine. He probably just needs a little alone time to decompress."
Amy,"Youêre probably right. So, what are you guys doing?"
Penny,"Well, Leonard cooked for me and now weêre just having a nice dinner, you know, as a newly engaged couple."
Amy,Thatês nice.
Leonard,"Anyway, as I was saying, Sheldon probably just needs a little alone time. ‚Cause thatês important. Not just for him, but for most anybody, really."
Amy,"Donêt I know it. What is that, polenta?"
Penny,"Amy, get out."
Sheldon,What happened?
Sheldon,And you couldnêt put it out?
Sheldon,So when will you reopen?
Sheldon,"So, tomorrow?"
Sheldon,"Your life? The university is making me do string theory and my girlfriend loves me so much she wants to live with me. And now, the place I need to go when Iêm sad is damp and smells funny."
Sheldon,"I do not accept this. Everything is changing and I hate it. It stops now. Iêm helping you get back on your feet. I would like to purchase this comic book, please."
Sheldon,Really? Itês soaking wet.
Sheldon,Can you break a twenty?
Sheldon,"You know what? I donêt always recognize sarcasm, but I do right now, and I donêt appreciate it. Iêm sorry for your loss. But youêre not the only one whose day has been a disaster."
Leonard,I havenêt heard from Sheldon in a while. You think heês okay?
Penny,"Oh, Iêm sure heês fine."
Leonard,Iêm gonna see where he is.
Leonard,"Oh, I know his password, so I can track his phone."
Penny,You do that?
Leonard,"Not always, but ever since he wandered off at the swap meet chasing a balloon, I get worried."
Penny,"He can take care of himself. Look, we went over stranger danger and gave him that whistle."
Leonard,Thatês weird.
Leonard,Heês at the train station.
Penny,So? He loves trains.
Leonard,"Itês dark out and heês alone, I donêt like it. Letês go get him."
Penny,Itês sweet how you look out for him. Youêre a good guy.
Leonard,Itês not just that. My mother would kill me if I let something happen to him.
Raj,"Dude, Iêm so sorry."
Howard,"Donêt take this the wrong way, but did you do this for the insurance money?"
Raj,"Weêre here for you, man. Whatever you need, okay?"
Raj,"Sure, of course. Oh, actually, Emily was gonna spend the night."
Raj,"Well, I canêt take all the credit. She let me do it to her, but, uh, but I can always call her and cancel."
Howard,Hang on. I know a place you can stay and earn some money at the same time.
Howard,"I just have to warn you, itêll involve humiliation, degradation and verbal abuse."
Sheldon,You tracked my phone?
Sheldon,"Boy, you chase one balloon for three miles."
Penny,We were worried about you.
Sheldon,Donêt be melodramatic. Iêm just getting on a train and leaving forever.
Leonard,Seriously? You donêt even have a change of clothes or a toothbrush.
Sheldon,My plan is to stop at malls and buy what I need. Itês called living off the land.
Leonard,"Okay, I know youêre upset and thereês a lot of stuff going on, but itês nothing we canêt work out. Come on, letês get you home."
Sheldon,Iêve reached my breaking point. I need to leave. Now.
Penny,And go where?
Sheldon,It doesnêt matter.
Leonard,So a few things donêt go your way and your best decision is to ride the rails like a hobo?
Sheldon,I suppose it is. Except I have a credit card. And I refuse to carry my laptop at the end of a stick. And Iêd sooner die than eat beans out of a can.
Leonard,"Come on, come home with us and tomorrow Iêll, Iêll take you to Legoland."
Sheldon,Legoland is not the solution to everything. And itês too much of a scene since that movie came out.
Leonard,Then what can I do?
Sheldon,"Leonard, I am overwhelmed. Everything is changing and itês simply too much. I need to get away and think."
Leonard,"Oh, come on, you know youêre overreacting."
Penny,"Leonard, hang on. Just come here. Maybe we need to let him go."
Leonard,Why?
Penny,It might be good for him.
Leonard,You know he canêt take a trip like this by himself.
Penny,Heês a grown man.
Leonard,"No, he looks like a grown man. Youêve seen Freaky Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies."
Penny,"Leonard, we canêt protect him forever."
Leonard,"I know, butÑ"
Penny,"Heêll be okay. You taught him well, Padawan."
Sheldon,"Good Lord. Padawanês the student, not the teacher."
Penny,"Seriously, let him go."
Leonard,"Sheldon, if you really need to do this, Iêm not gonna stand in your way."
Sheldon,I do.
Leonard,Okay. Good luck.
Penny,Be safe and call us.
Sheldon,I will.
Leonard,"Bye, buddy. Sheldon?"
Leonard,Iêm gonna miss you.
Sheldon,Of course you are.
Leonard,He just made that easier.
Howard,You sure?
Bernadette,"So, sheês not too much for you?"
Howard,You call her Debbie?
Howard,Was that a little weird?
Bernadette,"Yeah. I donêt know why, but something about it feels unnatural."
Howard,"Okay, letês go."
Amy,"Okay, Sheldon, thanks for checking in. Talk to you tomorrow? Oh, okay, bye."
Leonard,Heês okay?
Amy,Actually sounds like heês doing pretty well.
Penny,I really think this is gonna be for the best.
Leonard,"Me, too. And he was able to take a sabbatical fromÑ"
Amy,How could you let him go?
Sheldon,"Excuse me. Is it at all possible that youêre knitting a pair of pants? Oh, well, no, youêre understandably terrified. But, you know, allow me to explain. 45 days ago, um, I embarked on a railroad journey of healing because my university was making me do string theory, and my favorite comic book store burned down, and when my room mate got engaged, my girlfriend wanted to move in with me, which was no doubt a ploy just to see my, well, excuse my language, but my bathing suit parts. Uh, sir, may I use your phone?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, I understand that Iêm half naked, but there is a reasonable explanation. While I slept in my sleeper car, all my possessions were stolen. Now, typically, I wear pyjamas, but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pyjamas are the sleep-pants of the Man. Iêll have you know, Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him. My good man, now, before you walk away, I know that I may appear deranged, but I am, in fact, a world-renowned physicist. Ask me the difference between a boson and a fermion. Go ahead, ask. Bosons have integer spin, fermions have half-integer spin. My legs are getting cold. Why wonêt anybody help me?"
Penny,Hi. Want to do yoga with me?
Leonard,"Um, let me just have some coffee first, and then Iêll have the strength to tell you how much I wonêt be doing that.  Hello?"
Sheldon,"Hello, Leonard."
Leonard,"Hey, buddy. Good to hear your voice."
Sheldon,"Uh, Iêm in Kingman, Arizona, and, uh, I need you to come pick me up."
Leonard,Iêd love to. Iêm just about to do yoga with Penny.
Sheldon,"Leonard, Iêm at the police station. I was robbed. They took my phone, my wallet, my iPad, everything."
Leonard,"Oh, my God, are you okay?"
Sheldon,"No, Iêm not okay. Uh, Iêm wearing borrowed pants, I donêt have I.D., and one of the officers here wonêt stop calling me chicken legs."
Leonard,"Okay. Uh, Iêll, Iêll come get you. Whatês the address?"
Penny,"Hey, whatês going on?"
Leonard,He got all of his stuff stolen.
Sheldon,"2530 East Andy Devine Avenue,"
Leonard,"Sheldon, hang tight. Hey, do you want me to bring anything?"
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, please. A pair of pants. And my toothbrush. Yeah, and my mail. And a really good comeback for chicken legs, because _I know you are, but what am I?î was met with stony silence."
Leonard,Iêll be there as soon as I can.
Penny,Is he okay?
Leonard,"Yeah, heês fine, heês just a little rattled."
Leonard,Feel like driving to Arizona with me?
Penny,"I canêt, I have that job interview."
Leonard,"Oh, right."
Penny,"Besides, I donêt need six hours of your hair is different, why did you change your hair? Iêm holding my breath until your hair grows back."
Leonard,"All right, fine. Hey, can you think of a reason I shouldnêt invite Amy to come with me?"
Leonard,"Come on, you didnêt even try."
Raj,Thanks for the lift.
Howard,Whatês wrong with your car?
Raj,Iêm having my windows untinted.
Raj,Got a hot girlfriend now. I want the haters to know.
Howard,What are you talking about? No oneês paying attention to you.
Raj,"Wow. Howês that Hater-Ade taste, bro? Hey, this isnêt the way to work."
Howard,I just want to pop in and make sure Maês okay.
Raj,I thought Stuart was looking after her.
Howard,"He was, but now that her cast is off, he moved out. And honestly, Iêm kind of glad. It was getting a little weird."
Raj,How so?
Howard,"I donêt know, theyêre, chummy."
Raj,Like us?
Howard,"No, not like us. Creepy chummy, like you and your dog."
Raj,She feeds him out of her own mouth?
Howard,"I mean, he calls her Debbie, she calls him Stewie and theyêre all giggly around each other. And believe me, when food goes in that mouth, it does not come out."
Raj,So are you worried because heês replacing you as a son or are you worried because heês becoming her lover?
Howard,"First of all, no one can replace me as a son. Iêm her little matzo ball. And secondly, my mother is well past having any kind of sex life."
Raj,"Okay, okay. Although many older women lead vibrant, activeÑ"
Howard,I said well past it.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, Officer Hernandez? Any leads on the person who stole my belongings?"
Sheldon,"Well, perhaps I can help. Sherlock Holmes always says when you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. Now, have, have you tried doing that?"
Sheldon,"Well, maybe you should. Thereês lots of books called Sherlock Holmes, and thereês no books called Officer Hernandez."
Leonard,Thanks again for coming. Six hours was gonna be a long drive by myself.
Amy,"My pleasure. And Iêm not angry at all that my boyfriend was in trouble and called you instead of me. I love that,"
Leonard,"Yeah, timeês gonna fly by."
Penny,I havenêt been on a job interview in years. Iêm really nervous.
Bernadette,"Donêt be. You are built for pharmaceutical sales. Youêre cute, youêre flirty and started that like there were gonna be three things."
Penny,I donêt have any experience in sales. Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school. But you already made me take that off my r_sum_.
Bernadette,"This job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos êcause theyêre about to go bad, youêre just pushing our antidepressants before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding."
Penny,They do?
Bernadette,"Maybe. But like our lawyers say, the world is full of things that can cause a rectum to bleed. Anyway, I talked you up to Dan. Heês the guy whoêll be interviewing you."
Penny,"Oh, I really appreciate this. I just hope Iêm not in over my head."
Bernadette,Youêll be fine. Just be yourself.
Penny,I wish I felt more confident.
Bernadette,"Penny, I wouldnêt have put you up for this job if I didnêt think you could handle it."
Penny,"Oh, thank you, but maybe I should cancel."
Bernadette,Itês too late to cancel. Youêre going.
Penny,But I donêt know anything about pharmaceuticals.
Bernadette,"Oh, I understand. You want to do something youêre already good at. I know. Why donêt I get you a job at the Sitting Around All Day Wearing Yoga Pants Factory?"
Penny,Theyêre comfortable.
Howard,"Ma, I hope youêre decent. Raj is here. You just started seeing naked women again, and I donêt want you to be confused about where the boobs should be."
Howard,"Uh, what are you doing here? I thought you moved out."
Howard,Itês not that precious.
Raj,"Iêd like to back you up, but it sounds like it was pretty precious."
Howard,Or in her neck. Listen. You staying here seems like something she wouldêve talked to me about.
Raj,It wouldnêt kill you to pick up the phone.
Sheldon,Any word on my stolen items?
Sheldon,"You know, Sherlock Holmes liked to use cocaine to sharpen his focus. But Iêm sure those Cool Ranch Doritos are doing the trick."
Sheldon,"Leonard. Oh, Iêm so happy to see you."
Amy,Are you okay?
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm fine. Why did you come?"
Amy,"What do you mean, why did I come? Youêre my boyfriend. I havenêt seen you in over a month. I just drove six hours to help you out. Donêt you have anything to say besides why did you come?"
Sheldon,"I do, but, I feel uncomfortable saying it out loud in front of these police officers."
Amy,Fine. Whisper it.
Leonard,"So, Sheldon, tell us about your trip. Whereêd you go?"
Sheldon,"Where didnêt I go? I went to New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver, Seattle."
Leonard,How were they?
Sheldon,"Oh, I have no idea. I never left the train station."
Leonard,Hang on. You travelled across the entire country and never left a train station?
Sheldon,Why would I? Thatês where all the cool trains are.
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, so you never went outside?"
Sheldon,Or had a single piece of fruit.
Penny,"Well, Iêm a people person. People like me. Some of my favourite people are people. I feel like Iêm saying people a lot. People, people, people. Okay, Iêm done."
Penny,People. Yes.
Penny,"Uh, well, as a waitress, sales was a big part of my job. I mean, believe me, I convinced a lot of very large customers, who should not be eating cheesecake, to have more cheesecake. I mean, one of those chubsters even had an insulin pump."
Howard,"Itês weird, right? A grown man in his thirties living with my mother."
Raj,"That is weird. I thought he was, like, 45."
Howard,"Come on, you donêt think itês a little odd?"
Raj,"I donêt know. I mean, sheês lonely. He needs a place to stay. I doubt thereês any funny business going on. And even if there was, who cares? Theyêre both adults."
Howard,Who cares? You wouldnêt care if I slept with your mom?
Raj,"You know what? Youêre my best friend, and sheês in a bad marriage. I give you my blessing."
Howard,This is stupid. Iêm just gonna call my mother and be honest with her.
Raj,‚Cause thatês what little matzo balls do.
Raj,This is the part where you talk.
Penny,"Um, any chance his car needs to be washed by a girl in a bikini? Okay, Iêm really sorry for wasting your time."
Penny,"Okay, thanks. Um, Iêm sorry, listen, could you do me a favour and not tell Bernadette how badly I blew this interview? Sheêll get upset. And honestly Iêm a, a little terrified of her."
Penny,"Yeah, kind of."
Penny,"I know, but sheês kind of a bully."
Penny,"Me, too."
Penny,What happened?
Penny,"Oh, my God, no."
Sheldon,"At the hot dog stand in the Denver train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Salt Lake City train station, Heinz ketchup. At the hot dog stand in the Indianapolis train station?"
Leonard,I donêt care.
Sheldon,"Wrong. Huntês. Hey, Amy, what do you say? You ready to move on to the mustard round?"
Amy,Have you not noticed that Iêve been sitting back here quietly stewing for the past two hours?
Sheldon,I just thought you were bad at the game.
Amy,"Iêm mad at you. How could you just go away like that without even saying good-bye, and then call Leonard for help instead of me?"
Sheldon,"Amy, may I please have a moment of privacy to speak with my roommate?"
Amy,Weêre in a moving car. What do you expect me to do? Stick my fingers in my ears?
Sheldon,"Well, I was thinking put your head out the window like a dog, but thatêll work. Please? Thisêll be quick. Leonard? As soon as we get home, I want to have coitus with Amy. Okay, she canêt hear. The reason I called you is because I didnêt want Amy to know I couldnêt make it on my own."
Leonard,Whatês the big deal?
Sheldon,"Oh, of course itês no big deal to you. You idolize me, and nothing could ever knock me off that pedestal you put me on."
Leonard,"Well, yeah, itês true. You, you are a god to me."
Amy,Can I stop now?
Leonard,Just tell her.
Sheldon,I called Leonard because I failed. And I didnêt want you to think less of me.
Amy,You were worried about that?
Amy,"Sheldon, itês okay with me that youêre not perfect."
Sheldon,Can I have one more moment with Leonard?
Sheldon,Amy just hurt my feelings. I want to break up with her.
Howard,"Now, I never thought Iêd say this, but Iêm kind of excited to see Sheldon."
Bernadette,"I never thought Iêd say this, but Penny got a job today."
Howard,She did?
Bernadette,"Well, the only reason she got it is êcause the guy who interviewed her loves me."
Howard,What do you want?
Howard,"Youêre right, Iêm not. I think itês weird."
Howard,"It is. Heês a grown man. Heês just gonna live there rent-free? How is that gonna motivate him to get off his butt and get a job? I mean, do you even have a plan?"
Howard,Your mother and I? Youêre not my father.
Howard,"Well, I didnêt say I was your father."
Bernadette,"Okay, calm down. Youêre not his father, heês not your father. Nobodyês anybodyês father."
Howard,"Well, itês my house, itês my rules."
Bernadette,"Hey, donêt you take that sarcastic tone with him."
Howard,Donêt talk to her like that. That is my mother. Wife. My wife. I said my wife.
Howard,"Yeah, in my house."
Sheldon,I wish Iêd never gone on that trip. I feel no better now than when I left.
Amy,But you still accomplished something.
Leonard,"Yeah. If you had told anyone that you were going away on a train by yourself across the country, do you know what they would have said?"
Sheldon,That I couldnêt do it?
Leonard,Exactly. Right after they said yeah.
Amy,But you did do it. So what if it didnêt all go your way? Thatês what makes it an adventure.
Sheldon,"Thatês a good point. You know, Iêm a lot like Gandalf the Grey. He fought the Balrog and emerged stronger than ever as Gandalf the White. I was robbed of my phone and pants, and I, too, came back stronger. And whiter, too, êcause I wasnêt in direct sunlight for six weeks."
Amy,See? This trip was good for you.
Sheldon,"Indeed. I was the worldês smartest caterpillar. And then after pupating in our nationês railway system, Iêve burst forth as the worldês smartest butterfly."
Leonard,Butterfly couldêve gotten himself home from Arizona.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I feel renewed. Iêm ready to deal with any changes that come my way."
Penny,"Hey, look whoês back."
Sheldon,Your hair is different. You changed your hair. I canêt take this. Iêm out.
Sheldon,Would you like to see pictures from my trip?
Penny,I thought your phone got stolen.
Sheldon,"Yeah, it did, but luckily all my photos got backed up to the Cloud."
Leonard,And you thought they all had a silver lining.
Sheldon,"Here, day one, uh, this was the seat I was going to sit in but didnêt because there were cracker crumbs on it. As it was first class, I suspect Ritz. This is the train bathroom. This is the Imodium I took so I would never have to use the train bathroom."
Penny,I cannot believe you travelled the entire country and never left the train station.
Sheldon,"I know. You know, I almost died in a fire in Des Moines, but I stayed put. FYI, thatês when the Imodium gave out."
Sheldon,"I recently read that during World War Two, Joseph Stalin had a research program to create supersoldiers by having women impregnated by gorillas."
Howard,What a sick use of science.
Raj,"Hey, as long as the babyês healthy."
Amy,I wonder if Stalin considered any other animals.
Leonard,"Hippos are the deadliest creature. A half-human, half-hippo soldier would be pretty badass."
Howard,"Yes, but when theyêre hungry-hungry, you can stop them with marbles."
Sheldon,"Yeah, the correct animal for interspecies supersolider is koala. You would wind up with an army so cute it couldnêt be attacked."
Raj,"But half-man, half-owl could flyÑ"
Sheldon,The answer is cuddly soldiers with big flat noses. Moving on.
Howard,"So, Penny, whenês the new job start?"
Penny,Next Monday.
Bernadette,Did you get a chance to look over the materials I gave you?
Penny,"Uh, not yet, but I will."
Bernadette,Great. When?
Penny,I said Iêll get to it.
Sheldon,"Iêm sensing awkwardness, am I right?"
Bernadette,"I donêt want to be pushy, but youêve never done pharmaceutical sales before. It seems like you could use this time to get a head start."
Penny,"Well, the first few weeks will be all training. Theyêll tell me everything I need to know."
Bernadette,But imagine how impressed theyêd be if you showed up already familiar with the material.
Penny,"Okay, so what, you want me to be like a teacherês pet?"
Bernadette,Couldnêt hurt.
Leonard,"Mm, I donêt know. Who here has ever been hurt because they were the teacherês pet?"
Sheldon,It was like the rest of the class wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz.
Sheldon, Guess who?
Sheldon," Thatês right, good job. Hello. Uh, you wanted to see me?"
Sheldon,Thank you. I assume youêd like to reopen our dialogue about the university forcing me to continue with string theory?
Sheldon,"Thatês the one. I believe you went last, so, uh, please?"
Sheldon,"Wow. Pouting and running away actually worked. I must say, that may not be a lesson you want to reinforce with me. So, um, what is the solution?"
Sheldon,"But if Iêm a professor, then Iêll have to teach a class."
Sheldon,So your solution is to promote me and pay me more money so that I can impart my knowledge to the next generation of scientists?
Sheldon,You people are sick.
Penny,Hey. Ready to go to lunch?
Amy,Just give me a minute. Iêm stimulating the pleasure cells of this starfish. I just need to turn it off.
Penny,What happens if you donêt?
Amy,Then I have to sit through lunch knowing this starfish is having a better day than I am. Is Bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?
Penny,"Uh, no. Actually, I didnêt invite her."
Amy,How come?
Penny,"Well, ever since she helped me get this job, she wonêt stop bugging me."
Amy,"Well, I think she just wants you to do well, and sheês worried that you wonêt êcause you were just a stunningly poor waitress."
Penny,That is not true.
Amy,Iêm still waiting on my mini corndogs from two years ago.
Penny,"I told you, theyêll be right out."
Amy,"Okay, so no Bernadette."
Penny,"Well, you saw her the other night. Am I wrong?"
Amy,"No, I just, I feel kind of uncomfortable talking about her like this. Usually when someoneês being talked about behind their back, itês me and itês right in front of my face."
Penny,Iêm sorry. I just need a little break from her.
Amy,"I understand. You know, there is some research that indicates that sharing negative attitudes about a third party can be a powerful bonding force between two friends."
Penny,"So, what are you saying?"
Amy,"Iêm saying, in the spirit of science, what is that little skankês problem?"
Raj,"So, Iêve been trying to come up with a cute coupleês nickname for me and Emily. What do you like better? Emippali or Koothrapemily?"
Howard,Why is it your last name and her first name?
Raj,"Oh, well, her last name is Sweeney, and something just didnêt seem right about Koothrapeeney."
Leonard,"Hey, howêd it go with human resources?"
Sheldon,"Awful. Theyêre allowing me to move on from string theory, but they made me a junior professor and are requiring me to teach a class."
Raj,I donêt understand. Why is it bad that you have to teach?
Sheldon,What a stupid question.
Leonard,The kids are gonna love him.
Sheldon,I canêt believe I have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is whatês in their diapers.
Leonard,"This might not be that bad. Uh, you like telling people theyêre wrong."
Sheldon,"Wrong, Just because I enjoyed that one doesnêt mean I always do."
Raj,You enjoy giving people grades.
Sheldon,"A valid point, but unoriginal. B-minus."
Howard,And you love the sound of your own voice.
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, of course I do. Listen to it. Itês like an earful of melted caramel."
Leonard,"Look, most importantly, this will let you move on and study dark matter."
Sheldon,"It is true that many of my heroes have taken students under their wings. Feynman, Einstein, Professor X. Humorously, in the case of Professor X, some of his students actually had wings. Thatês rich. Iêll use that one to lighten the mood after my entire class fails the midterm."
Amy,"Measuring starfish serotonin levels in response to one point two molar stimulation of pleasure cells. You like that, donêt you? Thatês right, say my name."
Amy,"Hey, whatês going on?"
Bernadette,Not much. You want to get a drink later? Just the two of us?
Amy,No Penny?
Bernadette,Not tonight. Iêm a little frustrated with her.
Amy,Because you got her the job and you think she should be working harder to prepare for it?
Bernadette,"So itês not just me. You see it, too."
Amy,"I do, I see it."
Bernadette,"Itês driving me crazy. Just this afternoon, I saw on Instagram that instead of studying, she went out to lunch and got a manicure."
Amy,Thatês outrageous.
Bernadette,I know.
Amy,"If she doesnêt do well, this could reflect poorly on you."
Bernadette,Exactly. Does she not realize it or does she not care?
Amy,I donêt know. The important thing is I am here for you so we can mutually disparage this unpleasing third party.
Leonard,Hey. We just wanted to see how your class was going. Where is everybody?
Sheldon,There is no class.
Howard,Did you send everyone to the principalês office already?
Sheldon,No one signed up.
Leonard,"Well, thatês not your fault."
Sheldon,"I called the department secretary to see what happened. Apparently, I have a reputation for being obnoxious."
Raj,"Hey, Sheldon, Iêm sorry."
Sheldon,"No, itês fine. Now I can devote all my time to dark matter."
Raj,"Aw, you brought cookies for everyone?"
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. Fig Newtons. I was going to ask them which scientist both helped to develop calculus and had a famous cookie named after him? And then after someone said Newton, I was going to tell them theyêre wrong. The cookies are named after a town in Massachusetts. And then Iêd throw the cookies away."
Howard,"Hey, what if I took your class?"
Sheldon,Why would you do that?
Leonard,"Yeah, why would you do that?"
Raj,Whatês wrong with you?
Howard,"Iêm thinking about getting my doctorate, and he wants to teach. Why not?"
Sheldon,"Oh, Howard. I appreciate the gesture, but this is a graduate-level physics class. I donêt think youêd understand a single thing I was talking about."
Raj,"Ask why not again, Iêve got an answer."
Howard,"Sheldon, Iêm more than smart enough to take your class."
Sheldon,How would you determine the ground state of a quantum system with no exact solution?
Howard,I would guess a wave-function and then vary its parameters until I found the lowest energy solution.
Sheldon,"Hmm. Do you know how to integrate X squared times E to the minus X, without looking it up?"
Howard,"Iêd use Feynmanês trick, differentiate under the integral sign."
Sheldon,"Okay. Um, what is the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics?"
Howard,"Since every interpretation gives exactly the same answer to every measurement, they are all equally correct. However, I know you believe in the Many Worlds Interpretation, so Iêll say that. Now do you think Iêm smart enough?"
Howard,"Oh, come on. You mightêve gone to school for a couple more years than me, but guess what, engineers are just as smart as physicists."
Sheldon,You take that back.
Amy,"So, after drinks with Bernadette, I get home, and Penny calls to complain about her. And then while Iêm talking to Penny, I get a text from Bernadette."
Sheldon,I am trying to prepare my lesson plan for Howard. Why are you telling me this?
Amy,"Because itês taken 15 years, but high school is finally awesome. I love them both, but Iêm in the centre now, and I love that even more."
Sheldon,"Amy, please. I am trying to figure out a way to intellectually emasculate a dear friend of mine."
Amy,But Iêm justÑ
Sheldon,Not now.
Amy,"You better watch that attitude, buddy. Youêre dating the popular girl now."
Leonard,Hmm. Youêre up late.
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz. He is going to be so lost. Look at this section over here. Even I donêt really understand it."
Leonard,"Sheldon, why are you doing this?"
Sheldon,"Iêm a teacher, Leonard. Itês my job."
Leonard,"No, I mean, why are you going to so much trouble to prove that youêre smarter than Wolowitz?"
Sheldon,"Oh, itês no trouble, itês actually a pleasure."
Leonard,"You want to know what I think? I think the idea that someone could be as smart as you, or even smarter, scares the pants off you, and you canêt deal with it."
Sheldon,"Interesting point. Youêre suggesting that I have emotional issues below my consciousness which drive my behaviour, thus causing me to lash out at anything or anyone that threatens my intellectual superiority."
Leonard,Might be something to think about.
Sheldon,Howardês allergic to peanuts. How can I use that against him?
Sheldon,"Okay, now that everyoneês here, we can begin."
Howard,"Before we do, I just talked to Leonard. And if youêre gonna spend all your time trying to belittle me by making this class unnecessarily hard, then Iêm out. But if youêre interested in making a sincere effort to be a good teacher, then Iêm willing to give this a shot."
Sheldon,I suppose thatês a fair request. Thereês no reason we both canêt benefit from this experience.
Sheldon,"Okay. Well, then, uh, first things first. Um, are you familiar with the Brachistochrone problem?"
Howard,I am.
Sheldon,Good. And how it relates to the calculus of variations?
Howard,Itês an inverted cycloid.
Sheldon,"Wonderful. Now, what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?"
Howard,Thatês where Iêm a little fuzzy.
Sheldon,"Ha! I knew it. All right. We have a lot of information to cover before your first test. Which, by the way, is in eight minutes. The good news is Iêm grading on a curve, so youêre pretty much guaranteed a C."
Howard,"All I do is win, win, win no matter what."
Sheldon,What are you doing?
Howard,"Everybody hands go up, up and they stay there!"
Sheldon,What are you doing?
Howard,"If youêre gonna be a crappy teacher, then Iêm gonna be a crappy student.  Uh, uh, Ludacris going in on the verse. êcause I never been defeated and I wonêt stop nowÑ"
Sheldon,Will you stop it. This is a classroom. This is not American Bandstand.
Sheldon,"Now, where was I? Letês see. Oh, yes. Over here. YouÑ What are you doing now?"
Howard,Making a straw.
Howard,So I can shoot you with a spitball.
Sheldon,"Youêre not going to do that, and Iêll tell you why. This is an institution of higher learning, I am your professor, and youêre going to treat me with the propÑ You shot your spit in my mouth!"
Howard,Is that gonna be on the test? Because I donêt think I can do that again.
Amy,"Hey, girlfriend. Can I get a what what?"
Amy,"Close enough. Um, I was just calling to see what you were up tonight. Thought maybe we could hit up Color Me Mine, maybe sneak in some Pinot Greej. Whatevs."
Penny,"Uh, thanks, but I think Iêm gonna stay in and go over the stuff Bernadette gave me."
Amy,"Oh. Oh, I hear you. Try and get that nag off your back, right? I mean, youêre not a bicycle, whyês she riding you like that?"
Penny,"No, I think she was just trying to help. Plus, I really want to do well at this job. SoÑ"
Amy,"Okay, good luck. And call me later, you know, if you decide sheês a bitch or something. Hey, girlfriend."
Bernadette,"Hey, Amy."
Amy,"Tonight. You, me, Color Me Mine. Maybe we sneak in some Pinot, make it Color Me Wine."
Bernadette,"That sounds fun, but I promised Penny Iêd come by and help her study."
Amy,"Oh. Well, good luck getting her to do that. Sheês probably off getting another manicure. You remember when she did that? You remember?"
Bernadette,"I was probably being too hard on her. We talked, weêre good."
Amy,"Oh. Great. Iêm happy for you guys. You know, when the two of you arenêt getting along, it puts me in a really weird position."
Bernadette,"Well, donêt worry, everythingês back to normal."
Amy,"You mean, like, where sheês nice to your face? Okay got it. Bye. Hey, boyfriend."
Sheldon,Canêt talk. Spitball. Probably gonna die.
Leonard,"Sheldon, I promise. Your uvula does not have an STD."
Sheldon,Are you sure? It just doesnêt feel as innocent as it used to.
Howard,You reported me to human resources?
Sheldon,You violated the sanctity of my mouth.
Howard,"Well, I dropped your class, so I hope youêre happy."
Sheldon,I told you you werenêt smart enough to take it.
Howard,"Iêm smart enough, Sheldon. Asking me a bunch of questions about a topic Iêm not familiar with doesnêt prove anything. I could do the same to you."
Sheldon,"Yeah, try me."
Howard,"Okay. You enjoy making fun of engineering so much, how do you quantify the strength of materials?"
Sheldon,Youngês modulus.
Raj,Is that right?
Howard,"Yeah. Okay, how do you prevent eddy currents in a transformer?"
Sheldon,Laminate the core material.
Leonard,"Come on, give him a hard one."
Howard,"That was a hard one. All right. How does the flow rate in a pipe depend on its diameter? You donêt know, do you? Whatês the matter, smart guy? Donêt know Poiseuilleês law?"
Sheldon,Thank goodness I got it. Now I can quit checking my stool.
Bernadette,"Okay, what are the potential side effects for our erectile dysfunction drug?"
Penny,"Headaches, dizziness and nausea."
Penny,Those are also the side effects of having a 75-year-old man with an erection climb on top of you.
Bernadette,Want to stop here?
Penny,"Uh, no. I can keep going."
Bernadette,"Nah, you got this. Letês go for a drink. Iêll call Amy."
Penny,"Okay, good. She seemed like she really wanted to go out tonight."
Amy,"Hey, girl."
Leonard,"Okay, next question, for the Butterfinger. How long is a galactic yea"
Raj,250 million years.
Leonard,Yes.  
Howard,"Okay, this one is for a Cadbury Creme Egg."
Sheldon,Oh! Itês not even Easter time. This is crazy.
Howard,"Which Archimedean solid has 20 regular triangular faces, 30 square faces, 12 pentagonal faces, 60 vertices and 120 edges?"
Leonard,We are so smart.
Raj,Why didnêt girls like us in high school?
Howard,Because we were awkward and weird and couldnêt play sports!
Leonard,Right again. 
Howard,"So, how does this game work? I just throw it, like a real ball?"
Leonard,"Yeah, just nice and easy, right over the plate."
Howard,All right.
Raj,"You suck, Wolowitz."
Howard,Whatês that about?
Raj,Iêm heckling you. Itês a beloved part of baseball.
Sheldon,"Heês right. And given that youêre probably still waiting to be picked for a game that was played in fifth grade, Iêm sure you do suck."
Penny,Hi. Whatês going on?
Penny,"Okay, this is not what I meant when I said go outside and play."
Leonard,Heês practicing.
Penny,For what?
Howard,"The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw out the first pitch, so guess who they called?"
Penny,you? Really?
Howard,"Well, a lot of people who werenêt available, but then me."
Penny,Thatês so cool. Congratulations. I guess that makes you the athlete of the group.
Sheldon,"Well, not just him. May I remind you that youêre talking to the seeker, beater, chaser and water boy of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch team."
Penny,I know. Watching your boyfriend run around with a broomstick between his legs isnêt something you forget.
Leonard,"Cêmon now, throw one."
Howard,"All right, here we go."
Raj,You look like a jackass.
Howard,Cut it out. Youêre hurting my feelings.
Leonard,Now you know why weêre not outside.
Sheldon,Did you enjoy my lecture?
Amy,"No, and neither did our waiter."
Sheldon,"Well, if youêre going to serve Cornish game hen, you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it."
Amy,Itês hard to argue with that. And I know because I saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail.
Penny,"Hey, how was dinner?"
Sheldon,"Good, I had Cornish game hen."
Leonard,"Oh, that poor waiter."
Amy,"Sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?"
Penny,You guys are going out two nights in a row?
Sheldon,"I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip, and Iêm contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the Relationship Agreement."
Penny,Thatês so hot.
Amy,"Itês better than hot, itês binding."
Sheldon,"If youêre free tomorrow night, Iêd love to have you join us on a double date."
Amy,You are aware that a double date doesnêt count as two dates.
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, then come or donêt. I donêt care."
Bernadette,I canêt believe youêre sore.
Howard,"Hey, even professional pitchers need a rubdown after the game."
Bernadette,But they throw an actual ball. You were throwing air at a TV.
Howard,"For your information, I also gave Leonard one hell of a high five."
Bernadette,Iêm kind of surprised you agreed to do this in front of a stadium full of people.
Howard,Theyêre doing Space Day and NASA asked me. I felt like I couldnêt say no.
Bernadette,"Okay. Well, if you want, I could help you practice. I played a lot of softball growing up."
Howard,"Thank you, that would be great."
Bernadette,"Great. And while weêre at it, maybe we could butch up your run for when you head out to the mound."
Howard,Whatês wrong with the way I run?
Penny,"Sheldon, Iêm surprised youêd choose to go to a pub."
Sheldon,"At our committee meeting, Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park, but I tacked so many amendments on that thing it sank like a lead balloon."
Amy,I then suggested a pub.
Sheldon,"Yeah, which I was initially sceptical of until I saw online that they serve Yorkshire pudding."
Leonard,You donêt even like Yorkshire pudding.
Sheldon,"No, itês yucky, but informing people about the history of Yorkshire is yummy, yum-yum."
Amy,"After a lively debate, that proposal passed by a two-zero margin."
Leonard,Nice to see a busy couple keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.
Sheldon,"Ignore them, Amy. Theyêre just jealous because theyêll never have a relationship as good as ours."
Penny,Isnêt this when he says bazooka or something?
Sheldon,"I wasnêt making a joke, I was merely stating fact. Amy and I have a superior relationship to yours."
Leonard,"You donêt honestly think that, do you?"
Sheldon,"Leonard, I assumed you knew. The ranking of relationships in our circle by quality is me and Amy, Howard and Bernadette, Raj and his girlfriend, Penny and Chardonnay, Penny and you."
Leonard,"There isnêt any ranking. And if there were, we wouldnêt be at the bottom of it."
Penny,"Yeah, and actually, I drink Sauvignon Blanc."
Leonard,Thatês the part you have a problem with?
Amy,"There they go, fighting again. Youêd never hear her talk that way to Sauvignon Blanc."
Raj,"So you never played baseball as a kid, not even Little League?"
Howard,"Well, I was going to, but the day of tryouts I found my dadês Playboy collection. Threw my arm out."
Bernadette,"All right, the pitcherês mound in Major League Baseball is sixty feet, six inches away from home plate."
Howard,Great. You take this and say when to stop. How much further?
Bernadette,Keep going.
Howard,How about now?
Bernadette,Iêll let you know.
Howard,Are you saying stop and weêre just too far away to hear you?
Bernadette,"Okay, stop."
Howard,Are you kidding me?!
Bernadette,Thatês sixty feet.
Howard,Thereês no way this is sixty feet.
Bernadette,Iêm looking at it.
Howard,You realize this isnêt one of those times I want you to exaggerate how long something is.
Leonard,"Okay, I got to, I, I, I, I got to ask. What makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isnêt?"
Sheldon,"For starters, we enjoy spending time together."
Leonard,So do we. And Iêve seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things.
Sheldon,Itês called parallel play.
Leonard,"Yeah, toddlers do that."
Sheldon,Not as well as we do.
Leonard,You believe this guy? He has to be the best at everything.
Penny,So what? Why do you even care?
Sheldon,"Oh, listen to them. Not even married and the honeymoonês over."
Leonard,Whatever. You canêt even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement.
Sheldon,"If youêve got a problem basing a relationship on a contract, Iêd like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the U.S. Constitution. And it may not be cool to say so, but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today."
Amy,"Itês a good thing Iêm not wearing flag underwear right now, êcause thereês about to be a fire."
Bernadette,"Okay, itês not that hard. You just look to where you want to throw it, step towards where you want to throw, and throw it."
Howard,"Thatês your help? Thatês like saying hereês how you fly a plane, get in the airplane, know where you want to go and fly it."
Bernadette,Just throw the ball. Letês see what weêre working with.
Raj,"Come on Howard, fire it in."
Bernadette,Throw the damn ball!
Amy,So when do you guys plan on getting married?
Penny,"Uh, weêre not sure. But I want to wait long enough to prove to my mother Iêm not pregnant."
Sheldon,May I have one of your fries?
Amy,Of course. Can I have a bite of your burger?
Sheldon,Absolutely not.
Leonard,Some perfect couple. He wonêt even share his food with her.
Sheldon,It has avocado on it. Sheês allergic to avocado. Are you so jealous of our relationship you want Amy to die?
Leonard,Iêm not jealous. I just think itês silly for you to compare relationships like theyêre something that can be quantified.
Sheldon,"Everything is quantifiable. That French fry? A seven. Spider-Man? A nine. The number nine? Oddly, only a four."
Leonard,How ridiculous is he?
Penny,A hundred.
Leonard,"Sheldon, youêre just assigning random numbers to things based on your opinion."
Sheldon,"No, Iêm not. French fries have three variables, crispiness, saltiness and shape. Which is why a curly fry only gets a two. If I wanted curls for dinner, Iêd order a clown wig."
Penny,"Well, a relationship is more complicated than a French fry."
Sheldon,"Not according to the work of Berscheid, Snyder and Omoto."
Penny,"Oh, what did those rascals do now?"
Amy,"They developed the Relationship Closeness Inventory, which predicts the stability of a couple based on behaviour."
Sheldon,"Yeah, not to be confused with the French Fry Goodness Inventory. Thatês pure Cooper."
Leonard,"So, this is accurate?"
Sheldon,"Itês been around for 25 years, and has been extensively corroborated by other researchers."
Penny,"Well, kind of takes the romance out of relationships."
Sheldon,Kind of? It does it perfectly.
Amy,Sheldon and I got an eight-point-two out of ten.
Leonard,Fine. Weêll take it right now.
Penny,"No, donêt."
Penny,Just donêt take it.
Leonard,Why not?
Penny,‚Cause itês stupid. Who cares what number it is?
Leonard,Come on. Itêll be fun.
Penny,I said I donêt want you to. Iêm getting another drink.
Amy,Iêm gonna let you count this as two dates. Theyêre a lot of work.
Bernadette,Think heês getting any better?
Howard,That was a close one.
Raj,Is it too late for him to cancel?
Bernadette,I think so.
Howard,Heads up! Watch out!
Leonard,Are you mad at me?
Penny,"No, stop being stupid."
Leonard,"Um, whew? Is this about the test, or is this about us?"
Penny,"Look, I donêt need a score on a test to make me worry about something Iêm already worried about."
Leonard,What are you worried about?
Penny,"That weêre engaged and have nothing in common, and it scares me."
Leonard,"Yeah, that scares me, too."
Penny,It does?
Penny,"Well, thatês not good. You being blindly infatuated with me was the rock we were building this relationship on."
Leonard,"Okay, well, this might make you feel better. Uh, weêre both scared that our marriage will be a disaster, and so, thatês something that we have in common. Also, we both think Iêm not funny. Huh? See, youêre not laughing."
Howard,"Hey, Mike. Listen, NASA asked me to throw out the first pitch at an Angels game. You got any advice?"
Howard,Why shouldnêt I do it?
Howard,But itês for a good cause. What about all the kids thatêll be there?
Howard,"Well, maybe Iêll do a good job."
Howard,"Okay, thanks for the pep talk."
Bernadette,Heês so nice.
Penny,"Hey, sorry about that."
Amy,"No, weêre sorry. We never should have been comparing relationships in the first place."
Sheldon,"Why? We won. You know, I say, next, we take on Koothrappali and his dog. Really give ourselves a challenge."
Leonard,I just want to say one more thing about this. Just because Penny and I are very different people does not mean that weêre a bad couple.
Sheldon,"The answer is one simple test away. Hmm? You know, itês like when I thought there was a possum in my closet. Did I sit around wondering? No, I sent Leonard in with a pointy stick and a bag."
Leonard,I killed his Chewbacca slippers.
Penny,Letês just take the test.
Leonard,"No, no, no, I donêt want to."
Penny,"Oh, well, êcause you know weêre gonna do bad."
Leonard,Because it doesnêt matter. I donêt care if weêre a ten or a two.
Sheldon,Or a one. A one is possible.
Leonard,"Marriage is scary. Youêre scared, Iêm scared. But it doesnêt make me not want to do it. It, it just makes me want to hold your hand and do it with you."
Amy,It would make me so happy if you said things like that.
Sheldon,"We got an eight-point-two. Trust me, youêre happy."
Raj,"Mmm, I love how they put a waterfall at centre field. It really ties the whole stadium together."
Penny,"Look at you, talking sports."
Leonard,"This is fun, huh? We get to see our friend throw out the first pitch, have a hot dog, watch the game."
Sheldon,Whoa. Nobody said anything about watching the game.
Amy,"Sheldon, what did you expect?"
Sheldon,"I expected to see Howard throw the baseball, finish my hot dog, and hightail it across the street to Disneyland just in time for Mickeyês Soundsational Parade."
Amy,"Iêll tell you what. If we stay, Iêll buy you cotton candy and a bobblehead."
Sheldon,Whoês the bobblehead of?
Amy,Does it matter?
Sheldon,"No, as long as it bobbles."
Bernadette,"Howie, I am so proud of you."
Howard,"Thanks. Iêm proud of me, too."
Howard,Letês do it.
Howard,Wish me luck.
Bernadette,Go get êem.
Howard,Thank you. Thank you.
Penny,Can he really throw a ball?
Leonard,"On our Quidditch team, heÑ"
Penny,"Yeah, thatês a no."
Howard,"I have a message for the young people here today. When I was asked to throw the first pitch, a little voice in my head said I couldnêt do it. So, I practiced and practiced, and you know what? That little voice was right, but then I remembered that Iêm not an athlete. Iêm a scientist. So, todayês first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I present to you a working prototype of the Mars Rover. And hereês the wind-up, and the pitch."
Bernadette,Why is it going so slow?
Howard,‚Cause Iêm an idiot who didnêt think this through.
Sheldon,"Okay, new plan. We go to Disneyland, play hide and seek on Tom Sawyerês Island, and then come back and see the end of the pitch."
Howard,"Okay, while weêre waiting for the ball to arrive, hereês some fun facts about Mars."
Sheldon,He makes a valid point.
Howard,"Okay, booing isnêt gonna make it go any faster."
Leonard,Have you guys heard about this research team thatês trying to transgenically manipulate chicken DNA to create some sort of chicken dinosaur?
Sheldon,"Oh, I think that sounds wonderful."
Howard,Youêre afraid of both dinosaurs and chickens.
Sheldon,"Yes, but tell me a dinosaur chicken salad sandwich wouldnêt hit the Mesozoic spot."
Raj,"Hey, guys."
Raj,We still on for tomorrow night?
Leonard,Yeah. Iêm excited to finally meet your girlfriend.
Sheldon,"Speaking of which, according to a recent study out of Oxford University, when someone takes on a new romantic partner, that person loses one or two close friends."
Howard,Since when do you read social science?
Sheldon,I go to the bathroom like everybody else.
Raj,Why would I lose friends just because I started dating someone?
Leonard,"Yeah, you didnêt lose anyone when you met Amy. Yeah, well, no, this study refers to romantic partners. Not the way I would categorize the two of us."
Raj,You guys kiss and hold hands.
Leonard,Iêve seen him do it. Itês not romantic.
Raj,"Look, Iêm not the kind of guy who drops his friends just because heês in a relationship."
Leonard,What happens if she doesnêt like us?
Raj,"Well, hey, youêre my dear friends. Youêll get a Christmas card for a couple of years, and then youêre dead to me."
Amy,"So, Howard, is Stuart still living with your mom?"
Howard,I donêt want to talk about it.
Bernadette,But heês going to.
Howard,"My mom got him cable. In my whole life, growing up in that house, no cable. Do you know how many HBOs that leech had my mother get him? Seven. Seven HBOs. Seven."
Bernadette,"Long story short, they have seven HBOs."
Raj,"Hey, guys."
Raj,"Emily, you know almost everybody here."
Raj,"And this is Leonard, this is Penny."
Leonard,"Nice to finally meet you, too."
Leonard,"Wow, Raj, you were not lying about her."
Raj,I told you she exists.
Penny,"Hey, I hear youêre a dermatologist."
Sheldon,"Oh, I like their emergency room. Yeah, even if it turns out you donêt have Dengue fever, they still let you take a lollipop."
Bernadette,"You know, Penny just started training to be a pharmaceutical sales rep. Maybe she can practice on you some time."
Penny,"Oh, it would be great to practice on a real doctor."
Sheldon,I have some odd freckles on my buttocks. Can I make an appointment for you to look at them?
Amy,"Iêm with him three years, nothing. Sheês with him two minutes, and heês taking his pants off."
Bernadette,Last night was fun. What did you think of Emily?
Penny,I donêt know. I kind of got the sense she didnêt like me.
Bernadette,Did she say she didnêt like you?
Penny,Of course not. No one ever says they donêt like you straight to your face.
Amy,We have led different lives.
Bernadette,You guys just met. Why would she feel that way?
Penny,Itês just this vibe I got.
Bernadette,Iêm sure youêre worried about nothing.
Penny,"Yeah. Youêre probably right. I used to think my high school P.E. teacher didnêt like me, but it turned out, she liked me a little too much."
Penny,"Yeah. It was fine. We went to a Melissa Etheridge concert, I got an A, it all worked out."
Bernadette,"When you go to Emilyês office to practice, youêll see. Itês fine."
Penny,"Yeah, I hope youêre right."
Amy,You really went your entire life without anyone saying I hate you to your face?
Amy,"Iêd say it now, but look at those cheekbones."
Sheldon,"I miss Stuartês place. All this loud music and exposed brick. is this a comic book store, or a rave at the third little pigês house?"
Howard,"Yep, I wish Stuart would reopen. I hate this place, too."
Leonard,"Okay, him I believe because heês an 80-year-old man in a 15-year-oldês tee shirt. But youêre just upset about Stuart and your mom and all their HBOs."
Howard,"Yes, I am. You know, I canêt even watch Game of Thrones now without thinking of mother saying, Stuart, which one is Thrones?"
Raj,"You know, he might not reopen. He didnêt get a lot of money from the insurance company."
Sheldon,"Oh, boy, if there is one thing that gets my goat, itês those dad-gum insurance companies."
Leonard,"Why? Because they wonêt get off your lawn? Is Stuart trying to get a loan, or, or find investors?"
Howard,"All I know is, heês got my mother buying four-ply toilet paper. I mean, four-ply. If his butt is so delicate, why doesnêt he just use an angora rabbit?"
Sheldon,"For starters, they shed and bite."
Leonard,"Hey, hereês a thought. Why donêt we put up the rest of the money that Stuart needs?"
Raj,"So, weêd be, like, owners of a comic book store?"
Leonard,Itês kind of a dream come true.
Howard,That does sound fun.
Raj,"Ooh, maybe we could come up with a business plan to compete with this place."
Sheldon,"Iêll give you a plan right now. Step one, open comic book store. Step two, start rumour this comic book store gives you genital warts. Step three, buy a big bag to put the money in."
Leonard,Itês not that bad.
Penny,Thank you so much for letting me practice my sales pitch on you. I really appreciate it.
Penny,"Um, I brought coffee. I wasnêt sure what you like, so I got a regular, a cappuccino and a Chai tea. Since you like Raj, I thought you might be into that."
Penny,"Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just get out my materials. Leonard gave me this briefcase. He used to carry it around in high school. You can still see the dent where they whacked him with it. Okay, I would like to talk to you about our new birth control pill, Femevra."
Penny,"So, Femevraês triphasic design provides balanced hormonal exposure."
Penny,"It has also been shown to cause significantly fewer side effects than other oral contraceptives. Although it can cause acne, which, if you ask me, kind of increases its effectiveness as a contraceptive."
Penny,"Okay, Iêm sorry. Did we get off on the wrong foot? Because since the other night, I kind of feel like you might have a problem with me."
Penny,"Are you sure, because it doesnêt seem fine?"
Penny,"Oh, my God. Tell me, what did I do?"
Penny,"Oh, why would he say that?"
Penny,"Well, I wouldnêt exactly call it a hook-up."
Penny,Yeah.
Sheldon,"So, what are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition?"
Leonard,"Oh, kids buy comic books. It would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store."
Howard,"You know, when I was a kid, I loved going there, but I could never get a ride."
Raj,"Ooh, what if we got a van and drove around and picked kids up?"
Sheldon,"Nice. You mean, like at parks and schools?"
Howard,"Toy stores, puppet shows."
Leonard,"Hold on. So, your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up?"
Leonard,And are you gonna use candy to lure them in?
Raj,We are now.
Penny,You told Emily we hooked up?
Raj,"Um, well, in my defence, I tell everybody."
Penny,Why would you say that?
Raj,We were having a conversation about past lovers.
Penny,We werenêt lovers. Come on. Everyone knows we didnêt sleep together. We got drunk and fooled around. Why couldnêt you just leave me out of it?
Raj,"Well, we were being honest. You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dumped Leonard?"
Leonard,Why say it?
Raj,"Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, weêre playing fast and loose with the word list."
Penny,"Well, good job. Now she hates me. Ugh."
Sheldon,"On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who youêre going to lose next."
Raj,"You, okay? Itês you. Youêre, youêre next."
Sheldon,Youêre crazy about me.
Penny,"I donêt know what Emilyês so upset about anyway. Even if I had slept with him, so what? Everyone has a past."
Penny,Almost everyone has a past.
Bernadette,"Come on, look how pretty you are. Iêm sure this isnêt the first girl to hate you."
Penny,Itês not.
Bernadette,And Iêm sure you can turn it around.
Penny,How? You canêt force someone to like you.
Amy,"What if you just hang around and act like her friend until you wear her down? I mean, next thing you know, youêre in her home, youêre eating her food, drinking her wine."
Penny,"No, that wonêt work."
Amy,Youêre right. Cheers.
Bernadette,"Oh, I know. Why donêt you use your sales training to go back down there and sell yourself?"
Bernadette,"Yeah. But instead of selling a drug, youêd be selling Penny. itês cute."
Penny,Itês stupid.
Bernadette,"Well, maybe people would like you more if you didnêt crap all over their ideas."
Amy,"Iêm gonna go with Penny on this one. Then again, why wouldnêt I? I mean, we go way back."
Penny,"Oh, my God. I didnêt used to like you."
Amy,Shh. Amyês here now.
Sheldon,"You know, the more I think about it, the more intrigued I am about having our own store."
Howard,Weêll get to see all the new stuff before it hits the shelves.
Sheldon,"And weêll get to have fun interactions with our customers. Like, this isnêt a library, buy it or get out."
Howard,You say things like that all the time.
Sheldon,"Yes, but as a store owner, Iêll finally have a good comeback to, You donêt work here, shut up."
Leonard,"Uh, do you know how Penny told Raj he should have left her off his list?"
Leonard,"Well, do you think when she and I had that conversation, she left people off her list?"
Sheldon,Iêm sure she did.
Sheldon,"Because if she hadnêt, sheêd still be wading through the list."
Leonard,Will you stay out of this?
Sheldon,If only Penny had said that once in a while.
Howard,"Hey, what difference does it make? Youêre the one she wants to marry."
Leonard,Thatês true.
Howard,"Yeah, and Iêm not sure that complete honesty is always the best thing for a relationship."
Sheldon,"Yeah, heês right. Once, in a moment of candour, I told Amy that her hair reminded me of a duck caught in an oil spill. She stormed out. Which was sad, because we were playing Scrabble, and I had all the letters to spell persimmon."
Leonard,Why are you even part of this conversation? You donêt know anything about women.
Sheldon,"I know that if I had a wife or a fianc_e, Iêd ask her first before I invested money in a comic book store."
Howard,Heês right.
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, of course I am. I was also right about her hair. It did everything but quack."
Leonard,Thereês something I wanted to run past you.
Penny,Whatês up?
Leonard,"Mm, the guys and I were thinking about investing in Stuartês comic book store. Is that okay?"
Penny,Why are you asking me?
Leonard,"Well, you know, weêre engaged, and itês kind of a big deal financially. It seems like something we should talk about."
Penny,"Oh. Well, would you consider mounds of credit card debt kind of a big deal financially?"
Howard,"Mm. So, me and the guys were talking about this great investment opportunity."
Howard,But you didnêt hear what it was.
Bernadette,I know.
Howard,"Oh, come on."
Bernadette,Fine. What is it?
Howard,Itês to help reopen the comic book store.
Howard,"Well, hear me out."
Bernadette,"Howard, you know weêre saving up for a house."
Howard,"I know, but all the guys are doing it. Weêre splitting it four ways, so itês really not that much money."
Bernadette,It just seems like a risky investment.
Howard,"I get that. I, okay, look, the real reason this is important is, before my dad left me and my mom, he used to take me to the comic book store. It was one of the few things we did together."
Bernadette,"Oh. Howie, I had no idea."
Howard,"Well, I donêt like to talk about it."
Bernadette,"Oh, baby. That storyês made up, isnêt it?"
Howard,Thatês how much buying a comic book store means to me.
Sheldon,Iêd like your honest opinion on something.
Amy,Of course.
Sheldon,"Now, before I start, I need you to know that Iêm very excited about this, and anything you say that isnêt enthusiastically supportive will throw our entire relationship into question. So, keep an open mind."
Amy,"Iêm feeling a little backed into a corner, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Perfect. Now, Iêm considering investing in Stuartês comic book store."
Amy,"Interesting. Can you see how a grown man, an accomplished scientist, who invests in a store that sells picture books about flying men in colourful underwear might be wasting both his financial and intellectual resources?"
Amy,Then I think itês a terrific idea.
Sheldon,Great. Wait till you hear about our van.
Raj,Thanks for inviting us over.
Penny,"Oh, thank you for coming."
Penny,"No, no. No need to apologise."
Raj,"Excuse me, can I say something? I just love both you guys, and I want you to get along. And when I say love I meant as a friend. And, uh, way too soon, right?"
Penny,"Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily, what happened between me and Raj was a long time ago."
Raj,"It was, and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have."
Penny,"Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now, and Iêm just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us."
Penny,"Oh, thatês so sweet. I mean, look at you, you are gorgeous."
Raj,"Itês true, youêre both gorgeous. Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both. You get why Iêve been alone most of my adult life."
Howard,"Well, I donêt need a reason, itês my house."
Howard,Iêm always welcome.
Bernadette,"Okay, letês get down to business. Howie was thinking about putting up some money to help you reopen the store, but before that happens, I have a few questions."
Howard,"Excuse me. Ma, you are cancelling that cheque, and Stuart is not your bubala, Iêm your bubala. You canêt have more than one bubala."
Raj,Iêm so glad we could work this all out.
Penny,"Yeah, me, too."
Penny,"Oh, we would love that."
Penny,"Okay, good night, guys."
Raj,Iêm really disappointed weêre not gonna have our own comic book store.
Leonard,I know. I was looking forward to it.
Sheldon,"It wouldêve been so nice to have a place that was ours, where we could just sit and read comics in peace."
Howard,With comfy seats.
Raj,And snacks.
Sheldon,"Well, I guess it was too good to be true."
Raj,"Hey, I read that someone invented a way to convert your footsteps into electromagnetic energy so you can charge your cell phone while walking."
Leonard,We had that idea years ago. How come we never did anything with it?
Howard,"Probably because we left the diagram of it in the restaurant, and none of us wanted to walk back."
Sheldon,"I know the real reason you never made progress with that idea. You thought of it September 22nd, 2007. Two days later, Penny moved in, and so much blood rushed to your genitals, your brain became a ghost town."
Leonard,Thatês not what happened.
Sheldon,I remember it distinctly because I had just composed my annual poem commemorating the anniversary of Dr. Seussês death.
Howard,No one wants to hear it.
Sheldon,"Why, die. Why did he die? Old, told. I was told he was old."
Leonard,Penny is not the reason I didnêt pursue that idea.
Sheldon,"Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have been your greatest accomplishments?"
Raj,Easy. Sleeping with Penny.
Howard,Getting Penny to go back out with him after she dumped him.
Raj,Tricking Penny into getting engaged.
Howard,"And a few weeks ago, he almost did a pull-up."
Leonard,I think someone owes me an apology.
Sheldon,"Well, donêt feel bad. I think weêve all been distracted since the girls entered our lives."
Howard,You admit Amyês a distraction?
Sheldon,"Oh, very much so. Listen to this. This is from two days ago. Hi. Hope youêre having a good day. Who has time for this constant sexting?"
Leonard,"Well, maybe we have lost our focus."
Howard,It wouldnêt kill us to get together and brainstorm ideas.
Raj,"Ooh, we could have one of those retreats."
Howard,My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.
Sheldon,Iêm not going to a cabin in the woods. Did you see the movie Cabin in the Woods?
Leonard,Then weêll go to a hotel.
Sheldon,A hotel? Did you see The Shining?
Raj,We could go up to Big Bear and get a house on the lake.
Sheldon,Did you see The Lake House?
Raj,Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, no, not to them. To me. Time traveling mailbox. The only time that traveled was an hour and half of my life down the toilet."
Leonard,Fine. Then weêll just stay here and do it.
Sheldon,"Well, you didnêt suggest a beach house."
Leonard,You would go to a beach house?
Sheldon,"Well, good Lord, no, have you seen Jaws?"
Leonard,"Hey. So, the guys and I are talking about having kind of a science retreat this weekend. I just wanted to know if thatês okay. You and I had talked about going to brunch on Sunday."
Penny,Want to go to Vegas this weekend?
Amy,Of course I do.
Penny,Bernadette? Girlês weekend. Vegas. You in?
Bernadette,"Hell, yeah."
Penny,Yes. Iêll check flights.
Bernadette,Iêll check hotels.
Amy,"Iêll check my underpants. Iêm so excited, I think I peed."
Leonard,They seem okay with it.
Howard,Hey. I didnêt think youêd make it.
Raj,Why not?
Howard,"Well, êcause you have a steady girlfriend now, and we assumed youêd have to stay home to lower the food down to her in the pit."
Raj,"For your information, Emily is working tonight."
Sheldon,"Yeah, one would assume, on getting out of the pit."
Leonard,"Okay, letês focus. The girls are gone, we have 48 hours. There are no distractions. Letês change the world."
Sheldon,Thinking caps on.
Howard,Here we go.
Raj,"Ooh, this is exciting. Weêre innovating. I feel like weêre in the Facebook movie."
Howard,Oh. I never saw that.
Raj,"Oh. Itês wonderful, and I swear Iêm not saying that because Justin Timberlake is in it."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray. We should watch it."
Raj,Cool. Iêll make the popcorn.
Leonard,"Guys, in 30 seconds, we went from letês change the world to letês watch TV."
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. Is that a no?
Howard,Okay. Leonardês right. Weêre here to focus. Didnêt we used to have a list of all our ideas?
Leonard,"I, I think I still have it."
Sheldon,I did not get a clear answer. Iêm gonna set this down now.
Leonard,"Ah, here it is. Whoa. I havenêt looked at these in years. Robot girlfriend."
Howard,"Mm, that was mine."
Leonard,Robot prostitute.
Howard,Also mine.
Sheldon,Wait. Iêm confused. Why would you need both a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?
Howard,Thereês just some things you donêt do with your robot girlfriend.
Raj,"Boy, when you met Bernadette, the field of robotics really took a hit."
Leonard,"Okay, letês just skip all the inventions you can have sex with. All right, no, here we go, ergonomic heated seat cushion."
Howard,"No, it vibrates. Keep going."
Leonard,"You know, letês just come up with something new."
Sheldon,"You know, a number of significant innovations have been inspired by science fiction. The, the geosynchronous satellite from Arthur C. Clarke. The Motorola flip phone, that came from Star Trek. And Iêve long suspected that the idea of an African-American president was stolen from the movie Deep Impact."
Raj,"Hey, the future they show in Back to the Future II is only a year away. A lot of the things in that movie havenêt been invented yet."
Leonard,How cool would that be if we could make one of those a reality?
Sheldon,"If we could figure out the scientific basis for Martyês hover board, that would have universal application."
Leonard,"Well, itês, itês possible at absolute zero, but we would have to remove the temperature restrictions."
Raj,"Oh, I have an idea."
Sheldon,I think I have the same one.
Howard,We got to watch Back to the Future II.
Raj,Iêll make the popcorn.
Penny,"So, where should we go first?"
Amy,Ooh. Thereês a cover band in the lounge.
Amy,But they play Barry Manilow.
Amy,But theyêre called Fairly Manilow.
Penny,Oh. Okay.
Bernadette,"Well, what do you want to do?"
Penny,"Well, weêre in Vegas. I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere."
Amy,What if we donêt want to vomit?
Penny,"Oh, you will. Thatês why they give you the bucket. Uh-oh."
Penny,Itês my boss. They moved my field ride up to Monday.
Amy,What does that mean?
Penny,"It means instead of having a week to study, I only have two days."
Bernadette,That sucks.
Amy,Can you start in the morning?
Penny,"Uh, itês kind of a lot. You know, let me do a little tonight, and Iêll catch up with you guys later."
Bernadette,You sure?
Penny,"Yeah, itês okay. Go ahead."
Amy,"So, um, now that Pennyês not comingÑ"
Bernadette,Weêre not seeing Fairly Manilow.
Howard,"Hold on. Pause. Something doesnêt make sense. Look, in 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955, to give it to his younger self. But as soon as he does that, he changes the future, so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015, not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in."
Sheldon,"Wait. Whoa, whoa. Is placed right?"
Leonard,What do you mean?
Sheldon,Is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future?
Leonard,Had will have placed?
Sheldon,Thatês my boy.
Leonard,"Okay, so, it wasnêt until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions. Thatês when he altered the timeline."
Sheldon,"Yeah, but he had will havenêt placed it!"
Sheldon,"Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine, this couldnêt be more simple. When Biff gets the almanac in 1955, the alternate future he creates isnêt the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever use the time machine to travel to 2015. Therefore, in the new timeline, Marty and Doc never brought the time machineÑ"
Leonard,Wait. Is brought right?
Sheldon,Marty and Doc never had have had brought?
Leonard,I donêt know. You did it to me.
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm going with it. Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015. That means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff. Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac. And not just never gets. Never have, never hasnêt, never had have hasnêt."
Raj,"Heês right. Also, what kind of name is Biff? Sounds like when you pop open a can of Pillsbury dough. Biff."
Howard,"Oh, that stuff is so good wrapped around cocktail weenies."
Sheldon,"Do you know that the word wiener comes from the German name of the Austrian capital Vienna, or Wien?"
Raj,Do you know if you look at Austria on a map it actually looks like a wiener?
Leonard,"Guys, what are we doing? We sent the girls away so we could focus."
Sheldon,I donêt think it worked.
Amy,"Maybe after this, youêll be in the mood for some Manilow."
Bernadette,"I think after this, Iêll be dead."
Amy,"Look at us out, while Pennyês in the room studying."
Bernadette,Iêm proud of her. This is a great opportunity. Itês nice to see her take it seriously.
Amy,It is. But enough about Penny. Letês talk about us. Weêre looking good.
Bernadette,We are.
Amy,"Better than good. I mean, look at you. Your bodyês banginê."
Amy,"Donêt Amy me. Weêre always talking about how hot Penny is. Come on, scientist to scientist, how big are those Hadron Colliders?"
Bernadette,Youêre embarrassing me.
Amy,"Oh, donêt be embarrassed. Iêll show you the divot in my spine."
Amy,"No, no, itês okay. I was born with it. If you put a double-A battery in there, it makes my leg kick."
Leonard,All right.
Sheldon,"Oh, this is already better. There are far fewer distractions in here."
Raj,"Plus, this is where our minds are conditioned to focus on work."
Leonard,"So, Iêve been thinking about the hover boards, and maybe thereês a way we could use Maglev technology."
Howard,"Or if we could figure out a way to supercool the materials, we could utilize quantum coupling."
Sheldon,"Well, I wonder if anyoneês tried that."
Raj,Go online and look it up.
Howard,"Oh, I canêt argue with him. Itês right there on the screen. Austria does look like a wiener."
Raj,"Thatês nothing, dude. Go check out how hung Florida is."
Leonard,Iêm sure Mrs. Floridaês walking funny. Can we get back to work?
Sheldon,"Yeah, heês right. Oh, hereês a thought. What if we use some form of operant conditioning techniques to keep us from getting off topic?"
Howard,Like behavior modification?
Sheldon,"Yeah, exactly. Did you know those techniques were used to actually teach pigeons to play ping-pong?"
Raj,That cannot be true.
Raj,"Hey, it was match point."
Leonard,Some psychologists perform operant conditioning with punishment. Maybe we can come up with a punishment for straying off topic.
Raj,Not getting to see who wins at pigeon ping-pong comes to mind.
Howard,We could snap a rubber band on our wrists every time we get sidetracked.
Sheldon,"Mmm, not bad. You know, in medieval times, idle chatter was punished with a device called the scoldês bridle. Itês an iron cage thatês locked around the head and pierces the tongue."
Leonard,If only we had one.
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêll check Amazon."
Amy,We had a complaint about somebody pooping on a party in there.
Bernadette,It was us the whole time.
Amy,Whyêd you tell her? It was working.
Bernadette,Was it working?
Bernadette,"Oh, Iêm so sorry."
Penny,You guys look like youêre having fun.
Amy,Weêre having the best time.
Bernadette,Guess who won a hundred dollars playing craps.
Penny,Thatês a dollar.
Bernadette,Then guess who wildly overtipped a cocktail waitress.
Amy,"Hey, Penny, hey, letês go. We found a place that has Australian male strippers."
Bernadette,We want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction.
Penny,That sounds so great. But I have a little more studying to do.
Amy,Can you believe this nerd?
Bernadette,"Come on, do you want to sit here being a loser, or do you want to watch me climb into an Australian manês G-string like a baby kangaroo?"
Penny,"All right, guys, look, I would love to go out, but Iêve got to get this done, okay? So have fun at the club. And if you get in trouble, find a policeman. And if heês taking off his pants, he is not a real policeman."
Amy,"Okay, okay, this is obviously very important to her. Letês just, weêll help her study so she can get done quicker. Here, here, Iêm gonna quiz you. Iêm gonna quiz you. I got your notes. I got your notes. I got your notes. If you want these, theyêre gonna be at the strip club."
Bernadette,Arenêt you gonna chase her?
Penny,To the walk-in closet? Sure.
Leonard,"Okay, so we agree, whenever someone takes us off topic they get their arm hair yanked off."
Raj,And I really canêt let that happen or the girl who does my eyebrows will think Iêve been cheating on her.
Leonard,"All right, now, one benefit of quantum couplingÑ"
Sheldon,"Wait, a question, who decides if someoneês gone off topic?"
Leonard,"I think itêll be pretty clear. If not, weêll take a vote. Oh, and alsoÑ"
Sheldon,Ow. We didnêt vote!
Leonard,"We didnêt have to, that was clearly a tangent. Now come on. Back to work. If weêre leaning towards quantum couplingÑ Aah! Why?"
Sheldon,You said quantum coupling. That made me think of the show Quantum Leap. Thatês a tangent and itês your fault.
Howard,"Thatês ridiculous. Sheldon, I vote that is not a tangent."
Leonard,Thank you. And now I owe you one.
Sheldon,Ow. That was your fault.
Raj,"Ooh, that is a lot of hair. Ow. And now Iêm gonna hear it from Jenny."
Leonard,Everyone stop. This was a stupid idea. Negative reinforcement isnêt working.
Sheldon,I think you mean positive punishment. Negative reinforcement is the removal of a positive stimulus. Itês a common mistake.
Howard,Negative reinforcement is really wrong?
Sheldon,"Oh, itês used incorrectly all the time. Even Bill Murray makes that mistake in the first scene of Ghostbusters."
Raj,No way. Not Bill Murray.
Raj,Huh. Bill Murray did get it wrong.
Howard,Jump ahead to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.
Sheldon,Leonardês right. We canêt just jump ahead. We have to watch the whole movie.
Leonard,"Look. We keep procrastinating. We saw Back to the Future II, pigeons playing ping-pong, a bunch of countries that look like genitals and one guy whose genitals look like Denmark."
Raj,"Yeah, sorry for clicking on that."
Leonard,Itês late. Weêve wasted hours. Can we please find it in ourselves to do any amount of work tonight?
Sheldon,But we didnêt see them bust one ghost.
Leonard,"So youêre, youêre saying we should stand here in my lab on a Saturday night and watch the rest of Ghostbusters on a crappy laptop?"
Leonard,It really does hold up.
Bernadette,See? Isnêt this better than a hotel room?
Penny,Yep. Shake that thing.
Bernadette,Have you ever seen a body so fine?
Amy,"We had some pretty hot corpses in my anatomy class, but none of them moved like that."
Penny,"Good morning. You want to go to the pool? Come on, you said it yourself, only nerds and losers stay in the room. Wow, itês bright out. Isnêt it bright? I should probably close these curtains. Nah. Bye."
Bernadette,Would you please close the drapes?
Bernadette,I like your suit.
Penny,"Oh, thanks. Got a couple new outfits for work."
Howard,"How does it feel knowing your fianc_eês job is to go out and flirt with doctors, looking like that, while you sit here, you know, looking like this?"
Leonard,She doesnêt flirt with doctors.
Penny,Yeah. Itês all very professional.
Amy,"You know when you bend over, I can see down your shirt?"
Penny,"Okay, good."
Bernadette,"Speaking of new careers, how are things going with dark matter, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,"Oh, yeah, Iêd have to say itês the most exiting time in the history of the field."
Bernadette,Oh. Whatês going on?
Sheldon,I started doing it.
Raj,"You know, the government funded the biggest experiment yet to detect dark matter."
Leonard,"Yeah, Iêve read about that, theyêre sending research teams down into abandoned salt mines."
Raj,"You know, Sheldon, if we apply to be one of those teams, we could be on the ground floor of something big, not just for theoretical physics but for astrophysics as well."
Penny,"Wait, hang on, you guys are gonna work in a mine?"
Sheldon,Why not?
Penny,You had a panic attack when we went through the car wash.
Sheldon,Perhaps the emotion youêre referring to was shock at you having something cleaned.
Leonard,"I think what Penny meant is, the thought of you two in a mine is kind of funny, itês like a cat riding a Roomba."
Bernadette,Maybe they could ride around in one of those mine carts that go ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo.
Leonard,"Yeah, itêll help them get away when they see a g-g-ghost."
Sheldon,I miss the old days when I couldnêt tell.
Leonard,"So, one of my favourite video games of all time is called Shadow of the Colossus, and it was only for PlayStation 2, but then they came out with a new version for PS3 with better graphics. I finally got the chance to play it, and for some reason, it just wasnêt as good as the first one. Or something about yoga."
Penny,"Iêm sorry, I was thinking about work."
Leonard,"Well, I was just saying that there was this video gameÑ"
Penny,"Yeah, thatês when I started thinking about work. Uh, listen, Iêve got some good news."
Penny,This is for you.
Leonard,Huh. What is this?
Penny,"Well, you know how they gave me the company car? Didnêt make sense to have two, so I sold the other one."
Leonard,The one I gave you?
Penny,"Yeah. And thereês your money back, and now weêre even. How great is that?"
Leonard,"Uh, yeah."
Penny,"Oh, come on, Leonard, I know the car was a thoughtful gesture and I really appreciate it, but it doesnêt make sense to have both."
Leonard,Youêre right.
Penny,What should I have done? Taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says best fianc_ ever?
Leonard,Doesnêt sound that bad.
Penny,"Well, good, because thatês what I did."
Leonard,"Aw, oh, thank you. That is so sweet."
Penny,"Well, itês not that sweet, I paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage."
Leonard,"You know what, you donêt have to give me this. You keep it."
Leonard,"The car was a gift, it was something you needed. I was happy to help you out."
Penny,"And I really appreciate it, but now I donêt need it, so here you go."
Leonard,"Well, this is silly, so you donêt need the car, but you could use it to buy yourself something else, like a new purse to put all this money in."
Penny,"Sweetie, I can buy my own stuff. I have a good job now."
Leonard,"I know, and Iêm proud of you, but that doesnêt mean I canêt do something nice. Like this."
Penny,"Okay, I donêt want this to turn into a fight."
Leonard,"I donêt, either."
Penny,"Great. Thank you. Can you pass the salt, please?"
Leonard,"Sure. In my mind, that broke the tension with comedy and led to sex."
Raj,"Hey, Sheldon, you busy?"
Sheldon,"Iêm always busy. This mind is capable of advanced multitasking. You know, currently, Iêm attempting to solve the Penrose conjecture, Iêm composing my Nobel acceptance speech for when Iêve solved the Penrose conjecture, and Iêm wondering how mermaids have babies."
Raj,Donêt they lay eggs on a rock?
Sheldon,Now Iêve got room for another thing. What do you want?
Raj,"So, I did a little research on what the conditions are like in the mines, and the guys might be right, sounds pretty rough down there. For starters, itês very humid, and about a hundred degrees."
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm from Texas and youêre from India, weêre no strangers to the fragrant armpit. Next."
Raj,"Itês also a live mine, so thereêll be dynamite explosions going off in the distance."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I have a lactose intolerant roommate with a taste for ice cream. Next."
Raj,"Oh, you have to be down there for 12 hours at a time."
Sheldon,Yeah? We have to be somewhere.
Raj,"Well, thereês no toilets, weêll have to do our business in a bucket."
Sheldon,"So itês settled, weêre not doing it."
Raj,"Look, I get it, but before we pass up on an incredible opportunity, I was thinking about when Howard was training to go to space, they put him in a simulated environment."
Sheldon,Interesting. Youêre suggesting that we recreate the conditions of the mine to see if we can handle it.
Sheldon,Very well.
Raj,So where should we do it?
Sheldon,"Well, Iêll just Google hot, dark and moist, see what comes up."
Raj,"Uh, SheldonÑ"
Sheldon,"Oh, there, well, look, thereês all kinds of videos."
Leonard,"Hey, you got a sec?"
Penny,Hi. Sure.
Leonard,I was hoping we could talk about the money again.
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, just forget about it."
Leonard,"No, no, no, no, hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night."
Penny,"Well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count as weird."
Leonard,"Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution."
Leonard,"Why donêt we just put the money in a joint account? Itêll be our first money together. We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever."
Penny,"You know what, thatês great. I love that."
Leonard,"Yeah, of course you do, Iêm not just a genius in bed. You sure are, baby."
Penny,You two want to be alone?
Leonard,"I want you to know I get why you donêt want the money, youêve got this new job, youêre excited about being financially independent, and I am nothing but proud of you."
Penny,"Oh, thank you so much. It feels so good to hear you say that. And I want you to know that I get this job kind of changes the balance in our relationship, and Iêm trying to be sensitive to that."
Penny,"Well, I just think that maybe youêre a little hung up on the money because Iêm less reliant on you now, and thatês a little scary."
Leonard,Hmm. Maybe. Or maybe I tried to do something nice and maybe you had a problem with it because of your control issues.
Penny,Control issues?
Penny,"Or, maybe now that Iêm no longer an out-of-work actress who canêt pay for her own dinner, that makes you a little insecure."
Leonard,"Well, I canêt believe youêd say that. You know how insecure I am about my insecurities."
Penny,You know what? Iêm sorry. Itês stupid to fight over money.
Leonard,"Yeah, Iêm sorry, too. Weêre about to share the rest of our lives together. Itês our money, who cares who has it?"
Penny,"Ugh, Youêre right, who cares? Mm. Get that money out of my back pocket or I will break your fingers."
Raj,Huh. All this time I never knew there were steam tunnels down here.
Amy,"Most universities have them. When I was an undergrad, I spent three days in one pledging a sorority."
Raj,Did you get in?
Amy,They forgot I was there. But it really opened up my pores.
Sheldon,"Well, according to my research, the steam tunnels below this access point should be the closest analog to the mines."
Raj,This is gonna be so much more accurate than the steam room at the gym.
Sheldon,"Plus, thereês almost no chance weêll see any of our coworkers half naked."
Raj,"Or totally naked. I love Howard, but the dude needs a little shame."
Sheldon,"All right, Amy, this walkie-talkie is yours. If we run into any problems, Iêll contact you. And if anything bad happens, whatês the rule?"
Amy,Save you first; come back for Raj only if thereês time.
Raj,Weêre going to be fine.
Amy,"Sheldon, Iêm really impressed youêre willing to try this."
Sheldon,"Well, admittedly, this brushes up against my well-known aversions to heat, small places, going below floor-level, dampness, hatches, ladders, darkness, echoes, and eliminating in Home Depot buckets. That last one is quite new, but I have a feeling thatês gonna rocket to the top of the list."
Raj,Iêm sweating already.
Sheldon,"Yeah, as the person beneath you, allow me to say, I know."
Raj,How hot is it?
Sheldon,"Uh, letês see. 704? No, wait, itês on clock. Uh, the real answer isnêt much better. 102 degrees."
Raj,"Well, thatês what we wanted. This is as hot as the mines will be."
Sheldon,"True. Sheldonês Mine Simulation Log, entry one. Koothrappaliês restating of the obvious is already getting on my nerves."
Leonard,Thanks again for having us.
Howard,"Oh, of course. What did you guys want to talk about?"
Penny,"Well, you know, now that weêre engaged, we had some questions about how you handle money as a couple."
Bernadette,I told you they werenêt gonna ask us to swing with them.
Howard,I didnêt think they were going to. I just wanted to have a way to say no without hurting Leonardês feelings.
Leonard,"Well, nailed it."
Howard,So what did you want to know?
Penny,"Well, do you guys ever fight over money?"
Bernadette,"Sure, sometimes. I mean, it can be a little awkward since I make so much more money than Howie."
Howard,You didnêt have to say so much more.
Bernadette,"Well, I didnêt have to, but for the sake of accuracy I felt that I should."
Howard,"I brought a lot of significant assets into the relationship, too."
Bernadette,Like what? Your incomplete set of Star Trek collector plates?
Howard,"For your information, I just bought the last one I needed on eBay."
Bernadette,Without asking me?
Howard,There were only three minutes left in the auction and it was a mint condition Scotty from a smoke-free home.
Bernadette,"How much, Howie?"
Howard,Not a lot.
Bernadette,How much?
Howard,Letês not talk about this in front of our friends.
Bernadette,Was it more or less than falconry school?
Howard,"For the tenth time, that was a Groupon."
Leonard,Like I would swing with him.
Raj,How you feeling?
Sheldon,Good. Little claustrophobic.
Raj,Letês set up the equipment. Itêll help take your mind off of it.
Sheldon,Miners often sang mining songs to keep their spirits up.
Raj,Do you know any mining songs?
Sheldon,"Just the hits.  Where itês dark as a dungeon, and itês damp as the dew."
Raj,Thatês pretty.
Sheldon,"Where the dangers are double, and the pleasures are few. Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines, yes, itês dark as a dungeon way down in the mine."
Raj,Itês a little more bleak than I thought.
Sheldon,"Well, I pray when Iêm dead and the ages shall roll, that my body will blacken and turn into coal."
Raj,Getting kind of grim.
Sheldon,"Then Iêll look from the door of my heavenly home, and pity the miner that mines my poor bones."
Raj,Okay. How êbout a little Miley Cyrus next?
Sheldon,Whoês he?
Howard,Talk about wasted money. What about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didnêt pay the bill on time?
Bernadette,"Well, maybe I would have paid it if I wasnêt also doing everything else around here."
Howard,"Oh, youêre saying I donêt do anything around here. Look at my chore chart."
Leonard,She made him a chore chart.
Penny,I see it.
Howard,Do the dishes. Thereês a star right there.
Bernadette,That was a pity star. Putting water in the roasting pan and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes.
Howard,That pan had to soak and you know it.
Bernadette,"Well, donêt come crying to me when you donêt get your allowance."
Howard,"Itês not an allowance. Itês a stipend, and we said we werenêt gonna call it an allowance in front of my friends."
Leonard,"I usually donêt like lemon bars, but these, these are really good."
Raj,"So, as Hannah Montana, Miley was a world-famous pop star. But then she would take off her wig and go to school like a normal girl. Which, I donêt have to tell you, at that age, is its own headache."
Sheldon,Thatês preposterous. How would she go unrecognized just by wearing a wig?
Raj,But youêre okay with Superman concealing his identity with a pair of glasses?
Sheldon,He doesnêt just put on a pair of glasses. He combs back his curlicue and affects a mild-mannered personality.
Amy,You guys doing okay down there?
Sheldon,I told you to use the walkie-talkie!
Amy,You guys doing okay down there?
Sheldon,Please keep this channel clear for emergencies. Thank you.
Amy,Iêm going to the vending machine. Do you want anything?
Sheldon,This is a simulation. We have to survive on the supplies we brought.
Amy,"Okay, just checking."
Raj,We should have asked her to get some Funyuns.
Sheldon,Youêre not going to have Funyuns when weêre a mile below the surface of the Earth.
Raj,What if we brought them down with us?
Sheldon,Weêll take some Funyuns.
Amy,Anything else?
Sheldon,"Some York Peppermint Patties, a couple of Dr. Peppers, and run to Best Buy and see if they have a portable DVD player and season one of a show called Hannah Montana."
Raj,"Have her get season two. Season one, it was still finding itself."
Bernadette,Sorry you guys had to see that.
Penny,"Oh, donêt apologize."
Leonard,Yeah. It just makes it a lot harder to pretend it never happened.
Bernadette,Moneyês a sensitive subject for Howie because of the difference in our income.
Penny,It really bothers him?
Bernadette,"Well, sure. Thereês still a lot of pressure on guys to be providers. So even though heês happy for me, itês just a little tough on him."
Penny,"Well, if I do well in sales, I could end up making a lot more money than you."
Leonard,"Not a problem. I grew up with a mother who emasculated my father financially and in every other aspect of his life, so really, itês what I think love looks like."
Bernadette,Iêll be right back. Iêm gonna go check on him.
Penny,Maybe itês a good thing we came here. Itês like a lesson in what not to do.
Leonard,Yeah I donêt want something dumb like money to come between us.
Penny,It wonêt. Letês just promise to figure this kind of stuff out before we get married.
Howard,Why are you being so bossy?
Bernadette,Why are you being a baby?
Howard,"Iêm not a baby. Iêm a grown man, and I made the bed. Now whereês my star?"
Leonard,Should we go?
Penny,Hang on. I want to see if he gets the star.
Raj,"Oh, this heat is brutal."
Sheldon,"As someone from the tropical subcontinent of India, you should know that fanning yourself in a humid environment only raises your body temperature."
Raj,Huh. That does explain why the servants used to look so hot while they were fanning me. Letês get our minds off how uncomfortable we are. We could take some more simulated instrument readings.
Sheldon,My major focus at the moment is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.
Raj,Howês that going?
Sheldon,"You tell me. I feel like I canêt breathe, and I am tempted to crack you open and suck the air right out of your lungs."
Raj,"Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop."
Sheldon,Weêre not stopping.
Raj,You donêt have to bite my head off.
Sheldon,"I apologize. I just, Iêm plagued by an internal struggle."
Raj,"If you would just use the bucket, youêd be so much more comfortable."
Sheldon,My struggle is emotional.
Raj,Oh. Is it Amy?
Sheldon,"Itês dark matter. When I entered the field of string theory, I was a prodigy. I rose to a position of respect, and I assumed my career would continue on that upward trajectory. Now here I am in my 30s, Iêm back at square one. And, frankly, itês frightening."
Raj,"Sheldon, you know what I think of when Iêm scared? Voyager."
Sheldon,Voyager the space probe or Voyager the Star Trek TV show?
Raj,The space probe.
Sheldon,Good. Because I am too hot and tired to go on about how much I hate Voyager the TV show.
Raj,"By the time I was born, Voyager 1ês mission was supposed to be over. It had seen Jupiter and Saturn and all their moons, but it kept going. When I left India for America, I was never more scared in my life. I had no idea what lay ahead. Whenever I feel that way, I think about how Voyager is still out there somewhere beyond our solar system, going further than anyone ever thought it could. Donêt leave. You can do this."
Amy,"Sheldon, is everything okay?"
Sheldon,Itês too late for Koothrappali. Letês go.
Amy,11 minutes. Thatês longer than I thought.
Raj,Theyêre in my shirt. Theyêre in my shirt. Theyêre in my shirt.
Penny,"Okay, this is definitely the most fun thing we can do with the money."
Leonard,"Iêve never done it on a big old pile of cash before. Me neither, Leonard. Itês my first time, too."
Bernadette,Iêm so sorry I made you feel bad about the money stuff.
Howard,Itês okay.
Bernadette,"No, itês not okay. I want us to be partners, equals. Adults in a mature relationship."
Howard,"I want that, too."
Bernadette,"Now, letês talk about your birthday party."
Howard,"Ooh, laser tag, laser tag."
Amy,Do you really need me to transcribe this?
Sheldon,"Youêre not doing it for me. Youêre doing it for future generations who will benefit from my struggle.  Sheldonês Mine Simulation Log, entry four. My Kit Kat has melted. All is lost."
Raj,"You call yourself a friend? I was trying to help you, and at the first sign of trouble you ran away, leaving me to fend off a family of rats. Youêre a completely selfish human being and a, and a physical and a moral coward."
Sheldon,His statements of the obvious continue to annoy.
Bernadette,"So, what are you working on these days?"
Amy,Iêm studying one-celled organisms to try and find the neurochemicals that lead to the feeling of shame.
Bernadette,What would a one-celled organism have to be embarrassed about?
Penny,"Same as all of us, getting out of a car without underwear."
Bernadette,"Speaking of underwear, I have some interesting news."
Penny,"Okay, if itês sometimes Howie wears yours, Leonard already told us."
Bernadette,"He was being funny. Iêm pretty sure. Anyway, I was asked to be a part of a magazine article about the 50 sexiest female scientists in California. Isnêt that cool?"
Amy,I think itês awful.
Penny,Why would you say that?
Amy,"Bernadette is a successful microbiologist. She should be celebrated for her achievements, not her looks. I mean, what kind of message does that send?"
Penny,I think the message is check out the rack on that scientist.
Bernadette,Why canêt someone be thought of as both smart and pretty?
Amy,I just donêt think a professional woman should have to flaunt her sexuality in order to get ahead.
Penny,"Okay, whatês the big deal? Look, if it helps me make a sale with a physician, I donêt think it hurts to flirt a little. I mean, laugh at their joke, touch their arm, maybe crank up the AC in the car beforehand, you know, to wake up the girls."
Amy,"Maybe itês different in the world of sales, but itês already hard enough for women to be taken seriously in science."
Bernadette,"I was kind of excited about the article, but now youêre making me feel bad."
Penny,"No, I think you should do whatever you want. You know, maybe if fashion magazines had female scientists in them, I wouldêve become a theoretical physicist. Stop smirking at each other."
Sheldon,"No, thank you. Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers of our nationês commerce. Itês because of people like you, people like me can limit our human contact. Iêd shake your hand, but, well, you know."
Sheldon,Thatês humorous.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I bet you leave your patients in stitches. That was also humorous."
Sheldon,Are you bringing flowers to a patient to cushion the blow of a terminal diagnosis? That wasnêt a joke.
Sheldon,"Hmm. You know, they have delivery people that will do that for you."
Sheldon,Making the extra effort. Good for you.
Leonard,"Great timing, food just got here."
Sheldon,"Ooh, Siam Palace?"
Sheldon,"Uh, mee krob and chicken satay?"
Sheldon,"Uh, extra peanut sauce?"
Leonard,"No, but you can have mine."
Sheldon,"Eh, well, very well. Oh, and on the topic of sharing things that are yours, there is a gentleman caller bringing flowers to your fianc_e as we speak."
Leonard,Why didnêt you say that first?
Sheldon,Why didnêt you get extra peanut sauce? We can both play this game.
Leonard,Can I help you?
Leonard,May I ask why?
Leonard,"Okay, um, look, Iêm pretty sure she didnêt wink at you."
Leonard,"I got it, I got it. Listen, um, I think thereês been a misunderstanding. See, Penny is my fianc_e."
Leonard,I think so.
Leonard,Excuse me?
Leonard,Thank you. Sorry.
Sheldon,"Hold on, Doctor. Leonard, where are your social skills? This man is clearly upset. We should invite him in for a hot beverage."
Leonard,He tried to score with Penny.
Sheldon,"So have these two, and theyêre having dinner with us."
Amy,"So, how was work today?"
Bernadette,"It was fine, but youêll be happy to know they pulled the sexy scientists article."
Amy,What happened?
Bernadette,I donêt know. They just canceled the photo shoot and said theyêre rethinking it.
Amy,"Well, Iêm really sorry, but I think itês for the best. You want people focusing on your achievements, not staring at your breasts in some magazine."
Bernadette,"I guess. Itês really not that important. Hey, up here."
Amy,"Sorry, itês just weêre, we were talking about them. So, look, I, I wasnêt going to say anything, but since you seem to be okay with the article being canceled, I have a little confession. Iêm the reason it was pulled."
Bernadette,How?
Amy,I sent the editors of the magazine a pretty scathing e-mail.
Bernadette,"Amy, what did you say?"
Amy,"I simply pointed out that they would never consider doing an article ranking male scientists on their sexuality, let alone showing them in various stages of undress."
Bernadette,"Because no one wants to see Neil deGrasse Tyson in a wet T-shirt, bent over the hood of a Porsche."
Amy,"Well, it doesnêt make a difference, because they agreed it was in bad taste, and now you agree, so Amy saves the day."
Bernadette,"No, what happened was you got jealous, so you took away a chance for me to get some publicity."
Amy,But it was bad publicity.
Bernadette,"Thatês for me to decide, not you."
Amy,"I disagree. As a female scientist, I think what you do affects all of us."
Bernadette,"And I think you donêt like people expressing their sexuality because no one wants you to express yours. Oh, Amy, Iêm so sorry. That was over the line."
Amy,You have a nice night.
Bernadette,"Please donêt go. Up until my vicious attack, you were the one in the wrong."
Sheldon,"Here you go, Doctor. Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey."
Raj,"Oh, cool."
Howard,Howêd you get that?
Howard,"Wow, he really went where no man has gone before."
Leonard,That is amazing. How long have you been collecting?
Sheldon,Whatêd you get? Whatêd you get?
Raj,I would love to see your collection.
Howard,We know.
Leonard,"Oh. Well, you know, just being myself, really."
Sheldon,"Oh, please, you know, Iêll tell you how he did it. Implacable, relentless badgering. In urology terms, he was a drug-resistant staph infection. And she was a urethra that could not shake him."
Leonard,I donêt know that Iêd call myself an infection.
Howard,A gallant man would defend his fianc_e for being called a urethra.
Leonard,Can we please change the subject?
Raj,"Well, that didnêt go your way."
Penny,"Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?"
Penny,Really? Why?
Leonard,"Ah, thatês a good question. Apparently someone was being awfully flirty while not wearing their engagement ring, causing another someone to show up here thinking the first someone might be available."
Sheldon,"Oh, God. Donêt make it so hard on her. Look, the first someone is the deceitful you. The second someone is the delightful Dr. Lorvis."
Penny,"Oh, this is very embarrassing. Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry. I did not mean to lead you on."
Penny,Oh. Thatês why you were mumbling Mississippi.
Leonard,Can we talk in private?
Penny,"Please, yes."
Leonard,Iêll be right back.
Sheldon,So what other celebrity genitalia have you handled?
Leonard,"So, uh, whatês the deal? You take off your ring when you go to work?"
Penny,"No, no, I just put it on the other hand and turn it around. Keep that hand in my pocket."
Penny,"Well, what do you mean why? Look, I make more sales if these doctors think Iêm single. I did the same kind of thing as a waitress. The real question is, what is he doing in your apartment?"
Leonard,"Oh, he was upset. So Sheldon invited him in for a hot beverage."
Penny,You were okay with that?
Leonard,"I got upset. And Sheldon made me a beverage, too."
Penny,"Okay, he just showed up at my door. Donêt you think thatês a little weird?"
Leonard,"A little, but heês basically harmless. Heês actually kind of a nice guy."
Penny,"Okay. Whatever, look, my company does not allow me to socialize with doctors outside of work. You got to get rid of him."
Leonard,Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?
Penny,"I canêt do it, heês my best client."
Leonard,"All right, Iêll get rid of him. But you owe me one."
Raj,"Hey, weêre going to Oliverês house to see his collection. You want to go with us?"
Leonard,"Yeah, sure. You owe me."
Leonard,"Oh, my God."
Sheldon,"Leonard, I was wrong. Heaven does exist. And itês in the basement of a urologistês house in Sherman Oaks."
Howard,"Oh, come on. Itês a replica."
Howard,"Oh, I think I just cheated on my wife."
Raj,The gun from Hellboy?
Raj,How did you get it?
Raj,"Oh, I was hoping for a juicy tidbit about Ron Perlmanês testicles."
Howard,"Still lives with his ma. Yikes, right?"
Raj,"Yeah, Iêm not quite sure how to respond."
Leonard,"Wow, Donkey Kong. This, this was my game when I was a kid."
Sheldon,"Because itês a story of a pretty blonde girl tirelessly pursued by a small, oddly-shaped man?"
Leonard,"No, because I liked it."
Sheldon,"Well, now, donêt get defensive. Youêre oddly-shaped, but you got the girl."
Sheldon,"Yes. If youêd like to join in, the premise is their love seems unlikely and doomed to failure."
Sheldon,"Oh, if you want to get in on the pool, youêre too late. All the squares have been purchased."
Sheldon,"Leonard, as your friend I feel I should tell you something."
Sheldon,Iêm still upset about that peanut sauce.
Amy,Nice flowers.
Amy,Isnêt she lucky?
Amy,Whatês that?
Amy,I guess thatês all anybody wants.
Amy,"Well, I hope you get it."
Leonard,"Next game, letês switch helmets."
Sheldon,"No, Iêd look silly in that helmet."
Amy,I canêt take these.
Amy,But what about the other girl?
Penny,Dr. Lorvis?
Raj,You think he bites?
Howard,Stick your head in there and find out.
Raj,You fooled me with that goat at the petting zoo. You will not fool me again.
Leonard,I wonder where Dr. Lorvis is. Heês been gone a while.
Raj,Maybe heês playing bingo with his mommy.
Howard,Itês sad how some guys canêt cut the apron strings.
Raj,"Okay, now youêre messing with me."
Leonard,"Uh, guys, weêre locked in here."
Sheldon,"Oh, this day just keeps getting better."
Penny,"So, you just left them alone playing games in your house?"
Amy,We all have a past.
Penny,"Doc, youêve got to see what youêre doing is, is a little creepy."
Penny,"Okay, you canêt just go chasing after every girl whoês nice to you."
Penny,"Hey, Leonard. Guess whoês back. Dr. Lorvis. Yeah. You care to join us? You locked them in your basement?"
Penny,"Okay, so how do they unstick it?"
Penny,"Okay. Nope. Thatês it. We are gonna go over there right now, and you are going to let them out."
Penny,Move it.
Bernadette,"Oh, good, youêre here. Amy, I am so sorry."
Amy,That has to wait. This weirdo locked the guys up in his basement.
Penny,Just walk.
Sheldon,You can do this.
Raj,One ladder left.
Leonard,Oh-hom yeah.
Leonard,Next level.
Penny,"Leonard, are you okay?"
Leonard,Better than okay. I am having the game of my life.
Amy,"Dr. Lorvis, isnêt there something you want to say?"
Howard,"Yeah, that was very uncool. Get the hammer. Get the hammer."
Leonard,Got it.
Penny,"Okay, Leonard, letês go."
Leonard,Just hang on.
Leonard,"Oh, hey, oh, we ran into your mom at Benihana last night."
Howard,"Oh, yeah, she loves that place. Every time they flip a shrimp in the air, she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it. Thatês why I donêt take her to SeaWorld."
Leonard,"I know you-you donêt want to hear it, but she was there with Stuart."
Howard,Thatês fine. I donêt care.
Raj,It doesnêt bug you when they go out on dates?
Howard,Theyêre not dating. Theyêre just two friends who went out to dinner.
Raj,And then went back to the home they share where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas she got them because they both just love penguins.
Howard,"Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas who arenêt dating."
Raj,Like who?
Howard,Like you and your dog.
Leonard,Donêt rule out the dating.
Howard,"Fine, it bothers me. You happy?"
Sheldon,You think youêve got problems. The gibbon is the only member of the ape family not classified as a great ape.
Howard,How is this helpful?
Sheldon,All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one. That means taxonomists created the entire category of lesser ape just to single out the poor gibbon as the weird kid on the playground. Now thereês a hairy little fellow with a genuine beef.
Leonard,But the gibbon doesnêt know what itês categorized as. It doesnêt even know itês called a gibbon.
Sheldon,"True. Sorry, kid, youêve got it worse than a gibbon."
Bernadette,We brought snacks for movie night.
Penny,"Oh, great. I donêt suppose you also brought napkins, clean bowls, utensils and a roll of toilet paper."
Bernadette,Right here.
Penny,"Ah, You guys are the best."
Amy,Whatês with the clothes?
Penny,"Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work, I needed to make room in my closet."
Amy,"I meant why are they folded? But whatever. Ooh, whatês this?"
Penny,"That, believe it or not, is my prom dress."
Bernadette,"Wow, you still have it? I just assumed it was balled up in the corner of a barn somewhere."
Penny,What kind of teenager did you think I was?
Penny,The word is popular.
Bernadette,How was your prom? Did you go?
Amy,"No, but I was on clean-up crew."
Penny,"Aw, thatês sad."
Amy,"No, it was okay. The DJ let me dance one slow song with my mop before he shut down. Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water, I still hear Lady in Red."
Bernadette,"My prom was pretty terrible, too. I was so excited about my date, but it turned out he only asked me êcause he liked my friend. He spent the whole night talking about her."
Amy,"Okay, we get it, you had a friend and a date. Stop bragging."
Penny,Doesnêt matter. Prom is silly anyways.
Bernadette,Easy for you to say; you probably went with the captain of the football team.
Penny,I just made out with him a little while his date was puking.
Amy,My date wouldêve had to clean that up.
Bernadette,"Ooh, I have an idea. Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over."
Amy,"Oh, that would be so much fun. We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos."
Bernadette,"Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance."
Penny,"Okay, guys, trust me, as someone whoês been to, like, seven proms, it is never as good as you want it to be."
Amy,You went to seven proms?
Penny,"Yeah, letês see. Uh, four Under the Seas, two Enchanted Evenings, and one Night to Remember that I cannot remember for the life of me."
Leonard,"Hey, whereês Bernadette?"
Howard,She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.
Raj,"Oh, yeah, I got that Evite. Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink, Iêve wanted to go to an American prom. But then I saw Carrie, and I did not want to go to an American prom. But then I saw Never Been Kissed, and Iêm back on the prom bandwagon. This prom thingês been a real roller coaster."
Howard,"Bernieês really excited. I could tell because her voice got so high, the beagle next door started howling."
Raj,Did you go to your prom?
Sheldon,"I had a date with a proper education. Instead of a tuxedo, I dressed myself in good habits. Instead of spiked punch, I enjoyed the intoxicating flavour of knowledge. Instead of dancing in a gym, I shook my bootyto the seductive rhythmsÑ"
Penny,"Okay, okay."
Raj,How come youêre not shopping with Amy and Bernadette?
Leonard,"Let me guess, you think the whole idea is lame?"
Penny,"Well, who cares what I think? What do you think?"
Leonard,"Hmm, to be honest, itês kind of a dream come true to go to even a fake prom with a woman as beautiful as you."
Penny,"Ugh, thanks a lot."
Penny,"Well, now I canêt blow this thing off without being a bitch."
Raj,That sounds like a yes.
Bernadette,"Ooh, every single person RSVPêd yes. This is so exciting. Isnêt this exciting?"
Bernadette,"Look, even Stuartês bringing a date. I wonder who it is."
Howard,You know exactly who it is. Heês gonna bring my mom. Why did you even invite him?
Bernadette,"Because heês our friend, and you two need to get along. And why canêt he take your mom? You took her to your prom."
Howard,"I didnêt take her, she was a chaperone."
Bernadette,I saw a picture of you two dancing together.
Howard,What was I gonna do? They were playing our song. I canêt take this anymore.
Howard,"Stuart, we have to talk. This thing with you and my mom, I hate it. Itês making me crazy. You and I were friends for years, and now youêre bringing my mother to a party Iêm going to? What the hell?"
Howard,"Oh, so now youêre cheating on my mother?"
Sheldon, Penny?
Penny,You knocked more than usual.
Sheldon,"Next time I might be in a rush, itês good to have a few in the bank."
Penny,"Okay, whatês up?"
Sheldon,"Iêd like to discuss this party that Amy and Bernadette are throwing. Since you and I are both reluctant to go, I think Iêve come up with a perfect way for us to enjoy it."
Penny,"Great, how?"
Sheldon,"We pretend weêre aliens. Iêm not the best at reading facial cues, but Iêm gonna say that you love it and want to hear more. Now, in the beloved novel Hitchhikerês Guide to the Galaxy, an alien named Ford Prefect pretended to be human in order to blend in so that he could write an entry about Earth for The Hitchhikerês Guide to the Galaxy, which is a travel book within the actual book, which is also called The Hitchhikerês Guide to the Galaxy."
Penny,"Okay, just one question. What?"
Sheldon,"My point is, pretending to be an alien is a valuable coping mechanism Iêve used many times. I did it the first time I went to see you in a play. You had no idea Commander Umfrumf of Ceti Alpha Three was in the audience. Oh, donêt worry, he gave you seven thumbs up."
Penny,"Hereês a question, as an alien pretending to be human, are you planning to engage in any post-prom mating rituals with Amy?"
Sheldon,There are post-prom mating rituals?
Penny,"Not always. Unless your date drives a van with an air mattress, then always."
Sheldon,"Well, if itês part of the prom experience, then Iêm open to it."
Penny,Youêre kidding.
Sheldon,"I may be an alien, but I have urges. If Amy wants to copulate by firing her eggs into space, well, then, I will happily catch them with the reproductive sac on my upper flermin. Iêm not the best at reading facial cues, but I can see that youêre a little turned on."
Leonard,"You know, if youêre not gonna learn how to do this, they make some pretty good clip-ons."
Sheldon,Bruce Wayne doesnêt wear a clip-on.
Leonard,Bruce Wayne doesnêt make his roommate tie it for him.
Sheldon,"His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does."
Leonard,"There, perfect."
Sheldon,"are you sure? Itês my first prom, I want to do it correctly."
Leonard,I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.
Sheldon,"I was, but Penny didnêt want to. You didnêt want to. Bernadette, Amy, Koothrappali and Wolowitz didnêt want to. And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody."
Leonard,Was that a flask?
Sheldon,"Yes. Iêve decided to embrace all of the traditions associated with prom, including spiking the punch."
Leonard,Youêre gonna put alcohol in the punch?
Sheldon,"Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice. Itês all the fun of high school high jinks with the cell-protecting zip of antioxidants."
Leonard,"If you had ripped jeans and a leather jacket, youêd be like the toughest kid on the Disney Channel. So, anything else planned for tonight?"
Sheldon,"Oh, everything. Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing, being elected prom king. Pointing out that kings arenêt elected. Itês gonna be off the hook."
Leonard,"And while youêre at it, I know that at this age your hormones are raging, but just because all your friends are having sex doesnêt mean you have to."
Sheldon,Why would you say that?
Leonard,"You know, êcause, êcause a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night."
Sheldon,Penny implied the same thing. Is this true?
Leonard,"Just relax, itês a joke. You donêt have hormones."
Leonard,"Wow, you look amazing."
Penny,"Thank you, so do you."
Amy,"Sheldon, you look so handsome."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Penny,"Sheldon, doesnêt Amy look hot? Thatês got to put some starch in the upper flermin."
Amy,Whatês that?
Leonard,"Oh, itês a scaly genital organ that grows between his shoulder blades. Try not to touch it when youêre dancing."
Sheldon,Excuse me.
Amy,Where are you going?
Sheldon,"I canêt do this. And for your information, Leonard, the upper flermin doesnêt grow between my shoulder blades, it grows out of the belly button on my neck."
Leonard,"Heês right, I was thinking of the lower flermin."
Raj,"Ooh, Iêll, uh, text Stuart, let him know weêre close."
Bernadette,Thatês a neat tattoo.
Bernadette,"Aw, that movieês so cute."
Howard,Do you like her because you both have red hair?
Bernadette,I like Cinderella.
Bernadette,I like Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo.
Raj,"Hey, here comes Stuart and his date."
Howard,"Oh, my God."
Howard,Thatês Jeanie.
Bernadette,Thatês Jeanie?
Howard,Donêt say it.
Raj,Thatês Howardês cousin that he had sex with.
Howard,"She is my second cousin. We were 15, I just said, donêt say it."
Raj,"It was our first date, there was an awkward silence. What was I supposed to say?"
Penny,"Oh, itês beautiful."
Leonard,"Oh, the girls really did a nice job."
Penny,"Aw, I know I wasnêt into this before, but Iêm so glad I get to take you to your first prom."
Leonard,What makes you think I didnêt go to my prom? I went.
Penny,"Well, whoêd you go with?"
Leonard,I took a little lady I like to call loneliness.
Leonard,"Oh, itês all right. We ended up having a threesome with her friend humiliation, soÑ"
Penny,"Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone, I wouldêve asked you to dance."
Leonard,"No, you wouldnêt have."
Penny,"Well, you donêt know that."
Leonard,It was before my growth spurt.
Penny,that already happened?
Leonard,Very funny.
Penny,"Well, you wouldnêt have asked me either."
Leonard,I would have asked you. In my head. On the way home. While I was having a good cry.
Amy,"Sheldon, can I come in?"
Sheldon,I donêt think thatês a good idea.
Amy,Why not?
Sheldon,"According to an online message board, I may be having a panic attack. SoccerMom09 had similar symptoms. But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day."
Amy,Youêre making me worry. Whatês going on?
Sheldon,Whatês going on is weêre about to go to a prom. And thereês a great deal of pressure on young couples like us to engage in what Mr. Bob Eubanks called making whoopee.
Amy,What pressure? All I said was you look handsome. Can you please open the door?
Sheldon,Itês not just that. Leonard and Penny also made comments about it. And Iêm not blind. Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior in these tuxedo pants.
Raj,Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?
Howard,"So, my motherês okay with this?"
Howard,"‚Cause they have a weird, inappropriate relationship."
Raj,This is so messed up.
Howard,Why would you even come to this? Didnêt you know Iêd be here?
Bernadette,"So, you knew and you brought her anyway?"
Bernadette,"Yeah, go have weird relationships with your own mother and cousin. This is his turf."
Penny,"Well, I might not have asked you to dance then, but I will ask you now."
Leonard,Thereês no music.
Penny,I donêt care. Weêll make our own music.
Leonard,"My God, whoês the dork now? Thank you for wearing your flats."
Penny,Thank you for wearing your heels.
Leonard,Look at me. Dancing with the prettiest girl at the prom.
Penny,Want to take a picture of us and send it to your old friends in the chess club?
Leonard,I sent them a bikini shot of you years ago. This is nice. I kind of wish no one else was coming.
Penny,"I know, me, too. But it will be fun to have a prom without all the drama."
Bernadette,"Howie, get off of him."
Howard,Not until he stops humping his way up my family tree.
Amy,"Sheldon, this is silly. Iêm not missing another prom. Iêm going upstairs now. Good-bye."
Sheldon,I really did think you looked pretty.
Amy,You did?
Sheldon,Yes. So much so that I started to panic.
Amy,"Well, you can relax. Just because you think I look pretty doesnêt mean we have to spend the night together."
Sheldon,Were you hoping we would because itês prom?
Amy,Iêm always hoping. But tonight I just wanted to have a nice time with you. And maybe dance with someone who has arms.
Sheldon,Thank you for understanding.
Amy,"Of course I understand. Sheldon, thereês something else Iêve been wanting to say, but before I do, I just, I want you to know that you donêt have to say it back. I know youêre not ready, and I donêt want you to say it just because social convention dictatesÑ"
Sheldon,"I love you, too."
Amy,You said it.
Sheldon,Thereês no denying I have feelings for you that canêt be explained in any other way. I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite. But that seems even more farfetched. The only conclusion was love. I know whatês happening. This is a panic attack. SoccerMom09 says to lie down with your feet elevated.
Sheldon,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Just because I love you doesnêt mean girls are allowed in my room."
Raj,"Okay. Here we go, say cheese. Iskip) Say cheese. Iskip) Say cousin. Iskip) SayÑ"
Amy,This is an easy one. You love this guy.
Amy,"Come on, heês an under-appreciated genius."
Sheldon,Still think itês me.
Amy,"Itês not you. Now think, thereês a car named after him."
Sheldon,"Of course there is. The Mini Cooper, êcause itês me."
Amy,"How about this, heês a poor manês Sheldon Cooper."
Sheldon,"Oh, Tesla."
Sheldon,"Hey, how did it go?"
Leonard,"Oh, not fun. The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses."
Penny,"Yeah, I watched. It was like the scary boat tunnel in Willy Wonka."
Amy,Did they figure out whatês wrong?
Leonard,Yeah. Itês a deviated septum. The surgery to correct it is simple. Heês gonna do it next week.
Sheldon,Why would you have surgery?
Leonard,"Because I canêt breathe. I snore, I get sinus infections."
Penny,"Yeah, back off, heês all mine."
Sheldon,But you donêt have a life-threatening condition. Why would you take the risk of surgery?
Amy,"Sheldon, itês a routine procedure, Iêve heard you complain about his snoring."
Sheldon,"Yes, for the first five or six years, but Iêve gotten used to it. It helps me sleep. Heês like my mucus-powered white noise machine."
Leonard,"Sheldon, Iêm gonna get the surgery, itês no big deal. End of story."
Sheldon,Very well. Iêm done talking about it.
Leonard,Thank you.
Sheldon,I believe it was your turn in the game.
Sheldon,"Letês see. Oh, this person is most famous for never having gotten his nose mutilated with elective surgery and never living the rest of his life in the shadows as a hideous, disfigured freak."
Leonard,I think you could give a better clue.
Sheldon,I donêt. Iêm not even sure if thatês a person or a typo.
Leonard,"Okay, why?"
Sheldon,Iêm listening to you snore. Iêm wondering how Iêll ever sleep without it.
Leonard,"If it helps you sleep, then why are you sitting here staring at me like the albino boogeyman?"
Sheldon,"Really Leonard. Insults? After I spent two hours in your closet, waiting for you to fall asleep?"
Leonard,Whatês your problem?
Sheldon,"If the surgery is successful, the snoring is gone. And if you die during surgery, the snoring is gone."
Leonard,"It sounds like either way, I finally get some rest."
Sheldon,"I have to be honest with you Leonard, Iêm truly worried."
Leonard,"I told you, thereês nothing to worry about."
Sheldon,"Well, Iêve been doing some research and Iêve learned that one in 700,000 people die from general anaesthesia."
Leonard,"Buddy, wh, do you realize that that also means 699,999 people donêt die?"
Sheldon,I suppose thatês true. Youêre such a glass half-full kind of guy. Iêm going to miss that.
Raj,"Oh, so, my, uh, parentsê 40th anniversaryês coming up and I canêt think of a thing to get them."
Howard,"Damn, can you imagine being married to someone for 40 years?"
Bernadette,Not anymore.
Raj,"Anyway, any ideas on a gift?"
Bernadette,"Well, what are some of the things they like?"
Raj,"They used to like going to the Mumbai Symphony, but last year my mom thought they were phoning it in. Then my dad said based on their love life, she should know about phoning it in."
Bernadette,He said that to her?
Raj,"Well, they werenêt speaking at the time, so he had a servant say it to her. Oh, maybe I could make a gift for them. I know how much you guys love the coasters I made for you."
Bernadette,Theyêre yours in the divorce.
Leonard,Hey. Whatêre you working on?
Sheldon,"Remember when I said if you went through with your surgery, there was a one-in-700,000 chance of dying?"
Sheldon,"Well, Iêve been crunching the numbers, and so far, Iêve gotten your probability of death all the way to a sphincter-tightening one in 300."
Leonard,Great timing. My check sphincter light just went on.
Sheldon,"Leonard, what if you have an allergic reaction to the surgeonês latex gloves?"
Leonard,Iêm not allergic to latex.
Sheldon,"Well, then why donêt you wear the rubber gloves I bought for you to do the dishes?"
Leonard,For the same reason I donêt wear the apron or the hair net.
Sheldon,Fine. What about epilepsy?
Leonard,"I donêt have epilepsy, either."
Sheldon,"You donêt, but the surgeon might, hmm? And your carotid artery is just one shaky scalpel away from becoming the dancing fountain at Disneyland."
Leonard,"Sheldon, do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery?"
Sheldon,"I do. I have the drive to the hospital right here. That is if you make it to the car without falling down the stairs. And donêt expect me to carry you, I do that enough in life."
Leonard,"Buddy, I, I get that youêre worried about me and I, I appreciate that, but Iêm not going to die."
Sheldon,You donêt know that.
Leonard,"Well, I do know that it wonêt be from an asteroid strike."
Sheldon,You know who else said that? Every cocky T. Rex currently swimming around in the gas tank of your car.
Leonard,"If there was an asteroid strike, wouldnêt you die, too?"
Sheldon,"I donêt know, Iêm smart and scrappy, I think Iêd find a way."
Leonard,"Tell you what, the surgeryês not for a week, Iêll think about it."
Sheldon,"Thank you. And while youêre thinking about it, if you have the surgery in Nicaragua during monsoon season, I can practically guarantee your death."
Raj,"Yes. Okay. I, I understand. Of course, yes. Iêll call you tomorrow. Bye."
Howard,"So I found this fencing school in Burbank that has a Jedi class. And if youêre cool being the only adults there, they said they are."
Raj,"Dude, my parents just split up."
Raj,"Uh, that was my dad on the phone. He moved out."
Howard,"Oh, my God, I, Iêm sorry. I mean, if youêre not up to it, we donêt have to go out, we can just hang here."
Raj,"No, itês fine. Itês not that big a deal. As long as theyêre happy, Iêm happy. And when I get to see them for the holidays, Iêll get to celebrate Diwali twice, one at each house. Thatês double the Diwali."
Howard,You sure youêre okay?
Raj,Iêm okay.
Howard,You donêt look okay.
Raj,How can I be okay? I come from a broken home.
Leonard,The doctor said I should be out of surgery by ten.
Penny,Okay. And Sheldon really believes weêre at a public swimming pool?
Leonard,"He was so busy figuring out how many parts per million of urine weêd be floating around in, he didnêt even question it."
Sheldon,18 parts per million. And heês still doing it.
Amy,Donêt worry about that. Iêm happy to take you to work.
Sheldon,"Well, thank you. And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car. I canêt have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl."
Amy,Itês nice theyêre getting exercise.
Sheldon,"Although now that I think about it, Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt."
Amy,Iêm sure he brought it.
Sheldon,"No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it."
Amy,"He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look, thereês an entire section of my dashboard that doesnêt have any syrup on it."
Sheldon,Youêre acting odd. Why?
Amy,"Iêm odd all the time, everyone knows that. Just last night I tried to see how many fava beans I could fit in my mouth."
Sheldon,Tell me the truth.
Amy,Twenty eight.
Sheldon,Come on.
Amy,Fifty six.
Sheldon,Amy. Whatês going on?
Amy,"All right. Donêt get upset, but, an earlier appointment opened up for Leonard and heês getting the surgery right now."
Sheldon,I see. Take me to Leonard.
Amy,"Just go to work, heêll be fine."
Sheldon,"Amy, heês my best friend, and if you donêt take me, Iêm going there anyway."
Amy,Fine. Itês sweet that you care about him so much.
Sheldon,I do. And I wouldnêt be able to forgive myself if something happened to him and I wasnêt at his bedside to say I told you so.
Penny,We had a really nice swim.
Sheldon,"Oh, stop it. I assume this medical centreês already treated the burns on your bottom from the recent pants fire."
Penny,"‚Cause Iêm a liar, liar?"
Sheldon,Thatês for the fire marshal to determine.
Penny,You had to tell him?
Amy,"He wore me down. And I was distracted, he has on extra baby powder today."
Sheldon,Is he okay?
Penny,Heês still in surgery.
Sheldon,Very well.
Penny,Heês gonna be all right. That is sticky.
Amy,"Come on, letês talk about something other than the surgery."
Sheldon,"Thatês a good idea. Penny, did you and Leonard ever discuss funeral arrangements?"
Penny,I think she meant something a little happier.
Sheldon,"I suppose we could try to make it a celebration, but he died so young."
Howard,"Knock, knock."
Raj,Hey. What brings you by?
Bernadette,"Oh, muffin much."
Howard,"Told you, not funny."
Bernadette,Heês just not laughing because heês feeling blueberry. Tough crowd.
Raj,Iêm sorry. This is very sweet. Thanks.
Howard,"So, how you doing?"
Raj,Better. I guess the news just hit me a lot harder than I expected.
Bernadette,"Well, of course. I would be devastated if my parents split up."
Howard,Why? Your father barely speaks to your mother.
Bernadette,"Well, at least he stuck around, not like your dad, who just took off."
Howard,"As you can see, weêre here to cheer you up."
Bernadette,"Sorry, Raj. Do you have any sense of what happened with your folks?"
Raj,"I think, over time, they started to resent each other, and instead of talking about the things that bothered them, they kept it bottled up, and the hate just grew."
Bernadette,"Itês a shame they spent all that time unhappy. But sometimes, thereês muffin you can do about it. You get it, right?"
Penny,"Oh, itês nice you got him that."
Sheldon,"Oh, this isnêt for Leonard, no. Amy bought it for me."
Amy,Stubbed his toe on the revolving door on the way in.
Sheldon,You know those confounded things make me dizzy.
Amy,Who told you to keep going around?
Sheldon,There was a large plant in the lobby. It kept looking like the outside.
Penny,"Okay, listen, when Leonard comes out, he is not gonna feel great, so, please donêt give him a hard time."
Amy,"Penny has a good point. This is like the man in the supermarket with the goiter on his neck. Whatever youêre thinking, just keep it to yourself."
Sheldon,It was like a grapefruit.
Amy,And Iêm sure he knew that before you held a grapefruit up next to it.
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm not making any promises. Not only did Leonard take what I feel is an unnecessary risk, he deceived me."
Penny,"Okay, the reason he deceived you is you were being a pain in the ass."
Sheldon,"The reason I was being a pain in the B is because I was worried about him, and no one else was."
Penny,Really? You wonêt even say A?
Sheldon,You bet your sweet B I wonêt.
Penny,"Obviously, I care about Leonard. Iêm gonna spend the rest of my life with him."
Sheldon,And Iêm not? Itês an earthquake. I knew it.
Penny,"Sheldon, it was just a little tremor."
Sheldon,"A little tremor that turns routine sinus surgery into a frontal lobotomy. Oh, I donêt care for this at all. Oh, I need to see heês okay."
Amy,"Sheldon, you canêt go back there."
Sheldon,Try and stop me.
Amy,Are you okay?
Sheldon,Why didnêt you stop me?
Bernadette,Can I tell you something? This whole thing with Rajês parents just got me a little worried about us.
Howard,What are you talking about? Weêre fine. And Rajês parents probably split up because of Raj.
Howard,"They always say the children arenêt to blame, but, come on."
Bernadette,"Iêm not joking, Howie. You heard what he said about his parents. It was the little things they kept bottled up. I donêt want that to happen to us."
Howard,How can I convince you it wonêt?
Bernadette,"Well, is there anything about me youêre keeping inside?"
Howard,Iêm not answering that. Itês a trap.
Bernadette,So there are things you donêt like.
Howard,And here I am in the trap. You just keep talking. Iêm gonna chew my leg off.
Bernadette,"Just tell me one thing that bothers you, and I promise I wonêt get mad."
Howard,"Okay. The truth is, sometimes, youêre too beautiful."
Bernadette,"Oh. Howie, be serious."
Howard,"Okay, okay. I really donêt like how your wings poke me when we sleep êcause youêre an angel."
Bernadette,"Okay, fine, maybe it was a bad idea."
Howard,"I just donêt think the secret to a happy marriage is going out of our way to criticize each other. Although, there are ways to improve our communication. One thing I learned when I was in couples therapy wasÑ"
Bernadette,Who were you in couples therapy with?
Howard,Not important.
Bernadette,Was it your mom?
Howard,Not important.
Bernadette,It was your mom.
Howard,"Anyway, the therapist had us tell each other what we loved about one another."
Bernadette,"Oh, thatês so sweet. I want to do that."
Howard,All right.
Bernadette,"Okay, um, I love that you make me laugh."
Howard,Thank you. And I love that youêre strong and independent.
Bernadette,"And yet, I still love when you hold a door for me."
Howard,"I love that Iêm kind of a slob around here, and youêre okay with that."
Bernadette,"Uh-huh. And I love that I work and do all the cleaning, and youêre okay with that."
Howard,"See, I am. Isnêt this great?"
Penny,"Come on, smile. This is gonna be my Christmas card."
Sheldon,You know this is all your fault.
Leonard,How is it my fault?
Sheldon,I told you not to get the surgery.
Leonard,"Okay, first of all, the surgery was a success, and secondly, I didnêt even want you there."
Sheldon,"Wow. I donêt know which hurts worse, my nose or my heart. Well, Iêm done speaking to you."
Amy,Donêt be like that. You two need to talk this out.
Penny,"Yeah, êcause you sound really funny."
Leonard,"Sheldon, Iêm sorry I didnêt tell you about the surgery, but you were worried about nothing."
Sheldon,"Oh, youêre hardly out of the woods, no. You still run the risk of infection, a blood clot, the possibility that an inattentive surgeon let a barn spider lay eggs in your nose. The minute you sneeze web, Iêm moving out."
Leonard,"I never thought Iêd say these words, but come on, nose spider."
Penny,"Who are you kidding? You were so panicked Leonard was gonna die, youêll never leave him."
Amy,Sheldon will move out eventually.
Penny,"Yeah, once he figures out how to work a door."
Sheldon,"I was not panicked, and I am not overly attached to Leonard."
Leonard,You were so worried that you smashed your face trying to check on me. You love me.
Sheldon,"Yeah. Tell me those arenêt the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain. Amy, youêre a neuroscientist. Crack his skull open, spray some Raid in there."
Bernadette,"I love that you take pride in your looks, even when I have to pee in the morning, and youêre in there spending an hour on your hair."
Howard,I love that youêre too good to pee in the kitchen sink.
Bernadette,"I love that you have the confidence to speak, even without giving it an ounce of thought."
Howard,And I love how your hair is always on the soap. Itês like washing myself with a hamster.
Raj,"Hey, guys. Sorry I am so late. I was on the phone with my mother."
Bernadette,"Oh, how is she?"
Raj,"Pretty good. She bought the book Eat, Pray, Love and used it to set my fatherês Mercedes on fire. So, whatês up with you guys?"
Howard,Weêre just saying all the things we love about each other.
Raj,"Oh, like you and I did at couples therapy."
Leonard,"Oh, whatêd you get?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I ordered it before your surgery. Itês the urn I was going to put you in."
Penny,"Okay, thatês morbid. Send it back."
Sheldon,"I canêt send it back, I had it engraved. Here lie the ashes of Leonard Hofstadter. He thought he was right, but his room mate knew better.î"
Leonard,"Thatês funny. Boy, Iêm gonna miss these painkillers."
Penny,"Hey, why did you get two? Iêm with stupid."
Sheldon,"Oh, that oneês mine."
Sheldon,"Hello. Iêm Doctor Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper presents Fun with Flags, the final episode flagtacular. I knew it was coming. Still scary. Now, Iêm sure youêre thinking, the final episode? Who will stand between us and flag ignorance?"
Amy,I know I was thinking that. Is this a show on flags or mind reading?
Sheldon,"But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career, a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend."
Amy,"And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board."
Sheldon,"So as they say, all good things must come to an end."
Amy,After only 232 episodes.
Sheldon,233 if we include the one somebody forgot to press record on.
Amy,You said you werenêt gonna bring that up.
Sheldon,"And you said you pressed record. Anyway, please sit back, relax, and join us as we take our final lap, as indicated by the waving of this racing flag. And, of course, white flags can also represent surrender, the Stewards of Gondor, and the Japanese Minamoto clan, but Iêm sure you remember that from episode sixty-two, White Flags, Whoês Wavinê ‚Em and Why?"
Amy,That was a good one.
Sheldon,It was so good.
Raj,"You know, I thought cleaning out a dead professorês office was gonna just be boring, but then I found his dentures and realized itês also gross."
Howard,Doesnêt Professor Abbottês family want any of this stuff?
Leonard,I donêt think he had a family.
Raj,Thatês rough.
Leonard,"I know. You can spend your whole life working, and at the end all thatês left are some papers in a box."
Howard,"Makes you think. Oh, well."
Leonard,"Hey. Hey, weêre supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case itês important."
Howard,I did. Itês all outdated or disproved.
Raj,"I donêt know. This old pen kind of proves gravity. When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off."
Howard,"Oh, my dad used to have a pen like that. I dated it all through sixth grade."
Leonard,It still feels weird just throwing away his work like this.
Howard,"Donêt feel bad. Someday someone will be throwing out your work, too."
Leonard,"That someone was Sheldon, and the day was yesterday. Hey, look at this. Dear Roger, to be opened upon your first great discovery. Love, Mom. Wow, look at the date. He saved this fifty years and never got to open it."
Howard,Thatês intense.
Raj,Poor Roger Abbott.
Howard,Roger Abbott sounds just like Roger Rabbit.
Raj,"Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott. Oh, my God, Leonard, I know heês dead, but try it. Itês fun. Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott."
Penny,"Oh, Dan. My boss who didnêt want to hire me and nowês a little hug machine."
Penny,Iêll be right there. Bernadetteês just parking the car.
Penny,Come on. Sheês not that bad.
Penny,"I know she can be a little intense, but, I swear, she is so sweet once you get past all theÑ"
Bernadette,"Hey, what are you talking about?"
Penny,Oh. We were just talking about how much we love working with you. Isnêt that right? Dan?
Sheldon,"Over the years here at Fun With Flags, weêve had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder."
Amy,"And, yes, even shed a tear or two."
Sheldon,Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July spectacular and it doesnêt get recorded.
Amy,How many times do I have to say Iêm sorry?
Sheldon,How about four thousand. One for every domino I set up to make that American flag. Please enjoy these highlights.
Sheldon,"Crikey, what flag do we have today?"
Amy,"Australia, mate."
Sheldon,And now itês time for the speed round of Flag or Not a Flag.
Amy,"Say, Betsy Ross, what you working on?"
Sheldon,I have no idea. Because the story of me sewing the first American flag is unsupported poppycock.
Amy,"Then who did sew it, hmm?"
Sheldon,Donêt ask me. Iêm just a simple seamstress whose descendants are out to make a quick buck.
Sheldon,"Fancy a dip, my dear?"
Amy,I do.
Sheldon,"Wait, that purple flag indicates that marine pests, such as jellyfish, are present."
Amy,"Wow, that flag is a lifesaver."
Sheldon,This is. Stop looking at my legs.
Raj,"When stuff like this gets me down, you know what I like to do?"
Howard,Sing Hakuna Matata like an eight-year-old girl?
Raj,"Wrong, smarty-pants. Itês Everything Is Awesome from The Lego Movie."
Leonard,Look at these notebooks. Theyêre full of pages and pages of data. He clearly spent years on this.
Howard,Mmm. Itês just columns of random numbers. Toss it.
Leonard,"Well, but what if this was a potential breakthrough for him? What if, what if this is the thing that wouldêve finally let him open that bottle of champagne?"
Raj,"Maybe he didnêt know what to pair champagne with. Strawberries, caviar, oysters. All good choices. Yeah, that look right there is why people eat before they come to your parties."
Leonard,This has to mean something.
Howard,"Well, thereês no discernible pattern that I can see, but it shouldnêt be too hard to run the numbers and check."
Leonard,"Well, maybe we can get some time on the supercomputer."
Howard,Sure. We could try multiple regressions with varying physical and experimental constants.
Leonard,"Oh, we could run a pattern-matching algorithm against well-known unsolved physics problems."
Howard,"Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher. We could start with basic cryptanalysis."
Raj,Or we could talk to this guy he used to share an office with.
Howard,"Oh, letês do that."
Leonard,"Because you donêt know how to do cryptanalysis, do you?"
Howard,"Yeah, Iêm not even sure if itês the right word."
Penny,"So, Dan, you have a grandson. How old is he?"
Bernadette,"Oh, yeah. I remember him from the picnic. He was the one crying like a wuss the whole time."
Penny,I heard he was being picked on by a mean kid.
Bernadette,"Just builds character. Like my dad said, nobody likes a crybaby except their mommies and Democrats.î"
Bernadette,Whatês his problem?
Penny,"Oh, I donêt know. Maybe he didnêt like the fact that you called his grandson a wuss."
Bernadette,"Well, I didnêt think you were supposed to say sissy anymore."
Penny,"Okay, look, I know what a good person you are, but sometimes people think you might come off a little harsh."
Bernadette,"Iêm, like, the sweetest person I know. Look at me. I should be in a tree baking cookies."
Penny,"Yes, but once in a while, people think youêre a little mean."
Bernadette,"Oh, yeah? You one of those people?"
Penny,"No, no, no. I think the cookie thing."
Sheldon,"Welcome back. Our guest today is a returning fan favourite. He puts the reading in your rainbow, the Geordi in your La Forge, and the Kunta in your Kinte, Mr. LeVar Burton."
Sheldon,"You do this, I delete your contact information."
Sheldon,While you watch me do it.
Sheldon,"Well, since youêre here, Iêd like to get your opinion on something. In honour of Black History Month, I portrayed George Washington Carver in a loving tribute that my roommate called wildly racist. What do you think?  Hi. My name is George."
Sheldon,"You heard him, Leonard. No, itês not racist."
Howard,Are we sure this is the place?
Raj,The doorman said this is the right building.
Leonard,"I think if youêre pulling up your pants, youêre not a doorman. "
Leonard,"Uh, Iêve been looking for a Professor Sharpe?"
Leonard,Hi. Weêre from the university. Weêre trying to get some information about Professor Abbott.
Howard,We were cleaning out his office and found these books full of numbers.
Leonard,Any chance you know what it is?
Raj,"I was thinking it might be some sort of interstellar coordinate system, maybe an updated version of Hubbleês law. I keep seeing the number 90 repeating. That could be the angle of perturbation of a distant galaxy."
Raj,Does it work?
Raj,"Well, he could have been hit by a bus. You donêt know."
Leonard,"So, was there anything that Professor Abbott worked on during his life that came close to an accomplishment?"
Raj,"You were his colleague. How did your research turn out? Great. Hey, this is the apartment you get when you win a Nobel."
Raj,"Well, you could be very frugal. Iêm getting a little tired of everybodyês sarcasm."
Bernadette,"Iêm not a bully. I mean, maybe I come off a little strong, but thatês only because my dad raised me to be tough and not to take crap from anybody."
Penny,"Thatês fine, but thereês a difference between being tough and telling your friend her new pants look like a saggy diaper."
Bernadette,"I did say that, didnêt I?"
Penny,"Yeah, you did. I felt so self-conscious, I had to return them."
Bernadette,Where? To Babies R Us?
Penny,Youêre doing it again.
Bernadette,"Okay, sorry. Can we just go? I feel like everybody hates me."
Penny,"Oh, come on, they donêt hate you, all right? Theyêre just a little intimidated. All you need to do is show everyone how sweet you really are."
Bernadette,I think Iêd rather go.
Penny,"No, come on. You are not going anywhere, all right? I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together."
Bernadette,Thank you.
Penny,Even though your dress is ugly.
Sheldon,"Well, my little flag-keteers, it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end. If I could, I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you. And if you touched the ground, burn you. Iêd like to take a moment to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related Internet info-tainment show."
Amy,"Take that, glass ceiling."
Sheldon,"And if I may get serious for a moment, hosting this show has been one crazy ride. But with all its ups and downs, I wouldnêt give it up for the world. Except for now, when Iêm giving it up. Before I sign off, Iêd, uh, Iêd like to share with you all one last use for a white flag. Itês good for times like this. Good night."
Amy,"Cut. Sheldon, that was beautiful."
Sheldon,If you didnêt press recordÑ
Amy,I pressed it.
Leonard,"Well, thatês it. Thatês the end of Roger Abbott."
Raj,And we still donêt know who framed him.
Leonard,I still keep thinking about how an entire life can seemingly amount to nothing.
Howard,"I guess the sad truth is, not everyone will accomplish something great. Some of us may just have to find meaning in the little moments that make up life."
Leonard,Thatês a nice way of looking at it.
Howard,"Yeah for you, not for me. I went to space. Iêm covered."
Leonard,"You know what? This bottle was meant to celebrate an achievement. Letês make a pact. When one of us gets their first big breakthrough, weêll celebrate by opening this bottle of champagne and toasting Professor Abbott."
Howard,I love that.
Raj,"Yeah, me, too."
Leonard,"Then, of course, rubbing our success in Sheldonês face."
Raj,"Oh, well, thatês the best part."
Howard,"Oh, yeah."
Bernadette,"Dan, could I talk to you for a minute?"
Bernadette,Just want you to know I didnêt mean to be rude about your grandson.
Bernadette,"No, itês not. Penny told me that everyoneês scared of me."
Bernadette,"No, sheês right, and I just want you to know that from now on, Iêm gonna be much more sensitive. I donêt want anyone walking on eggshells around me."
Bernadette,No problem. When does that start?
Bernadette,Whoês been paying for my coffee?
Penny,Yeah. It comes from the swear jar we put money in when you curse.
Bernadette,What else donêt I know about?
Penny,"Uh, well, you know your private bathroom?"
Penny,That was supposed to be for the whole floor.
Bernadette,Youêre kidding.
Bernadette,I feel so bad.
Penny,"Well, then, maybe you shouldnêt have named her Wheelchair Kathy."
Bernadette,"Oh, my God. I thought everybody liked me, but Iêm just a monster."
Bernadette,"No, Iêm the worst. Iêm a terrible person."
Bernadette,Itês not okay. How can I even work here anymore?
Penny,Because this company needs you.
Bernadette,I canêt let you do that.
Bernadette,I guess that would be all right.
Penny,See? You donêt have to be mean to get what you want.
Bernadette,Youêre right. Now where did we land on my bathroom?
Leonard,How come youêre up so late?
Sheldon,"I posted the last episode of Fun with Flags hours ago, and not a single person cared enough to comment. All that effort for nothing."
Leonard,"Mm. I know how you feel. I spent the day throwing out a manês entire career, and all thatês left is an old bottle of champagne and a naked lady pen that Raj took when he thought no one was looking."
Sheldon,Itês not the same thing. I donêt think you know how I feel at all.
Sheldon,Hmm. You do get me. Someone left a comment.
Leonard,Yeah. What did they say?
Sheldon,"Too bad your show is done. I kind of liked it. Leonard, did you hear that? Oh, the people are heartbroken. I canêt take this away from the world. Fun with Flags is back."
Sheldon,Letês celebrate.
Leonard,"Sheldon, that wasnêt for you."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, Iêm not going to drink it. I just wanted to hear the pop. Yeah, I knew it was coming. Still scary."
Sheldon, LeVar Burton?
Sheldon,"You told me not to call, and I didnêt know how else to give you the good news. Fun with Flags is back, and you can be in the next episode."
Sheldon,"You, at least listen to the premise. Since you were born in Germany, I thought we could talk"
Penny,"Hey, how are things going with your parents?"
Sheldon,"You know, speaking of attorneys, if I ever needed a lawyer, I would not hire She-Hulk."
Penny,"You know what? That was almost on topic. Iêm gonna say good job, Sheldon."
Amy,"Wait, She-Hulkês a lawyer?"
Howard,"Yeah, she works at a law firm in New York."
Sheldon,"Yes, but sheês the only monster at the firm. Between you, me and the wall, I think sheês an affirmative action hire."
Raj,"Anyway, Dadês gonna be here in town, so I wonêt be able to do Christmas dinner this year."
Amy,"If youêre not up to hosting Christmas dinner, Iêm happy to do it. You can even bring your father."
Raj,That would be nice.
Amy,"Iêve always wanted to do a traditional Victorian Christmas. Parlour games, goose and figgy pudding."
Sheldon,"Ugh. English pudding. You get yourself all excited for pudding, and here comes a cake with raisins in it. Iêm not going."
Amy,Youêre going.
Sheldon,Why do you hate me?
Amy,I donêt hate you. I love you.
Sheldon,"Well, you call it love, but it has a lot of raisins in it."
Raj,"Amy, good luck getting these guys excited about a dinner with a theme. I gave up when no one cared about my Tom Hanks-giving."
Bernadette,I think a Victorian Christmas sounds nice.
Howard,I agree.
Leonard,Why not?
Penny,"Me, too."
Raj,You guys suck.
Leonard,"You know the best part of working in the clean room? No allergies. Check it out. Oh, that, that, thatês a lot of oxygen."
Howard,We should get going to Amyês.
Leonard,Can you believe there was a time when we would have needed an array of giant Cherenkov telescopes to detect cosmic particles? And here we are building our own multi-wire detector like a couple of badasses.
Howard,"I know. If we were still single, weêd be tripping over all that booty."
Leonard,"Ladies do love a man dressed like a kitchen garbage bag. Oh, no."
Howard,How the hell did a pigeon get in here?
Leonard,"You shut the loading doors, right?"
Howard,I thought you did.
Leonard,Do you know what a disaster this is?
Howard,"You mean êcause this room isnêt supposed to have dust in it, and we just let in a flying crap machine?"
Leonard,What do we do? Should we call someone?
Howard,And tell them that we compromised all the equipment? Letês just get it out of here before anyone knows.
Leonard,"Okay, how do we catch it?"
Howard,"Well, what if we turn off all the lights except for one, and itêll come to it."
Leonard,Itês not a moth.
Howard,Donêt yell at me. Youêre not gonna get any good ideas out of me if youêre yelling.
Leonard,"Okay, so if I remain calm, Iêll get more gems like turn off the lights?"
Howard,"Great, weêre turning on each other. Thatês just what the bird wants us to do."
Penny,"So, Dr. Koothrappali, long flight?"
Penny,"Oh, thatês rough."
Raj,Can we please talk about anything else?
Penny,"Oh, great. Everythingês good."
Penny,"Yes, we did."
Raj,"Hey, Leonard. Whatês up? How did that happen? Yeah, okay. Iêll be there as soon as I can. Sorry. I have to run to the university."
Amy,Whatês going on?
Raj,Thereês been a problem with an experiment. A bird got into the clean room.
Raj,"Uh, no. You had a long flight. You stay here and relax."
Penny,Youêre just gonna leave him here?
Raj,Yup. Bye.
Bernadette,"Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus Lane. Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer pulling on the reins."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I appreciate the ride."
Bernadette,"Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright. So hang your stockings and say your prayers êcause Santa Claus is coming tonight. Whyêd you turn it off?"
Sheldon,"Because in the last ten minutes, Santa came to town, kissed Mommy and ran Grandma over with a reindeer. I had a drunk uncle who did all those things. Nobody sings songs about him."
Bernadette,Maybe youêd like it more if you thought of Santa as a superhero and his power is bringing joy to children.
Sheldon,"My uncle was accused of that, too. It turned out to be legal in Oklahoma."
Bernadette,"Okay, new subject. Letês talk about presents. What did you get Amy?"
Sheldon,"Oh, weêre not exchanging gifts."
Bernadette,"Come on, Sheldon, you have to get her something."
Sheldon,"Why should I? She knows that I donêt like Christmas, and yet, every year, she forces me to celebrate it. Not only am I going to this foolish dinner against my will, at the Christmas tree lot, there was mistletoe, and she kissed me under it in public. Like we were the stars of a Tijuana sex show."
Bernadette,Sheês just excited about the holidays.
Sheldon,"Yes, and sheês not taking my feelings into account at all. Maybe itês time I teach her a lesson."
Sheldon,"Hmm. Itêd have to be something heinous, something that makes her as miserable as sheês making me. Oh, Iêve got it. This is good."
Sheldon,Iêm going to buy her a present.
Bernadette,"Yeah, youêre gonna have to walk me through that."
Sheldon,"With gift-giving, thereês an implied social contract. If I show up tonight with a present, and she doesnêt have one for me, sheêll feel terrible."
Bernadette,Then youêre both sad?
Sheldon,"Yes. Maybe sheêll feel so guilty, sheêll never make me celebrate the holidays again."
Bernadette,So your evil plot here is to buy your girlfriend a present?
Sheldon,"Thatês right. So stay on my good side, or Iêll get you a little something, too."
Howard,"Okay, hereês the plan. Iêm gonna put the food in the bag, and when he lands in the bag to eat it, we close it up."
Leonard,A Slim Jim?
Howard,Itês all I could find. Itêll work.
Leonard,Sure. If the pigeonês stoned or a trucker.
Howard,"Okay, well, whatês your plan?"
Leonard,I told you my plan. Letês call Building Services and get help.
Howard,And admit that we contaminated the clean room?
Leonard,"No, admit that you contaminated the clean room."
Howard,Why do you keep assuming it was me?
Leonard,"Because you do this kind of thing all the time, and then you try to cover it up."
Howard,Like when?
Leonard,"What about when you flipped the Mars Rover, or lost Koothrappaliês dog, or almost drove off with that baby?"
Howard,"Again, it looked like my car, and the baby didnêt even cry until his mother punched me with her keys."
Leonard,"Fine, put the Slim Jim in the garbage bag."
Howard,"Well, what if you said it without sounding so condescending?"
Leonard,"I can try, but your plan has the words garbage bag and Slim Jim in it."
Raj,"Hey, whatês going on?"
Leonard,Oh. Genius here wants to catch a bird with a garbage bag and a Slim Jim.
Raj,Should have put it in the bag first.
Penny,"So, if you donêt mind me asking, do you think you might start dating again?"
Penny,"No, but if things donêt work out with me and Leonard, Iêll give you a call. Wait. How much do you talk about Star Trek?"
Amy,"Okay, letês get this Victorian party started. Iêve done some research about some traditional parlour games we can play."
Penny,Like what?
Amy,"Well, thereês a fun one called Ball of Wool. You take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the centre of the table. Then people sit on opposite sides of the table and try to blow the wool off."
Penny,"Sorry. Sheês taken, too."
Howard,You know what I think your problem is? Youêre jealous because you and I used to be best friends until Koothrappali came along.
Leonard,And you found somebody you could push around?
Howard,Stay out of this.
Howard,"You know, maybe Iêm best friends with Raj because he doesnêt think heês smarter than me."
Howard,"I said, stay out of it."
Leonard,"No, no, no. No, Raj, go ahead, say what you were gonna say."
Raj,"All Iêm gonna say is you guys need to stop this right now. It. itês bad enough that my parents are fighting, now I have to hear the two of you? And who cares whoês smarter? If itês Leonard or me or, you know, itês Christmas, letês say itês Howard."
Howard,"Well, if youêre so smart, you get the bird out."
Raj,"No, youêre the one who let him in."
Howard,How do you know it wasnêt Leonard?
Raj,Come on.
Bernadette,What about that sweater?
Sheldon,"No, itês not good enough. It has to be perfect."
Bernadette,I think the nicest gifts Iêve got from Howie show how well he knows me.
Sheldon,"Hmm. Letês see, what do I know about Amy? She loves medieval literature, Chaucerês her favourite. And her eyes sparkle when she watches old French movies. I enjoy how harp music causes her fingers to dance as if sheês playing along."
Bernadette,"Wow, you really do love her."
Sheldon,"I do. Now, letês find the kind of gift that makes her feel small and worthless."
Amy,You won.
Penny,"Certainly doesnêt feel like it, does it?"
Penny,"Oh, I guess thatês where Raj gets it from."
Penny,"Hey, you know, Raj is dating a doctor who works a lot. Him and his mom have a type. You, you got to laugh at that, right? No? All right."
Sheldon,Thereês an argument for that. But I want to make sure.
Leonard,"Okay. On the count of three, Iêll shoot the fire extinguisher and get him airborne. Howard, you wave the blanket and guide him towards the exit. Raj, you hold open the curtain so he can fly out."
Howard,Are you sure a dummy like me can handle something as complicated as a blanket?
Leonard,Do you want the fire extinguisher?
Howard,"Yeah, I do."
Leonard,Great. Here you go.
Howard,"Okay. One, two, three."
Raj,"Uh, you have to take the pin out."
Leonard,"You miss the blanket now, donêt you?"
Howard,"On three. One, two, three."
Raj,What did you do?
Howard,"It was an accident. Oh, my God. Oh, my God."
Leonard,"Relax, it wasnêt your fault."
Howard,"Uh, maybe itês just stunned."
Raj,"Dude, itês not breathing."
Howard,"Oh, no. I killed it. Oh, not again."
Raj,"What do you mean, not again?"
Howard,"When I was ten, I was playing in my backyard and sat on a blue jay. I mean, I tried to bring it back to life with electricity, but it just caught on fire. The worst part was it smelled delicious."
Leonard,"Uh, guys, I found an article here that says you can do CPR on birds."
Howard,Great. Do it.
Leonard,"Iêm not doing it. You killed him, you do it."
Raj,Iêll do it.
Howard,I need to do it. This is on me.
Leonard,Okay. Mouth over beak and light chest compressions.
Raj,"Donêt blow too hard. If you pop him, I will vomit."
Howard,I am tasting a lot of Slim Jim.
Leonard,"Wait, wait, his wing moved."
Howard,"Oh, he blinked his eyes. Heês alive."
Raj,Itês a Christmas miracle.
Howard,"I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but Iêll take it. Come on, little guy, letês get you outside. Get the curtain."
Raj,Someone should really close that loading door.
Raj,"Well, thatês that. The roomês compromised. Theyêll have to change all the filters, probably shut it down for weeks."
Howard,"You were right. Go ahead, call Building Services. Tell them it was my fault."
Leonard,"No, weêre both to blame. You know, let me take the heat on this one."
Raj,"Yeah, just leave me out of it. You know if they come here and see crap everywhere, theyêre just gonna blame the Indian guy."
Leonard,"Hey. Iêm sorry, weêre still here. Is everything okay?"
Penny,Itês kind of boring. Although it did get exciting for a minute when Amy inhaled a wool ball. How much longer do you think youêll be?
Leonard,I donêt know. Thereês still a bird in here. We are gonna get in a ton of trouble.
Penny,"Honey, itês Christmas Eve. Who even knows youêre in there?"
Leonard,"No, our names are on the sign-in sheet."
Penny,So erase them and walk out.
Leonard,I canêt do that.
Howard,Canêt do what?
Leonard,She says take our names off the sign-in sheet and leave.
Howard,We canêt do that.
Raj,"Mmm. Amy, that pudding was delicious."
Sheldon,If you like raisins.
Amy,Thank you. And itês figs.
Sheldon,"Oh. Oh, in that case, it was pretty good."
Bernadette,You feeling okay? You hardly touched your goose.
Howard,It smelled too much like blue jay.
Amy,"Oh, you Heimliched a ball of wool out of me; youêre good."
Sheldon,"Uh, what do you say we exchange gifts?"
Penny,"Oh, Sheldon, we didnêt bring any."
Leonard,I thought you hate giving gifts.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I do. Which is why I got Amy this."
Amy,You got me something?
Sheldon,"Oh, not just something, no. Itês from the heart, itês holiday-themed, and I swallowed the gift receipt so you cannot return it."
Amy,Look at you on Santaês lap. Thatês so sweet.
Sheldon,Of course it is. Itês the perfect gift. How are you feeling right now? Guilty? Sad? Wishing you were Jewish?
Amy,"No, I love it."
Sheldon,"Oh, really? Well, how about now?  And you got me nothing. Christmas is ruined. Letês never speak of it again. Well, this was fun."
Amy,"Actually, I did get you something."
Sheldon,But what about our agreement?
Amy,"Well, you got me something. Here."
Amy,Theyêre your Meemawês Christmas cookies. I called and got the recipe.
Sheldon,Theyêre perfect. It tastes like her hugs.
Amy,"Merry Christmas, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"I canêt believe this. Youêre happy, Iêm happy. Well, maybe a holiday thatês all about giving isnêt soÑ Get your hand out of that box."
Amy,Okay. The next game is called Hot Boiled Beans.
Penny,Of course it is.
Amy,"One person is sent out of the room while the others hide a small item. Then they invite the first person back by saying hot boiled beans and bacon for supper, hurry up before it gets cold."
Raj,"If you people think this is better than Tom Hanks-giving, youêre all crazy."
Sheldon,What colour would you like to be?
Leonard,"Well, Iêd like to be green, but you know you always take it."
Sheldon,"Thatês not true. Any colourês fine with me. Yeah, I could be a-a combination of blue and yellow."
Leonard,Blue and yellow make green.
Sheldon,"Well, then itês settled."
Penny,Hi. Ready to go?
Sheldon,"Oh, good news, we ordered lunch, so we can all stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk."
Amy,"Sheldon, we said that we would play games with you tonight."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, weêll still be playing it tonight, this game can easily take eight hours."
Penny,"Sweetie, you really thought Iêd want to do this?"
Penny,"Well, did you tell him that?"
Penny,Did you say it out loud with words?
Penny,I donêt want to spend the whole day playing a board game.
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, you may change your mind when you hear that this is the new expanded edition which contains a more complete map of Middle Earth, now including the Haradwaith Territories."
Amy,I will literally race you to the car.
Leonard,"No, no, no, come on, donêt leave. Just try it."
Penny,"Weêre always doing what you guys want. Just once, itêd be nice if you did something we wanted."
Sheldon,You want to be green?
Leonard,"You know, they really have tried to like a lot of the same stuff weêre into."
Penny,"Yeah, we do game nights and video game nights and we watch movies with directorês commentary."
Amy,"Oh, my favourite, George Lucas can talk all the way through Star Wars, I say one word and Iêm banished to the kitchen."
Penny,"Yeah, today Amy and I are deciding what weêre all gonna do."
Leonard,"You got it, you girls are in charge."
Penny,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Fine. Now that weêre not playing, you can be green."
Leonard,Thank you.
Sheldon,"And since youêre green this time, I can be it next time."
Penny,"All right, letês see. Whatês something fun the guys would never take us to do? Oh, I know, we could go horseback riding."
Amy,"I actually canêt. My hips donêt open wider than 22 degrees. I rode a very thin pony once. On the first bump, just popped right off."
Penny,"All right, well, what do you want to do?"
Amy,Thereês a craft and folk art museum on Wilshire.
Penny,"Well, thatês Wilshireês problem. Come on, you know, there, thereês got to be something fun we could do that the guys will hate."
Leonard,"Hang on, why do we have to hate it?"
Penny,"Three words, Doctor Who convention."
Leonard,I did not force you to go to that.
Penny,You walked out of the house in a fez and bow tie. I went so you didnêt get beat up.
Leonard,I wasnêt gonna get beat up.
Penny,"You were, but somehow I held myself back."
Sheldon,You know what you could make us do? Ice-skating. The cold air will trigger Leonardês asthma and it plays right into my well-known fear of getting flattened by a Zamboni.
Leonard,Now youêre helping them find ways to make us miserable?
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm sorry, Leonard, Iêm a problem-solver, itês what I do."
Amy,I actually canêt go ice-skating. I have unnaturally brittle ankles.
Penny,Is there any part of your body thatês normal?
Raj,"Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God."
Howard,Will you please relax?
Raj,"I canêt take it, dude."
Bernadette,You okay?
Raj,"No, Iêm not okay. I feel like Iêm gonna jump out of my skin."
Bernadette,I told you not to wax down there. Itês itchy when it grows back.
Raj,Iêm worried about the New Horizons space probe.
Bernadette,Whatês he talking about?
Howard,"Nine years ago he was part of a team that launched a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto, and itês finally close enough, so this morning it turned itself on."
Raj,We hope. The signal has to travel over three billion miles. So itês gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.
Howard,Now we get to see him flip out because heês worried it was demolished by space ice.
Raj,Space ice is no joke. I canêt even watch Frozen anymore.
Amy,"Ooh, the philharmonic is playing Beethoven downtown."
Sheldon,"Before you say yes, itês not the movie about the big dog."
Penny,How come we canêt think of something we both want to do?
Amy,Because you always pick what we do and I just go along with it.
Leonard,"Ah, interesting, weêre being accused of making you do things you donêt like, and here you are, doing the same thing to poor Amy."
Sheldon,You should point out the hypocrisy of that.
Leonard,Thatês what I was doing.
Sheldon,"Oh, that wasnêt clear. Try it again, but this time drive it home with how do you like them apples, Missy?"
Penny,"All right, keep thinking."
Sheldon,"Youêre making it too complicated. Why not stick to the basics? Go shopping for clothes while Leonard and I sit in those uncomfortable chairs and hold your purses, hmm? I know Iêd hate that. Leonard?"
Leonard,"Well, yeah."
Sheldon,"Well, then, itês settled?"
Amy,What do you say? Sounds kind of perfect.
Penny,"It does, somehow he managed to take all the fun out of it."
Sheldon,"Well, once again, itês what I do."
Raj,"Oh, another two hours to go. The wait is killing me."
Howard,"I know. I get it. When I was in the Soyuz capsule returning from the space station, plummeting toward Earth at 17,000 miles per hourÑ"
Raj,"Before you finish, is this a story about patience and waiting or just another reminder that you went to space?"
Howard,A story can do two things.
Raj,"Ugh, I feel like Iêm gonna have a heart attack."
Howard,"You work in pharmaceuticals, donêt you have anything you can give him?"
Bernadette,"All I have is our new urine flow drug. Wonêt help with his anxiety, but itês so strong, when he pees heêll fly around the room like heês got a jet pack."
Raj,I canêt stop thinking about it.
Bernadette,"You know, worrying wonêt have any effect on what happens."
Raj,I know.
Howard,Maybe you need to do something more productive.
Raj,"Okay. If I make this shot in the trash can, the probe will have arrived in perfect working order."
Howard,"So, in addition to being crazy, youêre resting the fate of the mission on your athletic prowess."
Howard,The man who crashed his stationary bike.
Raj,"I didnêt crash it, okay? My playlist was too up-tempo, I got light-headed and I fell off. Okay. It all comes down to this."
Howard,You happy? Now you can relax.
Raj,What kind of scientist are you? Everyone knows you got to make two out of three.
Leonard,This isnêt so bad.
Sheldon,"Thatês easy for you to say. Your chairês not facing the lingerie section. Boy, thatês a lot of panties."
Amy,You guys comfy? This might take a while.
Sheldon,I donêt understand why women insist on making a big production out of buying clothes.
Penny,"No, youêre right, we should do what you do. Have our mom send us pants from the Walmart in Houston."
Sheldon,They have a man there who understands my personal style.
Leonard,"Uh, Iêve got some bad news. Thereês no cell service in here."
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, thatês all right. There were plenty of ways to pass the time before smart phones were invented."
Leonard,Thatês true.
Sheldon,Iêll look them up. Son of a biscuit.
Leonard,"Sheldon, itês fine."
Sheldon,"No, itês not fine. What kind of store in the 21st century doesnêt at least have Wi-Fi? Iêm going to call their corporate office. Son of a biscuit."
Sheldon,"Letês see, my armies are going to attack the Shire from Buckland. And I roll a five and a three."
Leonard,"Okay. And to defend, I roll two sixes. I win."
Sheldon,"Boy, double-sixes again. You know, if I hadnêt seen it with my own eyes, I wouldnêt believe it. I wonder how long weêre gonna be stuck here."
Leonard,"I donêt know, but the girls do a lot for us. Itês the least we can do."
Sheldon,"Oh, thatês true. I suppose itês only fair we make compromises."
Leonard,"Look at you, being all mature."
Sheldon,"I donêt know why youêre so surprised. If thereês one thing I know about after living with you for so many years, itês how to compromise."
Leonard,"I, Iêm sorry? You make compromises for me?"
Sheldon,All the time.
Leonard,"On Earth? In our lives? That, that, that weêre living?"
Sheldon,"Oh, yes. I, just yesterday, you had a, a big piece of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch. Did I say anything? I compromised and kept my mouth shut. Like you shouldêve, because everyone was laughing at you."
Leonard,That is not a compromise. A compromise is me driving you everywhere because you refuse to learn how.
Sheldon,"Oh, I learned how. Amy taught me."
Leonard,Then. then why donêt you do it?
Sheldon,"Uh, well, itês scary. And sometimes I get the pedals mixed up. But, more importantly, driving me to work is one of the things that gives your life purpose. I canêt take that away from you, so what do I do? Oh, come on, Iêm practically feeding you the answer. I compromise."
Raj,"Hey, uh, thanks for keeping me company."
Howard,"Iêm happy to. I think getting out of the apartment will do you good. So, where we headed?"
Raj,"If itês okay with you, Iêd like to go to temple."
Howard,"Buddy, trust me, you donêt want to convert to Judaism. I mean, I know I make it look cool, but itês not all briskets and dreidels."
Raj,I meant a Hindu temple.
Howard,"Oh. Okay. Itês not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right? Some bald guy with horns isnêt gonna rip my heart out."
Raj,"Dude, that movieês an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians."
Howard,You love that movie.
Raj,"Yeah, itês pretty great."
Howard,Iêm surprised to see you suddenly get religious.
Howard,"Well, because Iêve known you for ten years and youêve never gone to temple, you never talked about believing in God, and last Diwali I watched you eat two pounds of sacred cow at a Brazilian steak house."
Raj,"Religion is a very personal thing. I do go to temple, I just, I donêt talk about it."
Howard,"Yeah, but youêre a scientist."
Howard,"So, as a scientist, you believe the way to understand the universe is through facts and evidence, and now youêre counting on some blue chick with a hundred arms to help you?"
Raj,That is so offensive. Does everything you know about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?
Howard,Thereês also Apu from The Simpsons.
Raj,"Well, lots of scientists believe in God. Okay? Newton, uh, Faraday, uh, Pascal, all were believers. Even Einstein was famous for attacking quantum theory on the grounds that God does not play dice with the universe."
Howard,"Well, of course he believed in God. he slept with Marilyn Monroe."
Raj,Actually thereês no proof of that.
Howard,"You believe in your religion, Iêll believe in mine."
Amy,Howês it going in there?
Penny,"Uh, not really a great outfit for work, unless something opens up in the hookers and whores division. Hey, can I ask you something?"
Penny,Do I really force you to do things you donêt want to?
Amy,"Yeah, but itês okay."
Penny,How is it okay?
Amy,"I promised myself, if I ever got friends, Iêd do whatever they said. Really, Iêm lucky you found me before a cult did."
Penny,"Well, you know, that was a long time ago. Youêre a different woman now. Youêre smart, youêve got great friends, youêve got a boyfriend, youêre pretty, you have zero fashion sense, but, anyway, tonight weêre gonna do whatever you want."
Penny,"Absolutely. You name it, weêre doing it."
Amy,Basket weaving at the craft museum.
Penny,"Well, you named it."
Sheldon,"Oh, hereês another one. I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an A, but I donêt put it there because I donêt want you breaking one of your little legs when youêre supposed to be making my breakfast."
Leonard,Is it my turn to talk about the compromises I make?
Sheldon,"I wasnêt done, but go ahead. He said, compromising."
Leonard,"Because of you, Iêm not allowed to adjust the temperature in my own home. Iêm not allowed to whistle. I donêt wear shoes that might squeak."
Sheldon,"Well, youêre a physicist, not a circus clown."
Leonard,"Sheldon, do you realize I donêt live with the woman I love because of you? No other reason. Just you."
Sheldon,Is that true?
Leonard,"Yes, itês true. The last time I brought it up, you had an emotional breakdown and got on a train and ran away."
Sheldon,"Well, given my history on the subject, t seems a little reckless to bring it up now."
Leonard,You have no idea how much you inconvenience the lives of everyone around you. Itês exhausting.
Sheldon,"You know what? You think youêre so tolerant, but the truth is youêre mean to me a lot. Yeah, you think that I donêt notice all those sarcastic comments and those eye rolls, but I do. Hmm? I have excellent peripheral vision. On a good day, I can see my ears."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I, Iêm sorry if I hurt your feelings. Iêve been holding a lot of this in for a while."
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm sorry, too. And if you want to live with Penny, then I think you should."
Leonard,Do you mean that?
Sheldon,"Yes. Yeah, just put on your squeaky shoes and eee-eee-eee your way out of my life."
Leonard,"Come on, donêt get upset."
Sheldon,Iêm not upset. Iêm just imagining a world without my best friend in it.
Sheldon,Itês okay.
Leonard,Iêm not leaving your world. Iêm just talking about living across the hall.
Sheldon,"I understand. Either way, I want you to know that Iêm aware of how difficult I can be. So I just want to say thank you for putting up with me."
Penny,How are you guys getting along? Why are there tears?
Leonard,Everythingês fine. We just started talking about living arrangements.
Amy,Are you crazy? You know heês a flight risk.
Sheldon,Thatês exactly what I told him.
Penny,"Sheldon, we know this is a sensitive subject, and Leonardês not gonna move out until youêre ready."
Sheldon,"Well, what if you did it gradually?"
Leonard,All right. How about we start with two nights a week I live with Penny?
Sheldon,How about one night and I let you whistle?
Sheldon,When Iêm not home.
Leonard,You got it.
Sheldon,"There we go, compromising again. We really are the best."
Howard,"Here we go, my first Hindu temple."
Raj,"You see behind the fountain, that tower that looks like a pyramid? Itês called a Sikhara. It symbolizes the, the connection between the human and the divine."
Howard,Huh. I always thought it was mini golf.
Raj,All right. Shall we?
Howard,"Yeah. Just, uh, is there anything I should know before I go in?"
Raj,Like what?
Howard,Like am I dressed okay?
Raj,"Really? So every other place youêve been, you thought this was fine?"
Howard,"I know youêre under a lot of pressure, so Iêm gonna let that pass."
Raj,"Sorry. Youêre right. Iêm so stressed. But you know what, whenever I walk into that temple I realize that whatever happens, itês okay. Weêre all part of an immense pattern, and though we canêt understand it, we can be happy to know that itês, itês working its will through us."
Howard,Thatês nice.
Raj,"Whether you call it God or the universe or the self, weêre all interconnected, and thatês just a beautifulÑ Son of a bitch, that guy just dinged my car. S, seriously? You were just gonna drive away? Like my life isnêt hard enough right now. A space probe might be destroyed, my parents are going through an awful divorce, the guy who cuts my dogês hair just gave her bangs."
Raj,You saw her. She looks like Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber.
Howard,"Raj, you just got a text. The probe turned on. Itês fine."
Raj,"Oh, good. Namaste, Grandpa."
Leonard,"I thought this was gonna be boring, but itês actually kind of fun."
Penny,Donêt tell Amy that. Weêll be here every Sunday.
Amy,"Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket."
Sheldon,Itês not a basket. Itês a soldierês helmet from 16th century China.
Amy,Very nice.
Leonard,"Yeah, it looks great."
Sheldon,I saw that.
Leonard,"Well, roomie, itês only one night a week, but itês a start."
Penny,I know. Iêm really proud of Sheldon.
Leonard,"Yeah, Iêm proud of him, too."
Sheldon,Can you keep it down? Some of us are trying to sleep out here.
Leonard,"Okay, weêre headed out, see you later."
Sheldon,"Before you leave, could you test these noise-cancelling headphones?"
Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
Sheldon,Okay. Go ahead.
Leonard,"Hello, can you hear me? Sheldon, I havenêt changed the filter in the water pitcher in two years."
Penny,"Uh, Bernadetteês nickname for you is the virgin pi_a colada."
Leonard,Your George Lucas autograph is really a me autograph.
Penny,"Yeah, once I was too lazy to walk across the hall, so I used your toothbrush."
Leonard,"Ooh, and one time when you were asleep, Amy totally took off herÑ and thatês why youêre the best roommate ever."
Sheldon,"Aw, now Iêm sad I didnêt hear it."
Penny,So what do you need the headphones for?
Sheldon,"Well, Iêve been struggling for months to come up with a theory of dark matter that doesnêt make protons decay. Iêm hoping to finally tackle it by optimising my work environment. See, Iêve got, uh, my tea is at the perfect sipping temperature. Uh, I have fleece-lined boxer shorts to keep my tushie toasty. And then, oh, last but not least, this inspirational cat poster improved with the reassuring face of physics renegade Richard Feynman."
Penny,Is that why you had to take him to Office Depot last night?
Leonard,"I donêt want to talk about it. There, the place is all yours."
Penny,"Yeah, have fun."
Sheldon,"Oh, I will, nothing more fun than a paradigm-shifting evening of science."
Penny,And you thought it was soaping me up in the shower.
Sheldon,Okay. Here we go. Proton decay. Proton decay.  Proton decay. Proton decay.
Leonard,"Hey, weêre home. Any progress?"
Sheldon,"How could there be, with these constant interruptions?"
Penny,"I love him, but if heês broken, letês not get a new one."
Leonard,What are you doing? Itês time to go.
Sheldon,Iêm not going to work today. And would you like to know why?
Leonard,"Ah, youêre upset because you spent the whole night working on dark matter and didnêt make a breakthrough, and now youêre worried you made a huge mistake switching fields, and youêre gonna sit around and sulk all day?"
Sheldon,Like a big old baby.
Leonard,Call me if you need anything.
Sheldon,Iêve been cooped up in here too long. Maybe I need some fresh air.
Penny,Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! 
Sheldon, Penny?
Sheldon, Penny?
Sheldon, Penny?
Penny,"Ugh, what?"
Sheldon,You sounded in distress. I was worried something unpleasant was happening to you. Like a murder. Or spontaneous coitus with Leonard.
Penny,"Oh, Iêm just doing this awful workout. I hate it."
Sheldon,"Well, if you hate it, then why are you doing it? Although I could ask the same question about coitus with Leonard."
Penny,"I donêt know, I guess I like that I hate it. It makes me work harder."
Sheldon,And to clarify?
Penny,"The exercise, Sheldon. Shouldnêt you be getting ready for work?"
Sheldon,Iêm not going. Would you like to know why?
Penny,"Uh, youêre sad about not getting anything done last night, so youêre gonna sit around and pout about it?"
Sheldon,"Boy, Iêm not nearly as mysterious as I think I am."
Howard,I invented a game. You want to play?
Howard,"Itês called Emily or Cinnamon. I give you actual quotes Iêve heard Raj say, and you guess if he was talking to his girlfriend or his dog."
Raj,"Go ahead, make fun. You canêt embarrass me, Iêve got a beautiful girlfriend and a dog who loves me so much she drinks my bathwater."
Howard,"Okay, who was he talking to, Emily or Cinnamon? I want you to know, the bed feels so lonely when youêre not in it."
Raj,I may not be liking this game so much.
Leonard,Cinnamon. Give me another one.
Howard,"Okay, Emily or Cinnamon? Check it out, I got us matching sweaters."
Leonard,"We all got the Christmas card, Cinnamon."
Raj,"You know, a man can care deeply about a woman and a pet. Itês not strange."
Leonard,"Ooh, Emily. I heard him say that to Emily. Hey, I thought you were staying home."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I was, but after talking to Penny, I realised something. I, first, sheês trying much harder to stay attractive in this relationship than you are. And second, the reason I may not be progressing in my research is Iêve created too pleasant of an environment for myself."
Howard,What do you mean?
Sheldon,"According to a classic psychological experiment by Yerkes and Dodson, in order to maximize performance, one must create a state of productive anxiety. So Iêd like to ask you all to do something for me. Keep me on my toes. Just throw me off my game. Essentially, go out of your way to make my life miserable."
Howard,Hold on. Whatês in it for us?
Sheldon,"Well, I supposeÑ"
Howard,"Okay, weêll do it."
Amy,"33 seconds. Okay, thatêll be our baseline."
Sheldon,"You know, I donêt want to tell you how to do your job, but when a mouse completes a maze, it gets a food pellet."
Amy,It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.
Sheldon,And his last meal was a food pellet? Youêre a monster.
Amy,"All right, next, weêre gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problem-solving rate."
Sheldon,"Very well. And good luck, Iêm a pretty laid-back guy."
Amy,Ready? Begin. Whyêd you pop it?
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, I was aiming for your heart."
Amy,"Look, I know you donêt like it, but thatês the point of the experiment. I need to irritate you to find your optimal anxiety zone. And you said no to tickling, polka music or watching me eat a banana."
Sheldon,Who eats them horizontally?
Amy,My mother said thatês how good girls do it.
Sheldon,Perhaps this was a waste of time.
Amy,"Sheldon, youêre a remarkable scientist. Just be patient, Iêm sure youêll find the breakthrough youêve been looking for."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Amy,"And if you only do solid research instead of making a groundbreaking discovery, what does it matter?"
Sheldon,"Only do solid research? I come to you for help, and you insult me? I thought the least that you would do would beÑ"
Amy,"Look, your anxiety levels are right in the zone."
Sheldon,"Really? Oh, thatês fantastic. Now, wait, theyêre dropping. Why are they dropping?"
Amy,Because youêre happy theyêre elevated.
Sheldon,"Oh, that is infuriating. Ooh, look, they went back up again. Terrific. Oh, no, they went back down."
Raj,"All right, guys, what game do you want to play?"
Howard,Letês see. How about Emily or Cinnamon?
Raj,"You know what? I think itês a little weird that you remember me saying all these things. Maybe the truth is, youêre jealous of all my relationships."
Howard,"Oh, maybe I am. Who wouldnêt want to be the girl, or possibly dog, to hear the words youêre so lucky, you have the shiniest hair."
Leonard,"That is a tough one. Uh, I know he brushes both of them."
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I have figured out the perfect way for you to irritate me. Iêd like you to be my intellectual sparring partners. From now on, when I make an assertion, I need you to challenge it."
Leonard,So you just want us to disagree with whatever you say?
Raj,And you think thatês going to help?
Howard,"Well, I donêt think thatês gonna help at all."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, it will. See, by keeping my mind engaged, Iêll become more focused."
Leonard,"Howardês right, thatêll never work."
Sheldon,"Stop fighting me on the premise. Itês scientifically valid. Iêm going to advance propositions, I just want you to challenge me."
Raj,I donêt think thatês what you want at all.
Sheldon,"Why, of course itês what I want. Why would I say itês what I want if itês not what I want?"
Leonard,"Because it is what you want, and itês not what you said."
Sheldon,"I ask you for one simple thing, and you canêt even do it."
Howard,"Yes, we can."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, then do it."
Sheldon,"You guys are the worst. Thank you, I think that was helpful."
Penny,"So, whichever rep has the best sales for the quarter gets a trip for two to Hawaii."
Amy,That would be so romantic for you and Leonard.
Penny,"Yeah, clearly you havenêt seen him on the beach walking around with his metal detector."
Amy,"If I were going to Hawaii, Iêd spend all my time at the Keck Observatory. Did you know that the telescopes there have better resolution than the Hubble?"
Penny,Really? Want to go to Hawaii?
Sheldon, Ladies?
Penny,Come in.
Penny,Whatês up?
Sheldon,"Well, as you may know, Iêve been experimenting with elevated anxiety levels, and I thought, what better way to increase my discomfort than to subject myself to an evening of tasteless uncensored crotch talk?"
Penny,What exactly do you think goes on here?
Sheldon,"Well, conversations that you wouldnêt be comfortable having in front of the opposite sex. You know, who has the best cervix. Which sanitary napkin is all the rage right now. Menês buttocks, and how you want to pat and squeeze them."
Bernadette,We were talking about Pennyês job.
Sheldon,"And how difficult it is to do when sheês bloated, cranky and crampy? Continue."
Penny,"Sheldon, we are just people. We talk about the same things you guys talk about."
Sheldon,"You talk about if werewolves can swim? See, Leonard says yes, but I say it depends on if the human could swim before he was bitten. What do you think?"
Penny,Letês just talk about our periods.
Amy,"No, hold on. All canines instinctively know how to swim. Why wouldnêt a werewolf have the same abilities?"
Bernadette,"Well, theyêre not a hundred percent wolf. Theyêre a werewolf, thatês only part wolf. Itês like comparing apples to oranges."
Sheldon,"Thank you. Oh, and technically, itês apples that turn into were-oranges when the moon is full. Hey, this is fun. We should do it sometime when you arenêt all PMSêing. Bye."
Leonard,What is going on?
Sheldon,"Oh. Uh, I need to keep my anxiety at the right level, so Iêm using Darth Vader, the Joker, and Godzillaês roar to keep me in that sweet spot. Uh, I tried including Taylor Swift in the mix, but turns out I love her."
Leonard,"Well, at least listen to it through headphones. Iêm trying to sleep. Good night."
Sheldon,"Boy, Taylor was right, haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate."
Amy,"Youêve been working so much lately, Iêm glad you didnêt forget about date night."
Sheldon,Of course.
Amy,Maybe you want to put the notebook away and talk to me.
Sheldon,I can do both. My brain is working at optimal capacity. I can have a conversation with you and solve the dark matter proton decay problem at the same time.
Amy,Fine. How was your day?
Sheldon,"Oh, you said it."
Amy,"Sheldon. Sheldon, Iêm worried about you. Youêre not eating, you havenêt slept in days, and, to be honest, that cap is starting to smell."
Sheldon,I know. Itês replaced Godzilla as my principle source of anxiety.
Howard,"Okay, so itês one vote Emily, one vote Cinnamon. Penny, youêre the tiebreaker."
Penny,Say the quote again.
Howard,Itês just so perfect that weêre both Libras.
Penny,"Wow, this is hard. Iêm gonna say Cinnamon."
Raj,Come on.
Howard,"That was the last one, I promise. We wonêt play any more."
Raj,"Thank you. ‚Cause if she ever found out, it would hurt her feelings."
Bernadette,Emilyês feelings?
Raj,"Yes, Emily. Whatever. Whereês Sheldon?"
Penny,Date night.
Leonard,"That canêt be much fun for Amy. You know, at work today, he tried his first Red Bull."
Bernadette,What happened?
Leonard,He chased a squirrel around the quad for a while and then threw up in my car.
Bernadette,Donêt you think you should make him stop all this?
Howard,"I donêt know, heês not really hurting anybody."
Leonard,You didnêt have to scoop vomit out of your glove compartment.
Sheldon,He is getting a lot of work done. He had a pretty interesting take on proton decay.
Raj,"Wow, if he cracks that itês a game changer, guys. Itêll completely redefine our understanding of the physical universe."
Howard,"Hmm, it would. Okay, back to Emily or Cinnamon? How can such a little girl eat such a big steak?"
Amy,"Sheldon, I want you to take that cap off."
Sheldon,"That nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah. But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill, thatêd really put the zip-a-dee in my doo-dah."
Amy,"Iêm sorry, but you know we agreed not to bring work to date night."
Sheldon,"There you go, perfect."
Amy,"Sheldon, stop it, Iêm not kidding. Take the cap off, and put the notebook away."
Sheldon,"But after months of struggling, Iêm finally making progress."
Amy,You donêt need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.
Sheldon,"Or do I, hmm? Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia while convinced he was an armadillo."
Amy,Thatês not true.
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isnêt. I have been hallucinating lately."
Amy,"Sheldon, this has to stop. You need to get some sleep and take care of yourself."
Sheldon,"Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days than I have since I made the switch to dark matter. What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?"
Amy,"Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety."
Sheldon,"Hmm, perhaps. But Iêm not taking the cap off."
Amy,"Itês one thing to make yourself miserable, but youêre making everyone around you miserable, too. Now, Iêm telling you for the last time, take the cap off."
Sheldon,"Oh, really? What if I donêt? And before you answer that, can I have my dessert?"
Sheldon,"And then she threw me out. Me, her very own boyfriend. When all Iêve done is try to help humanity reach of the world we live in."
Sheldon,"I knew youêd understand, Armadillo Isaac Newton."
Leonard,Here we are.
Sheldon,Hey. What are you trying to pull? The president of science isnêt in here.
Leonard,"You lie down, heêll be here in a minute."
Sheldon,"Okay. Hey, I thought you were trying to trick me."
Penny,"Now, you just get comfortable."
Sheldon,"No, no, comfort is the enemy. You know whatês comfortable? Slippers and blankets and panda bears. Imagine a panda bear with Richard Feynmanês face on it. Warm up the car, Leonard, itês poster time."
Leonard,Maybe in the morning.
Penny,"Yeah, you get some sleep."
Sheldon,"No, I donêt want to go to sleep, you canêt make me."
Penny,"Youêre right, we canêt."
Sheldon,"Yeah, darn straight, you canêt. Try to tell a grown man to go to sleep."
Penny,"Soft kitty, warm kitty."
Leonard,Little ball of fur.
Sheldon,Thatês not gonna work.
Penny,"Happy kitty, sleepy kitty."
Leonard,"You know, he can be a lot of trouble, but when I see him lying here asleep like this, I just think how easy it would be to hold a pillow over his face."
Howard,You look like you got some rest.
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm feeling much better. And Iêve also been continuing to make progress without artificially raising my anxiety levels."
Leonard,"I turned on the heat in my car and some vomit came out, so my levels, right up there."
Raj,"Hey, guys. Mind if Emily joins us for lunch?"
Leonard,"Yeah, sure."
Howard,"Yeah, no problem."
Sheldon,Of course not.
Howard,"Well, um, we were just kidding around."
Penny,"So, tell me about your day, howês it going with the particle detector?"
Leonard,"Wow, you remember that?"
Penny,"Yeah, I listen to what you say. Youêre building a particle detector using superfluid helium."
Leonard,"You know, when you talk like that, I want to take you right here on this table."
Penny,"And you know from past experience this table cannot support both our weight. So, howês the detector going?"
Leonard,"Well, itês tricky working with superfluids. Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own."
Penny,Kind of like Sheldonês ant farm.
Leonard,"Exactly, except you donêt have a lunatic running around, yelling, I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me? Come on, this is boring, you really want to talk about this?"
Penny,"No, I do. I didnêt write superfluid helium on this napkin for nothing."
Leonard,"Okay, well, this is cool. Uh, thereês a thing called superfluid vacuum theory, where empty space is imagined as a superfluid with all of its qualities, viscosity, density, surface tensionÑ"
Penny,"Hey, if youêre pausing for dramatic effect, Iêd keep it moving."
Leonard,"No, no. People donêt talk about surface tension. If you imagine our three-space as the surface of an N-dimensional superfluid bubbleÑ This is exciting. This is really exciting. I have to go find Sheldon."
Penny,"Okay, well, if you find him, use the kitchen island, that coffee table will not support both of you."
Leonard,Which means a spherical multidimensional superfluid shows the same negative-energy density as space-time. So what do you think? What do you think? So what do you think?
Leonard,Is it wrong? Have you seen it somewhere else?
Leonard,"I know this isnêt my area, and I could never do the math like you can, but could this be something?"
Sheldon,"Well, you could have set Newtonês gravitational constant to one. And, ugh, the whole thing reeks of blueberry. You know I canêt stand these scented markers."
Leonard,"No one told you to taste them. Come on, is, is this good or not?"
Sheldon,Itês good.
Sheldon,I like it. I think youêre on to something.
Leonard,You do? Youêre not messing with me?
Sheldon,"Not at all. In fact, I have got something for just such an occasion. I was starting to think I might never get a chance to give it to you. Good job."
Leonard,Youêre giving me a sticker?
Sheldon,Not just a sticker. That is a sticker of a kitty saying me-wow.
Leonard,Iêm not a preschooler.
Sheldon,"Fine, Iêll take it back."
Leonard,I earned this. Back off.
Leonard,Youêre still awake?
Sheldon,"For a man whose last observation was our universe may be the surface of a multidimensional supercooled liquid, youêre still awake seems like quite the sophomore slump."
Leonard,You worked out all the math.
Sheldon,"Oh, I did more than work out all the math. I wrote a paper."
Leonard,You wrote a paper on my idea?
Sheldon,I wrote a paper on our idea.
Leonard,When did my idea become our idea?
Sheldon,When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness and cooked it in the Easy-Bake oven of my mind.
Leonard,This is good. Our idea is really good.
Sheldon,"Well, the lightbulb in this oven is ridiculously bright."
Leonard,"You know, if no oneês thought of this, yet, this could be a big deal."
Sheldon,"Only way weêll know for sure is if we post it online to the pre-print server. I have it ready to go, but I wasnêt gonna do it without you."
Leonard,"Wow, itês all happening so fast. Should we just sleep on it?"
Sheldon,"We could, but we always run the risk of someone else beating us to the punch."
Leonard,Youêre sure itês good?
Sheldon,My name is right on there with yours. That is a surefire mark of quality. That might as well say directed by Joss Whedon.
Leonard,"Okay, partner, letês do it."
Sheldon,Come on. Click the mouse with me.
Leonard,"One, two three."
Leonard,"Well, we did it."
Sheldon,"Yes, we did, my friend."
Leonard,Is your tongue blue?
Sheldon,I donêt want to talk about it.
Bernadette,"Okay, movie night, what do you want to watch?"
Amy,Whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?
Penny,"Oh, God. Probably nothing. I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store."
Bernadette,Search for it.
Penny,"no, why?"
Bernadette,‚Cause it would be fun to watch.
Penny,It would be humiliating.
Bernadette,"Well, now we have two reasons."
Amy,They have it.
Bernadette,"Please, can we watch it?"
Penny,"Fine, but Iêm telling you, itês terrible."
Amy,Have you even seen it?
Bernadette,"Well, maybe it turned out better than you think."
Bernadette,"Ho-ho, it really didnêt."
Leonard,"Sheldon, this is superfluid helium. Put this in your mouth, your tongue will freeze and break off."
Sheldon,Does it smell like blueberries?
Sheldon,Then weêre probably okay.
Howard,"Hey, your paper got mentioned on the Quantum Diaries physics blog."
Leonard,Really? Whatêd they say?
Howard,"Uh, itês basically a summary of the theory, but thereês a bunch of positive comments on the message board."
Leonard,"Let me see, let me see. One calls it insightful and innovative. Weêre insightful and innovative."
Sheldon,"Oh, nice to meet you, Mr. Insightful."
Leonard,"Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative. Uh, another one says the concept shows some real out-of-the-box thinking. Do you hear that, Mr. Out-Of-The?"
Sheldon,"I do, indeed, Mr. Box-Thinking."
Howard,"How are you today, Mr. Can-You-Believe-These-Jack-Asses?"
Raj,"Just dandy, Mr I-Wish-I-Was-Better-At-Improv."
Sheldon,Read another one.
Leonard,"Okay, okay. Uh, the analogy between space-time and a supercooled fluid is either meaningless or false. I wish this blog would devote itself to real science instead of wasting our time with crackpot wannabe theoreticians in a rush to publish."
Sheldon,Who wrote that?
Leonard,"Itês anonymous, and user name General Relativity."
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm responding to it."
Leonard,"Uh, donêt lower yourself to their level."
Sheldon,"Look, I am simply going to defend our work, scientist to scientist. And failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers."
Leonard,"Sheldon, my nameês on that paper, too. Thereês no upside to doing this."
Sheldon,He just left another comment.
Raj,What does it say?
Leonard,"Upon review, Iêve changed my mind about the Cooper-Hofstadter hypothesis that space-time is like a superfluid. In fact, itês inspired me to come up with my own theory. Maybe space-time is like two clowns with their heads in a bucket, much like Cooper and Hofstadter."
Sheldon,Can I respond now?
Leonard,Do it.
Sheldon,"You mess with the bull, you get the horns. Iêm about to show this guy just how horny I can be."
Leonard,Somebody else do it.
Penny,"Doctor, please help me. I think I might be turning into a killer gorilla."
Penny,"Because regular gorillas are vegetarians, and I just bit the fingers off your receptionist."
Penny,"Okay, weêve seen plenty."
Bernadette,"No, give me the remote."
Amy,Careful. Sheêll bite your fingers off.
Penny,"Okay, well, Iêve been poking around the internet, and I think I found something weêll enjoy watching even more."
Amy,What is it?
Penny,"Oh, just a video of Bernadette in a beauty pageant."
Bernadette,"Okay, I learned my lesson. Making fun of people is wrong."
Amy,I havenêt learned my lesson. Play it. Play it.
Bernadette,"Hi. Iêm Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski from Yorba Linda, California."
Penny,You look like a talking cupcake.
Amy,Play it again. Play it again.
Raj,Did he respond yet?
Sheldon,"Hmm. No, not yet."
Leonard,"Well, maybe we shouldnêt have sunk to his level."
Howard,It wasnêt that bad.
Leonard,Read it back one more time.
Sheldon,"My good sir, we are neither crackpots nor wannabes. In fact, we are experts in our fields. And while you hide behind your anonymity, we stand behind our paper. And later tonight, your mother."
Leonard,And you donêt think thatês too rough?
Sheldon,Weêre just standing behind her. Itês not like weêre gonna say boo and scare her.
Penny,How could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants?
Bernadette,‚Cause itês embarrassing.
Penny,It is; it truly is.
Bernadette,"Yeah, well, Amy writes Little House on the Prairie fan fiction about herself and posts it on the Internet."
Amy,Why? What did I do?
Bernadette,"Sorry, I had to get the spotlight off me, and tearing down other women is part of my pageant training."
Penny,Okay. We are reading that right now.
Amy,"No, please donêt."
Bernadette,We got embarrassed tonight. Come on.
Amy,But itês personal.
Penny,Why? Is it about you and Sheldon?
Penny,"Oh, my God, itês about her and Sheldon."
Amy,"Itês not about me and Sheldon. Itês about a young woman in the 1800s named Amelia, and the time-traveling physicist named Cooper she falls in love with."
Penny,Please show us?
Penny,You know Iêm gonna read it either way.
Amy,Good luck finding it.
Penny,"Amelia and the time-travÑ found it. It was just past dawn on the prairie, and like every morning, Amelia prepared to do her chores. Except something about this morning felt different."
Bernadette,Why? Why did it feel different?
Penny,"Maybe it was the first whisper of winter in the air, or maybe it was the unconscious handsome man with porcelain skin and curious clothing she was about to discover lying in the field. A man who would open her mind to new possibilities and her body to new feelings."
Amy,"You know, there was a time when I was alone and had no friends. Iêm starting to miss that."
Sheldon,He still hasnêt responded. Whatês taking him so long?
Leonard,Do you really want him to write back?
Sheldon,"Yeah, I do. Then no matter how he responds, I am going to destroy him with a picture of a bored cat saying oh, really?"
Howard,What are you doing?
Raj,"Iêve, uh, created some other user accounts so I can post positive comments about their paper."
Howard,This wee liêl bairn of a theory nearly blew my kilt off.
Raj,You have to read it how Dr. Angus McDougal of the University of Edinburgh would. This wee liêl bairn of a theory nearly blew me kilt off.
Sheldon,"He wrote back. Cooper and Hofstadter resorting to juvenile attempts at humour is proof they have nothing to back up their ridiculous paper. It should come as no surprise given they work at Cal Tech, essentially a technical school, where even the physicists are basically engineers. Engineers? Do you know how insulting that is?"
Raj,"Guys, this personês just going out of their way to get a rise out of you."
Sheldon,"Yeah, but itês still so aggravating."
Raj,"Yeah, well, all the other comments said really nice things. Focus on those."
Howard,"Yeah. Dr. Dmitri Plancovik of Moscow University said dis paper great, I love it more than wodka."
Raj,See? Better with the accent.
Sheldon,And send.
Leonard,What did you write?
Sheldon,Iêm done hiding from bullies. Iêm taking this into the real world.
Leonard,What does that mean?
Sheldon,"I told him weêll meet him face-to-face anytime, anywhere."
Leonard,Are you crazy? You donêt know who this person is. Delete that.
Raj,"Come on, Sheldon!"
Sheldon,"Oh, okay, okay, calm down.  Itês him. Heês trying to video chat. Perhaps I shouldnêt have taken this into the real world."
Leonard,"Oh, really?"
Penny,"_Time travel? I donêt understand,î said Amelia. Cooper stared at her. ‚Which word donêt you understand, time or travel?î"
Bernadette,"Wow, even in your fantasies Sheldonês kind of exhausting."
Amy,"Heês like that in the beginning, so she can change him. Itês called good writing. And wishful thinking."
Penny,"It stung Amelia when he spoke to her this way. In her little one-room schoolhouse, she was always the smartest student, regularly besting the boys in her class, but this was no boy in front of her, this was a man."
Bernadette,Here we go.
Penny,"Cooper told Amelia about all the strange and incredible things the future would hold, like computers and living past 30. He asked her if she had any questions. All she longed to ask was if his heart was beating as fast as hers, but she was too afraid to hear the answer."
Bernadette,"Oh, Amelia."
Penny,"So instead she asked if, in the future, Montana ever became a state."
Amy,In the 1800s that was considered flirting.
Raj,Iêm so sick of people being mean on the Internet.
Howard,"Well, I think the anonymity makes everyone feel like they can say things theyêd never say to your face."
Sheldon,Interesting. I canêt think of a single thing I wouldnêt say to someoneês face.
Leonard,Never noticed that about you.
Raj,"You know what? At least you guys did something. You know, you, you had a theory, you wrote a paper, you made an actual contribution. All guys like this do is just stand on other peopleês work."
Sheldon,Heês right. I say we call this person back. Weêve got no reason to hide.
Leonard,"All right, do it. Call him. Letês find out what this loserês ever accomplished."
Sheldon,"Click it with me. One, two, three, click."
Sheldon,Professor Hawking?
Leonard,You really didnêt like our paper?
Sheldon,Then why are you attacking us?
Leonard,Stephen Hawking liked our paper. Said the premise is intriguing.
Sheldon,"Good to see you again, Mr. Stephen-Hawking Liked-Our-Paper."
Leonard,"And you as well, Mr. Our-Premise-Is-Intriguing."
Howard,"How do you do, Mr. Iêll-Admit-Thatês-Pretty-Cool?"
Raj,"Yeah, you keep setting me up for failure."
Penny,"With a heavy heart, Amelia stood before the newly repaired time machine. She regretted giving Cooper the part he needed."
Bernadette,Because she wanted him to give her the part she needed.
Amy,"Okay, thatês enough."
Penny,"No, I really want to know what happens, and Bernadette really, really, really wants to know what happens."
Amy,Youêre just making fun of me.
Bernadette,I was just kidding. Iêm sorry. And the storyês really good.
Penny,"No, it is. Does he stay? Do they kiss? Does she find out about Montana?"
Amy,"Fine. As Cooper prepared to depart, tears filled Ameliaês eyes. He took her hand in his and said, _I canêt stay, but I will never forget you.î He brushed his fingers against her cheek, then quickly stepped into the machine. _Please donêt go,î she whispered. But it was too late. The engine hummed to life."
Bernadette,But they didnêt even kiss.
Amy,"She turned away, wiping her eyes. She couldnêt bear to watch her one chance at true love disappear forever. Then she felt a strong hand on her shoulder spin her around. It was Cooper."
Amy,"_What about the future?î asked Amelia. He looked deeply into her eyes and whispered, _There is no future without you.î He pulled her in close. She began to tremble all over. She felt his warm breathÑ"
Leonard,You will not believe what Stephen Hawking just said.
Penny,Get out!
Bernadette,Not now!
Leonard,Youêre right. This is even weirder than I thought.
Penny,You want me to stop reading?
Leonard,"Are you kidding? No, no."
Penny,As he stood for Amelia to dry himÑ
Leonard,"Yeah, okay, Iêm good."
Sheldon,"Iêve invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?"
Sheldon,How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
Amy,How many?
Sheldon,Who cares? He stole the idea and doesnêt deserve his own joke.
Amy,Is that really true?
Sheldon,"Of course, thatês how you know itês a good joke. It not only entertains, it informs."
Sheldon,"Uh, Barry, uh, how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?"
Sheldon,"What do you want, Barry?"
Amy,Whatês this for?
Amy,"Well, thatês fascinating. I canêt wait to read it."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, me as well. Uh, please e-mail it to Sheldon at bazinga dot biz. Why dot biz? Because I just gave you the business. And also bazinga dot com was taken."
Sheldon,Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?
Amy,"Well, Iêd been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity, and I thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory, itês not a big deal."
Sheldon,"Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didnêt you try to help me?"
Amy,"I did. You said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs."
Sheldon,"Thatês pretty funny, that does sound like me. But that doesnêt mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along."
Amy,"Sheldon, weêre all scientists. I helped out a fellow colleague. Youêre being petty."
Sheldon,"Iêm being petty? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him, he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends, he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant. Why are you laughing? Did you learn something?"
Howard,"Okay, Ma. Say hi to Aunt Gladys. Yeah, I love you, too. Bye."
Bernadette,Your mom having fun in Florida?
Howard,"Mmm, she loves it. She finally found a place where everyone talks about how sweaty they are. Anyway, she wants us to go to the house and check in on Stuart because he might be lonely."
Bernadette,Sheês just being nice.
Howard,"Well, Iêm her son, how come she doesnêt send someone to check on me if Iêm lonely?"
Bernadette,Because you have a wife.
Howard,"Yeah, well, sometimes you work late."
Bernadette,"I know you donêt like Stuart being in the house, but the storeês about to reopen, Iêm sure heêll get back on his feet."
Howard,That would be great. Iêd love for things between me and Mom to get back to normal.
Bernadette,"Well, normalês a strong word, but sure."
Penny,You okay?
Sheldon,"If I was okay, I wouldêve said hello, and not the much more ominous hello."
Penny,Whatês going on?
Sheldon,Iêm mad at Amy.
Penny,"Did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top, too?"
Sheldon,She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.
Penny,"Oh, that sounds like a good thing."
Sheldon,"Well, it would be, except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival, no less. Iêm sorry you had to see that."
Penny,Iêm sorry I didnêt have a camera.
Sheldon,Why would she do this to me?
Penny,"Well, Iêm sure she didnêt upset you on purpose. Besides, arenêt you the one who says thereês nothing more important than the advancement of science?"
Sheldon,"No, I said thereês nothing more important than me advancing science."
Penny,"All right, well, if Iêm understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, Iêm thinking you might have to let this one go."
Sheldon,"Ugh, let it go. I have heard that my whole life. Every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like itês my fault, and itês not okay to feel the way I feel."
Penny,"I donêt know what to tell you. I mean, why donêt you talk to her?"
Sheldon,"Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? Gee, Penny, lifeês giving me lemons. What should I do?"
Penny,"Well, you could shove them somewhere."
Sheldon,"Okay, now youêre getting creative."
Leonard,No problem.
Raj,Our pleasure.
Leonard,The place really looks great.
Raj,"Yeah, you should have burned it down years ago."
Leonard,"We know, we know, because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime."
Bernadette,"Stuart, this place looks amazing."
Howard,You really did a nice job.
Howard,"I appreciate that, and Iêm glad you were able toÑ is that my motherês furniture?"
Howard,Not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.
Howard,Why donêt you just clean out the whole room? Take the string art clown I made her in third grade and the ribbon I got in swim class for putting my face in the water.
Howard,"Well, Iêm her son, and I say itês not okay."
Howard,"Well, maybe I shouldêve gone to a fancy art school like you. Then I could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guyês mother."
Bernadette,Why donêt we leave so you can cool off?
Howard,Your store? My mother gave you the money to reopen. Iêm not going anywhere.
Leonard,Why donêt we go get the food for the party.
Raj,"Smart, looks like weêre being helpful."
Leonard,"Mmm, when really weêre just exiting an uncomfortable situation."
Sheldon,"Kripke, you know, of all the people, Barry Kripke. Iêm soÑ Are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you?"
Sheldon,"Oh, give me that. Just out of curiosity, if I were to let something go, how would I do that?"
Penny,"I donêt know, just think about something else."
Sheldon,Can I think about the spiny anteater?
Sheldon,The spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke. That didnêt help at all.
Penny,"You know, some people try visualization."
Sheldon,How does that work?
Penny,"Okay, imagine your problems are a pen."
Penny,Now imagine youêre holding that pen.
Penny,Now open your hand and let it go.
Sheldon,But I just got this pen. Itês got my initials on it and everything. Look.
Penny,"Sheldon, this isnêt that hard."
Sheldon,I may have a better way that you can teach me.
Sheldon,What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?
Penny,She didnêt give me any puzzles.
Sheldon,Are you sure?
Amy,"Boy, I just canêt seem to get these scissors back together. Can you do it?"
Amy,"Darn it. Thereês something in my eye, and I need to sort these coins by size. Can you help?"
Amy,"Penny? I really want to eat this banana, but itês stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box."
Penny,Son of a bitch.
Sheldon,"Okay, thatês great. Now, let it go."
Penny,I canêt believe you were testing me against a chimp.
Sheldon,"Well, excuse me, Amy was testing you. I was rooting for you. Good job on that banana box, by the way."
Penny,Why would she even do this?
Sheldon,"Sheês been conducting an experiment on apes where theyêre given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldnêt be able to solve them. Thatês when Amy said, want to make this interesting?"
Penny,Make this interesting? You bet money on me?
Sheldon,"No, no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now, isnêt that interesting?"
Penny,Itês not interesting. Itês incredibly insulting.
Sheldon,"Okay, maybe this will help. Imagine youêre holding a pen. Before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, thatêll make the next part really hard."
Penny,"Oh, my, thatês it. Get out."
Sheldon,"I donêt understand why youêre mad at me. You should be mad at Amy. Like I was this afternoon. Hey, look at that, I let it go."
Penny,Get out.
Sheldon,I think I left my pen in there.
Bernadette,"I understand why youêre upset, but he worked really hard to get the store ready. And itês just furniture."
Howard,"Itês my momês furniture. It belongs in the house I grew up in, next to that pile of TV Guides and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old, was a quality piece of string art."
Bernadette,"Howie, if the store succeeds, Stuart has a source of income, and he can move out of your motherês house. Seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that."
Howard,That is a good point. But I didnêt marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous Iêm being.
Bernadette,This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows.
Leonard,"Hi, weêre here to pick up an order for Comic Center."
Raj,"Dude, I, I think thatês Nathan Fillion."
Leonard,"Oh yeah, look at that."
Raj,"And heês picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh, I have got an idea."
Leonard,Weêre not selling his tomatoes on eBay.
Raj,"No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuartês store, that would be amazing."
Leonard,That would be great.
Raj,So should we go talk to him?
Leonard,"I donêt know. I mean, if heês not nice, itês gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again."
Raj,"The, the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk. We still watch Game of Thrones."
Leonard,He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.
Raj,"I was distracted. Itês weird seeing a member of the Nightês Watch with a kayak strapped to his car. Come on. Hi, excuse me, s, sorry, I, I donêt mean to bother you, but weêre just really big fans of Firefly. And Dr. Horrible."
Raj,"Donêt say that. I mean, youêre not Dame Judi Dench, but youêre pretty great."
Leonard,Come on. Sorry to bother you.
Raj,"Donêt know why heês so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once, and Iêm still floating."
Amy,"Sheldon, itês me."
Penny,"Oh, hey. Did you see that? I, I figured out how to open the door all by myself. Maybe Iêll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate."
Amy,What are you talking about?
Penny,I know youêve been giving me secret puzzle tests.
Amy,"Sheldon, open the door."
Sheldon,I canêt. Iêm naked.
Amy,I just saw you.
Sheldon,Hang on.
Penny,Open the door now.
Amy,"Oh, hey."
Penny,Pull up your pants.
Amy,"Itês not a big deal. I run tests like this on undergrads all the time. If you fill out some paperwork at the university, I can get you five dollars."
Penny,I donêt want five dollars. I want my dignity.
Amy,"So what are we talking, like, ten bucks?"
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,Sorry again.
Raj,"Are you sure youêre not him? Uh, you can tell us. Weêre scientists, not crazy fanboys."
Raj,"And youêre eating alone at a deli. I donêt buy it, youêre not him."
Leonard,That would be great.
Leonard,"Yeah, thank you."
Raj,"Wait, hang on. If youêre really Nathan Fillion, whatês the line from Firefly about your bonnet?"
Leonard,"Thatês it, thatês the line."
Raj,"Although, I knew the line, doesnêt make me Nathan Fillion."
Raj,I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.
Leonard,What do you think?
Raj,"Ah, itês good enough for Facebook."
Leonard,I canêt believe they did that.
Penny,"I know, itês so insulting. At one point, they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box."
Leonard,"Wait, Sheldon gave me a banana in a box. He was testing me, too."
Leonard,And how could a chimp even solve that? That was impossible.
Penny,Really? You couldnêt get it out?
Sheldon,Thank you.
Amy,"Wow, the store looks great."
Leonard,So you guys were testing us both? What is the matter with you?
Penny,"Eh, whatês the matter with them is they think theyêre so smart they donêt care if they hurt other peopleês feelings."
Amy,Thatês not true.
Sheldon,That sounds like us. I still donêt understand why youêre upset. You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.
Amy,"Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall."
Howard,"Iêm sorry, but itês making me crazy."
Bernadette,Can you please just let it go?
Sheldon,"Oh, I can help you with that. Imagine youêre holding an ordinary pen. While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket."
Howard,Hold that thought.  Hello?
Amy,How can I make this up to you?
Penny,The answerês in this puzzle box. Letês see if you can open it.
Raj,Thatês what I said when we moved it.
Bernadette,You helped him?
Raj,"No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own."
Leonard,"Hey, you okay?"
Leonard,Whatês wrong?
Howard,My mom died.
Howard,"Uh, that was my aunt. Ma took a nap. She never woke up."
Bernadette,"Oh, my God, Howie."
Leonard,Iêm so sorry.
Raj,What can we do?
Howard,I donêt know.
Sheldon,May I say something?
Leonard,"Not right now, Sheldon."
Sheldon,But I think it would be comforting.
Howard,"No, itês okay. What?"
Sheldon,"When I lost my own father, I didnêt have any friends to help me through it. You do."
Penny,I really thought he was gonna say let it go.
Raj,"Okay, thanks, Bernadette. Travel safe. Okay, bye. Well, theyêve booked a flight. Theyêre heading to the airport now."
Penny,Howês Howard holding up?
Raj,Heês hanging in there.
Leonard,"How are you doing, Stuart?"
Amy,One of us would have taken you in.
Raj,"Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special. When I first moved to America, Howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. Which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought I was the gardener."
Penny,"Whenever I saw her, sheêd say I was too skinny and try and feed me."
Amy,"She did that to me, too."
Penny,Donêt take this away from me.
Sheldon,"I didnêt care for her yelling. But now that Iêm not going to hear it again, Iêm sad."
Leonard,"If you want, I can yell at you later."
Sheldon,It wonêt be as good.
Leonard,Letês have a toast. To Mrs. Wolowitz. A loving mother to all of us. Weêll miss you.
Amy,I just read about an experiment designed to see if you could make two people fall in love in a matter of hours.
Leonard,That doesnêt sound right. My research has shown that it takes three to five years of shameless begging.
Penny,"Honey, neither of us comes off good in that story."
Raj,"Yeah, I, I, I saw that article youêre talking about. Uh, the participants ask each other a series of questions designed to promote intimacy."
Amy,And then they finish it off by staring into each otherês eyes for four minutes.
Sheldon,"Oh, thatês nonsense. I proclaimed my love for you. And the last time I looked into your eyes was when you thought you had conjunctivitis."
Amy,"Other than the fact that I had it, that was a magical night."
Penny,"Raj, would you ever try an experiment like that with Emily?"
Raj,I donêt need science to win her heart. I have my familyês wealth for that.
Leonard,"Iêm telling you, you canêt create love in a few hours. Right?"
Penny,"Oh, careful. Youêre poking at the whole foundation of The Bachelor."
Sheldon,"Yeah, but we donêt have to debate this. Weêre scientists. We can conduct our own research. I propose that we imprison two street people andÑ"
Sheldon,You didnêt even let me finish.
Amy,Forget it.
Sheldon,"So, you can experiment on all the apes you want. But I want to manipulate the emotions of two captive human beings, suddenly Iêm the monster."
Raj,Why donêt you just do the test?
Sheldon,"In the interest of science, Iêd be willing to."
Penny,Youêre okay with an experiment where you have to answer awkward questions about your innermost feelings?
Penny,"Please, can I do it with him? Please?"
Leonard,"Iêve been listening to Sheldonês feelings on things for ten years. Tag, youêre it."
Raj,"Yeah, but what if the experiment works?"
Penny,Iêm not gonna fall in love with Sheldon.
Amy,"Thatês what I said. Before I knew it, he pontificated his way right into my heart."
Sheldon,"Uh, fun fact, pontificate comes from the Latin word pontifex, which means bridge builder or Pope."
Leonard,In love yet?
Sheldon,"Just out of curiosity, Penny, if this experiment does make us fall in love, would you drive me to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin for Gary Con? Itês the only convention celebrating the life and work of Gary Gygax, the co-creator of Dungeons and Dragons."
Penny,"You know what? I can honestly say if we fall in love, not only will I drive you there, I will buy you all the dragon T-shirts you want."
Sheldon,"Okay, babe, letês do this."
Raj,"You guys are really being calm about Penny and Sheldon doing this thing. If it were me Iêd, Iêd be a little nervous."
Raj,"Well, even if the studyês nonsense, I donêt believe in tempting fate. Same reason I wouldnêt use a Ouija board, or pick a fight with an Asian guy. He probably doesnêt know karate, but why risk it?"
Amy,I think weêre safe.
Raj,"Well, thatês what the bullies at Bruce Leeês high school thought. And then, bam. Karate."
Leonard,"Well, are we just gonna sit here while they do the experiment?"
Amy,The two of us could do it.
Leonard,"Yeah, sure, that might be fun."
Amy,Whatês the first question?
Raj,"Hang on. Okay. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?"
Leonard,Hmm. I can honestly say Penny.
Amy,"Oh, then I choose a janitor, êcause Iêm about to throw up."
Leonard,Iêm in love. Letês do something else.
Raj,"Ooh, uh, Emily gets off work soon. Why donêt the four of us go out?"
Amy,Sounds good.
Leonard,Should we call Howard and Bernadette?
Raj,"I donêt know what time their plane gets in, but let me, let me shoot them a text."
Amy,Did he say anything about the funeral?
Raj,"Not much, but he seemed to be in a pretty good place."
Howard,Are you kidding me? You lost my motherês ashes?
Howard,"All right, fine. Where did you misroute the only woman who ever loved me? The first, well,"
Bernadette,Eight sixteen.
Howard,I really did mean first.
Bernadette,Just drop it.
Bernadette,"Um, well, itês, uh, black. Thereês a red ribbon tied to the handle."
Howard,The worldês greatest mom is in the shoe compartment.
Sheldon,You ready to begin?
Penny,Yup. Be right there. I assume you donêt want wine.
Sheldon,Correct. Youêre not supposed to drink alcohol when operating heavy machinery.
Penny,What heavy machinery? Letês just start.
Sheldon,"Well, as a Texas gentleman, Iêm inclined to say ladies first. Although, Iêm concerned that level of politeness and charm might make you fall in love with me before the test even begins. Perhaps we should flip a coin. Or if youêre familiar with the rules of Rock, Paper, ScissorsÑ"
Penny,"Question one. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest?"
Sheldon,Hmm. Living or dead?
Penny,Just says anyone in the world. I guess that means living.
Sheldon,"Ah, thatês just as well. As much as Iêd love to meet Euclid, inventor of the geometric proof, he probably wore sandals and I cannot look at toes during dinner. Oh, I know, the person Iêd most like to have dinner with is myself."
Penny,You sure thatês your choice? ‚Cause Iêve had that dinner.
Sheldon,"Well, I havenêt. And while they say never meet your heroes, I just donêt see how I could disappoint. Who would you choose?"
Penny,"Robert Downey, Jr."
Sheldon,"Oh, I didnêt think of Iron Man. You know, maybe after myself and I have dinner, we can meet you two for dessert."
Raj,"So, what do you guys want to do?"
Amy,"Well, weêre the ones tagging along, you pick."
Leonard,Whatês that?
Raj,"Oh, so kind of like whatês happening with Penny right now."
Sheldon,What would constitute a perfect day for you?
Penny,"Uh, well, Iêd probably sleep in, do a little yoga, then lie on the beach while cute cabana boys brought me drinks and probably get a massage and then cap off the night with some dancing."
Sheldon,Thatês it?
Penny,"Yeah, why?"
Sheldon,You didnêt mention Leonard.
Penny,Heês there.
Sheldon,"I donêt think so. Leonard canêt stand yoga, the beach, massages or dancing."
Penny,"Yeah, well, he brought a book, okay? Whatês yours?"
Sheldon,"Uh, I wake up. Uh, I enjoy some French toast with butter and syrup. Uh, then a wormhole opens, and whisks me millions of years into the future where my towering intellect is used to save the last remnants of mankind from a predatory alien race."
Penny,"Interesting, you didnêt mention Amy."
Sheldon,Who do you think made the French toast with butter and syrup?
Leonard,This is cool.
Amy,"So, how do we start?"
Raj,"Uh, wasnêt there supposed to be a zombie?"
Raj,"Ooh. Okay, letês hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear."
Bernadette,"So, where is it?"
Howard,"So, some stranger has my mom? Is that what youêre telling me? My poor mother can be anywhere in Los Angeles right now?"
Howard,"Oh, okay, great. So, your entire job is to find lost luggage, and youêve narrowed down the location of my mother to the planet Earth."
Sheldon,"If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be?"
Penny,"Well, not to steal from the Bible, but turning water into wine sounds pretty good."
Sheldon,I donêt think youêre taking this seriously.
Penny,"Come on, Iêm just having some fun with you."
Sheldon,I believe what youêre doing is using humour to avoid vulnerability.
Penny,"Fine. Honestly, if I could have one quality, I wish I could be as smart as you guys."
Sheldon,Ha. Keep dreaming.
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry. That was me having fun with you. Look, you may not be as, as academically inclined as are we. Yes, thatês how you say it. But, you possess an intelligence I envy. Which leads me to my answer. I would choose the ability to read peopleês minds."
Penny,"Well, I canêt read peopleês minds. Actually, thatês not true, I can read menês minds, but only êcause itês usually the one thing."
Sheldon,When are we going to get robot eyes?
Penny,Youêre all alike.
Sheldon,"Well, what I meant was I often misinterpret how others are feeling. Like, I canêt always tell if someone is only joking or laughing at me. You know, like, uh, if theyêre mad at something Iêve done or just in a bad mood. It, itês incredibly stressful."
Penny,Really? You always seem so confident.
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm not. And if I could read peopleês minds, life would be so much simpler."
Penny,"Well, now I wish I had the ability to make that stuff easier for you."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Penny,"Wow, I just felt this wave of affection for you."
Sheldon,You sure itês not too much Bible juice?
Penny,And the wave is gone.
Amy,"Keep it down, weêre working here."
Raj,"Okay, weêve got the cipher decoded."
Amy,We used the coordinates to locate the cities.
Leonard,Iêm putting the city names in the grid now. Iêm sure thatêll give us the code to the safe.
Leonard,Yup. Got the code.
Bernadette,"Sure you donêt want to go home? When the bagês returned, theyêll deliver it to us."
Howard,"No, Iêm not leaving without her."
Bernadette,"All right, weêll wait."
Howard,I couldêve driven her.
Howard,The day she left for Florida. She asked me to drive her to the airport. I was too busy. And I made her take a cab. I was too busy.
Bernadette,Thereês no way you couldêve known. Be right back. Excuse me?
Bernadette,"You better find my husbandês mother êcause one way or another, w eêre walking out of this airport with a dead woman."
Leonard,Which book are we looking for?
Raj,"Uh, Origin of Species."
Leonard,Here it is. Thereês a black light.
Raj,"Oh, okay. Uh, brothers and sisters I have none, but this manês father is my fatherês son. Who am I looking at? Yeah, yeah, we get it, you want brains. Calm down."
Amy,"Well, if I donêt have a brother, my fatherês son is me. And if Iêm this manês father, then heês my son. The answerês son."
Leonard,I bet the keyês behind it.
Amy,"So, thatês the key to the door? Thatês it?"
Leonard,We spent two hundred dollars on six minutes of fun?
Raj,"Itês like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter, and it just flew away."
Amy,"Well, to be fair, we do all have advanced degrees."
Penny,"If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone?"
Sheldon,"So, it would be today? Huh. Well, I suppose thereês something satisfying about dying on my birthday."
Penny,Todayês your birthday?
Penny,"Well, thatês always been a secret. Not even Amy knows."
Sheldon,"Well, I donêt enjoy presents. And the thought of people jumping out and yelling surprise fills me with more dread than the words George Lucas Directorês Cut."
Penny,"So, why did you finally tell me?"
Sheldon,The point of the experiment is to be completely honest with each other.
Penny,"Well, thank you for sharing it with me. I wonêt tell anyone."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Penny,That is so funny. I never would have pegged you for a Pisces.
Sheldon,Youêre making it difficult to love you right now.
Howard,"Oh, thank God. Itês okay, sheês here. Maês here."
Bernadette,"Okay, thank you so much."
Howard,Ma? Iêm sorry I didnêt take you to the airport. I just want you to know that Iêll never forgive myself for being so selfish. And I promise to keep you close for the rest of my life.
Bernadette,"Oh, no. That thingês gonna end up in my bedroom."
Sheldon,Thatês it. Weêre done with the questions.
Penny,All thatês left to do is stare into each otherês eyes for four minutes without talking.
Sheldon,"Okay. Wait, hang on. Bladder check. Weêre good to go."
Penny,You ready?
Penny,And begin. This is kind of creepy.
Sheldon,Weêre not supposed to talk during this part.
Sheldon,This is kind of creepy.
Penny,Do you want to stop? I know you have trouble with eye contact.
Sheldon,"Well, you have a brown fleck in your right iris that looks like a Formula One race car. So Iêm just concentrating on that. Plus, itês easier around people that Iêm comfortable with."
Penny,"Aw, sweetie, Iêm comfortable around you, too."
Sheldon,"Of course you are, Iêm warm and soothing. Iêm like a human bowl of tomato soup."
Penny,I meant more like a little brother.
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, I suppose I do think of you as a sister. And sometimes, a mother."
Penny,Itês getting creepy again.
Penny,Just thinking about the day I met you and Leonard.
Sheldon,It was a Monday afternoon. You joined us for Indian food.
Penny,Can you believe itês been eight years?
Sheldon,"Yeah, and youêre still eating our food."
Penny,I canêt remember a time you guys werenêt in my life.
Sheldon,"I remember it perfectly. But I have an eidetic memory. If youêre interested, I also remember how much you owe us for the food."
Penny,Thatês it. That wasnêt so bad.
Sheldon,"No, it wasnêt. Uh, now letês tabulate the results of the experiment. I think itês safe to say that youêre not in love with me and Iêm not in love with you. And psychology has once again proved itself the doofus of the sciences."
Penny,"Well, maybe. But Iêm still glad we did it. I do feel closer to you."
Sheldon,"And I, you. And yes, thatês how you say that. Yeah, so, given our newfound intimacy, Iêd say we have some hard choices to make."
Penny,Like what?
Sheldon,"Gary Con, do we fly or drive? Do we wear costumes? And if so, who gets to be Gary?"
Sheldon,Thank you for walking me home.
Penny,I just want to make sure you get there safe.
Sheldon,"Well, this is me. Itês been a very interesting evening."
Penny,It really has.
Sheldon,Aah! And after I let you be Gary.
Leonard,"I was unstoppable. I mean, I was, I was on fire. It was like my mind and my body were totally connected, like, like athletes must feel when theyêre in the zone."
Penny,"Again, it was miniature golf."
Leonard,"Admit it, youêre a little turned on."
Penny,You canêt be this proud.
Leonard,Why not?
Penny,Because I beat you.
Sheldon,"Oh, good. Youêre back."
Amy,We have some exciting news.
Sheldon,"As you know, Amy and I have been together a long time, and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible."
Amy,"After a careful evaluation of our relationship, we decided that the time was right to take a step forward."
Sheldon,Do you want to say it?
Amy,Letês say it together.
Penny,This is why Iêve been saying we should keep champagne on ice.
Sheldon,"Okay. That was tricky, êcause when it comes to alcohol, she generally means business."
Leonard,"Well, weêre, weêre very happy for you."
Amy,Thank you. Acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us.
Sheldon,"Itês true. It means that we care so much about each other, thereês enough left over for an eight-ounce reptile."
Leonard,Why a turtle?
Sheldon,"After much deliberation, weêve determined that a turtle is the ideal pet. They donêt shed fur, they donêt make noise."
Amy,"For Halloween, we can dress him as a cobblestone."
Sheldon,"Yeah. And if he ever goes berserk, I know I can outrun him. Coincidentally, thatês also why I chose you as a roommate."
Leonard,"Well, congratulations. Who wouldêve thought you two would be the first in our group to start a family?"
Amy,Thatês what I said.
Raj,"So, whereês your roommate tonight?"
Raj,"But remember our agreement? You can joke about murdering people, but you have to say just kidding."
Raj,Thatês okay. I can come back later.
Raj,"Okay, cool. Oh, and youêre sure your roommateês not gonna come back while Iêm here alone, right? ‚Cause thatêll be awkward."
Raj,"Oh, good."
Sheldon,"Oh, dear Lord. Oh, dear Lord."
Amy,Itês okay. You made it. Weêre fine.
Sheldon,That was a lot of puppies.
Amy,"Letês forget about them, and pick ourselves out a nice turtle. Oh, how about this one up on the log?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I donêt know. He kind of looks like a jerk. How about this one?"
Amy,"Well, heês barely moving. He looks half dead."
Sheldon,"I know. I like him, too. Hi, little guy. Howêd you like to come home with us? Youêll be living with me because we donêt live in the same house."
Amy,"But thatês not your fault. Like you, weêre taking it ridiculously slow. Youêll stay with me when heês at Comic-Con or away for work."
Sheldon,Or if they accept Daddyês application to live on Mars.
Amy,What are you talking about?
Sheldon,"Oh, thereês this company thatês attempting to establish a colony on Mars, and I applied to be among the first to go. What should we name him? You know, I came in thinking Seth, but he kind of looks Italian."
Amy,"You applied for a mission to be a colonist on another planet, and couldnêt be bothered to tell me?"
Sheldon,Would you have approved?
Amy,Of course not.
Sheldon,"Well, based on your reaction, it looks like I made the right choice. Isnêt that right, Giuseppe?"
Leonard,"Hey, hey. Listen, I, I have a little confession to make."
Penny,"Aw, is this your first time?"
Leonard,"No, I got you something for Valentineês Day, and I was too embarrassed to give it to you."
Penny,"Well, why?"
Leonard,"Well, êcause I got it at the dirty store."
Penny,You went to the dirty store without me?
Leonard,In sunglasses and a hat after I parked two blocks away.
Penny,"Well, get it. Get it for me."
Leonard,"Okay, uh, well, I hope itês fun. I mean, it, it comes with paints, and, and itês kind of creative and artistic."
Penny,"Okay, did you go to the dirty store or Michaels?"
Leonard,"No, no. We cover ourselves in body paint, and then, then we get on this big canvas and do our thing."
Penny,"Whoa, thatês kind of a big step for a guy who only recently agreed to take his socks off."
Leonard,Youêre making fun of me. Forget it.
Penny,"No, come on, I want to do it."
Penny,"Yeah, letês you, me, and your very, very pale feet make some art. Hey, when you got back to this store, I want to go with you."
Leonard,"Okay, but itês a drive, the one I went to is in San Diego."
Howard,How are the taxes going?
Bernadette,Okay. But you got a lot of receipts for the Lego store in here.
Howard,Those are business expenses. You can write those off.
Bernadette,A two hundred dollar R2-D2 is a business expense?
Howard,"Oh, Bernie, youêre gonna have to sound a lot more confident when we get audited.  Hey, whatês up?"
Raj,"Oh, Emily ran back to the hospital, so Iêm just hanging out at her place. What are you, uh, what are you doing?"
Howard,Just playing video games while Bernie does the taxes.
Raj,"What are you, a little kid? Is she gonna cut your dinner into little pieces, too?"
Howard,"She doesnêt have to, I filled up on jelly beans."
Raj,"So, uh, what game are youÑ Oh. Crap."
Howard,Whatês wrong?
Raj,I canêt get Emilyês night-stand to close.
Raj,Sheês gonna know I was looking in it.
Howard,Why were you looking in it?
Raj,"Well, thereês a question I better have a good answer to before she gets back."
Howard,"Okay, calm down. Thereês probably something jammed behind it. Just, uh, pull it out and see whatês there."
Raj,"Hang on. Oh no. Oh, no. Oh, God, no."
Howard,"You know what, you sound busy, Iêm gonna let you go."
Raj,"Dude, the whole front came off. Now sheês gonna know I was snooping."
Bernadette,Whatês happening?
Howard,Raj was snooping through Emilyês drawers and broke one.
Bernadette,Aw. Iêm gonna miss her.
Penny,So what do you think?
Leonard,"I thought itêd be a little more, just more."
Penny,"Iêm not even sure why we were out of breath. Uh, I mean, did we move at all?"
Leonard,"Maybe along the z-axis, but x and y are looking pretty sad."
Penny,"Okay, come on. We are not old boring people. We can do better than this."
Leonard,"Uh, Th, thatês true. How late did we stay up last night?"
Penny,Almost 1am.
Leonard,"Damn straight, almost 1am. And we werenêt even watching TV. We were watching Netflix, like the kids do."
Penny,"Yeah, is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Nobody knows. Now, come on. We are gonna do this."
Leonard,"Yeah. You get the paint, Iêll rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and then we do this."
Sheldon,I canêt believe you almost had me bring a wild animal into my home.
Amy,No one told you to poke the turtleês face.
Sheldon,I was playing Got Your Nose. Thatês how you get children to like you.
Amy,"Iêm surprised you even care if he likes you, since youêre planning on leaving the planet the first chance you get."
Sheldon,"Ugh, this again. Amy, Iêve already had one new hole torn in my body today. I donêt need another one."
Amy,"Sheldon, I know the odds of you even going to Mars are incredibly small, but it still hurts that you would volunteer for something that would take you away from me forever."
Sheldon,So youêre saying you wouldnêt leave me for the chance to be one of the first humans to colonize another planet?
Amy,I would at least mention it before filling out the application.
Sheldon,"Huh, thatês exactly what Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Bernadette and Penny said."
Amy,"And who says you could even survive an interplanetary mission, anyway? You could barely survive a tiny turtle bite."
Sheldon,"First of all, this has only made me stronger. But beyond that, all I did was fill out an application."
Amy,"You know what? Go to Mars, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Is there anything I can do to cheer you up?
Amy,Forget it.
Sheldon,What if I play the Star Trek theme on my nose?
Amy,Please donêt.
Sheldon,"Yep, youêre mad."
Howard,"Okay, let me see the damage."
Raj,Hang on.
Howard,"Well, I think you broke the dowels. Youêre not gonna have time to glue it back on, youêll have to nail it."
Raj,With what?
Howard,Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?
Raj,She does.
Howard,Great. Neither of those. Try a hammer.
Raj,Did that feel good? You feel like a big man now?
Sheldon,"I was going to make you red zinger, but since Mars is the red planet, I went with peppermint."
Amy,Why do you even want to do this?
Sheldon,"Actually, as part of the application, I was required to make a short video answering that very question. You want to see it?"
Amy,Canêt you just tell me?
Sheldon,But I made a video.
Sheldon,"Iêm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and Iêd like to tell you why I should be chosen to go to Mars. Iêm exceedingly smart. I graduated college at 14. While my brother was getting an STD I was getting a PhD. Penicillin canêt take this away. Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important and my hygiene is impeccable. In fact, animals donêt trust me because I smell like nothing. Literally nothing. During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale with my wacky sense of humour. Hey, Leonard, is there any peanut brittle left in that can?"
Leonard,You mean this weirdly suspicious one?
Sheldon,Yes. Open it and check.
Leonard,I donêt get it. Thereês actually peanut brittle inÑ Please go to Mars.
Sheldon,"But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars is that I believe, as a scientist, itês my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward. Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult. But life here on Earth is no picnic. Also, picnics are no picnic. Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground. In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime. To Mars."
Sheldon,"Afterwards, Leonard blew his nose, and pie came out."
Leonard,"Right there, right there, Oh, God, thatês it."
Penny,How did you get paint in your eye?
Leonard,Because you wouldnêt let me wear safety goggles.
Raj,"This looks terrible. She, sheês gonna know."
Howard,Itês fine. You just need two more nails.
Raj,"Okay, where should I put them?"
Howard,In Emilyês eyes.
Raj,Youêre not helping.
Bernadette,"Well, maybe this is what you get for snooping."
Raj,"You know, it, itês bad enough that I have to deal with thisÑ"
Raj,"Oh, no. Hey."
Raj,How was the hospital?
Raj,"Uh w, well, okay, look, I, I donêt want to lie to you. I got curious, I was looking around and I broke the drawer on your night stand."
Raj,Youêve never snooped around my apartment?
Raj,"Come on, think back. It would really help if you had."
Bernadette,She sounds really mad.
Howard,We should hang up.
Bernadette,"Yeah, we should."
Howard,"But weêre not going to, are we?"
Bernadette,Not a chance.
Howard,What happened to snooping is wrong?
Bernadette,"Howard, youêre going to jail for tax fraud. Who cares?"
Leonard,"Well, we did it."
Penny,We sure did.
Leonard,"I mean, I was on fire. I, I was in the zone, like an athlete."
Penny,"Sweetie, I beat you at this, too."
Leonard,"So, where do we want to hang it?"
Penny,Are you kidding? Weêre not hanging it.
Leonard,But itês an expression of our love.
Penny,And our butts. Not hanging it.
Leonard,Seems a shame to throw it away.
Penny,"Yeah. We could give it to Sheldon, and tell him William Shatner painted it."
Leonard,"God, I love you. I love you so much."
Amy,I think Iêm gonna go home.
Sheldon,Why? I really donêt understand whatês happening here.
Amy,"You know, Sheldon, at any other time, learning that you had plans to go live on Mars would be a slow news day. But a couple of hours ago, we were getting a turtle. And silly as it sounds, I thought that meant something."
Sheldon,"Amy. Oh, why didnêt I give her Sleepy Time tea? Amy, wait. Getting a turtle meant a great deal to me, too."
Amy,Sure. Unless something better comes along.
Sheldon,Do you want me to withdraw my application?
Amy,What I want is for us to be planning our future together.
Sheldon,"And in that future, are we on the same planet? Because Iêve seen people make the long-distance thing work."
Amy,Weêre on the same planet.
Sheldon,Okay. Does that planet have to be Earth?
Amy,Are you asking me to go to Mars with you?
Sheldon,"I am. Yeah, if Iêm going to a barren, lifeless environment where the chances of survival are slim to none, I want you there with me. Why donêt we go back to the apartment, and fill out your application?"
Amy,Okay. I suppose being the first people on a new planet would be incredibly exciting.
Sheldon,"Oh, I know. We could be the first to plant a flag on Mars. We could be the first to watch Mars Attacks! on Mars. We could be the first to say good lord, what on Mars are you talking about?"
Amy,"You know, we could also be the first people to procreate on Mars."
Sheldon,"You just canêt keep it in your space pants, can you?"
Amy,"Think about it. If we had a family there, our kids would be Martians."
Sheldon,"They would, wouldnêt they? We could give them cool Martian names. And we could teach them about Martian history. Like, who planted those flags? And, uh, where did that copy of Mars Attacks! come from?"
Amy,"I guess weêll have to make a new video together, as a couple."
Sheldon,"Good idea. And since youêve had such a rough day, Iêm gonna let you throw the pie in Leonardês face."
Raj,Thank you for forgiving me.
Raj,"Well, it almost happened when you called my apple pie crust doughy, but the truth is you were right, and I was just angry at myself."
Raj,Of course. What?
Raj,Just the drawer.
Raj,"I promise. Why, whatês in there?"
Sheldon,"Two one six four two zero one nine eight nine. And that, little lady, is pi to a thousand places."
Amy,"Iêd say Iêm sorry I asked, except I didnêt."
Sheldon,"Oh, look, itês the Scientific American that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote."
Amy,"Oh, let me see."
Sheldon,I have mixed feelings about doing interviews. I like the part where I talk. I do not like the part where the other man talks.
Amy,"Sheldon, this article doesnêt mention Leonard at all."
Sheldon,"Well, that canêt be right."
Amy,It only refers to Dr. Cooper and his team. Did you even talk about him?
Sheldon,All I did was answer a few questions about the theory. And then expressed my gratitude that Scientific American doesnêt include any of those smelly perfume cards.
Amy,Poor Leonard.
Sheldon,Why? The theory he came up with just got mentioned in Scientific American. He ought to be thrilled.
Amy,He might not be.
Sheldon,"Oh, maybe youêre right. He is kind of a lump."
Amy,Think about it. How would you feel if you were referred to as part of Leonardês team?
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêd be incensed."
Amy,So you see what Iêm getting at?
Sheldon,Squeaky wheel gets the grease?
Sheldon,Grass is always greener?
Amy,Try again.
Sheldon,"Well, I donêt know, weêre all Groot? Just tell me."
Amy,"Leonard is as much a part of this paper as you are, and he was overlooked. Heês going to feel bad."
Sheldon,But it wasnêt my fault. I didnêt exclude him. And I didnêt write the article.
Amy,Remember that time you didnêt get picked to pull the sword out of the stone at Disneyland and they let that other kid do it?
Sheldon,"Oh, that kid. Poor Leonard."
Sheldon,"For the record, that kid was a terrible choice. If you cry when you drop your churro, you do not have what it takes to rule England."
Howard,Thanks for helping us sort through all my momês stuff.
Raj,"Of course. I know what itês like having to go through a loved oneês possessions. My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna. But after he died, you know what we found? A statue of Shiva. It may not be Crips and Bloods, okay? But in India, itês a thing."
Bernadette,"Well, itêll be good that youêre there. Howardês been having trouble deciding what to keep and what to let go."
Howard,"Well, itês hard. A lot of Maês stuff brings back fond memories."
Bernadette,Is that why you couldnêt get rid of her drawer full of ketchup packets?
Howard,"Yes. It reminds me of us eating out and her saying quick, nobodyês looking, fill your pockets with ketchup."
Sheldon,Leonard? Have you ever noticed that only my name is on the cable bill?
Sheldon,"Good, good. And your name is on the electric bill and mine isnêt. And Iêm okay with that."
Leonard,"Actually, your name is on the electric bill."
Sheldon,"Oh, right. This is a disaster."
Leonard,I donêt even know what youêre talking about and I agree.
Sheldon,"Okay, I have to tell you something, but youêre not going to like it."
Leonard,Whatês going on?
Sheldon,An article was just published in Scientific American about our theory.
Leonard,Did they hate it?
Sheldon,"No, they loved it. They, uh, couldnêt say enough nice things about it."
Leonard,So whatês the problem?
Sheldon,You know how the PennySaver only has my nameÑ
Sheldon,They didnêt mention you in the article. Only me.
Sheldon,"I know. Itês not fair. Let the anger go, buddy. You just, you relax all your muscles. Except for your pubococcygeus and anal sphincter. Letês keep those tight."
Leonard,"Uh, that, thatês not necessary."
Sheldon,"It is. Theyêre what hold back the urine and the faeces. Look, maybe, maybe you shouldnêt read it. Itêll only make you feel worse."
Leonard,Cooper and his team?
Sheldon,You should know I had nothing to do with that.
Leonard,"Uh, at least theyêre talking about the theory. I mean, thatês whatês important."
Sheldon,"You know, youêre right. Yeah. You know, itês like when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man. Stan Lee may get all the credit, but Steve Ditko knows he was just as important. Even though Stan Lee gets to be in all the Marvel movies. And. and heês far richer. And heês a household name, you know? Whereas, you know, you say Ditko, and that sounds like a company that makes Dits."
Leonard,Thatês not helping.
Sheldon,"Well, Iêd give more examples, but, well, everyone in your positionês so forgettable."
Howard,"Stuart, weêre here."
Raj,Itês nice of you to let him keep staying at your momês house.
Howard,"Yeah, well, I tried putting him out on the curb, but nobody took him."
Bernadette,What happened?
Howard,"Wait, when did it go out?"
Howard,"Oh, my God."
Bernadette,"Howie, whatês wrong?"
Howard,Itês all defrosting.
Bernadette,Itês okay. Itês just food.
Howard,"Itês not just food. This is the last food my mother ever made. This is her last brisket. This is her last meatloaf. This is her last. I have no idea what this is, but itês the last one."
Raj,Everything okay?
Howard,All Maês food is gonna be ruined.
Bernadette,"Well, why donêt we take it home and put it in our freezer?"
Raj,"You donêt want to do that. Refreezing not only removes moisture, but it creates ice crystals in the fibres of the meat that can compromise its taste and texture. I saw a teachable moment. I dropped some culinary science."
Bernadette,What should we do?
Howard,Iêll tell you exactly what weêre gonna do. Weêre gonna eat it.
Bernadette,"Thereês, like, twenty pounds of food in there."
Howard,All you said was I had to get rid of things. You didnêt say they couldnêt pass through my colon first.
Howard,Okay. Then how about this? Letês invite everyone over to dinner. Itêll be like Maês feeding us one last time.
Bernadette,I love that.
Raj,"Me, too. Oh, look, weêve got enough ketchup to cover every ounce of it."
Penny,"I mean, who even reads Scientific American?"
Leonard,Itês kind of a big deal.
Penny,"If itês such a big deal, how come the biggest celebrity they could get for the cover is a molecule?"
Leonard,Can we please just stop talking about it?
Penny,Iêm sorry. What can I do?
Leonard,"Nothing, Iêm fine."
Penny,"No, no. Iêm gonna cheer you up. Here we go."
Leonard,What are we doing?
Penny,I am taking you shopping.
Penny,"My baby is sad, and Iêm gonna make him happy again."
Leonard,"Look, I know shopping cheers you up, but itês just not really my thing."
Penny,"Well, what about this helicopter you control with an iPad?"
Leonard,Does it have a camera in it?
Penny,It does have a camera in it.
Leonard,Babyês listening.
Sheldon, Leonard?
Sheldon,I spoke to the reporter at the magazine.
Leonard,What happened? Did you tell him it was my idea?
Sheldon,I did.
Leonard,Thank you. What did he say?
Sheldon,He said they made the editorial decision to only cite the lead scientist.
Leonard,Why did he think youêre the lead scientist? It was my idea.
Penny,"You know, for an extra four bucks, I can have this thing here tomorrow."
Sheldon,"Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said heês been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is êcause my name is on it."
Penny,You know what? I did it. Whatês four bucks?
Leonard,"If youêre trying to make me feel better, itês not working."
Sheldon,Well then what if I told you that I added your name to the cable bill?
Sheldon,"Oh. Thatês just as well. They had me on hold for 20 minutes and I hung up.  Leonard? Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner, so Iêm ready whenever you are."
Sheldon,All he had was an idea.
Amy,"Well, that is an important part."
Sheldon,"Oh, please. I have ideas all day long. Reverse SeaWorld where dolphins are allowed to pet people. A new clothing size between medium and large called Marge. Snow White retold from the point of view of Sneezy. Why wonêt Doc prescribe him something? We finally find out."
Amy,But Leonardês idea was good.
Sheldon,"Fine. Then Grumpy, whatês he so grumpy about? Maybe his girlfriend wonêt take his side."
Leonard,Iêm the one who thought of it.
Penny,"Well, didnêt he do a lot of the work?"
Leonard,Yeah. But now heês happy to let people think heês responsible for everything.
Penny,And thatês why you get an iPad helicopter.
Sheldon,Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation than he does?
Amy,Itês not your fault.
Sheldon,Is it my fault that my name came first on the paper alphabetically?
Amy,Not your fault.
Sheldon,Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me as the lead scientist I didnêt correct him?
Amy,"Hey, look at that pretty bird."
Leonard,He always needs all the attention. Heês such a baby.
Penny,"I know, I know."
Leonard,"I swear, he is never ever playing with my helicopter."
Raj,"Okay, Iêll start heating some of this stuff up."
Howard,"Oh, man. This is the boutonniere from my high school prom. A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah."
Bernadette,Did she throw anything away?
Howard,"If I find my foreskin, Iêm gonna kill myself."
Raj,"Okay, so weêve got, um, three briskets, four meatloafs, one lasagna."
Howard,"No, thatês noodle kugel."
Raj,"One Jewish lasagna, two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each, and one giant container of matzoh ball soup."
Howard,"Ma always kept it on hand, in case I got sick. She thought she could cure anything with her cooking. Even the time I got food poisoning. From her cooking."
Bernadette,You okay?
Howard,"Yeah, Iêm okay. Letês get started."
Raj,You got it.
Howard,Iêm never gonna talk to her again.
Bernadette,Should we tell everyone not to come?
Howard,I want to do this.
Bernadette,"Okay. Well, Iêll keep it together if you can."
Raj,Iêm not making any promises.
Leonard,Of course.
Penny,"Wow, it looks really pretty in here."
Leonard,"So, Stuart, have you thought about what youêd do if Howard sells the house?"
Sheldon,"Hi. Hello. Oh, and a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name."
Sheldon,"But you got it, right?"
Howard,"Hey, guys."
Howard,"I just want everyone to know, uh, tonightês not a sad occasion."
Bernadette,"Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that weêve all had here so many times before."
Howard,"Good food, good friends, and sometime around midnight, heartburn that makes you pray for death."
Amy,Do you need any help in the kitchen?
Bernadette,"No, we got it. You guys make yourselves comfortable."
Penny,"All right, hey, you two, weêre here for Howard right now, okay?"
Amy,"Yes, so please behave yourselves."
Sheldon,Of course.
Penny,This food is amazing.
Raj,"Mm, and not a vegetable in sight."
Howard,Thatês not true. Weêve got tomatoes right here.
Amy,All these bright people sitting around a table by candlelight. Feels like we could be an 18th century French salon.
Sheldon,"Indeed. Penny, a salon is a gathering where intellectuals entertained each other with sparkling conversations about issues of the day."
Penny,"Oh, so itês like The View."
Amy,"Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show hosted by women."
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm aware. It features Whoopi Goldberg. She played Guinan on Star Trek: Next Gen. Penny, Next Gen refers to Star TrekÑ"
Penny,Shut up.
Raj,I would like to propose a salon topic.
Amy,"Ooh, please do, Rajesh."
Raj,The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman. Marvel has made Tor a female.
Penny,"Wait, whoês Tor?"
Raj,"You know, Tor, the God of Tunder. As I was saying, is this a sign that our society is approaching gender equality?"
Howard,Certainly a lot more women are reading comic books now.
Amy,We wonêt know if thereês equality until female Thor has a baby and the Avengers are cool with her pumping breast milk at work.
Howard,I wonder if only a baby who is worthy can suckle at the bosom of Thor.
Penny,"Okay, new salon topic. Salons, dumb thing from a long time ago or interesting thing made dumb by talking about superheroes? Discuss."
Sheldon,I donêt believe it matters what the topic is. Whatês crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. Itês all about the execution.
Leonard,"Of course youêd focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic. Whatês more important, an idea or its execution?"
Bernadette,"Oh, thatês fine."
Sheldon,"Yeah, good for you, Leonard. Thatês a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, itês your uncle. He says you just got burned."
Leonard,"No, itês okay. Weêre all adults trying to have an intelligent discussion. At least I am. Howard, what do you think?"
Howard,"Well, I guess, as an engineer, I lean towards execution. I spend my days trying to take ideas and make them real."
Sheldon,"Well said, old chap. I thought eloquence had died, here it stands before us. Starting today, itêll go Gettysburg Address, I have a dream, and what he just said."
Leonard,"Oh, now heês a genius? All you ever do is make fun of him and engineering."
Sheldon,"Leonard, please. His mother just died."
Leonard,Youêre being ridiculous.
Sheldon,"Yeah, so are you."
Penny,"Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy, Iêd go to my real salon."
Sheldon,"Leonard, lots of people couldêve had that idea, but very few people couldêve worked out the math the way I did."
Leonard,"Lots of people also didnêt have that idea, like everyone in the entire world except for me."
Sheldon,"Oh, well, apparently Leonard thinks heês better than everyone in the whole world, including those fighting for our freedom. Yeah, well, I donêt know about you, but I support our boys overseas."
Amy,And girls.
Sheldon,"Hey, you already ruined Thor, give it a rest."
Leonard,So Iêm just supposed to be okay with you hogging all the credit?
Sheldon,I didnêt hog anything. Unlike you and that weird lasagna with raisins in it.
Leonard,You want some of this? Iêll give you some.
Bernadette,"Hey. Sheldon, Leonard, living room, right now!"
Sheldon,"She said my name first, that must kill you."
Bernadette,"I donêt know what you think youêre doing, but this is a very difficult time for my husband. Weêre eating the last food his mother ever made, and you were gonna throw it at each other like children? Whatever it is youêre fighting about, put it aside, go back in there and be a good friend to Howard or thereês no dessert for either of you. Look at me when Iêm talking to you. And donêt thinkÑ"
Howard,You guys ever notice sometimes Bernadette sounds like my mom?
Amy,I donêt hear it.
Raj,"No, not at all."
Penny,I donêt think Iêve eaten that much in my entire life.
Howard,Itês why my people wandered the desert for 40 years. Took that long to walk it off.
Sheldon,"You see, Penny, the Israelites were in the desertÑ"
Penny,Shut up.
Leonard,"Right now, Iêm just trying to burp without throwing up."
Sheldon,Hang on. Physics Today mentioned the paper.
Amy,Who cares? Did they mention Leonard?
Sheldon,They did.
Bernadette,"Good news, I found more Tums."
Sheldon,"Leonard, Iêve been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley."
Leonard,"Oh, I like to laugh. But say it anyway."
Sheldon,"Okay, um, what do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department? Iêll have fries with that. Because his education hasnêt prepared him for a career in the sciences."
Penny,"You know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than Sheldon."
Amy,Are you all set for your trip?
Sheldon,"Yeah, I think so. I just restocked the old PRK."
Leonard,Public restroom kit. Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places.
Sheldon,I donêt see whatês crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell.
Leonard,Keep going.
Sheldon,"And rubber gloves, uh, air freshener. Um, noise-cancelling headphones. Oh, danger whistle. Um, pepper spray. Ooh, a multi-language occupied sign. Uh, letês see, we have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes, a clothespin for my nose. Oh, and a mirror on a stick, so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isnêt some kind of weirdo."
Penny,You still worried some Berkeley girl is gonna steal him away?
Amy,"Yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle?"
Sheldon,Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called I Canêt Spy? Itês all the nail-biting tension of I Spy but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum.
Leonard,"If itês half as much fun as One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall, Iêm in."
Sheldon,"Iêll begin. Uh, I canêt spy with my little eye something passing right through us."
Leonard,That soy Frappuccino I had.
Sheldon,Will you please play the game? I canêt spy with my little eye something passing right through us.
Leonard,"I donêt know, um, if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second, given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimetres, that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?"
Sheldon,I donêt want to play anymore.
Leonard,We havenêt been on a road trip in a while. This is fun.
Sheldon,"We get it, you won the game. Stop bragging."
Leonard,"No, listen, we wrote a paper together. Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? Thatês pretty cool."
Sheldon,"I suppose it is. In fact, if youêd like to celebrate with a little music, Iêd be okay with that."
Leonard,This road trip just got crazy.
Sheldon,"Play that funky music, white boy."
Leonard,Iêm surprised you know that reference.
Sheldon,What reference?
Bernadette,"So, I put stickers on everything weêre gonna sell. We just need help taking it all out to the driveway."
Amy,Can I be in charge of pricing? Iêve been going to garage sales my whole life. Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel?
Howard,"All right, Amyês in charge of pricing and being 75."
Raj,"Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this?"
Penny,"Sure. Oh, we had one of these growing up. I used to play all the time."
Raj,"Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong."
Penny,"Oh, I meant beer pong."
Amy,"I had a table, too, but I didnêt have any friends, so all I did was serve."
Bernadette,"You know, you can leave one side up and play against it."
Amy,"And if I had a friend, they might have told me that."
Howard,Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? Itês my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house.
Bernadette,I think you just answered your own question.
Howard,"Come on, one day, this may double in value and be worth half what I paid for it."
Bernadette,"Sweetie, we have a lot to do. We donêt need to decide this right now."
Howard,"Well, I guess as long as youêre keeping an open mind."
Bernadette,Of course.
Sheldon,"So theyêre requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?"
Sheldon,And this music weêre listening to right now is funky as well?
Sheldon,Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?
Leonard,It could be.
Sheldon,"So itês like the musical equivalent of Russellês Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that donêt contain themselves as members contains itself?"
Sheldon,Well then I hate it. Music should just be fun.
Leonard,Making great time. Gonna be there pretty early.
Sheldon,Will our hotel room be ready?
Leonard,I doubt it.
Sheldon,Arenêt you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?
Leonard,"If we do, weêll just tell him to hit the bricks, see?"
Sheldon,"Seems a little confrontational, but all right. You know, we wonêt be very far from Skywalker Ranch."
Leonard,"Oh, thatês true. Itês not like we can get in there."
Sheldon,Why not?
Leonard,I donêt think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.
Sheldon,"Yodaês swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. Thatês code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in."
Leonard,"We do have time. I mean, we could drive by and just look at it."
Sheldon,"Yes. Oh, Iêm so excited. And I just canêt hide it."
Leonard,"Iêm about to lose control, and I think I like it."
Sheldon,What are you talking about?
Penny,So when do you guys think youêre gonna move in?
Howard,Weêre still figuring how much remodeling we want to do.
Bernadette,Itês tricky finding the right balance between tasteful modern and Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest.
Amy,Have you made a decision about the TARDIS? I think I can sell it if we call it Big British Porta-Potty.
Howard,"Weêre not selling it, itês mine."
Bernadette,You canêt just decide. How about I arm-wrestle you?
Howard,Thatês not fair. Itês like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest.
Raj,You could play Ping-Pong for it.
Howard,I would do that.
Bernadette,How is that fair? You grew up with a table.
Howard,"Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods."
Penny,"Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who Leonard has made me sit through, I will play on your behalf and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey, where I hate that I know it belongs."
Bernadette,"Yes, Penny plays for me."
Howard,"Thatês not fair, she has upper body muscles."
Raj,"Dude, three-time Sanskriti School for Well-Born Boys badminton champion."
Howard,"Thatês right, okay, Raj can play for me."
Amy,"Ooh, you just chose champions. Itês like weêre re-enacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat."
Penny,"Yeah, itês also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones."
Bernadette,"Leonard makes you watch that, too?"
Penny,"No, no, I like that show. Itês got dragons and people doing it."
Howard,So itês settled. The fate of Doctor Whoês TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers.
Amy,"If you still have that bra, Iêll give you a nickel for it."
Sheldon,There it is. Itês just a gate. On a road.
Leonard,Wasnêt even that hard to find.
Sheldon,This is so amazing.
Leonard,I know. You want to get a picture?
Sheldon,I want more than a picture. I want to go in.
Leonard,"Well, so do I, but theyêll never let us."
Sheldon,Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?
Leonard,"No, but I donêt have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me."
Sheldon,"Thereês a speaker box. Drive up, push the button, and letês see what happens."
Leonard,"Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? Iêm a little nervous."
Sheldon,"Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations."
Sheldon,"You pushed it, are you out of your mind?"
Leonard,"Um, uh, uh, uh, we donêt have an appointment, and, and we donêt belong here, but we, weêre, like, crazy-big fans. I mean uh, buh, buh, crazy for Star Wars crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really donêt want to look in."
Sheldon,Youêre blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him.
Leonard,And thatês how itês done.
Sheldon,"All right, weêve defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate."
Leonard,"Weêre trying to get past a security guard, not rescue Zelda."
Sheldon,"I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So whatês the plan?"
Leonard,"Uh, Iêm just gonna be honest with the guy."
Sheldon,Honesty will never get us in.
Leonard,"Well, whatês your plan?"
Sheldon,"All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurseês office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed."
Leonard,"Uh, Iêm just gonna tell you the truth."
Sheldon,"Oh, you are killing me."
Leonard,"We donêt have an appointment. We, weêre just fans of Mr. Lucasês work, and we thought weêd take a shot and see if we could get in and look around."
Sheldon,What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? A recording session I must attend.
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, donêt listen to him. Weêre actually physicists. Weêre giving a lecture at Berkeley later today. We just, we had some time to kill."
Leonard,Thank you so much. See? Maybe honesty is the bestÑ What are you doing?
Sheldon,"Shedding the yoke of my oppressors, you blind, sad little man."
Sheldon,"I can see the ranch, Leonard. Oh, itês rustic, itês lovely. Iêd take a picture, but people are chasing me. Iêm gonna make it. Iêm gonna make it. They have Tasers, but they wouldnêt dare useÑ Aaaaaaagh!"
Howard,"Come on, Raj. You are the King Kong of Ping-Pong. You are the menace of table tennis. Put her away, êcause I donêt have a third one. Yes. Woo."
Amy,"Rajesh eight, Penny four."
Penny,"Sorry, heês really good."
Bernadette,"Hey, Raj. if Howard canêt keep the TARDIS, how great would it look at your place?"
Howard,"Yeah, what?"
Bernadette,"I donêt know much about Doctor Who, but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back, it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the TARDIS, which is pretty cool êcause on the show, the inside of the TARDIS is bigger than the outside. But then again, I donêt know much about<i> Doctor Who."
Howard,"Donêt listen to her. You and I go way back, weêre like brothers."
Raj,"We are. We are. Oh, no. What a terrible serve. Sorry, brother."
Howard,"This is ridiculous. I want a new champion. Amy, were you serious about being able to serve?"
Amy,"Uh, it, itês been a long time. I donêt know. Iêm probably pretty rusty."
Howard,Sheês my champion.
Bernadette,"Well, if you can switch champions, so can I. I want Raj."
Bernadette,"Oh, come on, like you even care."
Penny,"I care. Oh, wait, no, I donêt. Good luck, Raj."
Howard,"You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you."
Raj,So did I.
Sheldon,Do you think theyêre gonna call the police?
Leonard,I donêt know. Maybe theyêll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star.
Sheldon,"Oh, I think thatês below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer. Stormtroopers are really the ones whoÑ"
Leonard,"Oh, shut up."
Leonard,"Uh-huh, Iêm normally very nice, but you shut up, too."
Sheldon,"So, what are you in for?"
Sheldon,But why are you here?
Sheldon,"Excuse me. Leonard, they have a sculpture gallery."
Leonard,We understand. Thank you so much.
Sheldon,"Uh, one question about that picture. Can it be with George Lucas? Ooh, grumpy you are."
Howard,"Okay, this is the match that decides it all. First to 11 wins. Serve switches every five points. And just so you know, when this started, I was going to put the TARDIS in a discreet corner of the house, but Iêve since turned mean, and now itês going right in the middle of the living room on a rotating platform with a sign that says suck it. Game on."
Bernadette,"Except, Raj is gonna win. Isnêt that right, Raj?"
Raj,"Uh, yeah, I mean, her serve was pretty good."
Bernadette,"Come on, get in her head. Be intimidating."
Raj,"Okay, uh, Iêm gonna own you, bitch."
Amy,Thatês not nice.
Raj,Letês just play.
Howard,"One-zero. Two. Three. Four. Five-nothing. Wait, did you play badminton or sad-minton?"
Bernadette,"Donêt listen to him, all sheês got is a serve. Now, grab a fresh tampon and put her away."
Raj,and thatês not offensive? Whereês the line?
Penny,Itês in your purse. Play.
Bernadette,One-five. Two-five. Three-five. Four-five. Five-five.
Howard,Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-five.
Bernadette,Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-ten.
Amy,"Well, that was an exciting 40 seconds."
Howard,"It was, and now the serve is back to you, and the game is over."
Bernadette,"You know, Amy, I, uh, canêt help but wonder how Sheldon would react if the TARDIS was at your place."
Howard,"Donêt listen to her, just hit the ball."
Amy,Keep talking.
Bernadette,"If this doesnêt get him into your bedroom, nothing will."
Sheldon,Are you still mad at me?
Leonard,"Yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested, and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee."
Sheldon,"Boy, some people are just glass-half-empty."
Leonard,"The glass is empty, Sheldon. Itês completely empty. If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst, he would be dead, do you know why?"
Sheldon,"Before I answer, was he a smoker? I think youêre looking at this all wrong."
Leonard,"Fine, then tell me how I should be looking at it."
Sheldon,"Well, not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch, we got in. And no one we know can say that. And for all the times you find me irritating, today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser."
Leonard,That part was pretty good.
Leonard,You did flop around a lot.
Sheldon,Iêll take your word for it. I was too busy trying not to defecate.
Leonard,"You know, when they were escorting us to the detaining room, I looked through a door, and Iêm pretty sure I saw a display case with the Ark of the Covenant."
Sheldon,Thatês amazing.
Leonard,I know.
Sheldon,"And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle. Although that was right after the Tasing, so who can say for sure?"
Leonard,I guess this could count as an adventure.
Sheldon,"It was. And even though weêre not allowed back there, they can never take today away from us. Unlike my sense of smell, which hasnêt returned since the Tasing. No, I got nothing."
Sheldon,"Amy, the Daleks are right on my tail, quick, we need to reset the time circuits. Oh, no, I left my sonic screwdriver behind."
Amy,Really should have thought this through.
Raj,Youêre wrong.
Howard,"No, Iêm not."
Raj,"Yes, you are."
Howard,"No, Iêm not. Settle this. Those little animated pictures on the Internet, are they called gifs or jifs?"
Leonard,"Well, the G stands for graphics. Thatês a hard G, so Iêd say gif."
Raj,The guy who invented it says itês jif.
Howard,"Iêm sorry, do you mean the guy or the juy?"
Sheldon,"Well, Iêll give you three guesses why Iêm so irritated."
Howard,Something happened different from the way you wanted it.
Sheldon,"I guess news travels fast. Itês true, a select group of scientists was invited to a weekend symposium at a former home of Richard Feynman, and I wasnêt included."
Leonard,"Oh, Sheldon, Iêm sure itês not because they donêt think youêre an elite scientist."
Howard,"Yeah, I bet you anything itês just êcause youêre a pain in the ass."
Sheldon,Youêre just saying that to make me feel better.
Leonard,"Look, you can spend the rest of the day being bitter about this."
Leonard,"I was gonna say or, but why bother?"
Bernadette,"Hey, Raj."
Raj,"Hey, I got you a little gift."
Bernadette,"Oh, thatês a lot of Girl Scout Cookies."
Raj,"You know me. Iêm from India. I canêt resist children begging. So, howês it going with the title to the house?"
Howard,"Great, itês all done. The lawyer tracked down my father and got him to sign it over. I didnêt have to meet him, I didnêt have to talk to him, I donêt even know where he is."
Raj,"Wow, so youêre not curious at all?"
Raj,"Hmm. What if heês in prison? What if heês a spy? What if heês in a Beatles cover band? Iêm just saying, if heês got your nose and haircut, heêd make a killer Ringo."
Penny,"Oh, itês cool, Iêve never been on a podcast before."
Leonard,"Well, you picked a good one to start. Wilês had lots of great guests. Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden."
Penny,Those are Star Trek people.
Penny,I only figured that out because Iêve never heard of any of them.
Leonard,This is exciting.
Penny,"Yeah, so, how many people listen?"
Penny,A few thousand people listen to you talk about nerd stuff?
Amy,Can you please pass the salt?
Sheldon,Sure. Itês not like I was invited to Richard Feynmanês house and have anything better to do.
Amy,Is this how the rest of the nightês going to be?
Sheldon,"I donêt know the future. Do you think thereês a chance that an asteroid could hit the Earth, destroying Feynmanês house and everyone in it?"
Amy,"No, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Then buckle up, youêre in for a cranky night."
Amy,"According to the codicil of the Relationship Agreement which you insisted upon, weêre not allowed to pout or be moody on date night."
Sheldon,You know I just put that in because of uterus stuff.
Amy,"Well, it applies to you, too."
Sheldon,"I was afraid you might bring this up, so I have a work-around. There you go. As far as youêre concerned, Iêm smiling. Although, I must admit, Iêm smiling a little bit at the moment because this loophole is so brilliant."
Raj,"So, Bernadette, have you thought about how youêre going to redecorate this place?"
Bernadette,"You know, Iêm thinking ripping up the carpets, maybe lose the wallpaper, all new light fixtures."
Raj,"You know, if you knocked out this wall, it would give you an open floor plan, and then, itês a little scary, but could be fun, indoor fire pit."
Howard,"Hey, I grew up in this house, okay? No oneês knocking anything down."
Bernadette,"Okay, okay. When heês at Comic-Con, Iêm bringing in a wrecking ball."
Howard,Can I help you?
Howard,"Wuh, uh, whoês your father?"
Howard,Sam Wolowitz is my father.
Howard,"Well, wait, so if we have the same father, are, are you saying youêre my half-brother?"
Howard,"Bernadette, weird things are happening out here."
Penny,"I think I started to suspect it was a bad movie when I looked at the script and saw the title, Serial Ape-ist 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill."
Leonard,"I, I didnêt want to interrupt."
Leonard,"Hey, great."
Penny,"Okay, well, Iêll apologize for the first time, but the other nine are on you."
Leonard,"Oh, if she was with an Indian guy dressed like a banana, that was just my friends, Howard and Raj."
Penny,"Hey, Kevin. Itês really exciting to talk to you."
Leonard,It really is.
Penny,"Oh, wow. I wish it was better."
Penny,"Oh, my, I would love that."
Leonard,You have a new job.
Penny,"Well, maybe I can do both."
Leonard,I donêt think you can do both.
Penny,I donêt think I asked you.
Leonard,"Stay out of it, Kevin Smith."
Sheldon,Do you think there comes a point in life when it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?
Amy,Probably not. Itês an evolutionary advantage to be included in group activities.
Sheldon,"You know what? I used to be a fan of evolution, but Iêve since evolved, and now I think itês dumb."
Amy,Being left out is a terrible feeling. No one understands that better than I do.
Sheldon,"Hey, look at that. Even in your example, youêre all by yourself."
Amy,"When there was a lice epidemic at my school, everybody got it except me. I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees."
Sheldon,"I can just picture them all right now at Feynmanês house, probably discussing Schrodinger and at the same time, not discussing Schrodinger. See? Theyêre missing out on hilarious jokes like that."
Amy,"And at the same time, not."
Sheldon,It reminds me of when my stupid brother and sister would build forts in the living room and wouldnêt let me in. I hated that so much.
Amy,"You know, thereês nothing I can do about getting you invited to the symposium, but if you wanted, we could build a fort."
Sheldon,Isnêt that a little juvenile?
Amy,More juvenile than this?
Sheldon,Iêll get the blankets. You Google how to have childlike fun.
Howard,"You know what, Iêm being a bad host. Let me get some more coffee."
Bernadette,"Oh, let me do it, Howard."
Howard,"No, I got it."
Bernadette,"So, Josh, what do you do?"
Bernadette,"Oh, how nice. I loved Finding Nemo."
Raj,Enough chitchat. How do we know you are who you say you are?
Raj,"Okay, you got me there. You here looking for money?"
Raj,"A kidney, cornea, piece of his liver?"
Raj,Youêre in a Beatles cover band and you need Howard to replace your dad as Ringo.
Bernadette,Why donêt you help with the coffee?
Raj,"Okay, but something smells fishy. And not just because you work around sea animals. That actually sounds interesting, and Iêd like to learn more about it. Hey, you okay?"
Howard,"Not really. This guy shows up out of the blue, and now I have a brother? My father has another family?"
Raj,I get it. What do you want to do?
Howard,"I donêt know. I, Iêd just like him to go away. I canêt deal with this."
Raj,"All right, Iêve got your back."
Howard,"Thank you. Come on. And Iêd like to point out, this wall just provided a lot of privacy."
Raj,"Listen, dude, itês time for you to hit the road."
Howard,"Hey, hey, the young man asked a good question."
Leonard,"No, no, no. Weêre not fighting, weêre just having a conversation."
Leonard,Give me back that juice.
Penny,What is the harm if I audition?
Leonard,"Well, what if you get it?"
Penny,"I donêt know, I make a movie, become rich and famous, win an Oscar, a Golden Globe and live an incredibly wonderful life."
Leonard,From a Kevin Smith movie?
Penny,Thanks a lot.
Leonard,Iêm just trying to protect you. How many times did I see you get your heart broken trying to make it as an actress?
Penny,"Okay, instead of protecting me, why donêt you try being excited when something good happens?"
Leonard,Iêm always excited for you. Iêm excited that you found this new job where youêre making decent money.
Penny,Decent? I make twice what you make.
Leonard,"Wait, twice?"
Leonard,"Like, times two twice?"
Leonard,I went to school for half my life. I have a doctorate. Iêm still paying off college loans.
Penny,"Well, how much do you owe? Maybe I can help you out."
Leonard,"Wil, can we just turn off the podcast for a little bit?"
Amy,"Howês it going, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,Wonderful. I just finished hanging the lights.
Amy,Can I come in?
Sheldon,"Yes, oh, but enter through the side. Batman is a load-bearing blanket."
Sheldon,I know. This isnêt the printout. This is my real face.
Amy,What are we doing? This is a fort. Letês sit on the floor.
Sheldon,Roughing it? Okay. Everything looks so big from down here. This must be how Leonard feels.
Howard,"Iêm surprised you could hear me with this Thin Mint in your ear. Yeah, pretty cool, huh?"
Bernadette,"Howie, have you noticed how often people say that when you start to do magic?"
Howard,"Well, I hope I get to see you again."
Bernadette,Keep dreaming.
Howard,"Hey, I threw out the first pitch at an Angels game."
Bernadette,He did it with a robot.
Howard,Thatês not what she meant.
Raj,"But technically, yes."
Leonard,"Hang on, if youêre making all this money, where is it?"
Penny,In a safe place.
Leonard,"What does that mean, under your bed?"
Penny,"No, it means a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. Iêm not overly conservative. Iêm young, so my guy said I can afford to take some risks."
Leonard,"Wait a minute, you have a guy?"
Penny,Donêt you have a guy?
Leonard,Why would I have a guy? I donêt have any money.
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, you should really get some money."
Leonard,"Wil, Iêm begging you, just please turn that off."
Penny,"Leonard, why are you making such a big deal out of this? So our roles have changed a bit over the last couple years. This is the way life is. And Iêm sure in time theyêll change again."
Leonard,"Great, youêre not only more successful than me, now youêre more mature."
Penny,"Okay, look, would it make you feel better if I did something dumb like sneak out of work one day to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?"
Leonard,"That would be great, thank you."
Leonard,"Yes, it is, Wil."
Howard,It was actually just a mechanical hand.
Howard,You are my brother.
Sheldon,"Okay, so the final four forts in the first annual best fort ever contest, or fort off, are, Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga, Fort Sumter and Fort Cozy McBlanket."
Amy,"Iêd say, Knox over Ticonderoga, êcause itês got the gold."
Amy,And McBlanket over Sumter êcause it has a higher thread count. Oh. Ten oêclock. Date nightês over.
Sheldon,"Wait, no. We havenêt picked a winner."
Amy,We both know this oneês gonna win.
Sheldon,"Well, of course we do. Fort Knox doesnêt have a secret physics lending library."
Amy,"Come on, Iêll help you take this down."
Sheldon,"Well, wait. What if, just this once, we suspend the date night parameters and you stay later?"
Amy,"Well, as long as weêre suspending the parameters, I could stay really late and we could have our first sleepover."
Sheldon,Thatês a big step.
Amy,Itês a big fort.
Sheldon,"Very well. I will agree to a family-friendly, G-rated, boy-girl sleepover."
Amy,PG. Some scenes may be too intense for younger viewers.
Sheldon,"G-rated, with a warning for families with babies and toddlers."
Amy,You got yourself a sleepover.
Sheldon,Do you need to borrow a toothbrush or pajamas?
Amy,Would it alarm you to know that I hid those things here two years ago just in case this ever came up?
Sheldon,"It would, but you know how much I admire preparedness. How did you know weêd be in the living room?"
Amy,Who says this is the only one I hid?
Leonard,Hello? What is this?
Sheldon,We built a fort.
Leonard,Are those my sheets?
Amy,"Yes, they are."
Leonard,"Okay. Well, you kids have fun. Iêm gonna go to sleep."
Sheldon,"Well, Leonard, donêt you want to see the inside of the fort?"
Leonard,"Yeah, Iêm good."
Sheldon,"Oh, come on. I really wanted to tell someone they canêt come in."
Leonard,"Okay, fine. Sheldon, may I please visit your fort?"
Sheldon,"I want to say no, but itês too glorious. Get in here."
Leonard,Thank you.
Amy,"Okay, have a seat on the floor."
Sheldon,Not there. Thatês my spot.
Sheldon,"Hey, would you like to hear some songs Iêve rewritten to get children interested in the hard sciences?"
Howard,"Yeah. Well, I like music, I like science, I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it."
Sheldon,"There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. J-A-M-E-S, C-L-E-R-K space M-A-X-W-E-L-L, And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o. There was a scientist who had a theory and James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o, A-M-E-SÑ"
Leonard,"Uh, okay, okay. Uh, we, we get it."
Sheldon,"Perhaps youêd prefer this one. The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all, because it haseight legs and two body parts."
Leonard,"Thatês pretty cool, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Thank you. Do either of you know Beyonc_? Iêd love her to get behind it.
Raj,You guys know the new Discovery class missions that NASAês been working on?
Raj,"Well, theyêre looking to include a message from Earth in case one of them is encountered by alien life."
Leonard,"Oh. When I encountered alien life, I discovered that the key thing was not to sit in its spot."
Sheldon,"All right, you canêt breathe our air without an inhaler, heês allergic to Earth nuts, but Iêm the alien."
Raj,"Anyway, Iêm among a handful of scientists that have been asked to submit a design proposal for the message and its delivery system."
Howard,Good for you.
Raj,And I was wondering if any of you guys would like to help me do it.
Leonard,Are you kidding? Yes. What did you have in mind?
Sheldon,"Iêll tell you exactly what you should do, avoid the presumption of the Terran sensory input paradigm."
Howard,"Yeah, absolutely. You need a device capable of delivering information across a wide range of perceptual modalities."
Sheldon,Any intelligent organism would at the very least need the ability to locate the position of objects in space. So the ideal interstellar lingua franca would be haptic.
Howard,"Ooh, how about a 3-D tactile communicator rigged for cross-sensory transposition?"
Raj,"Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing their ideas on me and only one gentleman who could be bothered to ask me what my thoughts were. You two are out. Congratulations, Leonard, youêre on the team."
Leonard,My mommy raised a gentleman.
Raj,Hey. Thanks for coming by.
Leonard,Yeah. Iêm excited to help.
Raj,"I would have included the others, but you know exactly what wouldêve happened. They wouldêve taken over the project and bossed us around."
Leonard,"I get it. Uh, just this morning, Sheldon wouldnêt let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts because he said it was a theoretical nut conflict."
Raj,You should have told him to mind his own business.
Leonard,"Yeah. Thatês better than what I did say, which was, fine, Iêll eat them with club soda."
Raj,What makes them think theyêre always in charge of everything?
Leonard,"Mmm, theyêre alpha males."
Raj,"Huh, what does that make us?"
Leonard,We could be betas. Theyêre second in charge.
Raj,"Okay, that sounds good."
Leonard,Or we could be omegas. They get pushed around by the alphas and the betas.
Raj,"Okay, that sounds like us."
Leonard,"Whatever. Thereês no alphas here, and this is your project. Youêre in charge. How do you want to start?"
Raj,I donêt know. How do you want to start?
Leonard,I donêt know. Should we call Sheldon and Howard?
Raj,We can do this by ourselves.
Leonard,Okay. Great. How do you want to start?
Raj,I donêt know. How do you want to start?
Penny, Sheldon.
Sheldon,"I bet that started off as a joke, but by the third one you realized there was something strangely enjoyable about it."
Penny,"Yeah, I kind of want to do it again."
Sheldon,"I donêt recommend it. Youêll be doing it the rest of your life. Anyway, if youêre looking for Leonard, heês with Koothrappali."
Penny,"Uh, no, I actually came to talk to you."
Sheldon,"How nice. Here are some topics that interest me, quantum mechanics, trains, flags."
Penny,"No, no. Itês about my acting career."
Sheldon,"Oh, sorry. Thatês not on the list."
Sheldon,"Oh, wait. How about we split the difference and discuss why Austria was an archduchy and not just a regular duchy."
Penny,"Okay, look, hereês the thing. I like pharmaceutical sales, itês going great, but I have an audition for a movie, and if I get it, it could screw everything up."
Sheldon,"Hmm. I know exactly what you should do. Unfortunately, I cannot tell you."
Penny,"Well, why?"
Sheldon,"Iêm attempting to turn over a new leaf. Earlier today, it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people."
Penny,Youêre really not gonna tell me?
Sheldon,"No, that train has left the station. Now, we can play this one of two ways. You can say, trains, tell me more, or you can just look at me like that and Iêll start."
Bernadette,Whatês going on in here?
Howard,I am making molecular cocktails. This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.
Bernadette,Oh. How do you drink it?
Howard,"Oh, just put it in your mouth and pop it like a zit."
Bernadette,I think Iêll have a beer.
Howard,First take a picture with me.
Howard,"Well, Raj and I always talked about learning how to make cocktails like this together, so I taught myself and Iêm putting this on Instagram so he can see it and feel like a turd. Say cheese."
Bernadette,Is this about the space probe heês working on without you?
Howard,You betcha. The very one.
Bernadette,"Howard, youêre grown men. You guys donêt have to do everything together."
Howard,I know. Thatês why Iêm spending tonight with you.
Bernadette,Trying to hurt Rajês feelings.
Howard,With my honeybunch.
Bernadette,Youêre being childish.
Howard,He is. So I have a dominant personality. We all know that.
Bernadette,Iêm sorry. What do we know?
Howard,"In social groupings, I just naturally wind up in charge."
Bernadette,"Donêt take this the wrong way, but how many of these little booze balls have you had?"
Howard,You donêt think Iêm a leader?
Bernadette,I was kidding. Of course you are.
Howard,Right. I couldnêt change if I wanted to.
Bernadette,"You better not change, because I love who you are. Now, will you need help cleaning all this up when youêre done or can you do it all by yourself?"
Howard,All by myself.
Bernadette,Thereês my big boss man.
Sheldon,"So, often on the front of the locomotive is a large iron wedge for clearing objects off the tracks. Now, while commonly known as a cowcatcher, I prefer the more accurate cow exploder."
Penny,"Okay. Sheldon, let me ask you a question."
Penny,"If I was at a train station and one train could take me to my current job and the other train could take me to an audition for a movie, which train should I get on?"
Sheldon,Are you using trains to trick me into giving you advice?
Sheldon,"All right, then. You should take a third train where you audition for the movie but hold off on making a career decision until you have more information."
Penny,Oh. Youêre right. Iêm worried about something that hasnêt even happened yet. Huh. You are a wise man.
Sheldon,"Well, Penny, whoês smarter, the wise man or the person who comes to him for advice?"
Penny,"Oh, I guess youêre right. Maybe it is the person who asks."
Sheldon,"No, itês the wise man. Thatês why heês called the wise man. You know how I know that? Iêm the wise man."
Penny,Iêm sorry. What was I thinking?
Sheldon,"Uh, just out of curiosity, why didnêt you ask Leonard for advice about this?"
Penny,"‚Cause I already know what heêll say. Wah, wah, wah, you shouldnêt do it."
Sheldon,"Ah, itês just like heês here."
Raj,"Okay, so we know that previous attempts to send a message into space, like the Golden Record on Voyager, were heavily criticized."
Leonard,"Well, aliens could only play the Golden Record if they figured out how to build a record player."
Raj,"Eh. Although, to be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella. Dude was like a little brown MacGyver."
Leonard,That would be more helpful if E.T. were real.
Raj,"Well, my feelings were real when he was about to die."
Leonard,"My God, when heês on the table and they use the paddles on him."
Raj,And heês all white.
Leonard,They zip him up in that bag.
Raj,And Gertie canêt stop crying.
Leonard,The flower dies.
Raj,"Okay, letês talk about something else."
Leonard,"All right, so it sounds like we need a way to communicate thatês simple."
Raj,And doesnêt require outside machinery to be built to access it.
Leonard,"Itês also a problem because we donêt even know if the aliens who find this can see. I mean, they might communicate in a totally different way than us."
Raj,"Like when my dog is mad at me, she tells me by peeing in my slippers."
Leonard,Thatês actually a valid example. Animals do deliver messages through scent.
Raj,Bees talk to each other by dancing. Whales have their songs.
Leonard,Yeah. Penny has about twenty different ways of rolling her eyes that each mean something different.
Raj,"Okay, so, what it sounds like is, what we want is a device that can deliver a message through not only sight, but other senses, as well."
Leonard,The most basic sense that any space-faring civilization would have to possess is touch.
Raj,"Ooh. Ooh, ooh. We could make a video-playing device that simultaneously translates the information into a tactile medium."
Leonard,All we have to do is rig up a 3-D communication system.
Raj,"We, we can totally do that."
Leonard,I know.
Raj,This is great.
Leonard,"Yeah, you know what else it is?"
Howard,Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.
Raj,"Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers."
Sheldon,"Itês the eye of the tiger, itês the ear of the bat, itês the whiskers of the catfish and the walrus."
Howard,"Hang on. Not that your song isnêt terrible, it is. but how do you mention bats and leave out sonar?"
Sheldon,"You didnêt let me finish. And also regarding the bat, it has sonar."
Raj,"Look, I know you guys are upset, but weêve talked about it, and we think itêd be beneficial for you to be part of the project."
Howard,"Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,Iêm sorry. I was trying to think of what rhymes with nose of the aardvark.
Leonard,We want you back on the project with us.
Sheldon,"Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?"
Raj,"Look, we admit it. The idea that you guys came up with was really good, and Iêd love your help."
Howard,I suppose it couldnêt have been easy for you to say that.
Raj,"It wasnêt, so are you in?"
Leonard,"Great. Now that weêre all on the same page, letês get together tonight and work on it."
Sheldon,"Get together tonight? Leonard, stop trying to control everything, and give poor Raj a chance to come up with what we should do. Go ahead, Raj."
Raj,"Okay, I think we should do it right now."
Sheldon,Tonight works better for me.
Raj,"So, Iêd like to try a technique where no one gets steamrolled. When you talk, instead of bringing up a new idea, respect what was just said by building on it."
Sheldon,"Uh, building on that, we should order dinner."
Leonard,How is that building on what he just said?
Howard,"Building on what Sheldon said, I could go for Chinese."
Raj,"Hang on. Building on what Leonard said, no one built on what I said."
Sheldon,"Building on building on that, thereês a new build-your-own pizza place on Colorado."
Leonard,"Building on that, Iêd like to remind you, Iêm lactose intolerant."
Howard,I saw the menu. They have soy cheese.
Sheldon,"Bah, you didnêt say building on. Youêre out."
Leonard,Itês not Simon Says.
Raj,"Yeah, youêre missing the point, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Youêre out, and youêre out. I win. Who wants pizza?"
Penny,"Oh, hey."
Penny,"Yeah, uh, I got a job as a pharmaceutical sales rep."
Penny,"Well, kind of. But now I get to act like inflamed heart is only a mild side effect."
Penny,"Yeah, itês going okay, but I do miss this sometimes."
Penny,Yeah. I started that rumour.
Leonard,"Okay, since we agree on the delivery system for the message, maybe we should talk about what the message could be."
Raj,"Well, I think we should show what earthlings look like."
Howard,The plaque they sent up on the Pioneer probe had a drawing of a naked man and woman on it.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I never cared for that. Itês advertising to predator races just how soft and squishy we are."
Leonard,Squeeze yourself.
Sheldon,"Oh, donêt be offended. You know, of the four of us, you have the most veal-like consistency."
Raj,"Well, maybe thereês a way to appear non-aggressive, but also be able to protect ourselves if necessary. Like smiling and waving with one hand, but the other hand holding the severed head of a tiger."
Howard,You want to send a passive-aggressive message out into the universe? Thatês ridiculous.
Raj,"Oh, you mean passive-aggressive like posting pictures of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan balls that you know belong in my mouth?"
Sheldon,"Perhaps Howard meant passive-aggressive like asking our group to help on your project, and then only choosing Leonard."
Raj,"Look, Iêm sorry I hurt your feelings, but you do have strong personalities and always end up taking over."
Howard,Itês not always.
Leonard,"What about when we went to Comic-Con and dressed like Jabba the Hutt? You got to be Jabbaês head, and I got to be his fat slug butt."
Sheldon,We looked great.
Leonard,You let a guy sit on me.
Howard,He was dressed as Princess Leia. It made a nice picture.
Leonard,"Iêm just saying, sometimes Raj and I feel pushed aside."
Raj,"Yeah. Like when you took Sheldon to Texas and showed him all around NASA, you didnêt even think to ask me and Leonard."
Howard,You know what? Youêre right. I should have asked you.
Sheldon,"Yeah, and if he does ask you, go. Itês amazing."
Howard,"Okay, and if weêre talking about being left out of things, you guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us."
Sheldon,"Oh, I recommend that, too. That was a magical experience."
Leonard,Wait a minute. Sheldon spent a whole day with James Earl Jones and never told any of us.
Sheldon,"I sure did. Oh, my goodness. Well, from Jabbaês head to ice cream with Darth Vader, Iêm having a heck of a ride. Yeah, look, clearly, good things happen when Iêm in charge. Now, why donêt you boys step aside, let me knock this project out?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, youêre not in charge. Raj is in charge."
Sheldon,"Leonard, whoês really in charge? The person in charge, or those who put him in charge?"
Raj,"Heês right. If you think about it, weêre all in charge."
Sheldon,"No, the guy in charge is in chÑ why is everyone so bad at these?"
Penny,"I mean, the whole experience reminded me about how much I hated about that world. You, you know, the anxiety, the depression, the negativity. I donêt want to feel those things. I want to sell drugs to people who feel those things."
Amy,I canêt believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie.
Penny,"I did. I mean, I walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out."
Bernadette,"Well, Iêm glad you have a new appreciation for your job."
Penny,"I do, and you know, I donêt think Iêve ever thanked you properly for helping me get it."
Bernadette,"Properly, at all. Itês just words Iêve never heard."
Penny,"Well, thank you. Youêre a good friend, and you changed my life."
Bernadette,"Youêre welcome. Hey, now that youêre making some real money, maybe you can take your friend out for a nice thank-you dinner."
Amy,"And you probably have to invite your other friend êcause she overheard you talking about it, and it would be awkward to exclude her."
Bernadette,How about now?
Penny,All right.
Bernadette,Donêt forget your wallet.
Penny,"I, uh, huh."
Sheldon,Greetings from planet Earth. Just turn left at Alpha Centauri. You canêt miss it.
Raj,"Itês, like, the best one they make, I just canêt get it to work."
Howard,Iêll figure it out.
Raj,It streams HD video straight to your phone while itês flying.
Howard,Nice. Where were you when I was single?
Leonard,"Okay, we should leave in about an hour. You all packed?"
Penny,"Uh, yeah, I just need to throw in a few last minute things, you know, makeup, underwear, clothes."
Sheldon,"If your bathroom floor counts as a carry-on, youêre packed."
Amy,"Leonard, have you ever given a high school commencement speech before?"
Leonard,Nope. Itês pretty exciting.
Sheldon,Arenêt you afraid of being blinded?
Leonard,How would I be blinded?
Sheldon,"At the end of the ceremony, all the students throw those pointy hats in the air. Itês all pomp and circumstance until someone loses an eye."
Leonard,Iêll take my chances.
Sheldon,Fine. I wonder if they make I told you so cards in braille.
Raj,"Look, the problem with commencement speeches is that theyêre boring. Ooh, do you own a T-shirt cannon?"
Howard,Why would he own a T-shirt cannon?
Raj,I donêt know. Why do I own one?
Amy,I think itês really nice that youêre sharing this experience with Penny.
Leonard,"Mm, I thought itêd be fun to show her my old stomping grounds. I even know the exact spot where they used to stomp me."
Bernadette,"Well, now you get to go back as a successful scientist."
Amy,With a beautiful girl on your arm.
Sheldon,And a pointy hat sticking out of your eyeball.
Leonard,Howêd you get ready so fast?
Penny,"Oh, I pack light. Once, I got through an entire spring break with nothing but a long T-shirt and a belt."
Leonard,Why did you need a belt?
Penny,Itês called an evening look. Iêve never been to New Jersey before.
Leonard,It gets a bad rap from shows like Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.
Penny,So itês not really like that?
Leonard,"No, itês like that. Well, Iêm excited to show you around."
Penny,You think weêll have time to visit your mom over there?
Leonard,"Yes. Weêll also have time to put my junk in a garlic press, but Iêm not doing that either.  Uh-oh. I just got an alert. Our flightês been cancelled."
Leonard,"Yeah, looks like thereês a big storm all up the East Coast."
Penny,"Well, can we get on another airline?"
Leonard,I donêt think so.
Penny,"So, thatês it? Weêre not going?"
Leonard,I guess not.
Penny,"Well, that sucks."
Leonard,"Yeah. I worked hard on that speech, too."
Penny,Oh. You could tell it to me.
Leonard,"Oh, thank you, but Iêm okay."
Penny,Are you sure? I could pretend Iêm a high school cheerleader who canêt control herself around esteemed alumni.
Leonard,"Greetings, distinguished cheerleaders."
Howard,"Okay, the WiFi extender is on, the cameraês on, theyêre both on the same network. We should be getting an image."
Sheldon,All I see is a black screen. And my own reflection. I look sad.
Howard,Maybe we should recalibrate it.
Sheldon,All right.
Howard,"Step one, rapidly flip the calibration switch from the fully up to the fully down positions for at least ten times."
Sheldon,It actually says at least?
Sheldon,Why would they say at least? Is it ten toggles? Is it a hundred toggles? You know? Is it a thousand toggles? Ten thousand toggles? A hundred thousand toggles?
Sheldon,You see where Iêm going with this.
Howard,Just flip the switch until the lights on the drone change to solid yellow.
Sheldon,"All right, that seems simple enough. Initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Well, I suppose ten is technically at least ten. But theyêre still getting at least one angry letter."
Howard,Now I rotate it horizontally on its centre axis until the lights turn green.
Sheldon,"Initiating rotation sequence. Donêt look at me, initiate. What does red and yellow mean?"
Howard,It means the calibration failed. We have to start over.
Sheldon,"Oh. Very well. Re-initiating calibration sequence. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, tenÑ eleven. Itês a good thing I didnêt send that letter."
Raj,"Mm. Hello, Daddy. Whatês up?"
Raj,"Very well, thank you."
Raj,"If you could feel how soft my skin is, you wouldnêt have to ask."
Raj,"Oh, youêre where that bill goes."
Raj,"No, Daddy, no. There are lots of other ways to teach me responsibility. I know, you can give me an egg and make me take care of it for a week."
Raj,"But, Daddy, I, I miss my family so much, and with you and Mummy getting a divorce, I feel sad and empty. Buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void. So while I canêt hug you every day, flying that helicopterÑ"
Raj,"Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?"
Howard,"No red and yellow, no red and yellow."
Howard,Itês green.
Sheldon,"We did it. Oh, if itês this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it."
Howard,"Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights turn off."
Sheldon,"Oh, no."
Howard,"Oh. All right, playtimeês over. Letês open this baby up."
Sheldon,Wonêt that void the warranty?
Howard,"Sheldon, I have a masterês degree in engineering. I wipe my bottom with warranties. Except for AppleCare. That pays for itself in the long run."
Leonard,"Hey, whereêd you go?"
Penny,I got you a little something to cheer you up.
Leonard,"Really? Sex last night, pancakes this morning, am I dying?"
Penny,Just open it.
Leonard,A cap and gown? Why do I need a cap and gown?
Penny,Because you are giving your commencement speech.
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Penny,I called your old high school and convinced them to let you give your speech over Skype.
Leonard,Really? Thatês amazing. And you gave me the robes to give it in. Thank you.
Penny,"Yeah, now about those, uh, they came from a costume shop, and all they had left was sexy graduate, so they might be a little short."
Leonard,"Short and sexy, thatês my wheelhouse."
Howard,"Boy, oh, boy, thatês a lot of pieces."
Sheldon,"You know what they all do, right?"
Howard,"Yes, of course."
Sheldon,What about this one?
Howard,"Well, I, how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?"
Sheldon,Not very.
Howard,That right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.
Sheldon,"So, can you get it working?"
Howard,Iêm an MIT-trained engineer. Iêve built components for the space station.
Sheldon,I thought the zero-gravity toilet didnêt work.
Howard,"It worked fine, it just wasnêt designed for Russian cosmonauts and their potato-based diet."
Raj,"Hey, guys."
Raj,I have to return the helicopter. My fatherÑ What did you do?
Sheldon,"Well, donêt worry. He went to MIT. He can solve any problem, as long as it doesnêt originate in a Russian manês colon."
Raj,I donêt freaking believe this.
Howard,"Relax, itêll be fine."
Raj,"No, you have to put this back together right now, so I can return it."
Sheldon,You canêt return it. Howard wiped his bottom with the warranty.
Sheldon,I think metaphorically. But he was in the bathroom for a while.
Raj,"Howard, my father cut me off. I have to get my money back for this."
Howard,Calm down.
Raj,"Okay. Okay, youêre right. Itês time for me to step up and take responsibility for my life. Be a man.  Hello, Mummy."
Raj,"Well, Iêve been thinking about you. How are you doing? Are you happy, Mummy?"
Raj,"Well, I like to think I take mostly after you. Anyway, speaking of Daddy, I had a very strange conversation with him. He said he couldnêt afford to send me money any more because of his active social life."
Raj,"Well, letês not talk about him or whatever shenanigans he may or may not be up to. Letês talk about you."
Raj,"All I know, Mummy, is that heês a single wealthy doctor, and now, for some reason, thereês no money for your little boy."
Raj,"Thank you, Mummy, I love you. Helicopters for everybody."
Penny,Whatês taking so long?
Leonard,I donêt think this is gonna work.
Penny,"Just let me see. Sweetie, you know youêre supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown."
Leonard,"A, surprised you know that. B, I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you."
Penny,"Oh. Well, you do."
Leonard,Thank you.
Penny,"Yeah. Youêre gonna be on Skype, theyêre not gonna see your legs."
Leonard,"Well, Iêm gonna go put on some pants just in case. But I have to say, this is very freeing."
Penny,Add a belt and Iêll take you some place nice.
Leonard,Oh. Done and done.
Howard,"Okay, I think Iêve narrowed it down to a faulty pin on the onboard communication chip."
Sheldon,"Very impressive. You know, when youêre done with that, can you look at this? It doesnêt make smoke anymore."
Howard,One toy at a time.
Sheldon,"Mm. Sorry. Ah, maybe itês for the best. I hear locomotive smoke is the second leading cause of death among train aficionados."
Raj,Whatês the first one?
Sheldon,Wrong. Obesity.
Bernadette,I have the tool you wanted.
Howard,Thank you.
Raj,"You guys donêt have to go to the trouble. Iêm back in the money now, I can just buy another helicopter."
Howard,"Itês not about the money. Itês about solving a problem. Itês why I became an engineer. Itês what I like to do, itês what Iêm trained to do. Itês who I am."
Sheldon,"Oh, look at you, the little engineer that could."
Bernadette,Why donêt you just call tech support?
Raj,Not cool.
Howard,"Thereês two kinds of people in this world, those who call tech support, and those who make fun of the people who call tech support."
Bernadette,I call tech support all the time.
Sheldon,You call tech support.
Raj,What a baby.
Leonard,"Members of the faculty, students, Iêm excited to speak to you today. I canêt help but remember the last time I was in this auditorium. Two guys from the lacrosse team played keep-away with my asthma inhaler. But enough about my ten-year reunion. Iêd also like to take a moment to thank my beautiful fianc_e for to helping make this speech possible, even though weather nearly prevented it."
Penny,"Oh. Hello. I, I didnêt know he was gonna point it at me, so, donêt do drugs and stay in school."
Leonard,Theyêre graduating.
Penny,"Okay, bye."
Howard,"All right, the power supply is reconnected. I think weêre back in business. Letês just run a few tests before we take it outside. Sheldon, we got WiFi?"
Howard,Battery charged?
Bernadette,Four hours of our lives gone? Check.
Howard,All right. All systems go. In fiveÑ
Sheldon,Thatês what my train used to do.
Bernadette,Ready to call tech support?
Howard,Give me the number. Probably wind up talking to some foreign guy whoês reading from the same manual I have. 
Raj,"Itês my father, you jerks. Hello, Daddy."
Raj,"Nothing. I was just calling to check in, make sure sheês doing okay."
Raj,Really? I donêt know where sheêd get an idea like that. You know Mummy and her crazy imagination Iêm so lucky I take after you.
Raj,"Well, I try to. I certainly wouldnêt be a scientist if you hadnêt been my role model.  Who wants to go to Vegas in a real helicopter?"
Leonard,"It was L. Frank Baum who said no thief, however skillful, can rob one of knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest treasure, wow, Iêm boring myself. Sorry, I canêt see any of your faces right now, but I bet they look like this. Uh, you know, I, I wrote an entire speech to say how high school prepares you and what a wonderful place it is, but I hated it. Maybe high schoolês great if you look like this, but I didnêt even feel like I existed at that school. And now that I think about it, I bet a lot of you feel the same way. So, for the remainder of my speech, this is for the invisible kids. Uh, maybe you never fit in. Or maybe youêre the smallest kid in the school, or the heaviest or the weirdest. Maybe youêre graduating and you still havenêt had your first kiss. By the way, 19, and Geraldine Coco, wherever you are, thank you. Maybe you donêt have any friends. And guess what? Thatês okay. While all the popular kids are off doing whatever, I donêt know what they were doing êcause I was never there."
Penny,"Iêll, Iêll tell you later."
Leonard,"My point is, while youêre spending all this time on your own, building computers or practicing your cello, what youêre really doing is becoming interesting. And when people finally do notice you, theyêre gonna find someone a lot cooler than they thought. And for those of you who were popular in high school, itês over, sorry. Thank you and congratulations."
Howard,"What happened to me? When did I become an old man baffled by modern technology? Next thing you know, Iêll be hitching my pants up to my armpits and complaining about the awful music the kids are listening to."
Sheldon,"It is awful, isnêt it? Listen to that noise."
Howard,"Hang on, hang on. Itês working. I did it."
Raj,Howêd you do that?
Howard,"No idea, but I did it."
Bernadette,Maybe you shouldnêt be flying it inside.
Howard,"Well, Iêm not flying it."
Sheldon,Then who is?
Howard,I donêt know. Must be getting a WiFi signal from somewhere else.
Sheldon,"Initiate landing sequence. Initiate landing sequence. Hey, the cameraês working. Oh, look, itês me."
Sheldon,"Yes, itês a robot uprising. Call the police."
Leonard,So you really think they liked it?
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, it was the best speech IÑ"
Sheldon,"Donêt worry, everyone in here is safe."
Penny,"Leonard, what time does your momês plane get in?"
Leonard,"I donêt know, some time tomorrow morning."
Penny,Donêt you want to know for sure?
Leonard,"No need to. As soon as she flies into California airspace, Iêll feel a disturbance in the Force."
Amy,Itês so nice both of your moms are coming in to see you guys get an award.
Sheldon,"Well, my motherês been there for every honour Iêve won since I beat out my twin sister for the did it on the potty trophy. How does this look?"
Penny,"Aw, itês so nice. Sheês gonna love it."
Amy,"Sure, his mom gets roses. When I want them, theyêre a bouquet of severed plant genitals."
Sheldon,You act like I didnêt get you that mushroom log on Valentineês Day.
Amy,"Heês right. Roses die, but a moist rotting log will pump out mushrooms for two or three magical years."
Penny,"You know, your momês never been too thrilled with our relationship. Maybe I should get her something so she warms up to me."
Leonard,"If you could run out and get a PhD, that might make her like you."
Penny,Really? It didnêt work for you.
Amy,Do you think the moms will get along?
Leonard,"Uh, I donêt know. Theyêre pretty different."
Sheldon,"Maybe theyêll be best friends. One of them is brilliant, one is sweet and simple. Sound familiar?"
Sheldon,"Oh, thank you, Mother."
Sheldon,"Oh, itês quite straightforward, actually. It describes a new model of the universe that conceptualizes it as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid."
Sheldon,"What did they feed the lions, Mother?"
Sheldon,"Listen, Leonardês mom is a renowned psychiatrist and woman of science. Can you please keep the Bible babble to yourself while sheês here?"
Sheldon,"Of course not. I love you. Iêm just embarrassed by the things you believe, do and say."
Leonard,"No, weêre kind of taking it slow."
Leonard,What does that mean?
Leonard,"Yes, Mother."
Leonard,"I change my answer. It, itês amazing. Itês hot. We can barely keep our hands off each other."
Leonard,"See, this right here, what youêre doing, can you please not do that around Sheldonês mom?"
Leonard,"Of course not. Sheês, sheês just a very sweet and God-fearing lady, and you have to be respectful of her beliefs."
Leonard,Thank you.
Leonard,East Texas.
Leonard,"Hey, look whoês here."
Sheldon,"Oh, Doctor Hofstadter, itês so good to see you again."
Sheldon,"Oh, thank you."
Leonard,We just spent two hours in traffic. Did you think to mention to me that you liked our paper?
Leonard,"Thatês so sweet, you think I have self-esteem."
Sheldon,"Doctor Hofstadter, I want you to meet my mother, Mary."
Leonard,"Subtle, mom, real subtle."
Bernadette,"We talked about this. I donêt mind you still living here, but we got to have some rules. And rule number one is pants."
Sheldon,"Beverly, would you like to see the math I worked out to support our hypothesis?"
Leonard,"You mean, my hypothesis. I hypothesized it all by myself."
Sheldon,"Ooh, good question. Everyone loves stories about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius."
Sheldon,"Ooh, this is a good one."
Sheldon,Tell her about the uranium. Tell her about the uranium.
Sheldon,But I wasnêt. ‚Cause I didnêt have any friends.
Sheldon,I was a handful.
Leonard,"You still are. Uh, Mom, hey, tell Mary the story about how I made a Van der Graaf generator out of our vacuum cleaner."
Howard,"I mean, for a while, everything was vampires. Now itês all zombies. I wonder what the next monster fad will be."
Raj,We havenêt had a good invisible man in a while.
Bernadette,"Guys. In the time youêve been sitting here playing video games, I got the car washed, picked up cleaning supplies and went to the bank."
Bernadette,"Okay, I donêt know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today. You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom."
Raj,"Hey, I donêt even live here."
Bernadette,"Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?"
Raj,"I do. And some of itês wool, so dry flat if possible."
Sheldon,"Oh, and hereês a picture of me receiving my bachelor of science degree."
Sheldon,"Well, I had just begun puberty. It was figuratively and literally one of the hairiest moments of my life."
Sheldon,"Oh, true. But all the clenching in the world will not keep testicles in your abdomen."
Penny,"Hey, sorry, got caught up at work. Hi, Beverly."
Penny,"Sorry, I forgot."
Sheldon,You remember my mother.
Penny,"Oh, yes. Hi, Mary."
Penny,"Ah, yeah, now thatês what Iêm talking about."
Leonard,"So, Mom, you havenêt seen Penny since we got engaged."
Penny,"Oh, yeah, let me show you the ring."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, not at all. No, we, uh, found a place online that, uh, repurposes diamond drill bits."
Leonard,We did not. Thatês not true. Can I speak to you alone for a second?
Sheldon,"Oh, sure."
Leonard,It came from Tiffanyês.
Sheldon,"You mean the box, right?"
Leonard,Keep walking.
Penny,Really doesnêt matter to me how much he spent on the ring. I think.
Sheldon,Did I misspeak about the ring?
Leonard,"Yes, and weêll get back to that. But, uh, even with your mother here, you are deliberately hogging all the attention from my mom. Youêre like one of those elephant seal pups that steals the milk from two mothers."
Sheldon,Do you mean what marine biologists refer to as super weaning?
Leonard,"Yes, you are a super weaner."
Sheldon,"Well, now I have to correct you. As a bit of an elephant seal buff, the more accurate comparison would be when two mother seals actively seek to nourish the same pup. So I believe the term youêre looking for is a double mother suckler."
Leonard,"Yeah, youêre right. That is the term Iêm looking for. You are a dirty double mother suckler."
Sheldon,"Okay, well, now that we have the terminology straightened out. How dare you."
Penny,Weêre not in a rush. Weêll set a date when the time is right.
Penny,"Hey, look at that. You both believe in Jewish bearded guys."
Penny,"Why donêt we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe, you know, like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are."
Sheldon,It is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you.
Leonard,"Oh, donêt flatter yourself. She likes everybody better than she likes me."
Raj,How old is this Jell-O?
Howard,Sorry we have to do this.
Raj,"Yeah, maybe itês a good thing if she stops babying you so much."
Howard,She doesnêt baby me.
Howard,"For your information, I twisted my ankle chasing the ice cream truck."
Raj,"Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you the same way your mother used to, and that was not a healthy relationship."
Howard,"Youêre right. Itês time for me to act like an adult in this marriage. Starting with my husbandly duty of taking out the trash. Bernie, I made a mess."
Sheldon,"Oh, itês all right. Sheêll forgive you. She has to or she goes to hell."
Sheldon,"Well, you doled out affection as a reward for achievement, a proven way to raise a child. Or train a rat."
Sheldon,"Iêd feign modesty at this point, but who would believe me? Still, you need to consider how successful Leonardês brother and sister are."
Sheldon,While my brother and sister are mouth-breathing idiots.
Sheldon,"Perhaps. But my mom made me spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs whenever I wanted, so who cares?"
Leonard,"Not once did my mother ever give me any love or affection for just being myself, I always had to earn it."
Penny,"Yeah, and you certainly donêt have to earn my love."
Leonard,Thank you.
Penny,"Of course, you already knew that when you bought me this princess-cut drill bit."
Leonard,Thatês not what it is.
Penny,"I know, I know. Zzzzzzzz."
Penny,"Well, come on now, she did kind of start it."
Leonard,"Oh, me."
Penny,"Yeah, me, too."
Leonard,I donêt really feel I deserve it.
Howard,"That was a big sticky mess, but I think I got it."
Raj,Looks good.
Bernadette,Look at that. You cleaned it up all by yourself.
Howard,"Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself. Honestly, I donêt know why you complain soÑ okay, maybe I missed one spot. Just leave."
Leonard,"Okay, Mom, letês get you back to your hotel before anyone says anything else."
Leonard,"Oh, really? Thatês too bad."
Sheldon,I taught her that.
Leonard,Wow. When does that start?
Penny,"Itês okay, go ahead."
Leonard,"Oh, my mother."
Penny,"Oh, my God."
Amy,Can you believe itês been five years since our first date?
Sheldon,I know. Do you think I should start watching The Flash TV show?
Amy,Thatês what youêre thinking about?
Sheldon,"Well, one of the things."
Amy,Are any of them me?
Sheldon,"Yes. I thought, I canêt decide if I should watch The Flash TV show. I know, Iêll ask Amy. Anyway."
Amy,What are you doing?
Sheldon,"Youêre right, you did kind of kill the mood."
Amy,"I didnêt kill anything. You did, talking about your stupid TV show."
Sheldon,Excuse me. Starting to watch a television show that might run for years isnêt a decision to take lightly. Iêm wrestling with a big commitment issue here.
Amy,"Really? Thatês the commitment issue youêre wrestling with? Sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation on a man with super speed, while after five years all I can get out of you is a distracted make-out session on a couch?"
Sheldon,"Ironyês not really my strong suit. But I have been getting better with sarcasm, if you want to give that a try."
Amy,"Oh, sure, Iêd love to."
Sheldon,Whenever youêre ready.
Raj,Ooh. Hot date?
Raj,"Youêre kidding, right?"
Raj,"I guess Iêm just more of a Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel kind of guy. Maybe Pier 1 if I really want to cut loose."
Raj,"No, no, no. Hey, you should totally get it. In fact, Iêll buy it for you."
Leonard,That was really intense.
Penny,"Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmersê market, the order is petting zoo first, then buy vegetables."
Sheldon,"Oh, good. Youêre here. I need your assistance."
Leonard,Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?
Sheldon,What happened?
Penny,"Oh, your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals."
Sheldon,Been there.
Penny,Mmm. So what do you need help with?
Sheldon,"Amyês mad at me, and Iêm not clear why."
Penny,Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?
Penny,Thatês probably it. Whatêd you say to her?
Sheldon,"Well, I just asked her if I should start watching the new Flash TV series."
Penny,And that made her angry?
Sheldon,"Baffling, right? We were necking like a couple of hooligans under the school bleachers. I stopped so I could ask the question. Next thing I know, good-bye, kissy face. Hello, yelly face."
Penny,"Well, Sheldon, when youêre kissing a girl, she expects the attention to be on her."
Sheldon,It was. I asked her if she thought I should watch The Flash.
Penny,Yeah. Iêm tapping out. Leonard?
Leonard,Iêm gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment of watching an entire season of a new show.
Sheldon,"Oh, no, not just a season. If Iêm in, Iêm in for the whole run, even if the quality declines."
Leonard,I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.
Sheldon,"Yeah. Exactly. You know, I waited ten years to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly."
Penny,"Wait, what is wrong with you two? He was talking about television during their date night."
Sheldon,"Oh, not just date night, our fifth anniversary."
Penny,"Okay, see, thatês even dumber than you wondering if being bitten by a goat would give you the powers of a goat."
Sheldon,"If that happens, donêt make me wait ten years to watch you eat a tin can."
Raj,You guys ever notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side?
Bernadette,You mean êcause she has weird tattoos?
Raj,"No, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard."
Howard,One more time?
Raj,"She and I were supposed to watch the new Avengers movie tonight, but it was sold out. So I said, what else do you want to do? She said, letês go to a cemetery and do it on somebodyês grave."
Howard,"Like, a random person or somebody she knew?"
Raj,What difference does it make?
Howard,"Well, if itês her fatherês grave and they didnêt get along, then you know she holds a grudge."
Bernadette,"The only issue is that everybody has their own thing, and as long as itês two consenting adults, I guess I donêt see the harm in it."
Raj,"Well, what if itês one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent because heês afraid of being alone?"
Bernadette,"Well, then I guess bring a blanket. The grass gets damp at night."
Raj,"I donêt know, guys. Maybe this relationship isnêt for me. Maybe I should break up with her."
Howard,Right. Youêre gonna break up with a girl who has sex with you. Can you believe this guy?
Bernadette,"I think if Raj wants to break up with a girl, he can do it."
Howard,How are you saying that with a straight face?
Bernadette,I donêt know.
Raj,You guys are being jerks.
Howard,"Buddy, other than Jenny Craig, youêve never broken up with a girl in your life."
Raj,Youêre one to talk. Youêve been complaining about Stuart living here for the past year. I donêt see you showing him the door.
Howard,"Thatês not the same thing. Emilyês a person. Stuartês more like an infestation, something you spray for."
Raj,"Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid of hurting someoneês feelings as I am."
Bernadette,Thatês not true. We were just laughing right in your face.
Penny,Thanks for cooking.
Leonard,Mmm. My pleasure.
Penny,That carrot was delicious.
Leonard,Yeah. I wish Iêd fought harder for the rest of êem.
Penny,Still havenêt heard from her?
Sheldon,"No, and Iêm confused. Itês been nearly 24 hours. Amy should have figured out sheês wrong by now."
Penny,"Hey, I donêt think sheês wrong about you going too slow in the relationship."
Sheldon,Too slow?
Penny,"Yeah, youêve been going out for years. You havenêt even slept together."
Sheldon,Thatês right. Itês called foreplay. And I could make the case that you two arenêt moving forward in your relationship.
Penny,"Uh, hello."
Penny,"Sheldon, weêre getting married."
Sheldon,"But youêve been engaged for over a year now, and you donêt even have a wedding date."
Penny,"Well, we will. Weêre just not in a rush."
Leonard,Weêre gonna set a date.
Sheldon,Okay. If you say so.
Penny,"Yeah, itês just, things are good right now."
Leonard,Really good.
Penny,Iêm focusing on my job.
Leonard,And weêve been busy with our paper.
Penny,So busy.
Leonard,"Yeah, weêll pick a date when we pick a date."
Penny,"You know, I can see why Amyês mad at you."
Sheldon,"Yeah, shut up, Sheldon."
Bernadette,Did you eat all my yoghurt?
Howard,You mean the one that makes ladies do the thing that ladies pretend they donêt do even though they do?
Bernadette,You know which yoghurt I mean.
Howard,I didnêt touch it. Must have been Stuart.
Bernadette,Maybe Raj is right. Maybe itês time we tell him he needs to move out.
Howard,We should have done it months ago.
Bernadette,"I know, but his store was reopening, and then there were the holidays, and then he was sick."
Howard,"Yeah, right. Sick. He didnêt have jaundice. He just looks like that."
Bernadette,All right. Tonightês the night.
Howard,"Agreed. When he gets home, Iêm dropping the hammer."
Bernadette,"Ooh, I like when you take charge."
Howard,"Oh, Iêm not taking charge, youêre the hammer."
Leonard,"So, why havenêt we picked a date?"
Penny,You know why.
Leonard,"Well, of course I know why. But just for fun, why?"
Penny,"Not in a rush, busy with workÑ"
Sheldon,Things are good right now.
Penny,Really good.
Leonard,"You still want to get married, right?"
Penny,"Oh, my God. Yes. Why would you even ask that?"
Leonard,I donêt know. Because we donêt have a date?
Penny,"Well, you want a date, pick a date."
Leonard,"Itês not just the date. We havenêt talked about anything. Big wedding, small wedding, indoor, outdoor?"
Sheldon,Outdoor? Oh. I can RSVP no right now.
Penny,"Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?"
Leonard,Is your dad paying for it?
Penny,I doubt it.
Leonard,"Okay, two friends each."
Penny,"All right, well, I want it in a church."
Leonard,Fine. I want black-tie.
Penny,Fine. I want to release butterflies.
Sheldon,Seriously? Airborne worms?
Leonard,"Okay. Well, then itês settled. Small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies."
Penny,Sounds perfect.
Sheldon,You still didnêt pick a date.
Penny,Stay out of it.
Leonard,Shut up.
Raj,"Oh, yes, weêve got the moon and the trees and Elizabeth McNulty, who apparently died when she was the same age I am."
Raj,"So does enjoying a meal at a well-lit restaurant, but here we are."
Raj,"Of ghosts, no. Of you, little bit."
Sheldon,Iêm sorry Iêve upset you. I shouldnêt have asked so many questions.
Penny,"No, itês okay."
Leonard,"Yeah, maybe itês good you got us talking about this stuff."
Sheldon,"Well, look at that, even when Iêm causing problems, I make the world a better place. Hey, next, why donêt we tackle your penchant for whining and Pennyês love of the olê glug-glug?"
Penny,"Uh, Sheldon, I think weêre good for now."
Sheldon,"Ah, well, very well. So does this mean youêll finally pick a wedding date?"
Penny,Here we go again. Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date? Weêre committed to each other. Weêre happy. A ceremony isnêt gonna change anything.
Sheldon,"So youêre never getting married? Itês his whining, isnêt it?"
Leonard,"Sheldon, Iêm not a whiner."
Sheldon,Itês amusing that he doesnêt hear it.
Leonard,"Look, all sheês saying is we are in love so it doesnêt matter if we get married tomorrow or a year from now or 50 years from now."
Penny,"Ew, 50? Weêll be old and gross."
Leonard,"Yeah, but weêll be old and gross together."
Sheldon,"My aunt and uncle were married 63 years. Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt."
Penny,"Um, Iêm free tonight."
Leonard,Are you saying you want to get married?
Penny,Vegas isnêt that far away.
Leonard,Iêm in. Letês do it.
Sheldon,After all these years. Iêm really happy for the two of you.
Penny,"Oh, thank you."
Sheldon,Now get out of my spot.
Howard,"Bernie, Stuart just pulled up. So remember, the key is to be firm. Show no weakness."
Howard,Good luck.
Bernadette,"Howard Joel Wolowitz, you get back here."
Howard,Never should have told you my middle name.
Howard,"Hey, you got a minute?"
Bernadette,Donêt let that sway you.
Howard,Itês hard not to. They taste so much better than real berries.
Bernadette,"So, we need to talk."
Raj,I think we should talk.
Bernadette,"Well, youêve been living here a while now."
Howard,His middle name is David. Go.
Raj,"Look, I care about you a lot, but we are very different people."
Raj,"No, no, Iêm just pointing out that youêre dark on the inside and Iêm dark on the outside."
Bernadette,"So, anyway, what Iêm trying to say isÑ "
Howard,You need to take that?
Raj,End things? Iêm trying to tell you that I love you.
Penny,"Wow, thereês a Dennyês in Vegas you can actually get married in."
Leonard,Doesnêt sound very romantic.
Penny,"Yeah, but we could get heart-shaped pancakes."
Leonard,Iêm sure weêll find a decent chapel.
Penny,Yeah. This is crazy.
Leonard,I know. You think people are gonna be mad?
Penny,"Maybe. But this isnêt about them, itês about us."
Leonard,It is. It is about us.
Penny,"And you know what the best part is? We took our time. I mean, we met, we were friends for a couple years, then we got together, and then we got untogether, then we worked out all our problems, and now we know everything about each other, we can just go forward with no surprises and no regrets."
Leonard,Right. No surprises.
Penny,And no regrets.
Leonard,"Uh, well, there, thereês one thing I feel I should tell you."
Leonard,"You know, so we can go into this with no secrets between us."
Leonard,"Remember, uh, a couple years back when I was on that research ship in the North Sea?"
Leonard,"Okay, well, there, there was a lot of drinking and craziness going on."
Penny,"No, you told me."
Leonard,"Okay, um, well, there was this girl."
Penny,What did you do?
Leonard,Nothing really. It was just kissing.
Penny,And then what?
Leonard,"And then nothing. I stopped it. But it still bothers me, and I wanted you to know."
Penny,All right.
Leonard,Did you ever do anything like this since weêve been?
Penny,"Nope, never."
Leonard,"Oh, thatês too bad."
Penny,"You know, can I ask you a question?"
Penny,Why are you telling me this now?
Leonard,"Well, like I said, weêre about to get married, and I, I want a clean slate. No secrets."
Penny,"Really? Because to me, it seems like weêre about to get married and youêre trying to sabotage it."
Leonard,Would you rather I didnêt tell you?
Penny,"No, I donêt want there to be secrets between us."
Leonard,"See, now Iêm confused. I mean, what, what am I supposed to do?"
Penny,"Uh, keep your mouth off other women."
Leonard,"I can do that. Uh, uh, from now on, this mouth, you and food, thatês it."
Penny,"Look, Iêm not happy this happened, but I think I can get past it. I mean, we werenêt engaged at the time, and it was just kissing."
Penny,Just kissing.
Leonard,"It wasnêt even very good. She was a smoker, Iêd just been seasick."
Penny,"Okay, thatês enough. Stop talking."
Leonard,"So, weêre still getting married?"
Leonard,Because we love each other.
Leonard,And itês the happiest day of our lives.
Penny,"Ha-ha, donêt push it."
Sheldon,"Hello. Listen, Iêve been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be, and I thinkÑ"
Amy,"Iêve been thinking about them, too, Sheldon. Being your girlfriend is so challenging. Emotionally, physically. Iêve been incredibly patient for years."
Sheldon,Strongly disagree. Go on.
Amy,"Okay, well, this isnêt easy to say, because I love you, but I need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation."
Amy,I hope you understand.
Amy,"Bye, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Well, Gollum, youêre an expert on rings. What do I do with this one?"
Penny,"So, what package are you thinking?"
Leonard,"Mm, this one comes with music and flowers. Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet."
Penny,Why would we want that?
Leonard,"‚Cause thereês a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who donêt believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist. Letês give them hope."
Penny,Whatever. Put us on the Internet. Iêve always wanted a wedding with a comment section.
Leonard,"If youêre not into this, we can do it another time."
Penny,"No, I want to. Look, weêve put this off long enough. Letês do it."
Leonard,"Aw. Thatês exactly what you said the first time we slept together.  Oh, excuse me. Sheldon. Hey."
Sheldon,"Leonard, have you gotten married yet?"
Leonard,Why?
Sheldon,Good. Donêt do it.
Leonard,Why not?
Sheldon,"Some important new information has come to light. Women are the worst. I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong. No piece of paper ever cut me this deep."
Leonard,What happened now?
Sheldon,Amy has ended our relationship.
Leonard,"Oh, no. Seriously?"
Penny,Whatês going on?
Leonard,Amy broke up with Sheldon.
Penny,She did?
Sheldon,Is Penny crying?
Sheldon,"No, of course not. They thrive on our suffering."
Leonard,"Buddy, Iêm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?"
Sheldon,"Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things."
Leonard,"Sheldon, uh, okay, just because youêre going through this with Amy doesnêt mean that all women are bad."
Penny,"Hey, I just heard about you and Sheldon. Are you okay?"
Amy,Not really. Can you come over?
Penny,"Uh, actually Iêm in Vegas. Leonard and I are about to get married."
Amy,Hold on. Youêre getting married and you didnêt invite me?
Penny,"Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing."
Amy,Wow. Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.
Penny,"Amy, donêt be like that."
Sheldon,Why did I just hear Amyês name?
Leonard,Pennyês on the phone with her.
Sheldon,"Did she say anything about me? Never mind. I donêt care. Well, if you care, you can find out and tell me. Just donêt be shocked when you find out that I donêt care."
Penny,"Okay, will you relax? Youêre not missing anything special."
Penny,"Sheês upset. Look, itês gonna be a great wedding. Look at you in your little suit."
Sheldon,Amyês upset? Is it about me?
Leonard,"No, I think itês because weêre eloping."
Sheldon,"Your marriage is causing her pain? Yeah, great, I take it back. Go ahead and do it. Yay for love."
Amy,Oh. What are you doing here?
Sheldon,"When last we spoke, you said you needed time."
Amy,"Well, itês only been 11 hours."
Sheldon,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours. I made you watch that, you said it was an eternity."
Amy,"Sheldon, when Iêm ready to talk, Iêll let you know."
Sheldon,Very well. You seem to be headed somewhere. May I walk with you?
Sheldon,"Boy, Iêm glad weêre going out again."
Amy,Weêre not back together.
Sheldon,"Why? Is there someone else? Just couldnêt wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?"
Amy,"If you must know, Iêm going to Howard and Bernadetteês to watch the wedding."
Sheldon,And whoês this guy youêre taking?
Amy,Thereês no guy.
Sheldon,"Oh, youêre going to a wedding alone? Thatês sad."
Amy,Iêm not gonna be alone. Iêll be with my friends.
Sheldon,"Your friends? Well, I think you mean my friends. And why wasnêt I invited to this?"
Amy,Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.
Sheldon,We make everyone feel awkward. Thatês our thing.
Leonard,Theyêre running a little behind. Should be pretty soon.
Leonard,"Hey, if youêre hungry, thereês a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door."
Penny,"Thanks, but I donêt like glitter on my scrambled eggs."
Leonard,"I donêt think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay. Look, itês not how I pictured it either, but Iêm still glad weêre doing it."
Penny,"Me, too."
Leonard,You sure?
Leonard,And you promise youêre okay with everything from the car?
Penny,"Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?"
Leonard,Youêre right. Iêm sorry. We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. So what do you think? Should we run next door and grab a bite?
Penny,What if they call our names?
Leonard,"Oh, donêt worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster."
Penny,"Oh, and the fairy tale continues."
Amy,Thank you for doing this.
Bernadette,Our pleasure. You feeling okay?
Amy,"We were together for so long, I honestly donêt know what Iêm feeling."
Howard,"Well, thatês understandable. You forgot. Itês called happy."
Howard,Iêm not saying anything bad. Just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.
Amy,Oh. What was her name?
Bernadette,"For Godês sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?"
Sheldon,I didnêt want to come in. I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable. So Iêll just stay out here and pretend that I donêt have to go to the bathroom.
Bernadette,"Howard, do something."
Howard,Iêm on it.
Amy,"Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better."
Sheldon,I see. And is that why everybody was invited but me?
Amy,"They didnêt invite everybody but you.Bernadette invited me, and Stuart lives here."
Raj,Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?
Leonard,"Oh, the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals."
Leonard,You know what? Itês fine.
Penny,"Really, weêre good."
Leonard,"Yup, just want to get married."
Leonard,This is it.
Penny,I know.
Leonard,I love you.
Penny,"I love you, too."
Penny,"No, thank you."
Leonard,Weêre good.
Sheldon,"Raj, youêre probably wondering why Amy and I arenêt showing any affection to one another."
Raj,Didnêt even crack the top ten.
Sheldon,"Well, you should know that she recently broke up with me."
Amy,I said I needed time to think.
Raj,Iêm sure you guys will figure something out.
Sheldon,You hear that? Raj is devastated.
Bernadette,"Sheldon, shh. The weddingês starting."
Sheldon,"I see whatês happening. Sides are forming. Well, if Bernadetteês on Amyês team, I pick Howard."
Howard,Iêm not taking sides.
Sheldon,"Fine, I guess Iêm stuck with Raj."
Penny,You wrote vows?
Penny,"Well, I donêt have any. Youêre kind of making me look bad."
Leonard,Itês okay. I donêt have to say them.
Penny,"No, no, no, go ahead. Iêll come up with something mushy, youêll cry, we got this."
Leonard,"Penny, we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began. I like to think those atoms travelled 14 billion years through time and space to create us, so that we could be together and make each other whole."
Penny,"Right. Um, okay. Leonard, I mean, youêre not only the love of my life. I mean, youêre my best friend, and, youêve got a friend in me. You got troubles. I got êem, too. There isnêt anything I wouldnêt do for you. We stick together, and we can see it through, êcause youêve got a friend in me."
Penny,He loves that movie.
Leonard,I do.
Bernadette,"Aw, that was beautiful."
Howard,"Yeah. I mean, not like our wedding beautiful."
Bernadette,"No, we totally won."
Sheldon,"Amy, I donêt understand, are we broken up or not? Itês like you canêt make up your mind."
Amy,Itês because youêre not giving me any space to think.
Sheldon,"Well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs youêre toting around have a sell-by date."
Amy,"You know what, Sheldon, youêve made this really easy. Youêre immature, youêre selfish, you just insulted me to my face. I donêt need any more time to think. Weêre broken up."
Sheldon,Will someone take me home?
Raj,"Yeah. Come on, Iêll give you a ride."
Penny,We did it.
Leonard,"Yeah, Iêm so glad you guys could watch."
Howard,Weêll say it was beautiful in the comment section.
Leonard,"No, no, no. Hang on. I believe Iêm supposed to carry you across the threshold."
Penny,Can you?
Leonard,Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV?
Penny,"Okay, letês do it. You gonna make it?"
Leonard,Iêm okay.
Penny,Nicely done.
Leonard,"Thank you. Finally, thereês a Mrs. Hofstadter who isnêt disappointed in me."
Penny,"Well, the night is still young."
Leonard,Everything all right?
Penny,Yeah. I guess.
Leonard,Just tell me.
Penny,"Itês just, when we were kissing, I couldnêt help but picture you with that other girl."
Leonard,"Oh, no. No, come on. I have a friend in you. You said so."
Penny,Youêre right. Just forget it.
Leonard,"Yeah. Okay, listen. If youêre imagining that it was sexy, it wasnêt. We, we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth."
Penny,Did you feel guilty?
Leonard,"No, she had dental insurance."
Penny,Did you feel guilty after kissing her?
Leonard,Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened. I feel guilty every time I see her.
Penny,"What do you mean, every time you see her?"
Leonard,"What do I mean? Boy, thatês a toughie."
Penny,You still see her?
Leonard,"Well, no, not socially. But, you know, just at work."
Penny,You work with her? How could you not tell me that?
Leonard,"I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking"
Penny,"Oh, okay. So youêre saying this is my fault?"
Leonard,"No, of course not. Okay, look, instead of fighting, why donêt we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby? I was trying to lighten the mood. Itês not easy. You try it."
Sheldon,"Hello, Mother."
Sheldon,I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers. Unless youêre open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.
Sheldon,She broke up with me.
Sheldon,"No, Iêll be okay. But I think that Iêd like to send the ring back to you."
Sheldon,Itês over for me. Iêm done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks. They both hurt you on purpose.
Sheldon,Are you going to say itês all part of Godês plan?
Sheldon,"Then no, thank you."
Sheldon,Wasnêt Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?
Bernadette,"I know it hurts now, but itês gonna get better."
Howard,Everythingês gonna be okay.
Amy,Thank you.
Bernadette,Thatês true.
Amy,I just hope I did the right thing.
Amy,Like youêre doing right now?
Leonard,I asked you over and over if you were okay. Why would you go through with the wedding if you werenêt?
Penny,"I thought I was okay, but it turns out Iêm not."
Leonard,"Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift."
Sheldon,"Wow. Well, marriage must agree with you. Well, you are just glowing."
Leonard,Iêm not glowing. Iêm upset.
Sheldon,"Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you."
Sheldon,"Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny?"
Penny,Whatês this?
Sheldon,"Leonard told me what happened, so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage."
Penny,Oh. Thatês so sweet of you.
Sheldon,"Yeah. I know. Turns out, being sweet isnêt enough to keep a girl these days. I blame Madonna."
Penny,Iêm sorry to hear about you and Amy.
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm sorry about Leonard. Thought I raised him better than that."
Penny,"You know, itês bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university."
Sheldon,He does? Who is it?
Penny,Some girl named Mandy.
Sheldon,Mandy Chao?
Sheldon,"Oh, you donêt need to worry about her. Sheês brilliant and attractive. She can do way better"
Penny,Thatês great.
Sheldon,"Wait a minute. I know this may sound far fetched, but Iêm on the market now. You know, if I dated Mandy, that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson."
Penny,Thatês ridiculous.
Sheldon,"Oh, youêre right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low sheêd be with Leonard."
Penny,Iêm with Leonard.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I know. Forever. Who would have believed these things would happen to us?"
Penny,Right? I canêt believe Amy actually went through with it.
Sheldon,Hang on. You knew that she was going to end it with me? Did you try and stop her?
Penny,I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.
Sheldon,Do what makes her happy? She plays the harp and her car is paid for. How much happier can she be?
Penny,"Okay, look, itês not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend."
Sheldon,"I see. Well, I think Iêll be going."
Sheldon,"No, no, no, no. We are done here. Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?"
Sheldon,"Thank you. And slam it hard, because I am pretty steamed."
Howard,"All right, Leonard, hang in there. Talk to you tomorrow."
Bernadette,What happened? They just got married.
Howard,I donêt know. Itês a mess. They had a huge fight in Vegas.
Bernadette,Think theyêll break up?
Howard,I donêt know. Sounds pretty bad. Pennyês back in her apartment all by herself.
Sheldon,Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?
Leonard,"Sure, letês make it an even hundred."
Sheldon,You would never kiss me and make me say I love you and then break up with me.
Leonard,I wouldnêt.
Sheldon,And you know why? ‚Cause youêre a man. The champagne of genders.
Leonard,"Well, I may be a man, but I think Iêm the one that screwed up on this one."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man. All you hear women say is, Iêll just have a salad. You know? Whereês my lip gloss? I think this element should be called radium. That last one was Madame Curie."
Leonard,I figured that out.
Sheldon,You know what? She was kind of an honorary man. She had a penis made of science.
Leonard,Canêt believe Iêm spending my wedding night with you.
Sheldon,Really? I never imagined it any other way.
Sheldon,Why are you up?
Leonard,"How am I supposed to sleep? Iêve been married less than 24 hours, and my wife isnêt speaking to me."
Sheldon,"Perhaps you can think of this n a more positive light. In one day, youêve managed to do what it takes many couples decades to achieve."
Penny,You couldnêt sleep either?
Leonard,Of course not.
Sheldon,"Me neither. But I just had a tickle in my throat, not profound marital problems."
Leonard,What are we gonna do?
Penny,I donêt know.
Leonard,"Please, tell me how I can fix it."
Sheldon,"Glad you asked. As I see it, thereês a simple solution. Your lips had a dalliance with the lips of another woman. It seems only logical that to restore balance to the relationship, you should find another man and dally with him. And by dally, I mean some hardcore mouth-on-mouth action."
Leonard,"Okay, that is the stupidest thing Iêve ever heard."
Penny,"Actually, I think heês onto something."
Leonard,"You canêt be serious. ‚Cause I messed up and made out with a girl, youêre gonna do the same with a random guy?"
Sheldon,Iêm currently single.
Penny,Thatês true. You are.
Leonard,What is happening?
Sheldon,I will tell you what is happening. I am saving my best friendês marriage.
Amy,"Sheldon, I donêt think you understand how being broken up works. The only way I can sort through my feelings is if there is space between us. Every time I see you, it re-traumatizes me. I go through the pain all over again."
Sheldon,"Well, hello to you, too."
Amy,What do you want?
Sheldon,"I understand weêre no longer a couple, but I would like to remind you that we made a baby together."
Amy,What baby?
Sheldon,A precocious little Internet show known as Fun With Flags.
Amy,Iêm hanging up.
Sheldon,Great. See you in about half an hour.
Amy,"Sheldon, I am not doing Fun With Flags with you."
Sheldon,Why not?
Amy,Because weêre broken up.
Sheldon,"Sonny and Cher made it work. Their variety show kept going long after the divorce, and here we are still talking about them."
Amy,No oneês talking about Sonny and Cher.
Sheldon,"You must be thinking about Donny and Marie, êcause you and I are clearly talking about Sonny and Cher."
Amy,"Sheldon, this has to stop. I know itês hard. Itês hard for me, too. But Iêve seen and talked to you more in the two days weêve been broken up than in the last two months that we were together."
Sheldon,"Well, if you want to see less of me, maybe we should go out again."
Raj,I canêt believe you made out with Mandy Chao.
Leonard,"Well, trust me, I wish it never happened."
Raj,And you knew about this this whole time?
Howard,I did.
Raj,And you didnêt think to tell me?
Howard,Leonard asked me to keep it to myself.
Raj,Letês leave Leonard out of this for the moment. This is about you and me.
Leonard,"Wait, wait, wait, how is my day-old marriage falling apart becoming about you two?"
Raj,Hang on. What do I need to do to make you trust me?
Howard,"You think itês hard having one wife, try having two."
Raj,I bet you told Bernadette all about how he was screwing around with Mandy Chao.
Leonard,"Oh, we didnêt screw around. We just got drunk and made out."
Raj,Whatever. It would have been nice to hear it from you.
Amy,What are you doing here?
Sheldon,Iêm here to return your belongings. Thatês what people whoêve broken up do.
Amy,And you didnêt do your compulsive knocking ritual so I would open the door.
Sheldon,"On the contrary, you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities. Weêre not friends with benefits."
Amy,Just give me the box.
Sheldon,Wait. Donêt you want to go through it to make sure I havenêt forgotten anything?
Amy,Fine. My old scarf.
Sheldon,You wore it the night we went ice-skating. Remember?
Amy,"You mean the night that I went ice-skating, and you stood at the rail googling the symptoms of hypothermia?"
Sheldon,"We made one heck of a team, huh?"
Amy,Whose bra is this?
Sheldon,"Itês not yours? Oh, my. How embarrassing for both of us."
Amy,Itês Pennyês.
Sheldon,"Hey, you broke up with me. It is none of your business whose naked bosom Iêm smooshing around like pizza dough."
Sheldon," Amy. Hmm. Tables work, too. Good to know."
Howard,"Ooh, brownies for girlsê night!"
Bernadette,Hands off. Iêm mad at you.
Howard,"Look, I know itês a lot of money, but the guy at the store said in five to seven years, itêll pay for itself."
Bernadette,What will pay for itself?
Howard,Doesnêt matter. What are you mad about?
Bernadette,"Iêm mad at you for blabbing to me what Leonard did on the North Sea, and Iêm mad that Iêve had to hide this from Penny for two years."
Howard,"And you have every right to be mad about those things. So, why donêt you let me handle the credit card bill this month, huh? I mean, donêt even look at it."
Bernadette,"I mean, if Penny finds out Iêve known all this time and havenêt told her, sheês gonna think Iêm a terrible friend. I wish you never told me."
Howard,And I wish Leonard never told me. Heês the bad guy here.
Bernadette,I guess thatês true.
Howard,"And you let Penny marry him. Compared to that, who cares if I bought a George Clooney limited edition manscaping kit?"
Leonard,"Hi. Iêm calling about your marriage counselling services and was curious what your rate is. Really? Um, okay. Is there any kind of discount for length of marriage? ‚Cause weêre just talking hours here."
Leonard,Call you back. Hey.
Penny,Can we talk?
Leonard,I would love that.
Penny,"All right, look, Iêm sorry I said I was okay with everything before we got married. I hate that weêre going through this, but I donêt know what to do."
Leonard,"If you donêt mind waiting for a Groupon, we can try marriage counselling."
Leonard,"Hey, uh, buddy, can we have some privacy?"
Sheldon,"Oh, of course. Wouldnêt want to intrude. This is yours."
Penny,"Okay, when Iêm done with him, Iêm gonna need more information."
Sheldon,Nothing odd. I just wanted to rub Amyês nose in it.
Penny,"Okay, look, I might be overreacting, but how am I supposed to get past this when I know tomorrow youêre gonna go to work and see this woman?"
Sheldon,"Now, forgive me for eavesdropping, but as I see it, thereês a simple solution."
Leonard,"Wake up, wake up, wake up."
Sheldon,Bring Penny to meet Mandy.
Leonard,Why?
Sheldon,"Well, right now, Pennyês imagination is running wild, but if they meet, that will eliminate the mystery and alleviate her fears. Like when that Sparkletts guy let me look under his eye patch."
Leonard,"Uh, first of all, you made that guy cry."
Sheldon,And we learned that you donêt need an eyeball to do that.
Leonard,"Secondly, I canêt think of a more horrible idea than Penny meeting Mandy."
Penny,Really? Why is that?
Leonard,you actually want to meet her?
Penny,"No, but now that youêre being weird about it, maybe I should."
Leonard,Iêm not being weird. Am I being weird?
Sheldon,Yes. And thatês coming from me.
Leonard,"Fine, you want to meet her?"
Penny,"No, I just want to know that when youêre at work, thereês nothing going on."
Leonard,How many times do I have to tell you? I have no interest in this woman.
Penny,"Yeah, well, maybe she has interest in you."
Sheldon,"In Leonard? Oh, even the Sparkletts guy could see thatês unlikely."
Penny,I guess my big problem is I never saw Leonard as the kind of guy who would do something like this.
Amy,Anybody can make a mistake in a weak moment.
Penny,What do you think?
Bernadette,"I donêt know what to think. But then again, I just found out about it."
Penny,"You know, I fell in love with Leonard because he wasnêt anything like the guys I was used to dating. I mean, I knew those guys werenêt above cheating because thatês usually how we met."
Amy,"Come on, you know Leonardês not like that."
Penny,I want to believe you. I really do. Am I being naive?
Bernadette,"Oh, I donêt know. This is all so new to me. Iêm still processing."
Penny,"You know, he never wouldêve done this when we first met. Heês cockier now."
Amy,Thatês because you made him more confident.
Bernadette,"You know, if you think about it, without you, he never wouldêve grown into the person he is now. I mean, sure, more women might notice him, but I think itês better to have a guy be with you because he wants to be and not because he thinks he doesnêt have any other choice."
Penny,I never thought about it like that.
Bernadette,"Oh, me neither, not until just now."
Sheldon,"Hello. Iêm Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to Sheldon Cooper Presents: Fun With Flags. You may notice that Iêm holding a remote control. Thatês because my cameraperson and co-host, Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, has chosen to end her relationship with me. Iêm going to pause here to let that sink in. Okay. If you need to pause a little longer, just click the pause button. But the show must go on. And thankfully, all the things my girlfriend used to do can be taken care of with my right hand. Anyway, letês not spend any more time talking about her. Weêre here to talk about flags. Tonightês theme, flags of countries that have been torn apart and the women I have a feeling were responsible."
Leonard,You guys have any idea how much it costs to see a marriage counsellor?
Howard,250 dollars an hour. Why?
Raj,How do you know?
Howard,"Bernadette and I have occasionally gone to one to, you know, stay on top of things."
Raj,And Iêm just hearing about this now?
Howard,"Dude, just because weêre best friends doesnêt mean that I have to tell you everything that goes on."
Raj,"You donêt have to, you should want to."
Leonard,"Oh, great, thereês Mandy."
Howard,Why are marine biologists always so cute?
Raj,"I donêt know, but Iêd like to get lost in her Bermuda Triangle."
Leonard,Thatês not helpful.
Howard,Then I wonêt say Iêd like to cover three-quarters of her surface area.
Leonard,Are we done?
Raj,"Not yet, this is fun. Ooh, I know. Iêd let her free my willy. Where you going?"
Leonard,"Iêm gonna ask her if sheêd be willing to talk to Penny, tell her she has nothing to worry about."
Howard,"Leonard, wait."
Howard,Iêd like to SpongeBob her SquarePants.
Raj,Now we are done.
Leonard,"Uh, do you mind if I sit?"
Leonard,"So, um, Iêve been thinking a lot about you and me and the boat."
Leonard,"You know, what we did, when we were drunk."
Leonard,"No, we just made out."
Leonard,"Uh, okay, well, um, I got married recently."
Leonard,"Never gets old. No, no, to a girl. Anyway, I told her what happened between you and me, and sheês concerned about us seeing each other at work."
Leonard,Because I didnêt want there to be any secrets between us.
Leonard,What else would it be?
Leonard,"No, I donêt think so. Although, Penny did say exactly that."
Leonard,"You know, on some level, Iêve always believed that I donêt deserve a woman like her."
Leonard,"I mean, sheês really beautiful. She could have any guy she wants. Which is probably why it took her so many years to tell me she loved me."
Leonard,"Too expensive. Youêd think Iêd be used to women withholding their love. I mean, my mother did. I mean, no matter how hard I tried, she just didnêt have any interest in me."
Leonard,"I wonder if thatês why I have such a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon. I had a dream the other night that I was in a cave and I was nursing a baby, but the baby had Sheldonês head on it."
Raj,"Hey, Leonard, when youêre done, we came up with a bunch more."
Sheldon,"And then the Czech Republic says to Slovakia, I donêt think you understand how being broken up works. Can you believe that? Youêd think that the Czech Republic would try to hold on to what it had, given that itês not as young as it used to be. And I donêt see any other countries lining up to invade its southern borders."
Amy,Iêm gonna kill him.
Sheldon,"But enough about the Czech Republic. Letês talk about the time Moldova made Romania a birthday cake and Romania said it tasted good even though it didnêt. And yet Romania gets dumped. Iêll pause here while you mull that one over. I know, right?"
Penny,"So, you said you had something to tell me."
Leonard,"Okay, yeah, um, do you remember when you accused me of trying to sabotage our wedding?"
Leonard,"Iêve been thinking about it, and you might be right. But the good news is that Iêm pretty sure I know why."
Penny,Iêm listening.
Leonard,"Penny, after all these years, I still feel like maybe I donêt deserve you."
Penny,"Okay, that is the lamest excuse you couldêve possibly come up with. But I get it."
Leonard,You do?
Penny,"Yeah. Yeah, sometimes I worry youêre gonna wake up and leave me for someone more like you."
Leonard,I donêt even understand why youêre with someone like me. Why would I want to be with someone like me?
Penny,"You know what I mean. And, you know, maybe the way Iêve been reacting was me sabotaging this, too."
Leonard,"Well, how about we stop being so scared of losing each other and just be together?"
Penny,That sounds nice.
Leonard,"Good. Because Iêve loved you since the moment we met, and I will keep loving you until the end of time."
Penny,"Oh. Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful thing anyoneês ever said to me."
Leonard,"Yeah? Thatês because youêre beautiful, and your beauty fills my heart with love and song."
Penny,"Itês getting kind of cheesy, Leonard."
Leonard,"Huh? If you think thatês cheesy, buckle up. Penny Hofstadter, will you please stay married to me?"
Penny,"Oh, damn it, you topped it. Should we go to the bedroom and make this marriage official?"
Leonard,"Yes, please."
Penny,"Sheldon, I canêt believe you got us a wedding gift."
Sheldon,"I donêt know why youêre so surprised. I watch movies, I see what people do."
Leonard,What is this?
Sheldon,Plane tickets and hotel reservations for a weekend away in San Francisco.
Penny,Thatês so great.
Sheldon,"Yeah, thereês Fishermanês Wharf and Alcatraz and cable cars. Weêre gonna have so much fun."
Sheldon,Is there a problem?
Penny,"Oh, no, no, I just, I said, Whee."
Amy,How dare you go on the Internet and say mean things about me and compare my genitalia to part of Czechoslovakia?
Sheldon,"You saw through that one, did you?"
Amy,"I donêt know what you were thinking, but take the video down now."
Sheldon,She watched it. Iêm gonna get that girl back.
Amy,I only watched it because you e-mailed it to me with the subject line this is gonna make you mad.
Sheldon,She was listening through the door. She wants me.
Sheldon,Would you pass the mustard?
Leonard,"Sure. Hey, want to hear a fun fact about mustard?"
Sheldon,Is it that the glucosinolates which give mustard its flavour were evolved by the cabbage family as a chemical defence against caterpillars?
Sheldon,"Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard."
Raj,"Hey, there."
Leonard,"Hey, youêre early. The movie doesnêt start for an hour."
Howard,"Actually, weêre not going to the movies. We are here to kidnap you."
Leonard,What are you talking about?
Raj,"Well, you eloped and we didnêt get a chance to throw you a bachelor party, so thereês a van downstairs and weêre here to take you to a surprise location for the weekend."
Sheldon,"Well, Iêd hardly call this kidnapping. Whereês the blindfold? Whereês the duct tape? Whereês the part where you call me and demand ransom and I try to keep you on the phone, but you hang up seconds before I can trace it and then I say Iêm getting too old for this crud?"
Leonard,When do we leave?
Howard,Right now.
Raj,"Yeah, Penny packed you a bag."
Howard,"Wow, okay."
Sheldon,Youêre seriously going to get in a van and let these two take you to an unknown destination for an entire weekend?
Raj,"Oh, not just him, youêre coming, too."
Sheldon,"Oh, and how do you think youêre going to get me to do that?"
Sheldon,Unhand me. This is ridiculous.
Howard,I told you to put tape on his mouth.
Raj,And I told you he bit me.
Sheldon,Itês bad enough Iêm being taken against my will. I donêt see why it has to be in some hippieês mobile sex dungeon.
Howard,"Well, Sheldon, thereês something about this van that youêre going to find very interesting."
Sheldon,It runs on syphilis?
Raj,"This van was owned and driven by your personal physics hero, Richard Feynman."
Howard,Yeah. A buddy of mine let me borrow it.
Leonard,This was Feynmanês van? Thatês so cool.
Raj,"Yeah, nothingês been changed since he drove it."
Howard,I bet he picked up a lot of cute grad students in this bad boy.
Sheldon,"Yeah, and talked about physics with them."
Leonard,"So, are you gonna give us a clue where weêre headed?"
Raj,"Uh, okay, letês see. Theyêve got spicy food and thereês a chance youêll get diarrhoea."
Raj,We can drive there.
Leonard,Your house?
Howard,We are going to Me-hi-co.
Leonard,"Fun, Iêve never been there."
Sheldon,"Leonard, donêt be fooled. Iêm from Texas, Me-hi-co is Spanish for Mexico."
Raj,Whatês wrong with Mexico?
Sheldon,"Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that jump around êcause thereês a worm inside."
Howard,"Okay, calm down. Thereês a theme to this weekend. We are going to Mexico in Feynmanês van to stay at the vacation house Feynman bought with the money from his Nobel Prize."
Sheldon,Viva la Imodium. Ay-ay-ay.
Bernadette,"Come on, Leonardês doing bachelor stuff. You sure we canêt take you to a strip club?"
Penny,"Nah, if I want to see a naked dancing man, I just flush the toilet while Leonardês in the shower."
Amy,"I know weêre not making a fuss, but in the spirit of bachelorette parties, I made cookies in the shape of male genitals."
Penny,"You really didnêt have to, whoa! That is anatomic."
Amy,Thank you. The veins are gummy worms.
Bernadette,"Oh, look, Jewish and gentile."
Amy,I had extra dough.
Penny,"Oh, thatês Leonard. He said theyêre about to cross the border."
Bernadette,I hope the boys donêt get too crazy in Mexico.
Penny,"Oh, yeah, right. Lock up your daughters or Sheldon might lecture them about the North American Free Trade Agreement."
Amy,"Boy, that was a long night for me."
Sheldon,"Uh-oh. According to this Mexican customs website, visitors may not bring more than five laser discs, 20 compact discs or 12 VHS tapes."
Raj,We donêt have any of those.
Sheldon,"How can you be sure? VHS was king when Feynman drove this van. For all we know, there are hidden compartments lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos."
Leonard,"If there was a hidden compartment, donêt you think youêd be stuffed in it by now?"
Sheldon,Are we all up to date on our yellow fever inoculations?
Howard,You donêt need a yellow fever shot to go to Mexico.
Sheldon,You can never be too careful. I got one last year before I went to Epcot.
Amy,"So, Penny, howês married life?"
Penny,"Oh, itês good. I just wish Leonard would work up the courage to tell Sheldon heês moving in here."
Bernadette,You guys still arenêt living together?
Penny,"We are. I mean, he sleeps here. But itês only a matter of time before Sheldon has a bad dream and tries to climb into bed with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows."
Bernadette,"Speaking of Sheldon, howês single life treating you?"
Amy,"Fine, I guess. Iêve been focusing on me. I was thinking about changing my wardrobe."
Bernadette,Good for you.
Amy,But then I decided I donêt want to go changing who I am just because of some man.
Bernadette,Good for you.
Penny,"You know, it is normal to want to change your look after a breakup."
Amy,"Actually, I was thinking of making one small change."
Bernadette,Your sweater?
Penny,Your glasses?
Bernadette,Your hair?
Penny,Your shoes.
Amy,Piercing my ears.
Bernadette,You really never had that done?
Amy,"My mom said pierced ears were for whores, pirates and genies."
Penny,"Okay, well, youêre a grown woman now."
Amy,"I know, but Sheldon had this clause in the Relationship Agreement forbidding cosmetic surgery unless itês to look like a Klingon."
Bernadette,Weêll take you to the mall to get it done.
Penny,Why? I can do it right here.
Amy,Really? You have a piercing gun?
Penny,"All you need is a needle and an ice cube. Iêve done it, like, a dozen times."
Amy,"Oh, I donêt know."
Penny,"Oh, come on. Iêll be gentle. Let me take your ear virginity."
Bernadette,This partyês weird.
Leonard,"Hey, watch your speed. I hear the Mexican police target tourists."
Howard,"Oh, not a problem. If anything goes down, we just put Koothrappali in the driverês seat and slap a sombrero on his head."
Raj,"Dude, how many races can you offend in a single breath?"
Howard,I donêt know. Have you watched the Olympics with me?
Leonard,"Sheldon, can you believe that weêre driving in a van that was owned by one of the greatest scientific minds of the 20th century? Itês like the Batmobile. If Batman was real and a physicist and his car wasnêt cool."
Sheldon,It is extraordinary.
Raj,"Perhaps some of his mojo will rub off on us. Maybe between this and his beach house, we will be inspired to greatness."
Sheldon,"I usually donêt put too much stock in charms and talismans. However, even I must admit feeling Richard Feynmanês butt dent cupping my own bottom that does get the creative juices flowing."
Howard,"Hey, I have to return this van. Keep your creative juices in your pants."
Sheldon,What was that?
Howard,I think itês a tyre.
Sheldon,What if itês banditos shooting at us? What if we get kidnapped? What if we end up in a factory making Bart Simpson pi_atas for the rest of our lives?
Howard,Itês the tyre.
Sheldon,I am getting too old for this crud.
Bernadette,"Amy, I noticed your status still says in a relationship on Facebook."
Amy,"Youêre right. I should probably let all of my Facebook friends know. Penny, Iêm no longer in a relationship."
Bernadette,Did you change yours to married yet?
Penny,"Uh, no, not yet. Thereês still a few people I havenêt told personally."
Penny,"Oh, just my parents and my entire family."
Penny,"Well, I donêt want to hurt my dad. You know, he always wanted to dance with his daughter at her wedding."
Bernadette,What about your sisterês wedding?
Penny,"They started to, then her water broke. You know, if he finds out we eloped, itês gonna break his heart."
Amy,How long do you think you can keep it from him?
Bernadette,"Yeah, isnêt it gonna get worse the longer you wait?"
Penny,"Well, not necessarily. You know, Dadês not getting any younger, so if I wait long enough, Iêll just tell him he walked me down the aisle and it was magical."
Raj,When did you learn how to change a tyre?
Howard,Every self-respecting gentleman should know how in case he comes across a damsel in distress by the side of the road.
Sheldon,"If I see one scorpion, I am getting on someoneês shoulders and never coming down."
Leonard,And thereês your damsel.
Howard,"Wow, this oneês really stuck."
Raj,Are you turning it the right way?
Howard,"I took the other four off and when I got to this one, I thought, you know, Iêm in a rut, letês shake things up."
Raj,"Here, let me try. Youêre right, it doesnêt turn the other way."
Penny,There you go. Youêre all done.
Amy,"That wasnêt so bad. Nice. Boy, if my mom could see me now, sheêd lock me in the sin closet."
Bernadette,"Thatês a joke, right?"
Amy,"Actually, the joke was on her. I could still see the TV through the slats."
Penny,Iêm starting to see why you and your mom arenêt very close.
Bernadette,Bet sheêd still tell her if she got married.
Penny,"Youêre not gonna let this go, are you?"
Amy,"Well, itês kind of sad that they donêt know. I mean, they love Leonard."
Penny,"Fine, you want me to call? Iêll call. Why am I so nervous?"
Bernadette,Itês understandable. Amy was afraid to tell her mom she broke up with Sheldon.
Penny,Yeah? How did it go? Did she make you crawl into the breaking-up drawer?
Amy,"Uh, well, actually, to be honest, I havenêt told her yet."
Penny,Youêve been giving me a hard time and you havenêt even told your mom about Sheldon?
Amy,Iêm feeling a little dizzy from all the blood loss. I donêt know what youêre talking about.
Penny,"Fine. Iêm calling home, but when Iêm done, youêre calling your mother."
Amy,Easy for you to say. You never had to watch 60 Minutes like this.
Penny,"Hey, Daddy."
Penny,"Uh, good. Is Mom around?"
Penny,"Okay, Iêll talk to her later. Uh, Dad, thereês something I need to tell you. Leonard and I got married."
Penny,"Last week. Iêm sorry, I shouldêve told you. It was a spur of the moment thing. I feel terrible. Please donêt be too disappointed."
Penny,Very. Leonard is so great.
Penny,"Aw, thank you, Daddy. That means so much."
Penny,It is. Youêre the best dad ever.
Penny,"Well, what is it?"
Penny,You killed my pig?
Penny,You didnêt tell me for a year?
Bernadette,"Okay, Amy, your turn."
Howard,What are you doing?
Raj,Itês called Lamaze breathing. It helps you push.
Howard,Great. Heês pushing with his uterus.
Raj,Thereês got to be a smarter way of removing it.
Leonard,"Yeah, this is nothing more than a physics problem."
Sheldon,"Right. Archimedes once said give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world."
Raj,Of course. All we need is to find stuff to make a lever big enough to fix this.
Howard,Exactly. Iêll bet thereês something around here that could be a lever.
Leonard,"Letês see, a lever, a lever."
Sheldon,"Everybody hold on. Letês take this problem one step at a time. First, we need to decide whether weêre calling it leever or lehver. And the sooner we decide itês leever, the sooner we can roll up our sleeves, not slehves, and get to work."
Leonard,Weêre gonna be here foreever.
Penny,"Thanks a lot, guys."
Bernadette,What did we do?
Penny,"Before I made that call, my pig was alive and happy and rolling around in the mud. Now heês illegally buried in our backyard next to my great-grandmother."
Bernadette,Really? They didnêt eat him?
Penny,He was a beloved member of the family.
Bernadette,The breakfast meat family?
Penny,Itês not funny. Youêre up. Call your mother.
Amy,"Oh, maybe later. Your pig dying made me sad. And a little hungry."
Penny,"Phone, now."
Amy,"Okay. Okay. Fine. Hi, Mom."
Penny,Try dialing.
Amy,"You saw that, huh? Hi, Mom. How are you doing? Oh, good. Howês work? Thatês nice. Iêm fine. Hey, listen, Iêve been meaning to ask, how come Aunt Doe and Aunt Florence never got along?"
Penny,"Okay, just give me that. Amy broke up with Sheldon, she got her ears pierced and she made us eat penis cookies. Hang on. She wants to talk to you."
Leonard,I donêt think the leverês working.
Howard,What makes you say that?
Leonard,Thereês gotta be something else we could try.
Raj,"If this was Star Trek, we could use a phaser to blast it off."
Howard,"No, itês too broad of a beam. Youêd need something more precise, like Supermanês heat vision."
Sheldon,"Ooh, the Green Lanternês ring could make a big green hand that unscrews it."
Raj,"If you need a green hand, why not just use the Hulk?"
Sheldon,"Oh, please, the Hulk would never get across the border with that temper."
Leonard,"Guys, excuse me, not that calling one of the Avengers isnêt a perfectly reasonable choice, but weêre scientists. Donêt you think we can figure this out using actual science?"
Sheldon,"Yes, we could use science. But itês your bachelor party. Lighten up."
Howard,"We will, we will percussive shock you."
Sheldon,"Buddy youêre a boy, make a big noise playinê in the street, gonna be a big man someday. You got mud on your face, you big disgrace, kickinê your can all over the place. I have an eidetic memory. Sometimes itês a curse."
Raj,I had no idea tortilla chips were such a good fuel source.
Leonard,Theyêre basically pure hydrocarbons soaked in fat. Letês hope the lug nut expands.
Sheldon,What if that burning food attracts animals?
Howard,We have plenty of food for the animals.
Sheldon,We do?
Howard,Yep. A six-foot wiener in a Flash T-shirt.
Sheldon,Thatês not very nice.
Leonard,Itês a bachelor party. Lighten up.
Sheldon,What is that awful smell?
Howard,Itês burning salsa. Iêm hoping the acidity and salinity combined with electricity will corrode the lug nut off.
Sheldon,What an innovative solution. Perhaps I donêt give your MIT education enough credit.
Howard,"Yeah, I saw it on Mythbusters."
Sheldon,"All right, this rust, combined with the aluminium recovered from the van, is now thermite."
Howard,Great. Couple of pinches ought to do the trick.
Raj,Is that enough to melt the lug nut?
Leonard,"Well, letês start small. We can always add more."
Howard,"You put up a good fight, lug nut, but youêve met your match."
Raj,"Hey, look, the lug nutês off."
Penny,What are you doing back?
Leonard,We got a flat and couldnêt get the tyre off.
Penny,"Oh, Iêm sorry."
Leonard,Thank you.
Penny,"If it makes you feel any better, I pierced Amyês ears and her mom made her sit in my closet."
Sheldon,We blew up Feynmanês van.
Penny,My dad killed my pig with his tractor.
Leonard,I spent the night in Mexico with Sheldon.
Penny,You win.
Sheldon,"What a wonderful day, thank you."
Penny,"Oh, weêre glad you had fun."
Sheldon,"Blue Icees and a trip to The Container Store? Itês like I died and went to the post-mortem, neuron-induced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven."
Leonard,I still donêt understand why you bought that pill caddie. Youêre a young man.
Sheldon,"Age is a state of mind, Leonard. In here Iêm 90. Why are you taking your bins over there?"
Leonard,"Itês just where I need them. You know, she doesnêt have a lot of closet space."
Sheldon,Whatês wrong with your closet?
Penny,"Uh, well, honey, you know, now that Leonard and I are married, it kind of makes sense that we actually live together."
Sheldon,So thatês all this day was? A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?
Leonard,"Come on, buddy."
Sheldon,"No, I thought we were friends. You asked for a sip of my Icee. If you had your own straw, I mightêve said yes."
Penny,"Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this."
Sheldon,"You know what they donêt sell at The Container Store? Something large enough to contain my disappointment. Although, if anyone did, it would be them."
Sheldon,Thank you for letting me come speak with you.
Bernadette,Of course.
Sheldon,"As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained, Iêm turning to you for female comfort and encouragement."
Bernadette,Aw. Iêm honoured.
Sheldon,"I tried reaching out to my mother, but she was in Bible study. Leonardês mother is on a book tour. My Mee-Maw was taking a nap, and after a while Siri started repeating her answers."
Bernadette,"So, Iêm your seventh choice."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I know, top ten, pretty exciting."
Bernadette,How can I help you?
Sheldon,"Well, in addition to Amy leaving me, Leonardês moving in with Penny. Itês difficult not to feel abandoned."
Bernadette,"Well, why donêt you look at this as an opportunity? You had other roommates before Leonard. Maybe this is a chance to find someone new."
Sheldon,Perhaps I could find someone better than Leonard. Someone I can rub in his face. Chris Prattês all the rage right now. I wonder how heêd feel about taking the smaller bedroom.
Bernadette,Hey. You know who would be the perfect roomie?
Sheldon,"Gandalf, but heês a smoker."
Bernadette,Stuart. Heês been living with us for a while now. Iêm sure heêd love to get us out of his hair.
Bernadette,"Well, Sheldonês looking for a roommate."
Bernadette,Heêll think about it.
Raj,Have you seen this Archie comic? Itês actually Archie versus Predator.
Howard,How could Archie defeat Predator?
Raj,I donêt know. Maybe Jugheadês a Terminator.
Howard,"Hey, Stuart."
Howard,What kind of music are you thinking of?
Raj,"Hey, weêve always talked about playing together."
Howard,"Well, it could be fun to try a little acoustic thing."
Raj,"Oh, we could play filk music."
Raj,"Itês been around for years. Itês like folk music, but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme."
Raj,"Dude, if we do this, weêre gonna need a cool band name."
Howard,"You know, Iêve actually had one Iêve been sitting on for years."
Howard,"It was for this power trio I tried to put together in junior high, but I was short two friends."
Raj,What is it?
Howard,Footprints on the Moon.
Raj,I just got chills.
Howard,So did I.
Sheldon,"Just a few more signatures, and weêll be finished. Initial here to acknowledge that youêve returned your key. Okay. As my future neighbour, Iêd like you to have a key. Initial here to acknowledge you received it."
Penny,Iêm proud of you. Youêre taking this really well.
Sheldon,"Well, itês not like Iêm never going to see you two again. Which brings us to article 23 subsection C, please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion."
Leonard,Do I really have to do that now?
Sheldon,"No, but if you want chicken and get stuck with the fish, thatês on you. All right. Oh, and lastly, please initial here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the universe and all alternate universes except for those universes where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen. In which case, all glory to the hive queen. All right, now all thatês left is for us to sign and date the document, and we will officially no longer be roommates."
Penny,Whatês the matter?
Leonard,Itês harder than I thought.
Sheldon,Let me help you. L. E. O. N.
Leonard,That helped.
Raj,"So I have an idea for a filk song. Itês kind of a, a power ballad, superhero crossover tale of epic proportions."
Howard,"Is it cold in here, êcause, oh, my."
Raj,"Okay, so itês a, itês a David and Goliath story. Itês about man against God. Itês called Hammer and Whip, The Untold Story of Thor versus Indiana Jones."
Howard,Thor versus Indiana Jones? You just blew my filking mind.
Raj,"Okay, I donêt have it all worked out yet, but I was thinking something like, um, Oh, Indy, oh, Indy, the skies are so windy. Is that a flying man with a killer bod? Wait, thatês no man, itês a Norse god."
Howard,"Oh yes, definitely. Hang on. Thunder clapped as Thor raised his mighty hammer. Indy rapped, thatês one bad mamma-jamma."
Raj,"That is, that is so good!"
Howard,Right? Mamma-jamma just came to me.
Raj,"Okay, and hereês the hook. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones."
Howard,"Oh, man, that rocks."
Raj,"Hey, remember The Ark of the Covenant?"
Raj,Thatês how much weêre gonna melt peopleês faces off.
Sheldon,I appreciate your interest in the apartment. I just need to ask you a few standard questions.
Sheldon,It says here youêre a chemist. Which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches?
Sheldon,Looks like argonês not the only one with an attitude problem.
Sheldon,"In general, would you say that you smell better, worse or the same as you do right now?"
Sheldon,"I was going to ask you what is the best fruit, but then I realized what I want to ask you is why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm, but then I realized what I really want to ask you is just can you just go?"
Sheldon,"Youêre healthy. You have a job in the sciences. Iêve got to say, if this credit report comes back good, youêre the frontrunner."
Amy,"Iêm not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"But I met with 11 people, and they all walked out. And that Hollywood phoney Chris Pratt never tweeted me back."
Amy,Iêm sure youêll find somebody else.
Sheldon,"I suppose. What happened to me, Amy? Years ago I was completely disengaged from my feelings. Iêd say it was a happier time, but I was disengaged from my feelings, so who can tell?"
Amy,"I donêt know how to help you. You know, feelings are a part of life."
Sheldon,"They didnêt used to be. You and Leonard and Penny, you all poisoned me with emotions. I was like the Tin Man, perfectly content until that evil wizard gave him a heart."
Amy,I donêt think that was the point of the movie.
Sheldon,"Fine, then I was like Pinocchio before that jerk Geppetto went and made him a real boy."
Amy,There you go.
Penny,"So, what are you thinking for dinner?"
Leonard,"Well, itês Thai food night."
Penny,"Well, honey, you donêt live with Sheldon any more. You can have anything you want."
Leonard,Youêre right. But what? Mexican? Italian? German? Indian? Greek? Cuban? Chinese? Pizza? Barbecue? Korean? Korean barbecue?
Penny,How about Thai food?
Leonard,"Oh, thank God."
Penny,"Hey, weêre going to dinner. You want to come?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I wish I could, but I realized Iêve become too emotionally vulnerable, so, like an operating system, Iêm restoring my life to the last stable version, which was in 2003, the day before I met Leonard."
Leonard,"You heard him, no."
Penny,"Hang on. Wait, you actually think itês 2003?"
Sheldon,"No, just because Iêm living my life like it was 12 years ago doesnêt mean Iêm delusional. And since it is 2003, I donêt know who you are, so please exit the premises before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone."
Penny,Are you doing okay?
Leonard,"I guess. Iêm just, you know, worried about Sheldon."
Penny,"Well, come on, heês a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s. Heês fine."
Leonard,I hope so.
Penny,What else can you do? Move back in with him?
Leonard,"No, of course not. I just feel bad."
Penny,"Well, so do I, but donêt you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when itês time to go to the bathroom, you know, not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?"
Leonard,I did like that he had the weather on it.
Penny,"Trust me, this is the right thing."
Leonard,"I know. And itês not like weêre abandoning him. Plus, we can FaceTime him whenever we want, you know, once iPhones are invented in his universe."
Bernadette,I canêt believe Sheldon asked you to be his roommate.
Amy,I canêt believe he ran my credit.
Bernadette,"Hey, if youêre open to living with someone great, Iêll give you a thousand dollars to take Stuart."
Amy,You really shouldêve gone on the Internet and checked how long that kind of thing lives before you got one.
Bernadette,"Iêm sorry. I just thought you might have a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life."
Amy,"Hey, I know Sheldonês quirky, but heês also brilliant and insightful. I think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair."
Sheldon,"Hello, 2003."
Leonard,"Hey, we brought you Thai. Where is everything?"
Sheldon,"In my present, itês in the future. In your present, itês been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man I met in The Home Depot parking lot."
Leonard,"I know what youêre doing. Youêre trying to get attention so weêll feel bad for you, but itês not happening."
Sheldon,"No, what Iêm doing is trying to figure out how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me."
Leonard,Will you knock it off? Weêre across the hall.
Sheldon,"As the kids are saying today, talk to the hand."
Penny,Theyêre not saying that.
Sheldon,They are in 2003.
Penny,"No, no, theyêre really not."
Raj,"Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One runs from Loki, the other runs from stones. So, what do you think?"
Raj,"Runs from stones means that, that big boulder, but I couldnêt rhyme anything with boulder."
Raj,"Right, yeah, right. But, what do you think?"
Raj,Cute? Itês not cute. Cute is children dressed as vegetables.
Raj,Just be honest. You donêt like it.
Raj,"You can dance to this. Um, uh, uh, Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones."
Raj,"Iêm telling you, dude, the song has no groove, you canêt dance to it."
Howard,Who cares? I thought the whole point of Footprints on the Moon was to write songs that make people think.
Raj,"You can do both, like Michael Jacksonês Billie Jean. While youêre dancing youêre thinking, like, darn it, whose baby is it?"
Howard,"Whereês this coming from? A few hours ago, we both loved this song."
Raj,I still love it. I just think thereês room for improvement.
Howard,"You played it for Emily, didnêt you?"
Raj,"Yeah, so what?"
Howard,"You are such a wimp. She didnêt like it, now you donêt like it."
Raj,"No, no. Iêm just evolving as a musician. Youêre the one whoês stuck in the past."
Howard,The past was lunch. You know whatês really happening here? Your girlfriend is breaking up our band.
Raj,She has nothing to do with this. I am my own man.
Howard,"Oh, please. Your brain belongs to whoeverês willing to sleep with you."
Raj,That is so not true.
Howard,Really? Remember when you were gonna get circumcised for Rachel Bernstein?
Raj,That had nothing to do with Rachel. It was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury.
Howard,I donêt need this. Iêm quitting the band.
Raj,"Fine, I quit, too."
Howard,Then get out of my house.
Raj,With pleasure.
Howard,"Raj, wait."
Raj,What took you so long?
Leonard,"Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but itês not."
Sheldon,"How can you say that? Amyês gone, and you two are married now, so itês only a matter of time before youêre gone, too."
Penny,"Okay, you donêt know whatês gonna happen."
Sheldon,"No, I do. Eventually youêll want more space, and youêll move into a house, and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week, itêll only be a couple of times a month, and then itêll only be on special occasions, like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz. Or, or, or like when Koothrappaliês weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body. Or Amyês wedding, where sheês marrying someone better than me."
Penny,"Okay, look, we donêt need to rush into anything. All right? Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me, we just leave things the way they are, and sometimes weêll sleep over there, and sometimes weêll sleep over here."
Sheldon,But mostly here.
Leonard,"Wuh, what about what you said in the restaurant?"
Penny,"Well, itês not forever. Itês just for a while. If you want, we can think of him like heês our dog."
Sheldon,"You can. Iêm happy when you come home. And Iêm scared of fireworks. By the way, on July Fourth, weêre all sleeping here."
Sheldon,"All right, great. Just give me one minute, and Iêll get started on a new roommate agreement. Yeah. nothing from Pratt, weêre good."
Howard,"Indyê whip snapped, Thorês hammer missed."
Raj,It was Avenger versus archeologist.
Howard,"Indy held his ground, and straightened his fedora."
Raj,"Thor said, thatês a nice look in nineteen fourty-foura."
Leonard,"Hey, ready for lunch?"
Howard,"Oh, one sec."
Sheldon,Is that the prototype drive system for the high-G rover?
Howard,"No, Bernadette got me a Fitbit so she can track how much Iêm exercising."
Leonard,Thatêll teach her to care about your health.
Howard,"Yeah, I canêt wait to see the look on her face when I die young."
Raj,When was the last actual exercise you got?
Howard,"The other day, when she tried to put that Fitbit on me and I ran away from her."
Sheldon,"According to a recent study, simply thinking about exercise, even while sitting still, can have physical benefits. For all you know, I could be exercising right now."
Raj,Are you?
Sheldon,"Nah, Iêll do it tomorrow."
Leonard,It wouldnêt be the worst thing if we were more active.
Howard,"You make an excellent point. Ooh, I think Iêm getting a runnerês high."
Leonard,"Look at all these activities the university has. Rock climbing club, archery, flag football."
Sheldon,"Had me at flag, lost me at football."
Penny,"Yeah, I think itês great you guys want to get more exercise, but do you really think sports is the right choice for you?"
Leonard,What are you saying? Weêre not coordinated enough to play sports?
Penny,"Okay, Leonard, sweetheart, you twisted your ankle playing Scrabble."
Leonard,"I got a triple-word score with a double letter Q. If thatês not a time to bust out the scrabble dance, whatês the point of having one? Hey, Barry Kripke started a fencing club."
Sheldon,Interesting. Sword fighting does hold a certain elegant appeal. And I would imagine it meets many of our personal criteria for a sport.
Leonard,"Itês indoors, so no sunscreen."
Sheldon,"No throwing, no catching, no running."
Leonard,No gym shorts that can be yanked down.
Sheldon,"Or worse, up."
Sheldon,"And as an added bonus, the word touch_ comes from fencing. It would be our only opportunity to use it in a non-metaphorical sense."
Leonard,What about a game of tag on a French schoolyard?
Sheldon,"Ah, touch_."
Bernadette,Sure. So how can we help?
Penny,"All right, well, what have you tried so far?"
Penny,Really? In a comic book store?
Amy,"Well, for starters, you might want to rethink some of this artwork. I mean, this womanês actually on a leash like a dog."
Raj,I feel cool. Like Puss in Boots.
Leonard,I always wanted to be a swashbuckler when I was a kid.
Sheldon,"Technically, swashbuckler is a combination of two terms. Swash referring to the sound of the sword. Swash. And then buckler meaning a small shield, which you donêt have."
Raj,We can still be swashers.
Howard,"Well said, Puss."
Leonard,Thatês not why weêre here.
Raj,"Yeah, Iêm here because I think itês gonna be like Game of Thrones."
Howard,And maybe a little Princess Bride.
Raj,"Ooh, ooh, I forgot about Princess Bride. Thatês my answer."
Sheldon,Weêre not afraid of physical activity.
Howard,Yeah. I already ran 18 miles today.
Sheldon,"Oh, dear."
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm not sure I have a dominant leg. Theyêre both pretty submissive."
Howard,"When youêre in a public restroom, which foot do you flush the toilet with?"
Sheldon,Right. Always right.
Howard,Heês a righty.
Howard,"Oh, God, I am going to feel this tomorrow."
Leonard,This is easy. I didnêt need to wear a cup.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, Barry?"
Sheldon,When can I stab one of my friends?
Sheldon,"Uh, yes, Iêm aware. But if I say I want to touch one of my friends, Iêll get called into Human Resources."
Amy,Have you thought about advertising directly to females?
Penny,"Hey, have you read the online reviews for this place?"
Penny,"All right, well, Heather H says, the owner stared at me the whole time and didnêt blink once. Kelly M says, the creepy guy who runs it asked me out, then called himself stupid before I could say no. Jessica K says, I told the weird owner that I liked his shirt. He took it off and gave it to me."
Raj,Look at us. Weêre like the Rockettes.
Sheldon,"En garde, Leonard. Prepare yourself for a rigorous touching."
Howard,My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Raj,My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Howard,I thought you were Puss in Boots.
Raj,"Oh, yeah, right. Sorry. My name is Puss in Boots. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
Sheldon,Iêm looking forward to him teaching us glove-slapping.
Sheldon,"You know, when my honour is insulted, and I need to challenge someone to a duel by slapping them across the face with my glove."
Leonard,When was your honour insulted?
Sheldon,My last physical.
Leonard,"Again, that doctor didnêt insult your honour. Just checked your prostate."
Raj,My name is Little Orphan Annie. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Howard,My name is Darth Vader. I am your father. Prepare to die.
Sheldon,"Ah, this is fun."
Leonard,"Well, good. Itês nice to see your mind off Amy."
Sheldon,"Not that itês any of your business, but she broke up with me."
Sheldon,Good to know? Whatês that supposed to mean?
Leonard,"Oh. I hate to say it, but it sounds like heês interested in her."
Sheldon,"Well, thatês unacceptable."
Leonard,"Oh, buddy, I get that you donêt like it, but itês not really up to you."
Sheldon,"Yeah, but heês dumb, and his face is dumb."
Leonard,"Look, even if itês not him, Amyês probably going to date someone at some point."
Sheldon,You really think so?
Leonard,Of course. She deserves to be happy.
Sheldon,How dare you.
Leonard,"Listen, I should warn you that maybe asking Amy out isnêt a good idea."
Sheldon,"Barry, a word?"
Leonard,And now the crazy version of what I just said.
Sheldon,"If you intend to pursue Amy, you leave me with no choice but to put a stop to it."
Sheldon,By challenging you to a duel.
Sheldon,"That is why the duel will take place at high noon, three years from today. If youêre worth your salt as an instructor, I should be ready by then. Yeah, and be warned. Iêm going to touch you all over."
Leonard,"Wow. That, that was crazier than I thought."
Bernadette,You are.
Amy,You can say it.
Penny,"Well, youêre talking to us now. I mean, you donêt seem nervous."
Amy,Do you not hear how creepy that sounds?
Bernadette,Was it?
Penny,"Okay. Donêt be offended, but, what went wrong with you?"
Bernadette,That really happened?
Amy,"Stuart, believe it or not, I understand. You know, before I met Sheldon, I was alone for a really long time. I was so desperate for people to like me, when I met these guys, it took everything in my power to hide my insecurity."
Amy,"Suddenly, the rabbit thing makes sense."
Leonard,"Iêm surprised you wanted to go to a sports bar, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Look at this blister. Like it or not, weêre athletes now. Besides, a bar is where I belong. Iêm having female problems."
Leonard,"If youêre cranky and retaining water, I have a theory."
Howard,"Sheldon, instead of focusing on Amy dating other guys, maybe you should start thinking about dating another girl."
Sheldon,Thatês ridiculous.
Raj,"Why? You never thought youêd end up in a relationship, and then you met Amy. Maybe thereês someone else out there for you."
Sheldon,"True, but Pennyês married, and so is Bernadette. And your girlfriend has red hair and white skin, which really rubs up against my clown phobia."
Leonard,Maybe you should consider women who arenêt in serious relationships with your closest friends?
Sheldon,"Thereês that prostate doctor, but Iêm still mad at her. Oh, thereês a woman. Iêll make her my girlfriend."
Raj,"Whoa, whoa. Walking up to a strange woman in a bar usually doesnêt work."
Sheldon,Youêre forgetting something. Ladies love jocks.
Raj,How many sips of that beer did he have?
Howard,"Oh, boy."
Sheldon,"Excuse me. Iêm recovering from a recent breakup, and Iêm told asking out another woman might make me feel better. And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, I choose you."
Sheldon,Itês a Pok_mon reference.
Sheldon,"Well, we gave it a shot. How about you?"
Sheldon,"Ah, what might have been. And you, give my regards to Barnum and Bailey."
Bernadette,Stuart took that rejection like a pro.
Penny,"Well, he knew he was on the breast cam."
Amy,I donêt have much experience turning men down. It wasnêt so much fun.
Bernadette,"Oh, you get used to it. Some guys you have to turn down over and over."
Penny,And sometimes we marry them anyway.
Amy,"Huh. Well, this is weird."
Amy,Barry Kripke just asked me out.
Bernadette,"Oh. Look at you, two guys in one day."
Penny,I told you things would change if you plucked your eyebrows.
Bernadette,What did he say?
Amy,"Hi, how are you? I was wondering if youêd like to get a drink after work sometime."
Penny,"Well, what are you gonna do?"
Amy,"I donêt know. I guess I assumed that I would eventually date other people, but this is happening so fast."
Bernadette,What can it hurt?
Amy,"Well, I was hoping the next person I dated would be a little less like Sheldon."
Bernadette,"You mean, not a scientist?"
Penny,I think she means not a weirdo.
Bernadette,Are you attracted to him?
Amy,I donêt know.
Penny,"All right, well, what happens if you imagine him naked?"
Amy,"Oh, I donêt have to imagine it."
Sheldon,I smell funny. I taste salty.
Leonard,Youêre just sweaty from exercise.
Sheldon,And kind of delicious. I wonder how many licks it would take to get to the centre of me.
Leonard,I know it only takes one doctorês finger.
Leonard,We should let you guys talk.
Sheldon,You donêt have to leave.
Leonard,Look at me go.
Amy,"Uh, Bernadette, youêre my ride."
Amy,How have you been?
Sheldon,Iêm doing all right. I tried fencing today.
Amy,Howêd that go?
Sheldon,It was pretty easy. And I think my background in mathletics helped. Barry Kripke was there. I should let you know that he expressed interest in asking you out.
Amy,"Well, actually, he, he already did."
Sheldon,"Okay. But donêt get too attached to him. in two years, 364 days, heês a dead man."
Amy,I said no.
Sheldon,"Interesting. I asked two women out today, and they both said no."
Amy,I didnêt know you were interested in dating.
Sheldon,Iêve been told itês a good way to move on.
Amy,"Oh. Okay. Anyway, um, itês nice to see you. You look good."
Sheldon,Thanks. And I taste good too.
Howard,Whatês up?
Bernadette,Why does your Fitbit say you ran 174 miles yesterday?
Sheldon,"Leonard, Iêve got terrible news."
Leonard,Whatês going on?
Sheldon,"Before I tell you, perhaps I should soften the blow. Youêre face is pleasingly symmetrical."
Leonard,Just tell me.
Sheldon,A Swedish team of physicists is trying to scoop our super-fluid vortex experiment.
Leonard,"Oh, well, that kind of stinks."
Sheldon,That kind of stinks? Why arenêt you more upset? Did I soften the blow too much? Because this here is more like a Picasso painting.
Leonard,What are we going to do?
Sheldon,Perform the experiment immediately.
Leonard,"Iêd love to, but we need liquid helium and our shipmentês on back order for a month."
Sheldon,A month? Are you kidding me? That would have been a good time for you to soften the blow.
Leonard,That shirt brings out the blue in your eyes.
Sheldon,Thank you. Arenêt you sweet.
Leonard,Letês go check to see if the university has any helium in reserve.
Sheldon,Did you know that I almost didnêt wear this shirt today?
Leonard,"Hey, Barry, weêre in trouble. We need liquid helium, does the department have any we can use?"
Sheldon,But you wonêt need much for that.
Leonard,"Come on, Barry, thereês a Swedish team trying to run our experiment before us. Canêt you spare any?"
Sheldon,Not a chance.
Leonard,What are you doing?
Sheldon,"He said be honest, so I was honest. Didnêt your mother tell you? Itês the best policy. So, what do you say?"
Sheldon,He couldêve softened the blow.
Raj,Why do you need Kripke? Canêt you just go to Party City for helium?
Leonard,Weêd have to go to every Party City in California.
Howard,Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.
Raj,"Hey, people were still talking about that party on siete de Mayo."
Sheldon,"Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us, I will never be able to enjoy anything from their country again. Which is a shame, because Swedish meatballs are my favourite toothpick-delivered meatball."
Howard,"If you need liquid helium so bad, I know a guy who can get you some, if you donêt ask too many questions."
Leonard,Who is he?
Sheldon,Where does he work?
Leonard,How does he get the helium?
Sheldon,How many questions are too many questions?
Howard,Maybe heês not for you.
Sheldon,Four questions. There answerês four.
Bernadette,"Hey, you know who went out on a date the other night? Stuart."
Penny,"Oh, good for him."
Bernadette,"I thought so, too."
Penny,"So is she, like, homeless, or framing him for a crime?"
Bernadette,Heês using some kind of dating app on his phone.
Penny,"Oh, which one? Maybe we can get Amy to try it."
Bernadette,"I donêt know. Stuart, can you come in here? He tried to explain it to me. It shows you pictures of people nearby, you swipe them around, it looks kind of like a game."
Penny,"Oh, and if you lose the game, you have to go out with Stuart."
Bernadette,Can you show us that dating app?
Penny,Wow. So how many girls have you met?
Penny,"Well, so how does it work?"
Bernadette,"Oh, what would make you give a girl a thumbs down?"
Leonard,"Oh, hey. I just heard back from the liquid helium guy."
Sheldon,Whatês he say?
Leonard,Heês got what we need and can meet us tonight.
Sheldon,"Really? You know I donêt like buying things at night. January 7th, 2009, I went to the Ralphês at 11:30pm to pick up Cracklinê Oat Bran for the morning and what did I see?"
Leonard,The man restocking the cereal shelves.
Sheldon,Thatês right. And what did he do?
Leonard,He handed you the box directly and called you Stretch.
Sheldon,Itês like it was yesterday.
Leonard,Do you want liquid helium or not?
Sheldon,Of course I do. I donêt want that Swedish team scooping us.
Leonard,Then Iêm going to tell him weêre in.
Sheldon,"Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical."
Leonard,"Weêre just bending the rules a little. We have grant money to do the experiment, so weêre going to spend it on the helium we need. Itês not like when Dr. Goldfarb claimed he bought an electron microscope and he was really just keeping a Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys."
Sheldon,Was she helping him with his research?
Leonard,"Sure. So, are we doing this?"
Sheldon,"Well, but where does he get the helium?"
Leonard,Remember? Donêt ask too many questions?
Sheldon,"Uh, but this is violating university code."
Leonard,"A little, but if I may quote Einstein, the pursuit of science calls us to ignore the rules set by man."
Sheldon,"Huh. All right, do it. Tell him weêre in."
Sheldon,I canêt find that quote on the Internet. Did you make that up?
Leonard,"Before I answer, may I just say your skin has never looked better."
Sheldon,Arenêt you just made of sugar.
Amy,Iêm not sure how I feel about this.
Penny,"Oh, come on, just let him put the app on your phone."
Bernadette,"Yeah, Stuart got two dates with it."
Penny,"Okay, let me see. Nope, nope, nope, oh, heês cute."
Bernadette,Doesnêt a teardrop tattoo mean he murdered someone?
Penny,And heês sad about it.
Bernadette,"Hey, I thought you were gonna be out late?"
Howard,"If you wanted me to stay out later, you shouldêve given me more spending money."
Raj,What are you guys up to?
Bernadette,"We put Amy on a dating app, and weêre seeing whatês out there."
Raj,"Oh, fun. Let me see. Uh, no, no, uh, definitely not."
Howard,What was wrong with that guy?
Raj,"Uh, heês Indian. Weêve already got one of those. Ooh, we should find a nice Latino, really round us out."
Howard,"Hey, I want to try."
Amy,"Uh, excuse me, can I have my phone back?"
Howard,"Hang on, Iêm trying to find you the next great love of your life. The man who will father your children. Okay, yes or no on white guy with dreadlocks?"
Leonard,That must be him.
Sheldon,"Oh, of course. An nondescript, white panel van. You may be familiar with it from the sentence, their bodies were found in a nondescript, white panel van."
Leonard,"Uh, Iêm Leonard. This is my friendÑ"
Sheldon,Iêm Skippy. Skippy Cavanaugh.
Leonard,"Uh, yeah, uh, right here."
Sheldon,"Wait, hold on, hold on. How do we know that youêre not gonna take the money and drive away?"
Leonard,"What ya doing, Skippy?"
Sheldon,Exactly what 1970s television crime dramas have taught us. You give us the helium first.
Sheldon,Guess Iêm not the only one who watches ê70s television crime dramas.
Leonard,"Look, you can trust us. Weêre respected scientists."
Sheldon,"Well, he is. Iêm a wedding planner who canêt find love himself. Itês ironic, but the point is we canêt trust you. Youêre a sketchy character in a parking garage."
Sheldon,"Well, I never thought of it like that. Boy, frame of reference will just sneak up on you, wonêt it?"
Leonard,My friend does make a decent point about the money. I donêt feel comfortable just handing it over up front.
Sheldon,"Not technically. In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves. Uh, you have plenty of moves available. You could beat us up and steal the money. You could kill us, you know. Really, youêre only limited by your imagination."
Leonard,I donêt think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff. What are we gonna do here?
Sheldon,"Not necessarily. Uh, many argue the essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm."
Sheldon,"Let me give you an example. Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your e-mail, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald. From that, I figured out where you live and where you work. Now, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh, you give us the helium or Iêll turn you in to the authorities."
Sheldon,"Yeah, exactly. See, youêre getting it."
Sheldon,Perfect. Now we really are in a Mexican standoff. Is this one of those times where Iêve won the battle but lost the war?
Leonard,"Afraid so, Skippy."
Sheldon,I told you we shouldnêt go shopping at night.
Leonard,"All right, letês all just calm down. Nobody wants to report anybody."
Leonard,"No, no, no. Wait, donêt go. Just let me explain. Weêre physicists, and weêre trying to prove a hypothesis that weêve been working on for over a year."
Sheldon,Space-time can be interpreted as the surface of an n-dimensional superfluid.
Leonard,"Okay, but now thereês this Swedish team that read our paper and theyêre trying to beat us to our own discovery. We really need this helium."
Sheldon,"And Iêm sorry I lied about being a wedding planner who canêt find love. Although I am currently single, if you know anybody."
Leonard,Hereês the money. Can we do this?
Leonard,Itês actually pretty common in our field. Thereês not much you can do about it.
Sheldon,"Did you hear that, Leonard? Thereês plenty we could do about it. Do you have a card?"
Penny,"Okay, here we go. Now everyone can see. All right. Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?"
Raj,You know he wonêt be looking at other girls.
Howard,Unless theyêre sitting on the end of his nose.
Penny,"Okay, okay, okay. Thumbs down. Next."
Bernadette,"Ew, check out his tiny teeth. He looks like a man-dolphin."
Penny,"Well if heês good in bed, she can throw him a fish."
Howard,"I love you, Amy. "
Amy,"Okay, Iêm starting to feel guilty. Arenêt we being a little mean?"
Raj,Thatês a fair point. We wouldnêt make fun of someone like this to their face.
Penny,"Look, itês Stuart."
Raj,You may want to leave the room.
Sheldon,"Right this way, Uncle Harvey."
Leonard,Will you stop with that already?
Sheldon,Iêm trying not to attract attention.
Leonard,And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady didnêt do that?
Sheldon,She said buenas noches. What was he supposed to do?
Leonard,Letês just start the experiment.
Sheldon,"Leonard, we should probably have our story straight in case we get caught."
Leonard,Weêre not getting caught.
Sheldon,"Well, you canêt be sure of that. What if the helium dealer rats us out? What if Kripke asks where we got it? What if the university checks my family tree and finds out I donêt have an Uncle Harvey?"
Leonard,"The dealer doesnêt care, Kripke has no authority over us, and you being related to a metal container would explain a lot. Help me hook this up."
Sheldon,"Well, did you see this sticker?"
Leonard,What is it?
Sheldon,"Itês partially torn off, but the segment that remains reads property of and the letter U."
Leonard,Itês probably USC or UCLA.
Sheldon,"Yeah, but what if itês Property of U.S. Government? Thereês a national helium reserve in Amarillo, Texas. If this was stolen from there, weêre accessories to a federal crime."
Leonard,Letês not jump to conclusions. A lot of things start with U.
Sheldon,"Thatês true. Thereês the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Defence, U.S. Navy, you and I are going to jail."
Leonard,"Listen, we can do the experiment as planned and beat the Swedish team to the punch, or we can kiss our dreams good-bye because we were to afraid to break a few rules."
Penny,"Okay, does everyone remember the rules? If heês shirtless, one sip. Posing with a pet, two sips. Pet and shirtless, chug like itês your job. And pull."
Raj,I have that same underwear.
Penny,"Amy, youêre getting a text."
Amy,"Oh, um, give me that."
Raj,I had a great time last night.
Amy,"No, no, stop reading that."
Howard,Whoês Dave?
Penny,You went on a date last night? Are you seeing someone?
Amy,"No, it, itês not like that."
Bernadette,And Iêd love to take you out againî?
Amy,"Okay, itês like that."
Leonard,Thank you for coming back.
Sheldon,"Anyway, if you could just give us our money back, you can have your helium and weêll be on our way."
Leonard,"No, nothing. We just changed our mind."
Sheldon,"He has glasses and Iêm a know-it-all, we are not built for prison."
Leonard,Thank you.
Sheldon,Youêre taking advantage of us? We clarified nomenclature together.
Leonard,You know what? Itês fine. Keep the money. We just want to be done with this.
Sheldon,I donêt understand.
Leonard,He wants more money.
Sheldon,"Well, it better not be more than a thousand dollars. Thatês all Iêve got on me."
Sheldon,"Finally, something breaks our way."
Penny,I canêt believe youêre seeing someone and we donêt even know about it.
Bernadette,"Yeah, why wouldnêt you tell us?"
Amy,Because itês new and weird and Iêm just trying to figure it all out. And I knew if I told you guys I had been out with a few people that youêd get way too excited about it.
Amy,Itês going fine. Itês mostly just been meeting people for coffee.
Raj,I thought we were allÑ never mind.
Bernadette,"I, I thought you werenêt ready to start seeing people."
Amy,"Well, I donêt have much experience dating, so I decided it would be good for me to, you know, get out there a little."
Penny,"Well, good for you."
Amy,Thank you.
Bernadette,And how many guys have you gone out with?
Sheldon,"Well, the Swedes might beat us, but at least we wonêt get gang-noogied in prison."
Leonard,Is Ernest Goes to Jail the only prison movie youêve seen?
Sheldon,"It scared me straight, Leonard."
Leonard,"Thank you, Barry."
Sheldon,Thatês preposterous.
Leonard,Can you give us a minute?
Sheldon,I donêt like being extorted like this. Especially by him of all people.
Leonard,"Me neither, but what other choice do we have?"
Leonard,I promise this is the last time.
Leonard,It says right here on Wikipedia. A Mexican standoff is a confrontation between at least three parties.
Sheldon,How can you trust Wikipedia if they use between to refer to three parties?
Sheldon,"Or amongst, if they were feeling whimsically archaic."
Sheldon,Absolutely. But donêt be surprised if this movie sets you on the straight and narrow.
Leonard,Did you hear about this study that found people that were cool and popular at 13 have problems succeeding later in life?
Raj,"Hmm. Iêm doing okay, and I was very popular at 13."
Penny,In school?
Raj,"Oh, no. At home. The servants would sing to me, laugh at my jokes. I wish I knew their names."
Penny,Does the study say what happens to the unpopular kids?
Leonard,"You tell me, you woke up in bed with one."
Sheldon,Listen to this. I just received an e-mail from Wil Wheaton. Leonard Nimoyês son is working on a documentary that he started with his father before he passed away. Itês about Mr. Spock and his impact on our culture.
Leonard,Why is he writing to you?
Sheldon,"Well, theyêre looking for fans to interview, and Wil thought Iêd be good for it."
Raj,"Oh. Hey, high five."
Sheldon,"Absolutely not. Yeah, Penny, you spent some time in front of the camera. Any words of advice?"
Penny,Yes. Donêt take your shirt off just because the director said so.
Sheldon,"This is a documentary about Mr. Spock. Iêm sure if thereês nudity, it will be tasteful."
Bernadette,Hey. You got a minute?
Howard,Not really. Visigoths are kind of up my butt right now.
Bernadette,"Pause the game, Howard."
Howard,"Howard? Uh-oh. Make room, Visigoths. ‚Sup?"
Bernadette,We need to talk about redecorating this place.
Howard,"Oh, no, not this again."
Bernadette,"Look, I get that you grew up here and youêre attached to things looking a certain way, but I want this to feel like my house, too."
Howard,"Oh, honey, of course itês your house. Why else would you be cleaning it all the time?"
Bernadette,"All right. Letês start over. Iêm redecorating. The furniture, the carpeting, the walls. Iêm changing everything that depresses me when I look at it. Try not to be one of those things."
Howard,May I say something?
Bernadette,Is it about how I canêt have new wallpaper êcause your dad left when you were little and your mom died?
Howard,Never mind.
Sheldon,"Hello, Amy. Itês Sheldon. Yeah, I, I know that weêre broken up, but Iêm leaving this message because I thought perhaps youêd like to watch me be interviewed for a documentary about Mr. Spock. Or as I like to call it, a Spockumentary. Yeah, Iêm going to use that joke in the interview, so try to laugh like youêre hearing it for the first time. You know, hysterically, hmm? And with a tinge of sadness that Iêm no longer in your life."
Leonard,Iêm the one who thought of Spockumentary.
Penny,And Iêm laughing like I did the first time I heard it.
Sheldon,"Oh, itês nice to meet you. I admire your fatherês work very much. Itês not every day I get to meet someone whose lifeês journey began in my heroês scrotum."
Bernadette,Whatcha doing?
Howard,"Oh. Making myself a bologna sandwich like my mom used to make me after my dad left, but before she died."
Bernadette,"Okay, listen, Iêm thinking that maybe we can compromise on the house."
Howard,Iêm listening.
Bernadette,Letês just redo one room and see how it goes.
Howard,That is reasonable. But what room?
Bernadette,How êbout this one?
Howard,"No way. No, this is the room I associate the most with my mom."
Bernadette,Then how êbout the bathroom?
Howard,I want to change my answer.
Bernadette,Fine. Then the dining room.
Howard,I guess we didnêt use it very often. Unless we had company. Which didnêt happen much after my dad left and not at all after my momÑ
Bernadette,Great. Iêm gonna go pick out paint samples.
Sheldon,All right. But this better not be some elaborate scheme to get me out of my shirt.
Leonard,How long have you known Adam?
Leonard,And what are you getting him back for?
Sheldon,"Dr. Sheldon Cooper, theoretical physicist, Caltech."
Sheldon,"The first episode of Star Trek: The Original Series I ever saw was The Galileo Seven. Uh, Spock had just landed on the planet Taurus II. Then my brother came in, sat on my head, and said eat farts. After that day, I was hooked. On Star Trek, not my brotherês sphincter-based cuisine."
Sheldon,"I think the same thing that appeals to people everywhere, the dream of a cold, rational world entirely without human emotion. Spock came from a planet governed only by logic. You know, on Vulcan, when your brother asks, why are you hitting yourself? the answer is, Iêm not. Youêre moving my arm. To which he says, Fascinating. And then you both watch educational television."
Penny,"Aw. When he says things like that, I just want to hug him and make everything better."
Leonard,"My brother was mean to me, too."
Penny,"Yeah, you probably had it coming."
Sheldon,I have many. My most treasured is an autographed napkin given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny. Thatês her over there.
Penny,"Hi. Look at that. Iêm in a movie, my shirt stayed on."
Sheldon,Of course. Excuse me. This will just take a moment.
Leonard,When did we get a wall safe?
Sheldon,When there was no more room in the floor safe.
Leonard,When did we get a floor safe?
Sheldon,When we got the security camera.
Leonard,Thereês a security camera?
Sheldon,"Aquaman, protecting your home since 2012."
Penny,"Oh, my God. Weêve done things on that couch."
Sheldon,Yeah. You donêt have to tell me.
Raj,"So, your father-in-law is in there right now?"
Howard,Yes. So back me up. The house is good the way it is.
Raj,"Oh, okay. Got it."
Howard,Hey. Whatês going on?
Bernadette,"Hey, Raj. Dad and I were just talking about taking down this wall."
Raj,You sure? Itês a pretty great wall.
Raj,Iêm sorry. I did what I could.
Bernadette,Seriously? You brought Raj over to take your side?
Howard,Your dadês on your side.
Bernadette,Heês not on my side. Heês doing all the work for free.
Raj,That is so generous of you. Iêd like to switch sides.
Howard,"Look, uh, I donêt even think you can take this wall down êcause itês load-bearing."
Raj,"Well, itês easy to find out. Just go into the crawlspace under the house and check."
Howard,When is your visa up?
Sheldon,Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth. So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoyês DNA.
Sheldon,"No offence, but this is pure 100% Nimoy. Because of your mother, youêre only 50%. Which isnêt bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away."
Penny,"Okay, enough about the napkin. What else you hiding in there?"
Sheldon,Wouldnêt you like to know?
Penny,I would.
Sheldon,"All right then. See? Just my valuables. My passport, uh, my will."
Leonard,You have a will?
Sheldon,"Yeah. My 1/18 scale Wil Wheaton action figure. I also have the other kind of will, and in it I will my Wil back to Wil."
Leonard,Will Wil want it?
Penny,"Oh, whatês that ring box?"
Sheldon,Oh. That is an engagement ring that I was going to give my girlfriend Amy.
Leonard,You bought her a ring?
Sheldon,"No, no. This has been in my family for generations. Except for a short time when Comanches cut off my great-great-great-grandmotherês finger and stole it."
Sheldon,"The Texas Rangers tracked them down to their village and slaughtered every last one of them. It was a happy ending. Well, for my nine-fingered Nana."
Penny,"Okay, back to the ring. Does Amy even know about this?"
Sheldon,She broke up with me before I could broach the subject.
Leonard,"Oh, man, Iêm sorry, that must have been devastating for you."
Sheldon,"No, not at all. No, Iêm fine. You know, Amy had reservations about our relationship, so all worked out for the best."
Penny,I know. It justÑ
Sheldon,"Yes. Oh, for example, three years ago when I discovered Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts, instead of getting angry or vindictive, you know, I got a floor safe."
Penny,I knew I could smell êem.
Sheldon,"Oh, certainly. Uh, when I was eight years old, Billy Sparks cornered me in the playground. I asked myself what would Spock do? Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder and performed my first Vulcan nerve pinch."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, he broke my collarbone. I can still hear it click."
Sheldon,"Oh, not at all. As I said, the entire point of emulating Spock was to rise above human emotion, which Iêve spent a lifetime mastering."
Penny,Oh pfft.
Sheldon,Excuse me?
Penny,Iêm sorry. Iêm not here.
Sheldon,You went pfft. What does pfft mean?
Leonard,You did go pfft.
Penny,"All right, fine. Well, Sheldon, Iêm no expert, but arenêt you completely missing the point of Spock? I mean, he liked to act like he had no emotions, but he was still half human."
Leonard,Just like you.
Penny,"Iêm just saying, you pretend you donêt, but you have feelings just like everybody else."
Sheldon,"Not true. No, look at me. I had an engagement ring to give a girl, and instead, she rejected me. And am I emotional about that? No, I am sitting here on a couch, talking about my favourite TV character like nothing happened. ‚Cause I am just like him, all logical, all the time."
Penny,"Sweetie, youêre yelling."
Sheldon,"Because when I speak at a regular volume, no one seems to believe me that Iêve put this Amy nonsense behind me."
Howard,"Yeah. Yeah, I feel like an archaeologist. Indiana Jones and the Single-Family Dwelling. Hey. Look. Found a seashell."
Howard,Sorry. Do you have a sense of where we are?
Howard,"Oh. Okay, so we must be under the dining room."
Howard,Why wouldnêt I want to hear it?
Howard,"Thatês not true at all. I wish sheêd get pregnant, believe me. Iêm climbing on top of her every chance I get. In a loving and respectful manner. The point is, I really do want kids."
Howard,"I donêt know why sheês lying to you. Sheês the one who doesnêt want kids. In fact, every time I bring up the subjectÑ"
Howard,"Oh, my God, weêre gonna die."
Penny,I canêt believe Sheldon was gonna ask Amy to marry him.
Leonard,I know. I also canêt believe he watched what we did on that couch and still sits on it.
Leonard,"Hey, buddy. How you doing?"
Sheldon,Better. Did Wil and Adam leave?
Sheldon,Do you think theyêre going to put my outburst in the documentary?
Leonard,"Oh, yeah."
Sheldon,"Well, thereês no point in dwelling on it. As the Vulcans say, Kup-fun-tor haêkiv naêish Du stau."
Penny,Do you know what that means?
Penny,Are you telling the truth?
Sheldon,"Well, this is ridiculous. Being upset about Amy all the time isnêt accomplishing anything. If I want to resolve this situation, then I need to take action."
Penny,What are you gonna do?
Sheldon,"Iêm going to find her and ask her to marry me. And if she says yes, we can put this behind us and resume our relationship. And if she says no, well, then she can just ponfo miran."
Leonard,He didnêt meant that.
Bernadette,So I should probably explain why I kind of fibbed.
Howard,That would be nice.
Bernadette,I told my dad that you were the one who didnêt want kids because I didnêt want to disappoint him.
Howard,But you were okay throwing me under the bus?
Bernadette,"Turns out yeah, I didnêt think twice about it."
Bernadette,"Oh, please. Mom did everything. All you did was come home from work, sit on the couch and drink beer. How is that raising kids?"
Raj,"Itês interesting your father didnêt help around the house and Howard doesnêt help, either, so in a way, Howardês not only like your father, but heês also like the child that youêre afraid to have."
Howard,Why are you still here?
Raj,"Fine, Iêll leave. But it sounds like somebody needs a fresh diaper."
Howard,"All right, I admit that I donêt help out a lot. And I need to work on that. But if we had a kid, it would be different."
Howard,"Because when my dad left, I promised myself that if I ever had a chance to be a father Iêd always be there."
Bernadette,"Okay, Iêll think about it."
Howard,"And this an actual Iêll think about it, not like the can we get a motorcycle with a sidecar Iêll think about itî?"
Bernadette,Itês an actual Iêll think about it.
Howard,I really believe Iêd be a great dad.
Bernadette,I know you would.
Howard,"Speaking of making babies, what do you say I wash up and poke around your crawlspace?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, right. You can just shut your feelings off. There goes television, lying to us again. We let you raise our children, and this is the thanks we get. Leonard, how could I have been so foolish to try and follow in the footsteps of a made-up alien race with no emotions?"
Leonard,"Well now instead of idolizing fictional characters, you can focus on the real people who are already in your life."
Sheldon,Those are very wise words.
Leonard,Thank you.
Sheldon,Theyêd just be so much more comforting if they came out of a television.
Penny,I think itês so adorable youêre making Sheldon breakfast.
Leonard,"Well, heês having a rough time. Amy broke his heart, the DVR cut off the last minute of Doctor Who. That crow followed him home."
Penny,Arenêt you worried youêre making French toast on oatmeal day?
Leonard,"Ah, well, whatês this? A pot of oatmeal? Or, thanks to you, what I will now call gloatmeal."
Penny,"Oh, I donêt want credit for that."
Sheldon,"Oh, Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter, lovely to see you this fine morning."
Leonard,Youêre in a good mood.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I am indeed. I have decided, instead of wallowing in sadness about Amy, it is time that I find myself a new female companion."
Penny,Oh. Good for you.
Leonard,What brought this on?
Sheldon,"I realized something. When Amy was in my life, I was hyper-focused on my work and ignored her."
Penny,And you donêt want to make the same mistake with the next woman.
Sheldon,"No, I need a new woman in my life to ignore so I can hyper-focus on my work again."
Leonard,"Hey, I made French toast sticks."
Sheldon,On oatmeal day?
Leonard,"Ah, I also made oatmeal."
Sheldon,"Ooh, thatês a lot of carbohydrates for a man on the prowl. You know what? You eat it. Youêre married, it doesnêt matter what you look like."
Penny,Donêt take advice from a man who threw his shoe at a crow.
Sheldon,"Thank you for coming by, gentlemen."
Howard,No problem.
Raj,So whatês up?
Sheldon,"Well, it was the two of you who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me. Now that Iêm looking for my next girlfriend, it seemed only logical that I employ your services once again."
Howard,You sure youêre up for that? She did hurt you.
Sheldon,"Oh, no, itês all right. I think of my time with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum. Sweet and enjoyable at first, but ultimately a flavourless lump of sadness."
Raj,Youêre not wrong about Fruit Stripe. I was always a Hubba Bubba man.
Howard,Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble? Youêre crazy.
Raj,"Hey, the jaw wants what it wants."
Raj,"Oh, right, uh, girlfriend. Okay."
Howard,But what are you looking for?
Sheldon,"All Iêm looking for is an educated, intelligent woman who shares my interests while retaining her own unique point of view. She should be kind, patient, and most important, unable to imagine life without me by ten oêclock tonight."
Howard,Isnêt that a little unreasonable?
Sheldon,"All right, fine, she doesnêt need her own point of view. Now, chop-chop."
Penny,"Come on, Amy, show us the dress."
Amy,Okay. But Iêm really stepping outside of my comfort zone here.
Penny,"Uh, I donêt think any of your comfort zones are showing."
Bernadette,"Yeah, itês your third date, maybe you could go more sexy."
Amy,"Well, some people think the sexiest organ is the brain."
Penny,No one ever bought me drinks at a bar because my brain just popped out of my shirt.
Amy,Do you have any heels higher than this? Heês pretty tall.
Bernadette,"Ooh, tall. Finally some details about this mystery man."
Penny,"Yeah, come on, tell us more."
Amy,"Well, I told you his name and that heês tall. What more do you need?"
Bernadette,Did you kiss him yet?
Amy,Just a little peck on the lips.
Penny,"Well, weêre your best friends, give us one more detail and we promise weêll leave you alone."
Amy,"Fine. Um, heês British. All right, that is a juicy one."
Penny,"All right, where is tall British Dave taking you?"
Bernadette,Tea and basketball?
Amy,To that new Italian place on Walnut.
Bernadette,"Oh, nice."
Amy,Iêm gonna go look for other shoes.
Penny,Good luck. I threw out all my tall ones when I married Leonard.
Bernadette,"Hey, you want to swing by that place tonight and get a look at this guy?"
Penny,We donêt even know what time theyêre gonna be there.
Bernadette,"Iêll just call the restaurant, pretend Iêm Amy and check the reservation."
Penny,"Damn, youêre sneaky."
Bernadette,"Yeah, but Iêm little, so itês adorable."
Howard,I think the quickest way to find you a new girlfriend is just to get you on every dating Web site out there.
Sheldon,"Are you sure? Iêve heard that on those sites, often when you think youêre corresponding with someone, itês actually a computer program pretending to be a real person."
Raj,And youêre afraid itêll do a better job than you?
Sheldon,"Excuse me. No one does a better job pretending to be a person than I do. Siri comes close, but I know more jokes."
Howard,"If you donêt want to use dating Web sites, what do you suggest?"
Sheldon,"Off the top of my head? Uh, prospective women weed themselves out in a battle of wits until only one champion remains, and she shows up at my door flush with the thrill of victory, and then sits quietly by my side while I watch Daredevil."
Howard,You seriously think women would fight for you?
Sheldon,"People compete for jobs and trophies, why not me?"
Howard,"Heês right, he knows a lot of jokes."
Raj,"Yeah, no, but it is basic human nature. If we present him as a prize, maybe they would."
Howard,"Well, heês smart, heês a respected scientist."
Sheldon,And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.
Raj,I donêt know if Iêd say youÑ oh.
Howard,"I have an idea. What if we put a post on Craigslist that says world-class Caltech physicist seeking girlfriend. If interested, solve the following puzzles for a chance to meet him."
Sheldon,"Oh, weêll make the puzzles extremely challenging to eliminate unworthy candidates."
Raj,"Oh, we could set it up like a scavenger hunt where the last puzzle gives the winner Sheldonês contact information."
Howard,"Well, this is actually an interesting social experiment."
Raj,Iêm a little jealous of the people who get to do it.
Howard,"Me, too. And weêve seen the prize."
Leonard,I donêt understand why weêre leaving so early for the movie.
Penny,"Oh, I forgot to tell you, weêre gonna meet up with Bernadette to spy on Amy and her date."
Leonard,I donêt want to do that.
Penny,and you think I want to see a documentary about aluminium can recycling?
Leonard,This is the movie that big soda doesnêt want you to see.
Penny,"No, itês the movie your wife doesnêt want you to see."
Leonard,So youêre actually okay with invading your friendês privacy?
Penny,Youêre not curious who sheês out with?
Leonard,Not really.
Penny,But youêre curious about aluminium cans? Youêre a weird little guy.
Sheldon,Thatês it. The Sheldon Cooper Girlfriend Challenge is officially live.
Raj,This is exciting.
Sheldon,"Right now, somewhere, a woman is dividing the atomic weight of the best noble gas by the number of colours in the oldest national flag still in use."
Howard,Then using that number as the average speed to calculate the travel time from Mordor to the Shire.
Sheldon,"And, taking her first step towards a lifetime of laughter, love and, best of all, rules."
Raj,"I, I hope we didnêt make the puzzles too hard."
Howard,"Well, if she can solve them, itêll prove sheês intelligent, tenacious and so socially awkward she has nothing better to do on a Saturday night."
Sheldon,"Golly, she sounds too good to be true."
Amy,"Well, Iêm having a good time, too. If you donêt mind me asking, why did you and your wife split up?"
Amy,"Oh, Iêm, Iêm so sorry."
Penny,"Hey. So, where are they?"
Bernadette,"Across the street, in the left window."
Penny,"Oh, damn it, we should have brought binoculars."
Bernadette,Right here.
Leonard,You just happen to have those in the car?
Bernadette,"Kinda. Before I met Howie, I liked to keep close tabs on my boyfriends."
Leonard,By stalking them?
Bernadette,Stalkers are creepy. Iêm just a harmless little girl with military-grade spy equipment.
Penny,"Oh, there he is."
Bernadette,"Heês cute, right?"
Leonard,Can I see?
Penny,now youêre interested? You didnêt even want to come.
Leonard,"I know, but you guys make being a crappy friend look fun."
Leonard,"Yeah, okay, I see him. It looks like theyêre having a nice time. I wish I could hear what theyêre saying."
Bernadette,"Yeah, I shouldêve brought my parabolic microphone."
Penny,Your what?
Bernadette,Nothing. Not important.
Amy,"I mean, to be completely honest, Iêve, Iêve only been in one long-term relationship."
Amy,"Thatês a good question. After five years, it was just feeling like more work than it should be."
Amy,Heês a theoretical physicist at Caltech.
Amy,"Um, used to be string theory, now itês dark matter. But letês not discuss Sheldon. Letês get back to you."
Amy,Iêm trying not to. Do you know him?
Penny,He really seems into her.
Bernadette,I took a video. I forgot how much fun this is.
Leonard,"Okay, we saw them. Can we go catch the movie?"
Bernadette,Whyêd you bring him?
Penny,I had to; weêre married now.
Bernadette,"Ugh, I hear that."
Amy,"Sure, why not?"
Amy,Um about an hour and half.
Amy,Yes. Yep. We were on a date. Very much like this one.
Amy,What was the rest of your question?
Amy,Really? You-you want me to introduce you to my ex-boyfriend?
Leonard,Are we gonna be much longer? I really have to go to the bathroom.
Bernadette,Right here.
Raj,37 minutes left until the deadline.
Sheldon,Someone will show.
Howard,"And no matter what happens, this is still a fun experiment."
Raj,Not as fun as the night we blew up grapes in the microwave. We really have led full lives.
Sheldon,Someone will show.
Raj,"Maybe you donêt want someone exactly like you. You know what they say, opposites attract."
Sheldon,"Well, by that logic, I should be with someone short, dull and needy, eh? Not to cast aspersions, but I canêt shake a stick around here without hitting that."
Amy,I have a DVD of that lecture.
Amy,"Not as a Valentineês present, no."
Amy,"Thatês, um, terrific. Listen, Iêm, Iêm kind of tired. Can we call it a night?"
Amy,"No, youêre not."
Amy,Thank you.
Bernadette,"Hey, hey, theyêre leaving."
Penny,"Here, give me, give me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, theyêre coming right towards us."
Bernadette,We got to get out of here.
Penny,"Okay. Well, wait, what about Leonard?"
Bernadette,He and his tiny bladder can take the bus. 
Penny,"Oh, no."
Amy,What are you guys doing here?
Bernadette,"Hi, Ames, what are you doing here?"
Leonard,What happened?
Amy,Pinch me.
Leonard,"I donêt know if you want to do that, I was just, okay, never mind."
Leonard,You really should.
Raj,Sixty seconds. This is not looking good.
Sheldon,One minute is a long time.
Howard,Iêve been telling women that for 20 years.
Sheldon,"45 seconds is plenty of time for a woman to walk through that door and fall in love with me. You know, probably half that if I break out the old cow eyes."
Raj,Thirty seconds.
Sheldon,Uh-oh. What if itês Jennifer Lawrence?
Sheldon,"Well, that last Hunger Games was not my cup of tea."
Howard,You thought she was great in X-Men.
Sheldon,"Oh, fine, I wonêt shut my heart to the love of Jennifer Lawrence."
Raj,"Guys, fifteen seconds."
Howard,Maybe sheês waiting to show up at the last possible moment.
Sheldon,"Sounds like a drama queen. Oh, no. It is Jennifer Lawrence."
Raj,"Five, four, three, two, one. Thatês too bad."
Howard,Maybe we did make the test too difficult.
Raj,"I donêt think it matters. Look, Sheldon, I believe when the time is right for you to meet someone, itêll just happen. Okay? Not because of a test or a Web site, but becauseÑ  we are the dreamers of dreams."
Howard,"Itês an actual girl, and sheês really pretty."
Raj,Answer it.
Sheldon,All right. Can I help you?
Sheldon,"Careful, itês addictive."
Sheldon,"And just like that, youêre a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie."
Sheldon,"I am a bit of a unicorn. Well, you certainly seem like a special lady, uh, but as you know, you missed the deadline, so thanks for playing."
Raj,How could you send her away?
Sheldon,"She was late. And she found atomic spectroscopy boring. Well, I wouldnêt coitus her with your genitals."
Amy,No problem. Iêm really sorry about your car.
Amy,"Um, listen, youêre a really nice guy, but I just, I donêt think this is working out."
Amy,"Iêm, Iêm really sorry."
Amy,There you go.
Amy,Sure. Heh.
Amy,"Okay, get out."
Raj,Have you guys seen this feature that lets you talk to Siri without pressing any buttons?
Howard,How does it work?
Raj,"You just say, uh, Hey, Siri, what time is it?"
Howard,"So now anyone can control your phone? Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts."
Raj,Nice try. It only recognizes my voice.
Howard,"Oh. Cool.  Hey, Siri, show me pictures of naked grandma butts."
Raj,I donêt sound like that.
Sheldon,"Hey. Good news, everybody. Now that Iêm no longer with Amy, I have an extra ticket to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet at the aquarium cafeteria. Who wants it? Well, you realize you wonêt be going alone, Iêll be there the whole time. Providing fish and pilgrim facts. Can you people hear me?"
Leonard,"Well, weêre having everyone over."
Penny,"Yeah, Leonard and I are gonna be cooking all day."
Leonard,Otherwise weêd love to.
Penny,But we canêt.
Leonard,"Yeah, poor us."
Bernadette,"And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup kitchen, feeding food to the homeless."
Sheldon,"Well, Howard, what about you?"
Howard,"Oh, I canêt. Iêm going to the soup kitchen, too."
Bernadette,You said that sounded like the worst thing ever.
Howard,"If you canêt support me when Iêm lying, why are we married?"
Amy,"Hi, Sheldon. Whatês up?"
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm calling because Thanksgiving is coming up, and I wanted to offer you the aquarium tickets."
Amy,No one can go with you?
Sheldon,"Theyêd rather spend the holiday with each other than find out of this is the year I finally touch a starfish. Anyway, I wouldnêt want the tickets to go to waste, so take whomever youêd like."
Amy,Oh. Okay. Thank you.
Sheldon,And feel free to tell your guest that the Myanmar catfish is also known as the pilgrim fish. In case the turkeyês dry and you need something juicy.
Amy,"Sheldon, I can tell you want to go, so if youêd be comfortable with it, maybe we could go as friends."
Sheldon,You donêt think that will be awkward?
Amy,"Well it is Thanksgiving in an aquarium cafeteria, so Iêm gonna go out on a limb here and say yes. But if you mean between us, I think itêll be fine."
Sheldon,"Very well, then. Iêll see you on Thanksgiving morning."
Amy,See you then.
Sheldon,"Oh, and forget what I said about the Myanmar catfish. My list of marine-themed pilgrim facts is pretty short."
Amy,Did you know they served shellfish and eel at the very first Thanksgiving?
Sheldon,And there goes my list.
Bernadette,"The soup kitchen manager assigns the jobs, and the shifts are six hours."
Howard,"Six hours? Oh, God, I donêt want to complain for that long."
Raj,Do you ever do anything for anyone else?
Howard,I happen to be a giving and generous lover.
Bernadette,"We are, and I believe the word youêre looking for is yu-huh-huh-huh."
Bernadette,Hi. Weêd like to volunteer.
Bernadette,Oh. Okay. Wipe that smug smile off your face.
Howard,Maybe Iêm happy that so many people turned up to help the less fortunate.
Bernadette,That heês an ass? He beat you to it.
Bernadette,"Oh, great. Weêd love to help."
Howard,Wipe that smug smile off your face.
Bernadette,I canêt.
Penny,Look at us. Our first Thanksgiving as husband and wife.
Leonard,I know. I feel so grown up.
Penny,"Sweetie, you are grown up."
Leonard,"Really? How many grown-ups do you know who have Mr. Spock oven mitts? Hey, the recipes are on my iPad. Will you pull êem up?"
Penny,Yep. Whatês the code?
Leonard,My birthday.
Penny,Itês not working.
Leonard,"Itês just the four digits, month and day."
Leonard,"Let me see. Yeah, there. What number were you putting in?"
Leonard,"You donêt know my birthday, do you?"
Penny,"Yes, I do."
Leonard,"Well, what is it?"
Leonard,May what?
Penny,Iêm not gonna say your password out loud. That is not secure.
Leonard,You donêt know your own husbandês birthday.
Penny,"Well, you donêt know everything about me."
Leonard,"Your birthday is December 2, you grew up on Perkins Street, the last four digits of your social are 7 6-2 1, and the odds of me letting you forget this are zero."
Penny,"Oh, look at us. Our last Thanksgiving as husband and wife."
Amy,Hi. Ready for the aquarium?
Sheldon,"I am. You know, and in an effort to reduce awkwardness as we learn how to function as friends, I printed out a list of safe topics for polite conversation."
Amy,If that makes you more comfortable.
Sheldon,"If there were a list of things that make me more comfortable, lists would be on the top of that list. Okay, now, oh, since last we spoke, have you acquired any pets?"
Amy,You?
Sheldon,"Um, since last we spoke, have you planned or gone on any vacations?"
Amy,I might go visit my aunt next week.
Sheldon,Mm. Your aunt in Modesto?
Amy,"No, the one in Bakersfield."
Sheldon,Bakersfield. I see. Where has this list been all my life?
Howard,So we donêt even get to be up front where the action is?
Bernadette,What difference does it make?
Howard,"I donêt know. I was hoping some poor kid would come up to me and say, please, sir, I want some more."
Raj,"Youêre in a soup kitchen, not a production of Oliver!"
Howard,Itês not like Iêm expecting them to sing.
Sheldon,"and then the next day was 73 degrees, and the day after that was 72, and then it was 72 again, uh, then it was 74, and that brings us to today, at Iêd wear shorts if I had a pair. 78."
Amy,Are we done discussing the weather?
Sheldon,"I donêt know if Iêd call it discussing. You kind of sat back and let me do all the work. Letês see, whatês next on the list. Oh, uh, do you whittle, and if so, what kind of knife do you use."
Amy,Sheldon. Weêve known each other a long time. We are perfectly capable of having a conversation without relying on a list off the Internet.
Sheldon,"All right. Well, what should we talk about?"
Amy,I donêt know. Just ask me whatever comes to mind.
Sheldon,Very well. I know youêve been seeing other men. Have you had coitus with any of them?
Amy,"Man, I walked right into that one."
Leonard,"Next we need a teaspoon of pepper, which, I believe, was also the name of your childhood dog."
Penny,Fine. You think you know so much. Whoês my favourite Spice Girl?
Penny,Whoês my favorite member of NSYNC?
Penny,Whoês my favorite Backstreet Boy?
Leonard,Nice try. NSYNC forever.
Penny,Damn it.
Leonard,"Face it, you canêt stump me. I am the king of husbands. I know that you donêt like the lingerie that I got you on Valentineês Day. I know you hate the word moist. I knowÑ"
Penny,"Hang on. Wait, wait. Why donêt I like the lingerie you got me?"
Leonard,Because itês orange and you think it makes you look like a slutty carrot.
Penny,Interesting. I never told you that.
Leonard,Sure you did.
Penny,I never told anyone that. But I did write it in my journal.
Leonard,I didnêt know you had a journal.
Penny,I also know your voice gets higher when youêre lying.
Leonard,"No, it doesnêt."
Raj,"You know, this reminds me of high school."
Raj,"No, I was in India, it was humid and smelled funny."
Howard,"All right, I think Iêm getting into a groove here. This isnêt so bad."
Howard,Weêve only been doing this 20 minutes?
Raj,"You know, I read that washing dishes can be an excellent form of meditation. The key is that while washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes."
Howard,Just because you have that accent doesnêt mean what you say isnêt stupid.
Raj,"No, seriously. Itês about being present in the moment, focusing on the feeling of the warm water, the smell of the detergent, the sound of the dishes squeaking, and following your own breath. Itês about, itês about simply being."
Howard,"Huh. Okay, Iêll try it."
Bernadette,Iêll do it.
Howard,"No fair, I was meditating."
Leonard,"Come on, donêt be mad. It was a long time ago, and it was an accident."
Penny,How can reading my journal be an accident?
Leonard,I didnêt even know what it was. I saw it on your nightstand. I picked it up.
Penny,"Well, when you realized what it was, why didnêt you stop?"
Leonard,"You know me, Iêm a big olê bookworm."
Penny,All right. Letês just finish cooking.
Leonard,"Well, hey, okay. Let me make this up to you. Sometimes I keep an online journal. I want you to read something that I wrote."
Penny,"Okay, really, Iêm fine."
Leonard,"Okay. Well, then Iêll read it to you. Itês from the day we first met. Beauty, thy name is Penny."
Penny,"Oh, God. Stop. I donêt want you to read something you thinkêll just butter me up. I want to hear the most recent thing you wrote."
Leonard,"Fine. Mmm, Pennyês beauty, like our love, grows more with each passing day.î"
Penny,Does it really say that?
Leonard,Why would I lie?
Penny,OMG. OMG. Weêre so close to the new Star Wars. I canêt take it. Gah. Gah?
Leonard,"Well, you didnêt read it right. The new Star Wars is coming. Gah."
Sheldon,Iêm sensing things have gotten awkward.
Amy,"Itês okay. If weêre friends, we should be able to talk about anything."
Sheldon,All right.
Amy,"So, you had some questions about me seeing other people."
Sheldon,Just a few.
Amy,Go ahead.
Sheldon,How many dates have you been on? Who were they with? Whereêd you go? Where did you meet them? Did you sleep with them? And how much longer to the aquarium? Iêm getting kind of hungry.
Amy,Letês see. I have been on six dates with three different people. It was either for coffee or dinner. One I met at a bookstore and two I met online. I havenêt slept with anyone. The aquarium is 40 minutes away. And thereês a baggie of Cheerios for you in the glove compartment.
Sheldon,Is that regular or honey nut?
Amy,I mixed them.
Sheldon,You mixed them. No wonder gentleman callers are pounding down your door. Do you have any questions for me?
Amy,Just one. Are you doing okay?
Sheldon,I am.
Amy,Good. I want you to be happy.
Sheldon,I believe you. Iêd believe you more if you threw a few Apple Jacks in here.
Howard,Thanks. You got to be kidding me.
Howard,"Y, youêre Elon Musk."
Howard,"Wh, what are you doing here?"
Howard,"Oh, man. I, what an honour to meet you. Iêm, Iêm such a fan of Tesla and SpaceX. All your companies. Howard Wolowitz, Caltech."
Howard,"Oh, yeah. Nothing better than helping people. Which is something I realized when I was viewing Earth from the deck of the International Space Station, where I spent two months as a payload specialist, a job I was qualified for because Iêm an MIT-trained engineer."
Howard,"Sorry. Itês just, youêre you, you know? And I really want you to adopt me."
Howard,"Oh. I made my wife come down, too."
Howard,Is that a job offer? ‚Cause I really want to go to Mars. Assuming I can bring my wife. She hardly takes up any room. Sheês basically a carry-on.
Howard,Thank you.
Howard,"A partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie from a homeless shelter? With Elon Musk, you bet I do."
Sheldon,"You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet in an aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad."
Amy,Youêre just upset êcause they ran out of Pilgrim hats.
Sheldon,They gave one to that baby. He wasnêt even awake.
Amy,"Well, it wouldnêt be a holiday without you being mad at a baby."
Sheldon,Oh. Would you care to play an ocean-themed game I invented?
Amy,Sure. What is it?
Sheldon,"Itês called Food, Friend, Fight. One of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle."
Amy,"So itês like Kiss, Marry, Kill."
Sheldon,What is that?
Amy,"Itês a game where youêre given three people and you choose which one youêd kiss, marry, or kill."
Sheldon,"Well, my game is better, êcause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them."
Amy,Letês just play.
Sheldon,"Iêll start you off easy. Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp."
Amy,"Hmm. Well, I wouldnêt fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse. So Iêd eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days I feel bloated."
Sheldon,Very well done.
Amy,"Thank you. Okay, your turn. Hmm. Seal, hagfish, SpongeBob SquarePants."
Sheldon,"Well, Iêd befriend SpongeBob but heês not real, so I canêt do that, can I?"
Amy,But you can pal around with a hagfish?
Sheldon,"Hey, letês not pull at that thread. Okay. Iêll fight SpongeBob, because heês so friendly weêll just end up tickling each other. Um, Iêll befriend the seal, because heês trainable, which is the problem Iêm having with my current friends. Which means Iêll have to eat the hagfish."
Amy,"Isnêt that gross? I mean, a hagfish can produce enough mucus to fill a bucket in a minute."
Sheldon,"I know. It makes its own gravy, itêll slide right down."
Amy,I miss this.
Sheldon,"How can you miss a game youêve never played before, silly?"
Amy,I guess sometimes Iêm silly.
Penny,Hey. Whereêd you go? I canêt tell if the turkeyês done.
Leonard,"Be right there. Hi, lover."
Penny,What are you doing?
Leonard,Iêm sorry about the journal. I want to make it up to you. So Iêm gonna let you post a shame photo of me on Facebook.
Penny,I am not putting that on the Internet. I donêt want people to see this. I donêt want to see it.
Leonard,"Donêt want people to see what, huh? A little bit of this?"
Leonard,"Huh? Some of this? And, since itês Thanksgiving, an extra helping of this?"
Bernadette,Happy ThanksÑ Yikes.
Leonard,Iêm glad you had a nice time with Amy.
Sheldon,"Me, too. Itês comforting to know that she and I are able to function as friends."
Penny,"Well, Iêve never been friends with any of my exes."
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm sure you and Leonard will be able to pull it off.  Oh. Itês my friend Amy. Hello."
Amy,"Hi, Sheldon. Iêm just driving home from my motherês."
Sheldon,Did you have a nice time?
Amy,"I did. Um, listen, I really enjoyed spending this morning with you."
Sheldon,"Well, I canêt take all the credit. It was pretty funny when that one anchovy started going the wrong way."
Amy,"It was. Uh, listen, I, I was thinking that, um, maybe Iêm ready to be your girlfriend again."
Sheldon,Oh. I thought we were just friends.
Amy,"We are. But I was hoping, maybeÑ"
Sheldon,"Amy, I excel at many things, but getting over you wasnêt one of them. I think I need to just be your friend."
Amy,Okay. I understand.
Sheldon,"Good. Oh, I watched a video of the hagfish producing mucus, so Iêm gonna change my answer and eat SpongeBob."
Amy,Okay. Sure.
Sheldon,"Sheldon Cooperês descent into madness, day two. Itês 2:25 a.m., and I feel the urge to urinate. My normal urination time is 7:10 a.m., but here I am, in the middle of the night, struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry. Itês only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades. I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is."
Leonard,Since when do you hum songs?
Sheldon,What are you talking about?
Leonard,You were just humming.
Sheldon,"Are you sure? Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise."
Leonard,How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?
Sheldon,"Letês see. Hey, I was humming. One point for Hufflepuff. What song is that?"
Leonard,"Well, hum it again. Is that the SpongeBob song?"
Sheldon,Who lives in a pineapple. Nope.
Leonard,Whatever. Can we just get back to this?
Sheldon,"I feel like I know what song that is, but I canêt put my finger on it.  My country, êtis of thee. No."
Leonard,Itês just an earworm. Itêll come to you.
Sheldon,Okay.  R-E-S-P-E-C-T. No.
Leonard,Is this what weêre doing the rest of the night?
Sheldon,Iêm surprised you have to ask.
Sheldon,"Hello, yes, I was hoping you could help me. What song is this? La, la, la, la, la, la, la. You donêt know? Well, how dare you call yourselves a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? My goodness. Do you sing along to the greatest hits of Elvis Presley with that mouth? Well, they were no help at all."
Leonard,"Which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service."
Penny,Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens to everybody.
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm not everybody. I have an eidetic memory. I should be able to remember what song this is, but I canêt. Somethingês wrong with me."
Penny,"I told you if we were patient, heêd figure it out for himself."
Sheldon,"I was always afraid this day would come. This might be the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually test the limits of public nudity."
Penny,Public nudity?
Leonard,"Eh, that just means going barefoot."
Amy,"Hi, Dave. Uh, itês Amy."
Amy,Iêm fine. How are you?
Amy,"Yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know. I took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend like he was Leonard Nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend."
Amy,"Well, I was wondering if youêd like to get dinner again sometime."
Amy,How êbout Saturday?
Raj,"Oh. Did you know, at the United Nations, thereês a Department for Outer Space Affairs?"
Howard,Really? Why?
Raj,They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.
Howard,"Mm, boy, thatês one of those jobs thatês boring, boring, boring, then, oh, God, whereês the memo with what we do now?"
Raj,"Oh, this is cool. So, a few weeks ago I set up a fan page on Facebook for our band andÑ"
Howard,Wait a second. How could you do that without consulting me?
Raj,"Itês not a big deal. It just took, like, five minutes to set up."
Howard,"Thatês not the point. When we created Footprints on the Moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual. Now youêre just trying to take over the whole thing. You know, maybe I should go solo."
Raj,But someone joined our page. We have an actual fan.
Howard,"All right. This thingês bigger than you and me, bandês back together."
Raj,"So, listen to what he wrote. Uh, I saw you play at the comic book store. You guys rock. And then thereês an animated smiley face raising the roof like this."
Howard,We did raise the roof that night.
Raj,"Yeah, we totally did."
Howard,Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?
Sheldon,Why canêt I recall this song? This is taking far too long. The urge to bang my head against the wall again and again and again and again and again is strong.
Leonard,Put on some headphones.
Sheldon,No they make my earlobes sweat.
Penny,"Hey, sweetie, why donêt you take a break and do something else for a while?"
Sheldon,There was a project Iêve been thinking about starting.
Penny,"Okay, great. What is it?"
Sheldon,Iêll show you.  Everyody cut footloose. Nope.
Penny,Iêll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose.
Sheldon,"This is Penny. She is your friend. If she offers you food, itês safe to take it. You probably paid for it, anyway."
Bernadette,"So, youêre really going out with Dave again?"
Amy,Why not? Heês actually a very nice guy.
Bernadette,But he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves Sheldon.
Amy,"Thatês nothing Sheldon hasnêt done before. Daveês just a big fan of his work. Besides, he said he wouldnêt bring it up again."
Bernadette,Okay. So whereês he taking you?
Amy,"Oh, heês coming here. Iêm actually making dinner."
Bernadette,Oh. Thatês a big step.
Amy,It is?
Bernadette,Yeah. Youêre inviting him into your home. Itês intimate. Itês where your underpants live.
Amy,"You know what? Good. I tried to get back together with Sheldon, he shot me down. Dave likes me. Maybe intimate is what I need."
Bernadette,You sure? Youêve never really been with a man. Do you really want to start with one thatês six-foot-seven?
Amy,Why not?
Bernadette,‚Cause itês like taking your driverês test in a bus.
Raj,Maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him.
Howard,What should we write?
Raj,"How about, uh, oh, how about, we might be Footprints on the Moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon."
Howard,Someday youêre gonna make an amazing grandma.
Raj,Well what do you want to write?
Howard,"Something badass, you know, like, thanks for digginê our vibe. Weêll keep rockinê if you keep rollinê."
Raj,"Dude, if I was wearing a bra, Iêd throw it at your head right now."
Howard,Iêll keep rockinê. You donêt do that.
Raj,Okay. I posted it.
Howard,"So, who is this guy?"
Raj,"Letês see. Uh, his name is Trent Monaco."
Howard,Cool name.
Raj,"Yeah. Heês 24. Heês a deejay. He brews his own beer. Heês got awesome tattoos. Dude, heês got a hot girlfriend, too."
Howard,"Damn. I donêt know if heês our biggest fan or Iêm his. Hey, Trent just liked our comment."
Raj,"He is so cool. Hey, no hard feelings, but Iêm throwing my hypothetical bra at him."
Penny,"Oh, my God, he wonêt stop."
Leonard,How does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying?
Penny,Nobody knows. Thatês why heês number one. Can you please go talk to him?
Leonard,Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it for once.
Penny,Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?
Leonard,"What do you want, a medal? It was your gum."
Leonard,I love you.
Penny,Who cares?
Sheldon,What are you doing in my room? Stop it. Thatês mine. Why are you so strong?
Penny,Problem solved.
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, he got a tuba."
Sheldon,"Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, this is a thermostat. It controls the temperature of the apartment. The ideal setting is 72 degrees. If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket. A straitjacket, êcause 72ês the best and youêre crazy. Now, this is your spot. Youêre very protective of it. When anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. It sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable. People are also delighted by your love of pranks. For example, Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee. It wasnêt replace it with Folgerês crystals, Iêll tell you that much."
Leonard,"Hey, can we please get back to work?"
Sheldon,This is Leonard. Heês your best friend in the world.
Leonard,"All right, just stop. This is ridiculous."
Sheldon,"Sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with your life. And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list."
Leonard,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Oh, no, heês drinking it."
Howard,Look at this. Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.
Raj,That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.
Bernadette,Whoês Trent?
Howard,"Oh, heês our fan."
Bernadette,Fan of what?
Howard,"Uh, did you forget? Weêre in a band."
Bernadette,You mean because you played one time in the comic book store?
Howard,And at the childrenês hospital until they asked us to leave.
Raj,"Hey, dude, Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks."
Howard,Really? You want to go down there and meet him?
Bernadette,Are you stalking him? Thatês creepy.
Raj,"Itês not creepy. I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page, Trent joined it."
Howard,"After that, all I did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until I found his Twitter handle."
Raj,"From there, it was easy to find him on Instagram, Snapchat and pretty much track his every movement."
Howard,"So if you think thatês creepy, you married the wrong guy."
Bernadette,Maybe I should marry Trent.
Raj,"Yeah, like she could get Trent."
Amy,Thank you.
Amy,"When you were married, did your wife cook?"
Amy,"So, a little silver lining."
Amy,"Uh, about five years. Iêm actually thinking of moving to a better place now that I donêt need to be so close to, well, you know."
Amy,"Yeah. Anyway, he doesnêt drive, so, I pretty much had to take him everywhere."
Amy,My fault. I brought him up.
Sheldon,"Bah, bam, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. This song is never going to stop. Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?"
Leonard,"Thatês a trick question, right?"
Sheldon,"Well, I shouldnêt be surprised. Thereês a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness."
Penny,"Come on, Sheldon. There are plenty of smart people who donêt have mental problems."
Leonard,"Yup, sheês right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue, thereês an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you."
Sheldon,Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.
Penny,Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.
Sheldon,"The list extends outside of science. Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock, chess champion Bobby Fischer, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys.  I remember the song. Itês called Darlinê by the Beach Boys. Oh, thank goodness. Iêm not crazy. I donêt have to take a pigeon as my bride."
Leonard,There goes our shot at him living on the roof.
Raj,"So, all right, there he is. So, should we introduce ourselves?"
Howard,Let him spot us.
Raj,I wonder if heês listening to our music right now.
Howard,"Could you imagine? What a cool way for us to meet. Heês playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band."
Raj,"And heês, all, like, arenêt you the guys from Footprints on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!"
Howard,I canêt watch.
Raj,"Itês okay. Oh, itês okay. Heês done."
Howard,Why is he looking at it?
Raj,"Eh, no, heês not going to eat it, is he?"
Howard,"Come on, Trent, youêre better than th-ah."
Howard,Letês just go.
Raj,"No, never heard of êem!"
Sheldon,I wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head.
Leonard,I donêt know. Itês pretty catchy.
Penny,Do you even like the Beach Boys?
Sheldon,They have beach right in the name. What do you think?
Leonard,"Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?"
Sheldon,Of course. Iêm already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultraviÑ I know why the song was in my head.
Sheldon,Itês about Amy.
Penny,"Okay, look, I know Amyês like an old lady, but sheês not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her."
Sheldon,"Itês about how she made my life better. Consider the lyrics. I was living like half a man. Then I couldnêt love, but now I can. More soul than I ever had. I love the way you soften my life.î"
Penny,"She did soften your life, didnêt she?"
Sheldon,Yes. Sheês like the dryer sheets of my heart. I have to go.
Leonard,Aw. Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?
Penny,Better. Youêre the lint trap of my love.
Amy,Thatês an interesting tie clip.
Amy,"No, I, I think itês neat. Oh."
Amy,"No, it, itês okay, and we are on a date. Iêm, Iêm just a little nervous."
Amy,"You know, Iêm just being silly. I, I donêt know what Iêm waiting for."
Sheldon, Amy?
Amy,Thatês Sheldon.
Amy,"Sheldon, this, this isnêt a good time."
Sheldon,"I donêt care. Amy, there was a song I couldnêt get out of my head. Eventually, I realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, I canêt get you out of my heart. So, what Iêm trying to say is, youêre my heartworm. The metaphorical kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind."
Sheldon,"Iêm, Iêm sorry; I didnêt realize you were on a date."
Amy,"No, it, it, itês okay. Keep going?"
Sheldon,"Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, I really want to be your boyfriend."
Amy,"I really want that, too."
Sheldon,Good. Because I love you.
Amy,"I love you, too."
Sheldon,"Well, Iêll let you get back to your date."
Amy,Get back here.
Leonard,"Guys, tickets already went on sale."
Howard,Theyêre not supposed to be available yet.
Leonard,"I donêt know what to tell you, but theyêre on sale."
Raj,Wait. Youêre sure theyêre Star Wars tickets?
Leonard,"No, itês Steel Magnolias 2: Even Steelier."
Sheldon,The Web siteês frozen. I canêt get in.
Leonard,"Yeah, me, too."
Howard,Same here!
Raj,"Guys, theyêre gonna sell out."
Howard,What are we gonna do?!
Sheldon,"All right, this goes against everything I stand for, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Lord, this is Sheldon Cooper. Youêre good friends with my mom. I know Iêve spent my life denying that you exist."
Howard,Got êem.
Sheldon,And I will continue to do so!
Penny,Iêm really happy you and Amy are back together.
Sheldon,"Oh, thank you."
Leonard,"Iêm also really happy, but I canêt pretend itês for you. New Star Wars in three days."
Sheldon,"Hey, Thursday canêt get here soon enough. Iêm taking off work to watch the original trilogy while I eat enough Star Wars cereal to choke a Wookiee."
Penny,"Uh, sweetie, you do realize Thursday is Amyês birthday."
Sheldon,"And you do realize I bought my ticket when Amy and I were broken up? I hope you didnêt need anything in that case, êcause itês closed."
Penny,You guys just got back together. You might not want to ditch her on her birthday.
Leonard,I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day.
Sheldon,"But someone might spoil the movie. No one can spoil Amyês birthday for me. Surprise, sheês even older. Who saw that coming?"
Penny,"Aw, thatês nice. Put that on her cake."
Sheldon,"Arthur, what brings you back?"
Sheldon,"In the past, youêve come to me when Iêm struggling with a dilemma."
Sheldon,"Well, my friends are telling me I shouldnêt abandon my girlfriend on her birthday to see the new Star Wars movie."
Sheldon,"Those are the robes of the Jedi, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy."
Sheldon,"So, you agree with my friends that I should skip the premiere?"
Sheldon,Yes. But she knows how important Star Wars is to me.
Sheldon,By seeing the movie sheêd want me to see?
Sheldon,Youêre right.
Sheldon,Where are you going?
Amy,"Sheldon, whatês wrong?"
Sheldon,I wanted to let you know Iêll be spending your birthday with you.
Sheldon,"See, I, I had tickets to the Star Wars premiere that night, but Professor Proton came to me in a dream dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me I should be with you."
Sheldon,"Iêll, Iêll let you get back to sleep now. Good night."
Amy,"Okay. Good night. Wait. Um, Sheldon, were you actually not gonna spend my birthday with me?"
Sheldon,Itês late. Got to go. Bye.
Raj,Good for Sheldon deciding to stay with Amy on her birthday.
Leonard,I know. Itês still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.
Howard,"Well, we could wait a couple days and see it together.  "
Leonard,Hey. Weêre going to the comic book store. You want to come?
Sheldon,"No, I canêt. I need to make preparations for Amyês birthday. Which leads me to the following bit of business. This is my ticket to Star Wars. I donêt have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. I trust youêll give it to someone worthy."
Leonard,"You got it. Well, Penny might want to join us."
Sheldon,This is my ticket to Star WarsÑ.
Sheldon, Penny.
Bernadette,"What happens if I say, come in?"
Penny,"Well, find out."
Bernadette,Come in.
Sheldon, Bernadette.
Penny,Come in.
Sheldon,Keep it up. I got nowhere else to be.
Bernadette,Just come in.
Sheldon,"For future reference, if I want to watch Mean Girls, Iêll stream it on Netflix."
Penny,Weêre sorry. What do you need?
Sheldon,"Well, as you know, Iêll be celebrating Amyês birthday with her, and I could use your assistance in helping me select the perfect gift."
Sheldon,"Well, so far, Iêve come up with three ideas. The first is a chance for her to play the harp with the L.A. Philharmonic."
Penny,Wow. You can really arrange that?
Sheldon,"Well, I said a chance, you know. When you tell them itês your birthday at Benniganês, they make a fuss. I donêt see why the Philharmonic would be any different."
Bernadette,How about something a little more realistic?
Sheldon,"Well, Amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters, so I was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival."
Penny,Sorry. I was waiting for the bazinga.
Bernadette,"Hold on. It could be romantic. The two of them away together, keeping each other warm in snowy Wisconsin."
Sheldon,"No, no, no, no. Sheêd be going alone. Well, if you think Iêm afraid of birds, you should see me around sheep."
Penny,"Okay, well, whatês the third option?"
Sheldon,That I have coitus with her.
Leonard,What do you think about giving Sheldonês ticket to Stuart?
Raj,I donêt know. Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?
Howard,"Itês like going with your grandpa. Instead of eating popcorn, he brings little pieces of chicken in Tupperware and a thermos full of soup."
Leonard,"Heês not that bad. Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?"
Howard,"Oh, make sure to wear sensible shoes. Wil, want to go to Star Wars Thursday?"
Penny,"Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Letês, letês, letês just recap our options. All right, weêve got harp thing, sheep thing."
Bernadette,Wild thang.
Sheldon,"Which do you think sheêd prefer? Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site, and thereês only 8,000 tickets left."
Penny,"Sheldon, being physical with Amy is a huge step for you."
Bernadette,"Yeah, are you ready for this?"
Sheldon,"Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me, but Iêd like to show her how important she is, and it feels like now might be the right time."
Penny,"Sheldon, thatês so beautiful."
Sheldon,Then itês settled. Amyês birthday present will be my genitals.
Amy,Thanks for taking me out.
Penny,"Well, youêre spending your birthday with Sheldon. Why not celebrate early?"
Bernadette,So where do you want to go?
Amy,I heard that new Mexican place on Green Street is good.
Penny,"Sure, sure. Or we could take you to get a bikini wax."
Amy,Why would I get a bikini wax for my birthday?
Penny,"Uh, I donêt know. It was just a thought."
Amy,I think Iêll just stick to Mexican.
Bernadette,"Great. And then maybe after, we can watch a dirty movie, and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how, we can answer them."
Amy,"Okay, what is going on?"
Penny,"Oh, we just want you to be prepared for any surprises that might happen tomorrow."
Amy,What surprises?
Bernadette,"We donêt want to spoil anything, but you should know that Sheldon said heês ready to be physical."
Amy,You shut your damn mouth. You actually heard him say this?
Penny,Yes. He said he wants to do something to show you how much you mean to him.
Amy,"I, I canêt believe it. I, I donêt know what to say."
Bernadette,"Well, weêre really happy for you, and we know how much he caresÑ"
Amy,I do know what to say. Letês get me waxed.
Sheldon,Youêre back.
Sheldon,"I suppose youêre here because Iêve decided to be physical with my girlfriend, and Iêve never done that before."
Sheldon,"So, can you help me?"
Sheldon,"Oh, no. Not that. I, I understand the mechanics."
Sheldon,I think they say junk.
Sheldon,"This is an important night for us, and Iêm worried I might be overwhelmed and ruin everything."
Sheldon,"Thank you, Arthur. You are the wisest of the wise."
Sheldon,"Oh, sure. Well, youêre fun to look at."
Raj,Tonightês the night.
Leonard,"Yeah, the wait is finally over."
Penny,I know. Then youêll finally stop talking about it.
Howard,Ready to go?
Raj,Letês do this.
Penny,"Have fun, guys."
Leonard,We will.
Raj,I canêt believe Sheldon gave this up.
Howard,I know.
Leonard,Weêre gonna have so much more fun than him.
Bernadette,"No, theyêre not."
Penny,"Knowing them, they will."
Howard,T minus 15 minutes.
Raj,"Oh, did you hear from Wil?"
Leonard,"Yeah, heês on his way. Time for bladder check."
Howard,Check. Wait. Screw it. Iêm holding it.
Raj,What is everyone booing at?
Leonard,"Um, hey, Wil. What you doinê?"
Sheldon, Birthday girl.
Amy,Come in.
Amy,"Hi, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Hello. Sorry Iêm late. I also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and I chased it for a while."
Amy,"Thatês okay. Come on in. Thank you. Um, Iêll, Iêm gonna go put these in water."
Sheldon,"Okay. Ooh, this is different, hmm? Candles and music."
Amy,Do you like it?
Sheldon,Itês kind of spooky.
Amy,I can change it back.
Sheldon,"No, no, no. Itês your birthday. As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, Iêll be fine."
Amy,"So, whatêd you have in mind for tonight?"
Sheldon,"I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner. If we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon."
Amy,"Um, that sounds nice, but Iêm not really hungry right now. I thought maybe we could do presents first."
Sheldon,Oh. All right. Um. I should probably tell you something about this gift.
Amy,You mean before you give it to me?
Sheldon,Yes. May I ask you a question before I give it to you?
Amy,Of course.
Sheldon,Why are we saying give it to you like that?
Amy,"Sheldon, I know your present is for us to be intimate tonight."
Sheldon,"I see. Is that all right? Iêm sorry, but this is a litigious society. Iêm gonna need verbal consent."
Sheldon,"You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet."
Leonard,"So, if you donêt like Star Wars, why are you here?"
Raj,"Is it bad? Did you hear something? Oh, my God. Itês bad. Somebody kill me."
Howard,Heês right.
Leonard,"Yeah. No matter what happens, weêre coming back tomorrow to watch it again."
Bernadette,Do you think Sheldonês actually gonna go through with it?
Penny,I donêt know. He said heês ready.
Bernadette,"Yeah, but he also swore this was the year heêd be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin."
Penny,"Well, Iêm gonna stay positive. I mean, we talked, I told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling, he seemed pretty sure of himself."
Amy,"So, um, should I get under the covers with you?"
Sheldon,All right. Hello.
Sheldon,Why are you shaking? Are you cold?
Amy,"Iêm just, um, really nervous."
Amy,"Well, Iêve been waiting for this for so long, Iêve just built it up in my head. I donêt know what to expect."
Sheldon,Neither do I. But we can find out together.
Leonard,Iêm really nervous.
Howard,I know. Weêve been waiting so long for this.
Raj,And weêve built it up in our heads so much.
Leonard,Thatês true.
Howard,Heês right.
Raj,It is.
Raj,"Leonard, I, Iêm scared again."
Sheldon,"Well, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would."
Amy,"Me, too."
Sheldon,I look forward to your next birthday when we do it again.
Amy,That works for me.
Raj,I donêt think I can walk right now.
Sheldon,"Arthur. What are you doing here? I, I donêt think I need any more advice."
Sheldon,"Oh. It was amazing. I, I saw it a few days later. What a movie."
Sheldon,"Oh. Uh, uh, she liked it fine. But she doesnêt have the history with the franchise I do."
Sheldon,Iêm glad to see you made it safely. Howês your hotel?
Amy,"Itês not the best Best Western Iêve been to, but Iêd say itês the third best Best Western Iêve been to."
Sheldon,"I know how you feel. The Best Buy by my house is only the third best Best Buy. They have the best buys, but having the best buys isnêt the only thing that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy."
Amy,What makes a best Best Buy the best Best Buy?
Sheldon,"Mm, thatês a great question. I like when theyêre next to a Chipotle."
Amy,"Okay, well, I should unpack."
Sheldon,All right. Enjoy the neurobiology conference.
Amy,I will. I wish you were here.
Sheldon,At a neurobiology conference? What a mean thing to say.
Amy,"Okay, Iêm glad youêre not here?"
Sheldon,"Aw, you always know just what to say after I tell you what to say."
Amy,"Good-bye, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Bye. Oh, good news, gentlemen. Amyês at a conference this weekend, which means Iêm available to be entertained, hmm. As todayês youth might put it, who wants to get their Sheld-on?"
Howard,Bernie and I are getting the house ready for the remodel. We could always use an extra pair of hands.
Sheldon,That sounds awful. Raj?
Raj,"Uh, Iêve got time booked in the telescope room all weekend scanning for rogue planets. Youêre more than welcome to join me."
Sheldon,Thatês the one to beat. Leonard?
Leonard,"Oh, if anything, Iêm trying to get my Sheld-off."
Sheldon,"Well, then it looks like we have a winner. Congratulations."
Raj,"Well, I should warn you, itês just looking at data for hours and hours on a computer screen."
Sheldon,"Uh, stop selling it, kid. You won."
Leonard,How was your day?
Penny,"Oh, not good. Still couldnêt get in to see Dr. Gallo."
Sheldon,"A doctor? Well, I hope youêre not contagious. Iêve got a weekend in the telescope room Iêve been excited about for almost three minutes."
Penny,Iêm not sick. Itês for work. Thereês this doctor who refuses to see any sales reps. Iêve been trying to get in for months.
Leonard,"Well, did you try wearing the shirt I said was inappropriate for work?"
Penny,"Well, the doctorês a woman, but yes, because you never know."
Howard,What kind of doctor is she?
Penny,"Um, a psychiatrist. Why?"
Howard,"Well, what if you make an appointment as a patient? Then youêll get to talk to her."
Penny,"Yeah, they already know Iêm a pharmaceutical sales rep."
Raj,Oh. What if Leonard made an appointment and tried to lay some groundwork for you?
Penny,Thatês interesting.
Leonard,Iêm not gonna make a fake appointment with a psychiatrist. What would I say is wrong with me?
Raj,Low self-esteem.
Howard,Social anxiety.
Sheldon,Sexual insecurity.
Leonard,None of that is true.
Penny,"Uh, denial. See, sweetie, the list goes on and on."
Leonard,Thatês just crazy. How would my going in there even help you?
Penny,"I donêt know. You could talk to her, and maybe if it comes up, you could ask if sheês heard about the drug."
Leonard,What if I get caught?
Howard,Fear of failure.
Raj,Lack of confidence.
Sheldon,Kind of a wuss.
Leonard,"Fine, Iêll do it. But not because of them, because I love you."
Penny,Thank you.
Sheldon,Still hasnêt bought milk even though I told him two days ago.
Howard,That was incredible.
Bernadette,It was. I just wish Stuart wasnêt around so we didnêt have to be so quiet.
Howard,I know. Itês not like he returns the favour when he watches his Japanese porn cartoons.
Howard,"What is it, Stuart?"
Howard,Hang on. Should I send him away?
Bernadette,"No, itês okay."
Howard,Whatês up?
Howard,Wow. I thought I was done getting lucky tonight.
Bernadette,"So, when are you thinking of moving?"
Bernadette,Oh. Okay. Sorry to see you go?
Bernadette,Youêre very welcome.
Sheldon,What are you doing?
Raj,"Uh, making sure the telescopeês camera is white-field balanced."
Sheldon,Hmm. What are you doing now?
Raj,Still making sure the telescopeês camera is white-field balanced.
Sheldon,"Oh, I see. How about now?"
Raj,Now Iêm making sure the telescopeês camera is white-field balanced and wishing you had a colouring book.
Sheldon,"Well, I can be helpful. Give me something to do. You know, my father took me to work once, and in ten minutes I figured out whoêd been stealing from the cash register. It was my father. Yeah, Dad lost his job, but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle."
Raj,"Fine, you want something to do? Thereês about six months of data on this hard drive. Why donêt you go through it and see if you can spot any patterns or anomalies."
Sheldon,"Yep, Iêm on it. Hey, look at that, an Indian guy outsourcing a computer job to a white fella."
Raj,"Yeah, okay, whatever it takes to keep you busy for a few hours."
Sheldon,Found one.
Raj,"No, you didnêt. There are millions of data points there."
Sheldon,"But, look, an optical transient."
Raj,"Yeah, maybe that is something. How did you find that?"
Sheldon,"It wasnêt difficult. You know how when you see prime numbers, they appear red, but when theyêre twin primes, theyêre pink and smell like gasoline?"
Sheldon,"Oh. I guess Iêm a special boy. You know, sometimes when a boy is special, he gets a Fudgsicle. Which, by the way, tastes like the speed of light."
Leonard,Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.
Leonard,"Uh, sheês my mother. You know her?"
Leonard,"Well, then you know her better than I do."
Leonard,"Really? Any chance you find them cold, cruel and unsuitable for innocent little boys who just want to be happy?"
Leonard,"No, no, say it. Sing it. Rent a plane, write it in the sky."
Leonard,"Oh, no, I, Iêve worked through a lot of that stuff, Iêm better now."
Leonard,"Do you know she never let me celebrate my birthday because being born was her achievement, not mine?"
Leonard,"Right? To this day, I send her a card every year with a little money in it."
Howard,"You know, once we get the house back to ourselves, we can be romantic in any room we want."
Bernadette,Great. I can finally show you where the laundry room is.
Howard,No one.
Bernadette,Nobody thought that.
Bernadette,I guess so.
Howard,Yeah. A grown man moving into his own apartment. Crazy times. See ya.
Bernadette,Ignore him. Heês just using humour to express how happy he is.
Bernadette,"Sure he does. Well, let us know when youêre all settled in."
Bernadette,Our pleasure.
Howard,Heês gone. Letês start in the garage.
Raj,"Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones weêve already collected, weêll know what it is that we found."
Sheldon,"Ooh, perhaps itês a Heliosheath scintillation."
Raj,It could be a trans-Neptunian object.
Sheldon,Maybe itês a new planet.
Raj,"Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet."
Sheldon,"Well, as long as it has a healthy gravity and all its moons, Iêll be happy."
Raj,"Okay, the final image is coming in. And the object we discovered isÑ"
Sheldon,"Come on, Daddy needs a livable planet he can rule with an iron fist."
Raj,A medium-sized asteroid.
Sheldon,Thatês it? How common. Thatês the chicken fingers on the menu of space.
Raj,I kind of like chicken fingers.
Sheldon,"Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor."
Raj,"Come on, a medium-sized asteroid is still an interesting discovery."
Sheldon,I suppose it could end up on a collision course with Earth and destroy life as we know it.
Raj,You dream different than me.
Sheldon,It is kind of cute.
Raj,"Yeah, it is. And you know we get to name it."
Sheldon,We better choose a name no one can make fun of. Sir Frederick William Herschel didnêt do Uranus any favours.
Penny,"Hey, howêd it go?"
Leonard,"Oh, great. Dr. Gallo is terrific. You know, I, Iêve always been insecure that no one cares about what I have to say, but she made me seeÑ"
Penny,"Yeah, no one cares. Did you help me out or not?"
Leonard,"Okay, now, what Iêm hearing is that you feel that I sometimes take too long to express myself, and you wish Iêd be more succinct."
Penny,Youêre only hearing that because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.
Leonard,"All right, well, after we talked about my issues with my mother, nothing too deep, just how she ruined my life, I told her about you and your drug. She said sheêd be happy to meet you."
Penny,"Really? Oh, youêre the best husband ever."
Leonard,So youêll go to the Doctor Who convention with me next week?
Penny,I guess.
Leonard,"Oh, I actually did hear your eyes roll that time."
Bernadette,"Boy, when was the last time Stuart cleaned this place?"
Howard,"No kidding. Oh, okay, Iêm about to suck something up. What do you think this object sounds like?"
Bernadette,"Howie, I donêt want to play Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore. So, what do you think we should do with this room?"
Howard,"Well, I was thinking a home theatre or a gaming room, you know, like a man cave."
Bernadette,Why canêt it be a woman cave?
Howard,"As long as it has a home theatre, a video game system and youêre not allowed in it, you can call it whatever you want."
Bernadette,Iêm being serious.
Howard,"Well, what do you think we should do?"
Bernadette,"I donêt know, maybe a home office or, oh look. The teddy bear Stuart won the night we took him to the fair."
Howard,Oh. He was so excited.
Bernadette,"Yeah. You know, no matter how hard they tried, they could not guess his age."
Howard,Iêll give it to him next time I see him.
Bernadette,Have you heard from him since he left?
Howard,Youêd think he wouldêve called once he got settled in.
Bernadette,Hmm. Maybe heês busy.
Howard,Too busy to call? He wasnêt too busy to binge-watch Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password. What is happening? Are we missing him?
Bernadette,"No, thatês not what this feeling is. Is it?"
Howard,Of course not. He drove us crazy. Like when you were gonna make that pie and Stuart ate all the blueberries.
Bernadette,"And he tried to deny it, but his teeth were all purple."
Howard,That was pretty cute.
Bernadette,"Yeah. Ew, we are missing him!"
Raj,"So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names."
Sheldon,Thatês a great idea. Iêve got it. Weêll call it Cooper.
Raj,How is that both our names?
Sheldon,Koo from Koothrappali and per from Cooper.
Raj,"Yeah, s-so itês, like, Kooper with a K?"
Sheldon,"Nah, youêre right, thatês dumb."
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonard, great news. We discovered a medium-sized asteroid together."
Leonard,"Wow, thatês amazing. Iêm in a pretty great mood today myself."
Sheldon,Okay. Guess weêre gonna talk about you now.
Leonard,"Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo made me realize that Iêm a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter."
Raj,"I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you."
Sheldon,"Okay, back to me. I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it."
Raj,"Wait, what happened to us?"
Sheldon,"Now, this isnêt about us, this is about whatês best for the asteroid."
Leonard,"Well, what are you thinking of naming it?"
Sheldon,I havenêt settled on anything yet.
Raj,We havenêt settled on anything yet.
Sheldon,"All right, way to go, Cat Poster. You hang in there."
Leonard,You know whatêd be nice? Name it after your girlfriends. Show them how much you care.
Raj,That is a great idea.
Sheldon,"Itês perfect. It appears romantic, but itês really just a rock in space that gets me out of Valentineês Day forever."
Raj,"So, uh, what were you thinking? Combine their names?"
Sheldon,"I like it. Yeah, weêll take the A-M from Amy and, uh, the Y from Emily."
Raj,Thatês just Amy.
Sheldon,Exactly. See how well we work together?
Penny,"And in double-blind studies, Placinex proved extremely effective in treating all kinds of anxiety. Actually, funny story, the boys in the lab were worried about getting FDA approval for Placinex. They started taking it, stopped worrying."
Penny,"Uh, do you have any questions?"
Penny,I just meant a question about the drug.
Penny,I donêt wanna.
Penny,"You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot. That was a big selling point."
Amy,"Hi, Sheldon. Whatês up?"
Sheldon,Good news. Youêre an asteroid.
Amy,"Uh, please tell me what to say next."
Sheldon,"Perhaps I should explain. While working with Koothrappali, we discovered an asteroid, and I named it after you."
Amy,"Oh. Sheldon, thank you. Thatês so romantic. But what about Rajesh? He was okay with you choosing the name?"
Sheldon,"Well, it took a little negotiating, but I wore him down. Uh, we get the asteroid, and if you and I have children, they all have to be named Rajesh."
Amy,All of them?
Sheldon,Even the girls.
Amy,"Okay, I think I know what to say now."
Penny,"How can I not sound like his mother when our entire bedroom is filled with Star Wars toys? I mean, have you ever had sex with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?"
Penny,"You know, if anything, heês turning me into his mother. Before I did pharmaceutical sales, I was an actress. You know, I was pretty good. You know, girl-next-door type, but hot. Doable."
Penny,"And not only am I Leonardês mother, but we have this man-child living with us named Sheldon."
Penny,"Yeah, heês as real as the fine I get when I use too much toilet paper."
Penny,"I do. You know, Leonardês right. Talking to you is really helping."
Penny,"Okay, if you think itêll help. Oh, just donêt make it Placinex. I do not need sudden fits of homicidal rage."
Amy,I miss you.
Sheldon,I miss you as well.
Howard,I canêt believe I miss Stuart.
Penny,I guess I just miss when life was simpler.
Leonard,"Remember, girls, you decide what makes you happy, not your emotionally withholding mothers."
Penny,"Hey, so I saw a movie trailer the other day. How could Batman possibly fight Superman? I mean, isnêt that dumb?"
Bernadette,Maybe he uses Kryptonite.
Penny,"No, no, no, no, no. Iêve seen that movie. Itês called Iron Man."
Leonard,What is happening?
Howard,I donêt know.
Raj,But itês beautiful.
Penny,And now Ben Affleck is Batman?
Penny,"Ooh, we should watch that next girlsê night."
Bernadette,We could do a double feature with the Leonardo Di Caprio Romeo and Juliet.
Penny,"Oh, I love me some Leo."
Leonard,And itês gone.
Sheldon,"Oh, hello, everyone. I am happy to report Iêm feeling much better."
Leonard,Good for you.
Sheldon,"My fever is gone, my sinuses are pressure-free, and my mucus is as clear as a Yosemite waterfall."
Howard,Glad to hear it.
Sheldon,Iêll be able to return to work tomorrow.
Sheldon,"Well, why isnêt everyone happy? Your little ray of sunshine is ready to beam again."
Penny,You really donêt know why?
Sheldon,But I knew that his yay was sarcastic. Not bad for a guy whose last bowel movement sounded like rain on a roof.
Leonard,Let me refresh your memory.
Sheldon,"Penny, rub Vicks on my chest."
Penny,"Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast. I made your bed. I checked your mouth for thrush. You can rub your own chest."
Sheldon,"Oh, sure, grope every other male on the planet, but draw the line with me."
Bernadette,I brought you a little care package from work. Itês our latest antiviral and the best decongestant we make.
Sheldon,"I hope laughter is the best medicine, êcause this care package is a joke."
Howard,"Hey, she came all the way hereÑ"
Bernadette,Youêre gonna want to take these with food.
Raj,"Sheldon, stop being a baby and let Emily take a look at you."
Sheldon,Sheês a dermatologist.
Sheldon,"Well, in that case, try removing the irritating patch of brown skin standing next to you."
Leonard,"All right, here you go."
Sheldon,"Leonard, Iêm dying."
Leonard,Youêre not dying. Itês just the flu.
Sheldon,I asked for chicken noodle. This is chicken and stars. Itês killing me.
Sheldon,"I never did get that chicken noodle, did I?"
Amy,"Hi, Sheldon."
Amy,Are you feeling any better?
Sheldon,"Physically, yes, but Iêm upset because everyoneês mad at me for no good reason."
Amy,"Why donêt you tell me what happened, and in a gentle, loving way, Iêll explain to you why youêre wrong."
Sheldon,"You know how, when youêre sick, youêre allowed to be cranky and say whatever you want and other peopleês feelings donêt matter?"
Amy,"Ooh. Gentle and loving, this is gonna be tricky."
Sheldon,"I had a hundred and one fever. If thatês not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?"
Amy,"Sheldon, when youêre sick, you can be unbearable. Thatês why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after itês ended."
Sheldon,You stayed in Michigan all week to avoid being around me?
Amy,"No, no, not just that. I mean, Detroit is beautiful when itês sleeting."
Sheldon,"You know, Iêm not the only one whoês unpleasant when theyêre sick. When Penny got food poisoning, she threw up so loudly I could barely hear the television."
Amy,"Ooh, I just heard something. Might be hail, might be gunfire. Either way, Iêm gonna go take pictures. Bye."
Raj,"Hey, Stuart."
Leonard,"No, heês fine. We just needed a little break."
Howard,He was being a jerk to everyone. Donêt take it personally.
Raj,I wish we could do more stuff without Sheldon.
Leonard,I wish that all the time. Usually before I blow out birthday candles.
Howard,"You know, Amy took some time off from him. Really improved their relationship."
Raj,"Huh. Okay. As long as it doesnêt end with us having coitus with him, Iêm in."
Howard,We should all take a trip or something.
Leonard,"Well, you know, Penny and I have been talking about taking a weekend in Vegas. Maybe we should all go."
Howard,Bernie would love that.
Raj,"Oh, Ooh, maybe we could get one of those party buses to take us there."
Leonard,That sounds really fun.
Raj,"Yeah, that sounds fun. A party-bus party donêt stop. Ooh, when I say party, you say bus."
Leonard,"So, the guys and I were talking about renting a party bus and everyone going to Vegas."
Penny,"Oh, that could be fun. But just to be clear, you mean a party bus with booze and music, right, not, like, juice boxes and video games?"
Leonard,"Yes. And Howardês birthday was a drop-off party, you didnêt have to stay."
Penny,"Well, Iêm in. When are we going?"
Leonard,This weekend.
Sheldon,"Oh, where are we going?"
Leonard,"Well, Vegas, butÑ"
Sheldon,"Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy? No, thank you."
Leonard,"Thatês fine, êcause actually youêre not invited."
Sheldon,"Well, now, well, thatês hurtful."
Penny,"Oh, Sheldon, you donêt even like it there."
Sheldon,I can consider a place Americaês urinal cake and still enjoy the occasional visit.
Leonard,Not this time.
Sheldon,"Oh, fine. Then Iêll just hang out with Wolowitz."
Leonard,"Heês coming, too."
Sheldon,"Well, then Raj and I willÑ"
Sheldon,Very well. Stuart.
Leonard,"Oh, great. Do that."
Sheldon,Ugh. Stuart.
Amy,"Hi, Sheldon. Whatês new?"
Sheldon,"Our friends are jerks, and Iêm mad at all of them."
Amy,"I said whatês new, but sure."
Sheldon,Can you believe they planned a trip to Las Vegas and didnêt invite me?
Amy,Did you refuse to apologize and act like they were stupid for being mad?
Sheldon,"You know, I liked it better when there was still a little mystery left in our relationship."
Amy,"Everyone tried to take care of you, and you were nothing but mean to them."
Sheldon,I canêt believe youêre not on my side. I was on your side when someone stole your car radio.
Amy,Who elseês side could you have been on?
Sheldon,I donêt know. A music-loving hobo with a heart of gold?
Amy,"Sheldon, I understand that youêre upset because you feel left out, but I donêt know why weêre even talking about this. Just apologize to them."
Sheldon,"Fine, if thatês what it takes to go on their dumb trip."
Amy,Maybe you could try apologizing because you actually feel bad. Itês called empathy. Itês something you could work on.
Sheldon,"I have empathy. Watch. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him."
Amy,Great. Now try it as if this isnêt your first day as a person.
Sheldon,"Fine. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. Hey, I felt a little something. Let me try again. Leonard made me soup, and I was mean to him. I was mean to him. He must have felt terrible. Oh, now I feel terrible. Neat."
Amy,Glad I could help.
Sheldon,Now let me see you feel bad for lying and staying in Detroit longer than you needed to.
Amy,"I feel so, so bad."
Sheldon,"Hey, weêre both great at this."
Sheldon,"Leonard, get ready for an apology. And with the added twist of an M. Night Shyamalan movie, Iêm going to mean it."
Leonard,"Ah, so like every other M. Night Shyamalan movie Iêve seen, you spoil it in advance."
Sheldon,"Hey, if you didnêt know Bruce Willis was dead the whole time, thatês not on me. Okay. Here it comes. You tried to take care of me when I was sick, and I was mean to you. Thereês no excuse for that. And Iêm truly sorry."
Leonard,Thank you. I appreciate that.
Sheldon,I want you to know that that is sincere. I do feel bad. Iêm not just saying it to be included on your trip.
Leonard,"Appreciate that, too."
Sheldon,"Terrific. Now all thatês left is for you to invite me to come, me to ask are you sure, you to say absolutely, and then me to bring it home with, how could I say no to that face?"
Leonard,Youêre still not coming.
Sheldon,"I apologized and I meant it. I know that we donêt play this game very often, but youêre doing it wrong."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you upset a lot of people while you were sick. Iêm not in a position to just say you can come."
Sheldon,"Well, all right. What if I apologize to all of them?"
Leonard,"Fine, if you apologize to everyone, they all say itês okay, then yes, you can come."
Sheldon,Challenge accepted. Sounds like itês time for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour.
Leonard,"Well, I hope itês as much fun as the Sheldon Cooper Spell-Checks Local Menus Tour."
Sheldon,"My goodness, do you remember comes with apsparagus?"
Sheldon,"Howard and Bernadette, you tried to comfort me when I was ill, and I treated you terribly. Iêm sorry."
Howard,Wow. Iêm impressed.
Sheldon,"No, no, no, wait. Iêm not done. Allow me to underscore my sentiment with a haunting rendition of Brenda Leeês Iêm Sorry played on the pan flute."
Howard,Apology accepted.
Bernadette,"Forgiven, forgiven."
Sheldon,"All right, thatês eight hours of practice down the drain. And to memorialise this occasion, here are your commemorative T-shirts."
Howard,Sheldon Cooper apologized to me
Bernadette,And he made it all better.
Sheldon,"All you did was offer maternal care and affection, and all you received in return was rude and insensitive behavior."
Penny,Can this wait?
Sheldon,Iêm afraid it canêt. The trip is tomorrow. And I have more apologies to make.
Penny,"Okay, fine, I accept your apology, now get out."
Sheldon,Wonderful. would you mind holding up this shirt while I take a quickÑ?
Sheldon,"You brought me my comic books when I wasnêt feeling well. That, that was thoughtful. And I was insensitive. Iêm sorry."
Sheldon,"And I want you to know that I mean it, you know? This isnêt me just wanting to go on the trip to Las Vegas."
Sheldon,The one everyoneês taking this weekend on the party bus.
Sheldon,"That would be my understanding. On a less painful subject, what size T-shirt do you take?"
Sheldon,"Raj, you were being a good friend, and my illness was no excuse for my behaviour. I hope that you can accept my apology."
Raj,Of course I do.
Sheldon,"And, Emily, Iêm sorry for saying dermatologists arenêt real doctors. And Iêm sure youêre tired of hearing that."
Sheldon,"Well, I would imagine when your job is popping zits and squirting Botox into old lady facesÑ"
Raj,"Okay, okay, the point is that we accept your apology."
Raj,"Yeah, but he doesnêt mean it."
Sheldon,"I believe I can answer that. Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy. Now, why donêt you accept my apology receive your free T-shirt, uh, I hope extra small is okay. For some reason Wolowitz took a medium."
Raj,What are you doing?
Raj,"Fine, how about this? Youêre making me uncomfortable by prolonging this ridiculous fight, and I wish youêd stop."
Raj,"No, come on, please donêt leave."
Sheldon,"Point of clarification, are you still going on the trip? Because if notÑ"
Sheldon,"I caused that fight, I feel terrible. Wait, I can do that better. I caused that fight. I feel terrible. Yeah, wow, I donêt know which one I like more."
Penny,"So, was the fight really bad?"
Sheldon,"As a fight, it was excellent. She used harsh language and slammed the door. Although as I say this, that might not have been what you were asking."
Leonard,You think theyêll still go on the trip?
Sheldon,All I know is after the fight I went to Emilyês to smoothÑ
Leonard,Theyêre not going on the trip.
Raj,What is wrong with you?
Sheldon,"Look at him, caring about whatês wrong with me. That is some top-shelf empathy. Hey, well, we should start a club."
Raj,"You went to Emilyês to apologise, and when you left, she was crying."
Sheldon,"That is true. Well, I suppose I should apologize again."
Penny,Is she okay?
Raj,"Yeah, I calmed her down, but sheês not going to Vegas if heês going."
Howard,"Wait, thatês an option? I didnêt know that was an option."
Sheldon,"Well, that is fine, because Iêve decided that I wonêt be joining you. Iêve realized that the most genuine way to demonstrate the remorse I feel is to let you have this weekend to yourselves."
Raj,Thatês very mature of you.
Sheldon,"Well, Iêve been on a little trip myself recently. Not to Sin City but to Sincere City. Where instead of genital warts, the only growth youêll come back with is personal growth."
Penny,And thereês your next T-shirt.
Howard,"Ooh, check out the stripper pole."
Bernadette,You know what that means.
Leonard,That Rajêll be on it before we make it to the freeway?
Raj,"You know it. Oo-ah, oo-ah."
Bernadette,This is so cool.
Penny,Hereês some champagne.
Leonard,"Mm-hmm. Well, I would like to propose a toast to a well-deserved weekend ofÑ"
Leonard,What are you doing?
Sheldon,"My plan was to jump out at the state line, but one of my nose plugs fell into the toilet."
Penny,You couldnêt give us just one weekend?
Leonard,"What do we do, kick them off?"
Penny,"If we drop them off at a fire station, they have to take them, no questions asked."
Sheldon,"Before you do, please give me one more chance to apologize to Emily."
Raj,"Oh, God."
Sheldon,"Emily, as Iêm sure you know, Iêm considered an odd fellow. But what you donêt know is that, while I often say the wrong thing, in my heart I mean well. I think that you are a smart and wonderful woman, you know? And we all think that you can do better than Koothrappali."
Raj,"You know, SheldonÑ"
Sheldon,"So, for all the times Iêve offended you and all the times that Iêll offend you in the future, Iêm sorry."
Sheldon,Good. Then Iêll be leaving now.
Sheldon,"Oh, thatês very kind of you. But Iêm sure youêll all have a better time without me. Letês go, Stuart."
Sheldon,"Stuart, now."
Penny,And now you see the problem.
Leonard,"Come on, you pain in the ass."
Sheldon,"Thatês me. Bye, Stuart."
Sheldon,Are you relieved that you and Raj were able to patch things up?
Penny,"Shake it, baby."
Bernadette,"Ooh, work that thing."
Sheldon,"Hereês a fun Postal fact. The inner side of our mailbox is under federal jurisdiction. So, if you broke my right thumb, thatês Pasadena city police. But if you broke my left thumb, thatês the FBI."
Leonard,"If Iêm going to jail, Iêm killing him, not breaking his thumb."
Sheldon,"Oh, I got a letter from my Meemaw. Umm. Smell this."
Penny,What is that?
Sheldon,"Uh, roses, bengay, and Dr. Schollsê foot powder."
Penny,"Ah, yeah, Grandma by Calvin Klein. You know, the last time I got a hand written letter it was from someone who told me I parked like a blind person."
Leonard,That someone has a name.
Sheldon,"Uh, thank you. Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth. Oh, but then she found her old ones. Oh, so now the new ones are just gonna be her church teeth."
Leonard,Fun. Like your Comic-Con Spock ears and your around the house Spock ears.
Penny,I park fine.
Sheldon,"Oh, my goodness, sheês coming to visit!"
Leonard,"Oh, itêll be nice to finally meet her."
Sheldon,"Oh, you are going to love her. She is the kindest, sweetest woman youêll ever meet. Unless youêre a gopher digging up her vegetable garden. In that case, you can expect to have your head bashed in with a shovel."
Sheldon,Thatês not her. Thatês not her. Thatês not her. Thatês not her. Thatês not her. Thatês not her. Thatês not her. Thatês not her.
Leonard,Really? The old Asian man is not your Meemaw?
Sheldon,"And thatês not helpful. You know, I got her an iPhone for Christmas. Iêll see where she is."
Leonard,"Oh, thatês nice. Most people her age donêt embrace technology."
Sheldon,"Oh, no, she doesnêt even know she has it. No, I had my sister slip it in her bag so that I can track her like a sea turtle."
Leonard,Same as when we lost you at the zoo.
Sheldon,"Uh, for the hundredth time, I smelled kettle corn and couldnêt find the cart."
Leonard,Still doesnêt explain how you ended up on the freeway divider.
Sheldon,Meemaw. Iêm so happy to see you.
Sheldon,"Oh. You got even smaller. I love it. Uh, Meemaw, this is Leonard. Leonard, this is my Meemaw."
Leonard,"Hi. So nice to finally meet you. Let me take this for you, Meemaw."
Sheldon,"Oh, no. Now you call her Constance. I call her Meemaw. You have your own Meemaw. Itês not my fault she died when you were four."
Sheldon,"It isnêt, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard."
Leonard,Can you please live with us forever?
Howard,"Thatês ridiculous. If you had a superpower, and spent your whole life being told to suppress it, when you finally decide to embrace that power, why hide in isolation?"
Raj,"Iêm sorry, and how much money did your version of Frozen make?"
Howard,"Iêm just saying, instead of Let it Go, she should really sing, Look At Me Hiding in a Freezer Like a Dove Bar."
Raj,"She built an ice castle, made a snow monster and gave herself a complete makeover in one day. You know what I saw you do today? Eat a block of cream cheese straight from the foil and lie about it to your wife."
Raj,"Yeah, thatês true. In fact, they liked the song so much, they retooled the whole script around it."
Howard,"Here we are talking about Frozen, and yet, you got burned."
Raj,"Iêm so sorry but, how can you not like that movie?"
Howard,"Oh, thatês what I said an hour ago."
Howard,You shouldêve seen us after The Good Dinosaur.
Raj,"It was a classic western set in the post-Jurassic period, and it changed my life."
Sheldon,Are you comfortable?
Sheldon,"You were so cute, huffinê and puffinê. Thereês Amy. I just know youêre gonna hit it off. You both have the same fashion sense. Hello. Come in, say hi to my Meemaw."
Amy,Hi. Nice to meet you.
Amy,How was your trip?
Amy,"Thatês great. And look at you, sitting in Sheldonês spot. You know, I donêt even get to sit there."
Sheldon,"Yeah. And you never will. Ooh, hey, oh, ask her to do the tissue thing. Do it, ask her."
Amy,Can I have a tissue?
Sheldon,Isnêt that the best? Sheês like Grandma Spider-Man.
Sheldon,"Oh, well, you two sit down and get to know each other. Iêll get your room ready."
Sheldon,"If I did, would I find any?"
Sheldon,Thatês a risk Iêm willing to take.
Amy,"Well, this is so nice. Heês so excited to have you here andÑ"
Amy,"S, s, si, size me up?"
Amy,"Well, I, Iêm, Iêm sure youêll like me once you get to know me."
Sheldon,"A Texas Special cattle and calf car train set with authentic horn and bell. Thank you, Meemaw."
Sheldon,"Amy, why donêt you look excited? Well, you get to watch me play with this."
Raj,"Oh, I see youêre reading Saga."
Raj,"It is, and not a lot of comics have a woman with wings breastfeeding a baby right on the cover."
Howard,You should. Heês really looked.
Raj,"Iêm Raj, by the way. This is Howard."
Raj,"Well, Iêve never seen you here before, Claire."
Howard,Youêre a screenwriter?
Raj,"Yeah, I get that. Iêm a scientist, slash party planner, slash small-dog enthusiast, slash guy who probably should have stopped at scientist."
Raj,"Well, astrophysicist."
Raj,Sure. I love animated movies.
Howard,"He does, and he has the Lilo & Stitch collector plates to prove it."
Raj,Excuse me for wanting a little magic in my life.
Raj,"Yeah, great."
Raj,"Yeah, bye."
Howard,What are you doing? You have a girlfriend.
Howard,"So, how do you think sheêd feel about you helping a beautiful girl with her screenplay?"
Raj,I wouldnêt say sheês beautiful.
Howard,Really? You donêt think sheês attractive?
Raj,I do. I just wouldnêt tell my girlfriend.
Penny,"Constance, are you sure I canêt pour you some wine?"
Sheldon,"Here you go, Meemaw. I made it just how you like, a lot in a glass."
Amy,Iêm curious. Why do you call Sheldon Moon Pie?
Sheldon,"And I call her Meemaw because, well, just, well, look at her."
Amy,"Oh, well, you know, now, now that Iêm hearing it, it does sound familiar."
Sheldon,"How could it? I never told you, and you never bothered to ask."
Amy,"Well, now I know."
Penny,Yes. Iêm a pharmaceutical sales rep.
Amy,"I have a relationship and a full-time career, too."
Amy,"Why not? You, you just said itês okay for her to work."
Leonard,Thatês my best friend.
Amy,"Look, I, I get that youêre protective of your grandson, but heês an adult now. Maybe I understand what he needs better than you do."
Amy,Thank you.
Amy,"Well, maybe I donêt like you either."
Sheldon,"Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to like each other. Well, we have a 4:30 reservation at Applebeeês."
Amy,I think I should leave.
Sheldon,"But why? Other than you two fighting, weêre having such a good time."
Amy,"The minute you left the room, your precious meemaw started giving me a really hard time. I donêt need this."
Amy,What ring?
Leonard,Maybe we should give them some privacy.
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. You go ahead. Iêll catch up with you."
Amy,You have an engagement ring?
Amy,"Penny, did you know about this?"
Penny,"All right, letês go."
Amy,When did you get an engagement ring?
Sheldon,"My mother gave it to me, and I had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up."
Amy,"Sheldon, will you please tell your grandmother to stay out of this?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I donêt think I could do that."
Sheldon,"Iêm gonna opt out of that one, too."
Amy,"Who said I even want to be engaged to him? And if I do, I, I donêt need your hand-me-downs."
Sheldon,"All right, all right, look, l, letês all, letês remain calm and analyse this situation. Now, I realize that youêve only known each other for less than a day, but is it possible this crankiness is because your cycles have synced?"
Amy,Donêt speak to him like heês a child.
Sheldon,Thank you. Iêm gonna go next door and play with Leonard.
Bernadette,"Okay, so you met this girl, you exchanged numbers, and youêre gonna meet up with her."
Raj,Just to help her with her screenplay.
Bernadette,"Oh. Well, I guess thatês not so bad."
Howard,You werenêt there. He was really flirting.
Raj,"Hey, itês not my fault if American women project their fantasies on foreigners with the kind of magical voice that grants wishes."
Bernadette,Iêm sure it was harmless. People flirt. No big deal.
Howard,Really? So itês okay if I flÑ
Bernadette,"Not you. I own your ass. The real question is, where are you with Emily?"
Raj,"Uh, itês hard to say. I think weêre good, but things like this make me wonder if Emilyês really the right person for me. I mean, did you guys ever have doubts about each other?"
Howard,Never.
Bernadette,"Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this."
Howard,"Fine. I had reservations about you, too."
Bernadette,"No, you didnêt."
Howard,"No, I didnêt."
Bernadette,"Well, it doesnêt matter now, êcause I love how things worked out."
Howard,"Me, too. And I think youêre even more beautiful than this rose."
Penny,"Wow. You know, the last time I saw my grandma, the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding."
Leonard,Did it?
Penny,"Yeah, right in there. She ate it and everything."
Sheldon, Leonard and Penny.
Penny,Come in.
Leonard,Hey. What happened? Is Amy gone?
Sheldon,They asked me to leave so they could speak privately.
Sheldon,"Yeah, I know. It was quite tense. So hereês the million dollar question, uh, who wants to pop over there and get my trains?"
Raj,"All right. Iêve made up my mind. Iêm gonna do the right thing, call this girl, and let her know that Iêm in a relationship."
Howard,"Okay, so far weêve heard, made up my mind Iêm dumping Emily."
Bernadette,Made up my mind to date both of them by pretending to be twin brothers.
Howard,"And made up my mind, Iêll ask for a threesome and if they say no, play it off as a joke."
Raj,Iêm calling her. And the threesome didnêt deserve the belly laugh it got.
Bernadette,Youêre right. It could totally happen.
Raj,"Hi. Hi. Yeah, itês Raj. Rajesh. We met at the comic book store."
Raj,"Actually, thatês why Iêm calling. I, um, I just, I need to let you know that I have a girlfriend."
Raj,"Well, no, no. I, I didnêt want to mislead you after you asked me out."
Raj,"Wait, are you saying that we didnêt have a vibe?"
Raj,"Come on, I just told you I had a girlfriend. The least you can do is tell me if we had a vibe."
Raj,"I knew it. Okay, we did have a vibe. This is exciting. Whatês my next move?"
Bernadette,You still have a girlfriend.
Raj,"Right. Good catch. Anyway, so Iêm sorry to waste your time. And, uh, and good luck with your screenplay."
Raj,"Not me. Ever since you admitted we had a vibe, Iêve been planning our wedding."
Raj,"Okay. That hurts a little, but okay."
Raj,"Bye. All right. So, uh, weêre meeting for coffee like two adults. Everybodyês happy. Easy peasy."
Bernadette,Are you gonna tell Emily?
Raj,"Yeah, of course. We have no secrets."
Howard,When are you gonna tell Emily?
Raj,He lied about the cream cheese. He ate the whole thing. I saw him.
Amy,"Look, I know you think Iêm not right for Sheldon, but trust me, Iêm his best shot. You have no idea how much I put up with."
Amy,Really? You know what itês like to have date night ruined because Google changed their font?
Amy,"Well, if you understand, then why are you giving me such a hard time?"
Penny,Hi. Sorry. Sheldon would like to say something to you.
Sheldon,"No, I wouldnêt."
Leonard,Just get in here.
Penny,Go ahead.
Sheldon,"Meemaw, look, Iêm sorry, but I have to defend my girlfriend to you."
Amy,"Oh, Sheldon, thank you."
Sheldon,"Oh, great, now youêre gonna get emotional. I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop. I, I know what a challenging man he could be, but I saw you stand by him and-and make him into a better person."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, that is exactly what Iêve been doing the last five years with this little work in progress."
Leonard,"He never disappoints, does he?"
Amy,I think what Sheldon means to say is weêve both grown together. Isnêt that right?
Penny,Say yes.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Amy,"So if he wanted to give me that engagement ring, we would have your blessing?"
Sheldon,"I just gave you my virginity, woman. Cool your jets."
Raj,"Yeah, see, if you just change the story to the destruction of our galaxy, then a super massive black hole could work."
Raj,And thatês how Mommy and Daddy met.
Raj,I will.
Sheldon,"If any of you are looking for something to do on Valentineês Day, Amy and Iêll be streaming our first-ever live episode of Fun With Flags. Youêre welcome to join us as we celebrate the timeless love affair between wind and flapping fabric."
Leonard,"Penny and I have dinner reservations that night, but any other time, no."
Howard,"Sorry, Bernie and I are breaking in the new hot tub, if you know what I mean."
Sheldon,Not a clue. Raj?
Raj,Spending Valentineês Day with Emily.
Leonard,You donêt sound very excited about it.
Raj,"Oh, I am, I am. I, I guess Iêm still wondering if Emily and I are right for each other."
Howard,Does this have to do with that girl you had coffee with?
Raj,"You mean the strong, sexy angel I canêt stop thinking about? Who can say?"
Howard,Youêve been talking about breaking up with Emily forever. Why donêt you just do it already?
Leonard,"Yeah, just get it over with."
Raj,"Well, you say it like itês easy. Have any one of you ever broken up with anyone?"
Leonard,Not really.
Sheldon,"You know, uh, once I ordered an Uber by accident. I just got in and went somewhere."
Penny,"So, you really gonna break up with her?"
Raj,"Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?"
Penny,"Well, I have broken up with my fair share of guys. I mean, how many times did I break up with Leonard?"
Leonard,I stopped counting at four.
Penny,"All right, my advice to you is do it at her place so you can leave when you need to, uh, tell the truth, make it quick and be prepared for tears."
Raj,"Oh, Iêm gonna do a pre-cry before I go in there. Really dry myself out."
Leonard,She meant Emily.
Penny,"No, I, I really didnêt."
Raj,"Youêre right, letês talk again in a few days."
Raj,"Hey, Claire. Hi. Itês, itês Rajesh. I was, I was wondering if youêre free for Valentineês Day?"
Raj,But I just broke up with my girlfriend.
Raj,Please take me back. Our love was meant to be.
Raj,Iêm gonna all alone on Valentineês Day.
Leonard,"Well, you were right, tears."
Amy,"Okay, and we are live in 22 minutes."
Sheldon,Iêm nervous. I hope people will be around to watch even though itês Valentineês Day.
Amy,"People who are fans of an Internet show about flags? Trust me, theyêre around."
Sheldon,"Oh, and speaking of Valentineês Day, I havenêt forgotten about you tonight."
Amy,What do you mean?
Sheldon,"Well, youêve become such an integral part of my life as well as this show, I felt it only right to include your name in the title."
Amy,Oh. That is so sweet.
Sheldon,"So from now on, this program will be officially known as Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present Dr. Sheldonê Cooperês Fun With Flags."
Howard,Iêm gonna check the temp on the tub.
Bernadette,Donêt make it too hot.
Howard,"Sorry, but too hot is the only temperature I come in."
Bernadette,"Look at that, you shaved it all."
Howard,"Youêre welcome. Um, question, this is my first hot tub, is it supposed to come with a rat flopping around in it?"
Bernadette,"Ew, really? Get it out."
Bernadette,"Uh, wish we had a skimmer."
Howard,"Uh, you turn off the jets, Iêll get a strainer from the kitchen."
Bernadette,I donêt know how to turn off the jets.
Howard,"Good, I donêt know where we keep the strainer."
Leonard,"Excuse me. Uh, bad news. The maÓtre dê said itês gonna be at least an hour."
Penny,An hour? Thatês crazy. We have a reservation.
Leonard,I know.
Penny,So what did you say?
Leonard,"Thanks, sorry to bother you. But I said it like a badass."
Penny,"All right, well, canêt you, like, slip him some money or something?"
Leonard,Really? Iêve never done that before. Does it work?
Penny,Do people like money? Is that what youêre asking?
Leonard,A lot of attitude from the woman who thought MC squared was a rapper.
Penny,"Now, is that a smart thing to say on a holiday thatês basically national sex night?"
Leonard,"Iêm sorry. Youêre pretty, Iêm stupid. Hello. Uh, just checking again for Hofstadter. Still gonna be an hour?"
Leonard,Okay. Thanks. Hey. I think you may have dropped this?
Leonard,"Oh, I took care of it."
Amy,"Okay, we are live in five, four, three, oh, wait, oh shoot, I already pushed the button. Never mind, weêre live."
Sheldon,"Uh, hello and welcome to a special live edition of Dr. Sheldon CooperÑ"
Amy,And Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler presentÑ
Amy,"Consider tonightês episode a Valentineês Day gift for you, our viewers."
Sheldon,"Itês also my gift to you. That was clear, right? ‚Cause youêre not getting anything else."
Amy,"Since weêre live, youêll finally be able to reach out to us with your flag thoughts and flag questions."
Sheldon,"Allow us to answer a few quick ones that we get all the time. Uh, uh, yes, I really am a doctor. Uh, yes, she really is my girlfriend."
Amy,"No, I just blink a lot, itês not Morse code for rescue me. Oh, uh, ok, uh, hereês our first call. Hello, and welcome to Fun With Flags. Whatês your question?"
Raj,What is wrong with me? Why am I so self-destructive?
Raj,"Yes. Whenever things are going well, I always find a way to ruin it. You two look happy, how do you do it?"
Amy,"I, I think it starts with good communication."
Sheldon,"You know what, thatês not a flag question. Next caller."
Howard,"I hope you donêt think Iêm just saying this because itês Valentineês Day, but, I love you so much."
Bernadette,"Iêm gonna put this down your robe. Itês not moving, but I think itês still alive."
Howard,"Well, should we put it back in there a few minutes?"
Bernadette,"No, and itês not a rat, itês a rabbit. We need to save it."
Howard,"Well, how do we do that?"
Bernadette,"Um, I donêt know, look it up on your phone. Iêm gonna wrap it in a towel."
Howard,"Um, taking care of injured rabbit. Okay. Make sure itês comfortable and warm. Well, it was just in a hot tub. Iêm gonna say check."
Bernadette,Anything else?
Howard,"To make sure itês not dehydrated, feed him an electrolyte solution. If itês not responding, use a warm cloth to wash its face and genitals. Yeah."
Penny,"This is ridiculous. You know, Iêm gonna go talk to the maÓtre dê."
Leonard,What are you gonna say?
Penny,"I donêt know. Iêm, Iêm gonna flirt with him."
Leonard,I donêt know if Iêm comfortable with that.
Penny,Iêm still sleeping with you tonight.
Leonard,See if you can get a table by the window.
Penny,Hi there. Whatês your name?
Penny,"Oh, boy, it is crazy in here tonight, huh, Glen?"
Penny,"Yes. Oh, bet your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight. Anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and I justÑ"
Penny,You donêt have to call me maêam.
Penny,"I mean, weêre basically the same age."
Penny,How old are you?
Penny,"Just shut up, Glen. Come on, letês get out of here."
Leonard,Why?
Penny,Because Iêm young. Letês go.
Amy,"Rajesh, itês perfectly normal to have doubts after breaking up with someone."
Raj,You really think so?
Sheldon,"Yeah, you know whatês not normal? Blubbering about emotions during a flag show. Unless that emotion is excitement over New Zealand changing their flag. Yeah, good luck, you crazy Kiwis, weêre rooting for you."
Amy,Your friend is hurting.
Raj,"No, Sheldonês right. Emily did say I always talk about my feelings too much."
Sheldon,"I suppose that could be a legitimate concern in a relationship. Uh, perhaps even a, a red flag. And speaking of red flags, check out this sexy number from the former Soviet Union. Hubba, hubba."
Amy,"Oh. Uh, we-we have another caller. Hi. Youêre on Fun with Flags."
Raj,Kripke? Is that you?
Sheldon,"Please, all comments and questions should be flag-related."
Sheldon,I donêt see why not.
Bernadette,Heês eating. Thatês a good sign.
Howard,Youêre gonna have to wait one hour until you can go swimming again.
Bernadette,Heês pretty cute.
Howard,He is. Should we name him?
Bernadette,It is Valentineês Day. How about Valentino?
Howard,"Nice. A classic rabbit name. Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit. Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit. Oh, look at all that chest hair and overbite. Of course youêre a Wolowitz. Son of a bitch, he bit me."
Bernadette,Are you okay?
Howard,"No, Iêm not okay. Wild rabbits can have rabies."
Bernadette,"Oh. Well, why did you put your finger near its mouth?"
Howard,"Poor judgement, obviously."
Bernadette,Heês so little. Iêm sure itês fine.
Howard,How can it be fine? I just got attacked by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.
Leonard,"Itês not what we planned, but this isnêt so bad, right?"
Penny,It is freaking amazing.
Leonard,"Well, glad youêre feeling better."
Penny,"I was just hungry and cranky, and Iêve never been called maêam before."
Leonard,Is that a big deal?
Penny,Kind of. When was the first time someone called you sir?
Leonard,"Sixth grade, but I wore a sport coat and carried a briefcase, soÑ"
Penny,"Can you believe when I met you I was 22? I mean, itês crazy. Where did all that time go?"
Leonard,"Mm, you watched The Bachelor a lot."
Penny,"Yeah, go ahead and make jokes, but your thirties are almost over."
Leonard,"No, theyêre not."
Penny,Youêre closer to 40 than you are 30.
Leonard,"Ha, ha. You married an old man. Tell you what. Letês do something fun tonight."
Penny,Wonêt make us any younger.
Leonard,"Well, maybe not, but some day we actually will be old, and weêll look back on this night and remember what a good time we had."
Penny,"Okay, like what?"
Leonard,I know. Food fight. Iêll keep thinking.
Amy,"Look, I know you both feel bad about being alone, but sometimes the best thing you can do is take a little time for yourself, especially when you just got out of a relationship."
Sheldon,"Speaking of ending relationships, when British Honduras became Belize, they designed a new flag with a tree on it, and I would like to hang myself from that tree."
Raj,"But, Amy, when you and Sheldon split up, didnêt you start dating someone right away?"
Amy,"Well, I, I wouldnêt say right away."
Sheldon,"And actually, it was three different men."
Amy,"Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke."
Amy,"Now? Oh, looks like we just lost Kripke."
Raj,"Before Emily, I was alone for so long. I just, I donêt know if I can do that again."
Sheldon,"Well, you know, here is something that might cheer you up. The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but three legs sharing a weird pair of underpants, so you think you got problems."
Amy,"I have an idea. Maybe someone in our audience would be interested in meeting Rajesh. Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind, handsome, intelligentÑ"
Raj,"Rich parents, donêt forget, rich parents."
Amy,"Ñspoiled astrophysicist who not onlyÑ oh. Well, that was quick. Hi. Youêre on Fun with Flags."
Amy,"Hello, Kripke."
Leonard,"Letês see. Whatês young and fun? Uh, we could go dancing."
Leonard,Are you actually gonna dance?
Leonard,Of course.
Penny,"Yeah. No one wants to see that. Hey, how about skinny dipping at the beach?"
Leonard,"No, I donêt need any fish nibbling my business."
Penny,"Oh, thereês a screening of Moulin Rouge, I heard the crowd sings along and stuff."
Leonard,That sounds fun. Whenês it start?
Leonard,Midnight. Really? You know what? Letês do it.
Penny,"Okay, great. Oh, wait. Uh, itês sold out."
Leonard,"Oh, thank God."
Howard,"It says, rabies in rabbits is highly unlikely."
Bernadette,"Oh, terrific."
Howard,"Itês not terrific. Lots of highly unlikely things happen. You saw whatês under this robe, and you still married me."
Bernadette,"If youêre really worried, weêll take him to the vet and have him tested."
Howard,"Good. Thank you. Oh, okay, there is a test. All they have to do is cut off his head and check his brain."
Bernadette,"Oh, cut off his head? Thatês where his little nose is."
Howard,Heês not showing any symptoms. I guess Iêll just go to the emergency room to be safe.
Bernadette,"Howie, this is just your hypochondria."
Howard,"No, when I sat on the mute button and thought Iêd gone deaf, that was my hypochondria."
Bernadette,Weêll find another time to tell him Iêm pregnant.
Raj,"I mean, this is the first time Iêve ever broken up with someone. I just, I didnêt realize it was gonna hurt this much."
Amy,It really can.
Sheldon,"All right. Nothing about this is fun. No one wants to talk about flags, and I havenêt spoken in over ten minutes, so, enjoy your new show, Internet. Dr. Amy Farrah Flower present with."
Raj,Iêm sorry for bothering you. Iêll hang up now.
Amy,"No, hold on, Rajesh. You know, youêre not being very sympathetic. You know first hand that breakups are hard."
Sheldon,"Fine. If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isnêt good for us."
Amy,Iêm just gonna push all the buttons.
Sheldon,"Raj, now, Iêm sorry youêre suffering. When Amy and I were broken up, I also suffered. And this may sound surprising, but Iêm grateful for having gone through it."
Sheldon,Yes. I believe our relationship now is stronger than ever.
Amy,So do I.
Sheldon,"When, when we were apart, I learned how important you are to me. And I realize that when two people are in love, sometimes theyÑ"
Leonard,We are young and fun.
Sheldon,I stand corrected. Fun.
Sheldon,Congratulations on a successful live show.
Amy,And a lovely Valentineês Day.
Penny,Cleaning up is not young and fun.
Leonard,It can be. Confetti fight. Maybe you should take a break. I got this.
Sheldon,Did you know the singular of confetti is confetto?
Amy,"Interesting, and when would you use the singular?"
Sheldon,"Iêm glad you asked. Amy, you have a confetto in your nose. No, no, no, no. Other side. There you go."
Howard,We? What is this?
Bernadette,I donêt know. Maybe it says something on the back.
Howard,"Continued on milk. If youêre tricking me into making my own breakfast, it didnêt work for my mom, and it wonêt work for you. Are. We are. See spoons for more."
Bernadette,What could it be? We are Groot? We are the champions? We are family? I got all my sisters with me?
Howard,Are you serious?
Howard,Are you sure?
Bernadette,"Pretty positive. Thatês a joke, because the pregnancy test saysÑ"
Howard,"Oh, my God. This is incredible. Weêre gonna be parents? Weêre gonna get to board planes first. Finally gonna get to see whatês in that family bathroom at the mall."
Bernadette,"I know, itês crazy."
Howard,"It is crazy. Oh. I mean, how do you prepare for something like this? Iêm not even sure Iêve held a baby before."
Bernadette,"Oh, itês okay, youêll figure it out."
Howard,"But howês this all gonna work? Do we get a nanny? I mean, can we afford a nanny? And if we can, we canêt get a pretty one, êcause itêll wreck our marriage. We canêt get an ugly one, êcause itêll scare the kid."
Bernadette,"I donêt know, Howie."
Howard,"Are we in a good school district? Youêre Catholic, Iêm Jewish. What religion do we raise it? And if itês a boy, do we get him circumcised? People say itês barbaric, but if we donêt, it looks like a pig in a blanket."
Bernadette,"Calm down, itês gonna be okay."
Howard,"Howês it gonna be okay? Look at me, Iêm a mess. And that means this babyês gonna be half a mess. And thatês even before we screw it up with our cut-rate moderately attractive nanny."
Leonard,"Hey, Raj, I read a couple of guys in your department may have discovered a new planet in our solar system?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I heard about that. Why didnêt you discover it?"
Raj,"Because instead of being in the telescope room, I was busy making you guys home made jam for the holidays."
Sheldon,"Well, you be sure to let us know when you win the Nobel Prize for boysenberry."
Raj,"Hey, bud."
Leonard,Ready to play when you are.
Howard,"Yeah, um, in a minute. I actually need to tell you guys something."
Raj,"If itês thank you for the home made jam you got in December, congratulations, youêre the first one."
Leonard,Whatês going on?
Howard,"Iêm, uh, uh, gonna be a father."
Leonard,Congratulations.
Raj,Thatês so amazing.
Sheldon,"Oh, no."
Leonard,"Why oh, no?"
Sheldon,"Because this changes everything. What about comic book night? Uh, what about playing games together? What about our trips to Disneyland? How can we do those things with a child around?"
Leonard,"Relax, thereês room for two babies in this group."
Sheldon,"Oh, dear lord, Pennyês pregnant, too?"
Leonard,Youêre the other baby.
Sheldon,"Oh, really? Okay, well, would a baby have to shave once every 11 days?"
Leonard,Would an adult refuse to eat his graham crackers because one of them was broken?
Sheldon,I guess weêll call this a draw.
Bernadette,"So, Iêm glad you guys are here. Thereês something I want to share with you. Howie and I are going toÑ"
Penny,Leonard says youêre pregnant.
Penny,"Donêt say anything. act surprised when she tells you. All right, how you want to do this?"
Bernadette,Iêm pregnant.
Penny,"Oh, my God, I canêt believe it."
Amy,This is so exciting.
Bernadette,"Yeah, itês all real exciting."
Penny,"Are, are you not happy about this?"
Bernadette,"I am. Of-of course I am. Iêm, Iêm sure itês just the hormones. But itês weird, Howieês the one whoês been talking about having kids for years, and I was all excited to tell him because I thought heêd be thrilled, but then he started to flip out and now this feels like a bad idea and Iêm gonna get fat."
Penny,"No, no, come on. Come on, youêre not gonna get fat. Youêre gonna be beautiful and glowing and, and have the cutest little baby bump ever."
Bernadette,"Easy for you to say, skinny bitch. Sorry, hormones."
Penny,"Oh, thatês all right. All I heard was skinny."
Amy,I wouldnêt make too much out of Howard not reacting the way you expected him to.
Penny,"Yeah, Iêm sure it was just the initial shock of it all."
Bernadette,"Youêre probably right. After we talked about it, he started to calm down."
Howard,I shouldnêt be raising a kid. I donêt even eat my own vegetables.
Leonard,"Buddy, I, I think you might be overreacting."
Howard,"And then thereês this nose. I mean, what if he looks like me? Or worse, what if she looks like me?"
Sheldon,Not to mention the impact on our social circle. Everythingês going to change. Howard wonêt be able to come over as much.
Raj,"Well, he could bring the baby here."
Sheldon,"Oh, but then weêd have to baby-proof the apartment. You know, my sister has one of those toilet locks in her bathroom. I have two doctorates, I still had to go in the sink."
Howard,"Oh, my God, and do you have any idea how expensive having a kid is?"
Raj,"I read that in Los Angeles, raising a child through college can cost over a million dollars."
Howard,"A million dollars? God, itês like my nuts just kicked me in the nuts. Thatês it, I got to start earning more money right now."
Raj,"I know, you could ask Bernadette for a raise in your allowance."
Howard,This isnêt a joke.
Raj,I wasnêt joking.
Leonard,Itêll be fine. People have kids every day. Youêll figure this out.
Raj,"Yeah, come on, this is great news and you know it."
Howard,"Youêre right, it is, Iêm just a little overwhelmed right now."
Leonard,"Hey, you know what we should do?"
Sheldon,All get vasectomies so this doesnêt happen to us?
Leonard,Go out and celebrate. But not your worst idea.
Amy,"Hey, letês go do something to get your mind off this."
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, we should go out."
Penny,"Uh, I donêt know, a bar?"
Bernadette,Canêt drink.
Penny,"We can, but all right."
Amy,Are you hungry? How about that sushi place you love?
Bernadette,Doctor said I canêt have sushi.
Penny,"Okay, look, we donêt have to go anywhere. We can just, you know, stay here and hang out in the hot tub."
Bernadette,Doctor said I canêt go in the hot tub.
Amy,Maybe you should get a new doctor. he said you canêt laugh either?
Raj,"Iêd like to propose a toast to our friend, Howard, his, um, his big heart, his beautiful soulÑ"
Leonard,And his tight little pants that somehow did not make him sterile.
Howard,"Well, look at this. I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas doesnêt have to worry about money. He can have all the kids he wants."
Sheldon,And can keep a small portion of their heads dry.
Howard,"If Iêm gonna have any chance of raising this kid, I need to come up with a big idea to make some money."
Leonard,Thereês no reason you canêt.
Howard,Thatês easy for you to say. You and Sheldon already came up with your superfluid helium model.
Leonard,Thatês just research. Weêre never gonna make any money from it.
Sheldon,Forget helium. The real superfluid is the fruit punch in this mug. Reminds me of my daddyês secret donêt tell mama juice.
Leonard,"Uh, these are strong, you should slow down."
Sheldon,Oh. Iêll just take one last sip. Ah.
Howard,"Okay, how about this for an invention, slightly bigger cocktail umbrellas."
Leonard,How is that a new invention?
Howard,"I donêt know, all Apple does is change the size of things and we keep buying them."
Raj,Itês true. I like my giant iPad and my little iPad almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.
Sheldon,This place is terrific. Why. why have we never been here before?
Leonard,The same reason we donêt do a lot of fun stuff. You.
Sheldon,Thatês some smart talk from a guy who canêt even keep his face in focus. Whereês the bathroom?
Raj,"Uh, itês in the corner."
Sheldon,"Excuse me. Hey, how you doinê?"
Raj,I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.
Leonard,Doesnêt matter. Heês headed for the kitchen anyway.
Howard,"Maybe thatês an idea, guidance systems for drunk people."
Raj,They have that. Itês called Uber.
Howard,"Hey. In your supercooled helium experiments, did you create quantum vortices?"
Leonard,Yeah. Why?
Howard,"Well, if you made a guidance system, couldnêt you use those vortices as a gyroscope?"
Leonard,Wow. Iêve never thought about that.
Howard,"And since itês in a quantum state, it would maintain an infinite persistence."
Raj,"Groundbreaking revelations, tropical drinks. Tell me this isnêt like the best episode of Sex and the City."
Leonard,You may have actually just come up with something.
Howard,You think so?
Leonard,I really do.
Sheldon,"You guys, the bathroom here is amazing. Thereês people cooking in it."
Amy,Think about all the fun things you get to do when you have a baby.
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, you get to buy toys and little clothes."
Bernadette,I kind of already do that for Howie.
Penny,"And whenever youêre hungry, youêll be in a minivan with Cheerios all over the floor."
Amy,"Oh, and I just found a new travel cup for Sheldon. It only lets out three at a time. So, when did you guys decide to get pregnant?"
Bernadette,"Well, we didnêt exactly decide. We were talking about it, and then one night we got a little reckless."
Penny,"Oh, tell us."
Amy,"Yeah, tell us."
Bernadette,"No, Iêm embarrassed."
Penny,"Oh, come on, weêre all grown-ups. Weêve all done it."
Amy,"Me, me, me too. Iêm a grown-up and Iêve done it."
Bernadette,"Fine. We were out one night, and things got a little spontaneous."
Amy,"Oh, that sounds juicy."
Bernadette,"Well, Sheldon was going on and on about time zones and railroad schedules, and I went outÑ"
Penny,"Wait, I remember that. Hang on. You did it at our place?"
Bernadette,Kind of on Sheldonês bed.
Bernadette,"I was headed to the bathroom, and I passed Howie on his way out. Usually he says, do not go in there, but this time he said, hey, letês go in here."
Amy,How could you do that?
Bernadette,"Iêm sorry, but you know what itês like when youêre with your man and one thing leads to another."
Amy,I do know what thatês like. I really do.
Leonard,Iêm not seeing anyone using liquid helium vortices like this.
Howard,Iêm not finding anything either.
Raj,Itês a good sign.
Sheldon,"Oh, wait, I found something."
Howard,Damn. What is it?
Sheldon,"This video. The baby panda sneezes, and the mama panda gets so scared."
Leonard,Can you focus on what weêre talking about?
Sheldon,"All right. Look, now, this may be the rum talking, but as long as the unpinning rate of the vortices is kept within 1.1 and 1.3, the Magnus force issue should be negligible."
Raj,"Even drunk, heês still smarter than all of us."
Sheldon,And stronger. Who wants to see me beat up the bartender?
Leonard,Iêd enjoy that.
Sheldon,"Nah, sheês a good kid."
Howard,"If this is a viable thing, we could get a patent and license it to companies that make guidance systems."
Raj,Look at that. Youêve known youêre gonna be a father for less than a day and youêre already stepping up.
Leonard,"Iêm telling you, you got this."
Howard,Maybe youêre right.
Sheldon,Of course heês right. You and I both know how hard it is growing up without a father. Thatês why Iêm confident youêre gonna be the best dad you can be.
Howard,"Thank you, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Youêre welcome. And if he has twins, we can do all kinds of neat experiments on them."
Bernadette,You guys can go in if you want.
Penny,"No, weêre a team. If you canêt go in, weêre not going in."
Amy,Then why are we drinking?
Penny,"Okay, itês not like sheês got the Christ child in there, all right?  Oh. Itês Leonard. He says Sheldonês drunk and theyêre gonna do karaoke if we want to join them."
Bernadette,That sounds fun.
Amy,"Oh, no. Sheldonês drunk texting me."
Penny,Whatês it say?
Amy,Would you like to sing karaoke with us.
Bernadette,How is that a drunk text?
Amy,He used a period instead of a question mark. Heês so wasted.
Raj,"Your movieês showing, so youêre going. Could care less about the five youêre blowing. Theatre gets dark just to start the show. You spot a fine woman sitting in your row, sheês dressed in yellow, she says hello, come sit next to me, you fine fellow. You run over there without a second to lose, and what comes next, hey, bust a move."
Leonard,"You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it"
Raj,"Just bust a move,"
Leonard,"You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it"
Raj,"Just bust a move,"
Leonard,"You want it, you got it, oh, you want it, baby you got it"
Penny,"Hey, guys. Congratulations."
Howard,Thank you.
Amy,Hi. How are you doing?
Sheldon,"Wonderful. Iêm being musically encouraged to bust a move. If I knew what that meant, I might just do it."
Howard,Iêm really glad youêre here. Can we talk?
Penny,"So, you gonna get up there later?"
Sheldon,"A microphone, a room full of inaccurate depictions of Polynesian religion, and a captive audience to hear about it? You bet I am."
Howard,Iêm sorry I freaked out this morning. I want you to know Iêm done being scared.
Bernadette,"Itês okay to be nervous. I am, too."
Howard,"Thank God, êcause I was lying, you might not have to wait nine months to see someone soil their pants. But Iêm also really excited. I mean it."
Bernadette,"Me, too."
Howard,I love you. Mmm. And Iêm not just saying that because your breasts are gonna get bigger.
Penny,"Are we an item? Girl, quit playinê."
Amy,"Weêre just friends, what are you sayinê?"
Penny,Say thereês another and look right in my eyes.
Amy,My first love broke my heart for the first time.
Howard,"Baby, I need your lovinê, got to have all your lovinê. Baby, I need your lovinê, got to have all your lovinê."
Raj,"Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby. Ooh, baby, baby, baby, baby."
Leonard,"Ah, push it."
Bernadette,"I appreciate this, but you reallyÑ"
Leonard,Push it real good.
Sheldon,"Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrimsê pride, from every mountainside let freedom ring."
Howard,"Iêd like to dedicate my last song of the evening to my wife, best friend, and now the mother of our child. I love you, Bernie.  Havinê my baby, what a lovely way of sayinê how much you love me. Havinê my baby, what a lovely way of sayinê what youêre thinkinê of me."
Sheldon,Youêre kidding. What kind of maniacs have coitus in someone elseês bedroom?
Howard,"Thank you, Pasadena. Good night."
Penny,That was such a fun night.
Leonard,Probably êcause you got to see your man up there rockinê the mic.
Penny,"Yeah, yeah. I was a little surprised when you decided to beat-box."
Leonard,Oh. That was really an asthma attack. I just sold it.
Penny,"Well, I am so happy for Howard and Bernadette."
Leonard,"Me, too. So, you ever think about it?"
Penny,"Babies? Well, Iêm not in a rush but someday, yeah, sure. What about you?"
Leonard,I think weêd make amazing parents.
Sheldon,Will you guys keep it down?
Penny,"On the other hand, we might lack a certain maturity."
Amy,"So Sheldon, thereês something Iêve been wanting to talk about but I know itês kind of a touchy subject."
Leonard,Way to narrow it down to everything.
Sheldon,What is it?
Amy,"Well, your birthdayês coming up, and youêve never let us celebrate it, and I was hoping maybe this year we could."
Sheldon,"Oh, I suppose thatês a discussion we could have."
Amy,"Okay, great, I mean, it doesnêt have to be a big party or anything. I was just, whereêd he go?"
Penny,"W, wait a minute. You mention his birthday and he vanishes?"
Leonard,"Well, whereês that information been this whole time?"
Penny,"Well, where is he?"
Leonard,Iêll check his room.
Penny,"Oh, my God."
Sheldon,"Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. Now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one? I suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? You know, the answer, it may surprise you."
Amy,Iêm sorry I brought it up.
Penny,"Yeah, what is the problem? Is it about getting older?"
Sheldon,"Please, look at this porcelain skin. Iêm like a human sink."
Amy,But itês the one day a year thatês just all about you.
Leonard,One day. Right.
Amy,Can you please just tell me why?
Sheldon,"Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year weêd have a party. No one I invited would ever come, because they didnêt like me."
Amy,Iêm sorry.
Sheldon,"Oh, that part wasnêt so bad. I didnêt like them, either. But then Iêd inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sisterês friends."
Penny,"Oh, poor thing."
Sheldon,"When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window."
Amy,You realize none of those things would happen now?
Sheldon,"I do, but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all?"
Amy,"Well, you made my last birthday so memorable, I wanted to return the favour."
Penny,"You know, if you had a party now, you have plenty of friends that would love to come."
Leonard,"And we live here, so we have no choice."
Sheldon,"Very well. You may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love. But then you owe me big-time."
Howard,You have any idea what youêre getting Sheldon for his birthday?
Raj,Heês been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. Maybe we could get him a fossil.
Leonard,"Well, just donêt get anything Jurassic. He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood. Hey, uh, you know, he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party."
Howard,Thatês funny. Letês do that.
Leonard,Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.
Raj,"You mean, some guy in a lame suit?"
Leonard,"Or a real Batman. Hey, Stuart? Didnêt you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once?"
Leonard,Can I get his contact info?
Leonard,He is?
Amy,"Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?"
Sheldon,"Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car."
Penny,"All right, what about music?"
Sheldon,I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.
Penny,No music it is.
Bernadette,What kind of cake do you like?
Sheldon,"Well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if thereês writing on it, make sure itês not all caps. I donêt need my dessert yelling at me."
Raj,"Hey, so what was Adam West like on the phone?"
Leonard,"Uh, nice guy. But it was a little weird to hear Batman say donêt ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy."
Raj,"You know, Adam West is my favourite Batman? Well, after Michael Keaton, Christian Bale and Batman from The Lego Movie."
Howard,Donêt say that to him.
Raj,"He beat out George Clooney, and thatês something. Like, I love me some Clooney."
Leonard,Donêt say that to anyone.
Penny,"Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart."
Penny,"Okay, sweetie, weêre on the clock here. Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?"
Bernadette,"No, no, no. Come on in."
Bernadette,Doing great.
Penny,"Yeah, birthday party first. Pity party later."
Leonard,Are you crazy? How can you put Michael Keaton in front of Christian Bale?
Raj,Thank you. Thatês why I say Keatonês number one. He brought a sense of humour to the role.
Howard,"Really? Youêre ahead of Bale? The man who personified the words, Iêm Batman."
Leonard,"Iêm sold, youêre ahead of Bale."
Howard,Can we just all agree weêre worried about Affleck?
Raj,"Yeah, of course."
Sheldon,Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?
Amy,"Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated."
Sheldon,But whoês gonna tell them theyêre doing it wrong?
Amy,"Well, Iêm, Iêm sure theyêll ask you to give a speech, and thatês when you just tear êem a new one. Have to say, you, you do look good in that suit."
Sheldon,Oh. Thank you.
Amy,"Maybe later Iêll, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit."
Sheldon,But this is my birthday suit. Are you having a stroke? Because thatês the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.
Leonard,"So, Mother, Iêm surprised you came all this way for Sheldonês birthday."
Leonard,Oh. You had a party for your 60th?
Penny,"You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas and didnêt invite her."
Amy,Oh. Penny says everyoneês there. Are you ready?
Sheldon,I am. Oh. Wait.
Amy,Are you all right?
Sheldon,"No, I just, I got a little light-headed."
Amy,"Oh, do you need a minute?"
Sheldon,"No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this."
Leonard,Speech! Speech!
Raj,"Come on, Sheldon, say something."
Sheldon,"Uh, um, uh, thank you all so much for coming. Beverly. Wil Wheaton. Adam West, for some reason."
Leonard,Batman finally came to your party.
Sheldon,Thank you. This is all so thoughtful. Excuse me.
Leonard,"Okay, Iêd better go in there and talk to him."
Amy,"Well, donêt you think Iêm the one who should go in?"
Leonard,"No offence, but Iêve known the guy a really long time."
Amy,"Well, Iêve, you know, seen him without pants on."
Leonard,"Again, no offence, but so have I."
Amy,"Well, heês seen me without pants on."
Leonard,"Again, noÑ"
Penny,"Okay, this is ridiculous.  Sheldon? Can I come in?"
Sheldon,How do you know Iêm not using the facilities?
Penny,"Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though Iêve clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. So, whatês going on?"
Sheldon,"I donêt know. I looked around the room, and I saw all the faces and the presents, and it, it was just too much."
Penny,"I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet. Itêll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever."
Sheldon,I know that you worked hard to put this together. Iêm sorry Iêm ruining it.
Penny,"Oh, pl, youêre not ruining it. Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now, that will ruin it."
Sheldon,I donêt think I can go back out there.
Penny,"Thatês fine. You know, I hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. But what I hate even more is, if I was there, I would have tortured you, too."
Sheldon,"Based on this pep talk, Iêd say youêre still doing it."
Penny,"My point is, there was a time I never wouldêve been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favourite people. So, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, Iêm happy to do it with you."
Sheldon,"Well, everyone will think Iêm weird."
Penny,"Sweetie, you are weird. Everyone knows youêre weird, but theyêre all still here because they care about you so much."
Leonard,Leslie. I canêt remember the last time we talked. So much has changed.
Leonard,"Yeah, uh, um, Penny and I got married."
Leonard,"Yeah, well, donêt be a stranger."
Penny,"Okay, everybody, Sheldon is gonna come back out, but I think heês a little embarrassed, so letês all be extra nice, okay?"
Sheldon,"Hello, everyone. I, Iêd like to apologize for my behaviour. I hope it hasnêt put a damper on the party. So, please, enjoy yourselves. Oh, this is quickly getting out of hand."
Amy,"If I may, I, Iêd like to propose a toast. Um, thank you all for coming tonight. I know itês customary for the birthday boy to receive presents, but I feel like I got the greatest gift the day he was born."
Sheldon,"Aw, Amy, that was lovely. You know, this is fun. Letês do more. Someone else say something wonderful about me."
Howard,"Sheldon, I donêt think everyoneÑ"
Sheldon,"Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz."
Howard,"Okay, then, uh, Sheldon, weêve known each other a long time. And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend."
Sheldon,"Little generic. Keep thinking. Weêll circle back. Wil Wheaton, go."
Sheldon,"Thatês how you do it, Wolowitz. Now you see why heês famous and youêre not."
Leonard,"Seriously, Barry, stop."
Raj,"And it was Gandhi who said, live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever."
Sheldon,And it was Sheldon Cooper who said letês speed this up. A lot of people want to talk.
Sheldon,"Oh. Oh, now, you know I hate change. Say it."
Bernadette,"I canêt think of anything to say that hasnêt already been said, so, hereês to you, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Thank you, Bernadette. That was perfect."
Howard,You gotta be kidding me?
Leonard,"Sheldon, weêve been together so long, itês hard to remember a time you werenêt in my life. And believe me, I try. You make me laugh. You make me a better scientist. You make me crazy. Youêre more than just my roommate, youêre my brother."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Leonard,"Happy birthday, buddy."
Sheldon,"Thank you. That, that was wonderful."
Penny,"Oh, wait, wait, wait. Stuart didnêt get to speak."
Amy,"Hey, everybody, listen up."
Penny,You nailed it.
Amy,Weêve got someone who couldnêt be here but really wanted to wish you a happy birthday.
Sheldon,Professor Hawking.
Sheldon,Thank you so much. I canêt believe youêreÑ
Sheldon,"Oh, youêre singing. Well, Iêm sorry."
Leonard,"Uh, Professor Hawking, if you just give us one second, weêll light the candles, and we can all sing together."
Penny,"Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didnêt think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug."
Sheldon,"You know, I used to hate these hugs. Now theyêre just extremely irritating."
Leonard,"Ready when you are, Professor Hawking."
Howard,"Okay, I gotta ask, why are you wearing a bow tie?"
Sheldon,Iêve never applied for a patent before. I wanted to make a good impression.
Howard,Is the impression that your first name is Pee-Wee?
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, youêre an engineer. End of joke, burn."
Howard,"See, heês not wearing a tie."
Leonard,"Well, heês a patent attorney. Maybe his tie is pending."
Sheldon,Thatês great.
Leonard,So what happens next?
Howard,"Oh, I donêt think there will be."
Leonard,"Yeah, we did our own search."
Sheldon,Get a load of this guy.
Howard,Can you imagine if we make money with this?
Leonard,"If we do, I am splurging on the best sinus irrigator money can buy."
Howard,"That old sad story, guy gets a little money, goes straight up his nose."
Howard,Seventy-five percent?
Sheldon,Thatês outrageous. This is our idea based on our research. How can you possibly justify owning a majority share?
Sheldon,I know when Iêm beat.
Leonard,"Hold on, hold on. So the three of us do all the work and only end up with 25%?"
Leonard,"Well, until you just said that mean thing, kinda."
Howard,"Wait, so this can turn out to be a financial success, and I get nothing?"
Sheldon,"Well, thatês not fair. We should all get plaques."
Leonard,"Sorry, but we canêt sign this."
Howard,"Come on, letês go."
Leonard,Thank you for your time.
Sheldon,Couple of questions about the plaque.
Amy,"So, have you been having any morning sickness?"
Bernadette,A little. And it doesnêt help that Iêve got this heightened sense of smell.
Penny,Is that a pregnancy thing?
Bernadette,"Yeah. The other day I sniffed out where Howie hid the Girl Scout cookies. No more Tagalongs, my ass."
Penny,But now youêll be able to make your own milk to eat the cookies with.
Raj,"Hey, guys. Hey, Penny. I really appreciate you helping me with this. I donêt know what to do."
Penny,"Oh, sure. Let me see it."
Amy,See what?
Raj,"I hadnêt spoken to Emily since I broke up with her, and she left this on my doorstep with a note."
Penny,"Raj, I got you this before we split up, but couldnêt return it and thought youêd like to have it. Happy belated Valentineês Day, Emily."
Bernadette,Thatês nice.
Penny,"Nice, or is she trying to manipulate him?"
Raj,"I know. I mean, do I open it? Do I return it?"
Amy,Why wouldnêt you open it?
Raj,"Well, she was pretty mad. For all I know itês a voodoo doll of me with a fork stuck in my junk."
Bernadette,"You donêt think sheêd actually send you something gross or dangerous, do you?"
Penny,I know one way to find out. Sniff this.
Amy,"Sheês pregnant, sheês not a bloodhound."
Bernadette,Although I am getting a little machine oil. I think itês metal.
Penny,"Come on, just open it."
Raj,"You know, on Game of Thrones, Balon Greyjoy received his sonês genitals in a box."
Penny,"Well, never hurts to have a spare."
Bernadette,What is that?
Raj,Wow. Itês an antique sextant. Sailors used these to find their position by the stars.
Amy,What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.
Raj,"I know, sheês so thoughtful."
Penny,"See, sheês trying to get you back. Now, that is exactly what I wouldêve gotten you if I had any idea what it is or what you do."
Raj,"You know, I have too much self-esteem to let this girl guilt me into getting back together with her."
Amy,You donêt need to be pregnant to smell that load of crap.
Leonard,"Well, what if we go around the university and just get the patent ourselves?"
Howard,"We canêt. It says on their Web site, as long as we work there, they have a controlling ownership of anything we come up with."
Sheldon,"Great, so they own my idea for a T-shirt that says Dumb as a Bag of Geologists."
Leonard,"Well, our choices are we do this with the university or we donêt do it at all."
Howard,"Either way, I get nothing."
Leonard,"Or, if we ended up making money from this, Sheldon and I could split our shares with you."
Sheldon,"To be clear, Leonard is referring to the gyroscope, not the T-shirt and mugs. Oh, now they own the mugs."
Howard,I guess that is a way around this. You guys would be cool doing it like that?
Leonard,"Of course, we can split any profits three ways."
Sheldon,Iêm fine with that.
Howard,"Okay, great."
Sheldon,"It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order."
Leonard,"Sure, we could write something up."
Sheldon,But which one of us should be the party whoÑ
Howard,"You can do it, Sheldon."
Sheldon,So stipulated.
Leonard,Once I found a stash of contracts under his bed. It was weird.
Bernadette,I wonder how much she spent on this.
Amy,"Ooh, letês find out."
Raj,It doesnêt matter. Itês the thought that counts.
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, and beautyês on the inside, size doesnêt matter, how much she spend?"
Raj,"Seriously, guys, I donêt want to know."
Amy,"Oh, my."
Raj,"Oh, come on, you canêt say oh my, and then not tell me."
Amy,These things go for five hundred dollars and up.
Bernadette,Damn. All I got for Valentineês Day was a postcard saying my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered.
Penny,"Okay, so, she drops off a five hundred dollar gift and sheês not trying to get back together with you?"
Raj,Maybe youêre right.
Bernadette,Or sheês telling the truth and just being nice.
Raj,"Maybe youêre right. Wow, I am easy to manipulate.  Oh, guys, itês Emily. What should I do?"
Penny,"Okay, answer it. Just be strong. And if she starts to cry, donêt make any promises. And most importantly, put it on speaker so we can hear."
Raj,"Yeah, yeah. Sure. Whatês up?"
Raj,"Maybe, maybe."
Raj,"Iêm sorry, I seem to be taking an annoying amount of time deciding how I feel about this."
Raj,"Iêm sorry, I donêt think thatês a good idea."
Raj,"Good-bye, Emily. That was rough, you guys."
Penny,"I know, but you did it. Iêm so proud of you."
Raj,"Well, anyway, Iêll leave you to your girlsê night."
Amy,Are you sure you donêt want to stay here with us?
Raj,"No, I kind of feel like being alone right now."
Bernadette,"Well, if you change your mind, weêll be here."
Raj,Thank you.
Penny,Say hi to Emily for us.
Raj,Will do.
Howard,This contract looks good to me.
Sheldon,"Iêll say it looks good. Itês in my proprietary font, Shelvetica."
Leonard,"I want to say something obnoxious, but it is easy on the eyes."
Bernadette,"Iêm a little tired, Howie. You ready to go?"
Howard,"Yeah, one sec. I just need to sign this contract."
Bernadette,What is it?
Howard,"Well, we ran into a problem about my share of the patent, so weêre forming a partnership to split anything we make equally."
Penny,"Sheldon, did you draft the contract?"
Sheldon,You bet I did.
Penny,Ooh. Youêre gonna make out so hard tonight.
Bernadette,"So, youêre just gonna sign this without having a lawyer look at it?"
Sheldon,Excuse me. Iêve been drafting contracts since kindergarten. Didnêt need a lawyer to get me out of finger painting. Donêt need one now.
Bernadette,"I know, butÑ"
Howard,"Bernie, the guys were nice enough to find a way to keep me from being cut out."
Bernadette,"Well, I should hope so. The whole thing was your idea."
Amy,"Well, to be fair, Howardês idea was based on Sheldonês math."
Leonard,"Guys, everyone is involved in thios, okay? Howardês invention, Sheldonês math, my original theory that space-time was like a supercooled liquid. Which Iêm sure Penny wouldêve mentioned if she wasnêt working on that hangnail right now."
Howard,"Honey, this is fine."
Bernadette,"If you want to sign a contract that Sheldon whipped up, go ahead."
Howard,Can I talk to you in the hall?
Howard,Excuse us.
Sheldon,"Hey, Leonard."
Sheldon,"If she doesnêt think that we should apply for this patent, sheês being patently absurd."
Leonard,Good one.
Sheldon,"Okay, you got it. See, I was afraid it was a thinker."
Howard,What are you doing?
Bernadette,I just want to make sure youêve thought this through.
Howard,Whatês to think about? We have an invention and want to move forward.
Bernadette,"Howie, youêre about to form a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper."
Howard,"All right, if youêre gonna calmly make excellent points, then I donêt know if I want to talk to you. Okay. I get it. And itês sweet that youêre worried about me, but I can take care of myself."
Bernadette,Iêm not worried about you. Iêm worried about me. I donêt want to go through this pregnancy listening to you complain about Sheldon driving you crazy more than you already do.
Howard,Here we go with the ironclad logic again.
Bernadette,Youêve tried to work with him before. It hasnêt gone well. Why is this time gonna be any different?
Howard,Is the foetus helping you? ‚Cause thatês cheating.
Raj,"Hi. Iêm good. Really good. Well, I donêt know why I said really good. Iêm just regular good. I really just wanted to sound confident. And that really was a real really, not a fake really like the first really."
Raj,"I donêt know. I lost track and I missed my exit. So, uh, so whatês up?"
Raj,Really? Iêm sorry. I swear I know other words.
Raj,"Yes. Indeed. Absolutely. Indubitably. Iêm not even sure what the last one means, but itês another word, and I know it. So, uh, when do you want to meet up?"
Raj,"Right now, well, well, actually, to, to be completely honest, Iêm stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend because sheês having a tough time. But itês not like weêre getting back together or anything."
Raj,Thatês exactly what she said. How do you know that?
Raj,Any chance you could send me a PDF of that playbook?
Leonard,Theyêve been out there a while.
Amy,I hope everythingês okay.
Sheldon,I wonder what theyêre talking about.
Penny,"If you guys would shut up, I could tell you. Oh. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
Leonard,You guys all right?
Howard,"Yeah. But, um, we were talking, and Iêm a little concerned about the three of us forming a partnership."
Sheldon,Are you suggesting a limited liability corporation? ‚Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.
Howard,"Sheldon, my concern is not with the money or anything. Itês, itês with how you treat me."
Sheldon,"Well, I believe Iêm treating you generously. Thatês why Iêve stipulated in the contract that your contributions to our invention are as valuable as my own."
Bernadette,Are you saying that his contributions arenêt as valuable as yours?
Sheldon,"No, I am not saying that, because I kept saying that this morning and Leonard said stop saying that."
Howard,See? This is what happens every time we work together.
Penny,"You know what, hang on. What if Sheldon had no choice but to be respectful?"
Leonard,Is there a switch on the back of his neck we donêt know about?
Penny,What Iêm saying is you could add a clause to the contract that he canêt make fun of Howard.
Bernadette,How would you enforce it?
Sheldon,"Oh, please. Any contract I sign is enforced by my own personal code of ethics."
Amy,And his obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Sheldon,"Yeah, that, too. And scoot over. Part of your shadowês on my spot."
Leonard,"Howard, what do you think?"
Howard,Iêm on board.
Sheldon,"Iêll add it right now. Oh, baby, itês addendum time."
Raj,"Hey, Emily, listen, Iêve been thinking, and Iêm not sure itês a good idea that I come over."
Raj,"No, no. Please donêt cry."
Raj,"Hey, so, listen, Claire, change of plansÑ"
Raj,I donêt think so. She sounded pretty upset.
Raj,"Emily, listen, Iêm sorry, but I canêt come by."
Raj,"I think we both know if I come over, weêre gonna get back together andÑ"
Raj,Call you right back.
Sheldon,"The, the revisions I made start on page four."
Penny,Wow. That is a lot of whereupons.
Amy,You should see the Valentineês Day card he gave me.
Howard,"Article three, as it pertains to this project, Dr. Sheldon Cooper promises to abstain from all insulting or disrespectful language directed toward Howard Wolowitz, including but not limited to mockery of engineering, his height, his hair, his wardrobe, and his insane belief that the Ghost Rider movie was, quote, not that bad."
Leonard,"Hang on. Maybe there should be a no insult clause about me, too."
Sheldon,Do you still like cilantro?
Sheldon,Youêre tying my hands here.
Howard,"All right, letês sign this."
Penny,"Wait, wait, wait. What are these changes on page six?"
Amy,"Sheldon, what did you do?"
Howard,I shouldêve known.
Bernadette,"25% of profits due to Sheldon Cooper will be allocated to a scholarship fund for the firstborn child of Howard and Bernadette Wolowitz. Sheldon, thatês so nice."
Leonard,That beats the onesie I was gonna get them from baby Gap.
Howard,"Thatês very generous, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêve always valued education over money. And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive Iêve been of your contributions."
Howard,I appreciate that.
Sheldon,And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.
Sheldon,I didnêt sign it yet.
Raj,"I hear what youêre saying, but Iêve known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt."
Raj,"As a matter of fact, I do. Iêm gonna comfort her, because Iêm a caring and decent friend whoês happy to be there when she needs someone to talk to."
Raj,Good talk.
Amy,I didnêt understand your e-mail.
Sheldon,"Uh, can you repeat that? Youêre breaking up."
Amy,I didnêt understand your e-mail.
Sheldon,"Ah. Yeah, I had to get a little creative because the S, R and M keys on my laptop stopped working."
Amy,"Deaw Aby, could you pleathe dwive be to the twain thtow thubtibe tobowow?"
Sheldon,"So, is that a yes?"
Amy,"Sheldon, why donêt you get a new computer? You know that oneês out-of-date."
Sheldon,"Oh, but I like this computer."
Amy,"The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, I didnêt get that."
Amy,"The video is failing, and the sound is cutting out."
Sheldon,The sound is cutting out. I canêt read that. The video is failing.
Amy,Get a new computer.
Amy,Get a new computer.
Sheldon, Hello?
Leonard,This is cool. When was the last time you and I built something together?
Howard,Scientifically? A little over a year ago. LEGOs? Last week in my room.
Leonard,"If there was a Nobel Prize for Millennium Falcons that fall apart when you pick them up, weêd be set."
Penny,"Hey, guys."
Leonard,Hey. What are you doing here?
Bernadette,We heard there were some sexy scientists working hard all weekend.
Penny,"Yup, so we brought you some lunch and we are gonna go look for êem."
Leonard,"Soup, sandwiches and emasculation, just like my mom used to make."
Penny,"So, howês it goinê?"
Leonard,Good. Slow.
Howard,"Thereês a lot of tedious setup, but once we get through that it should go quicker."
Penny,Is there anything we can do to help?
Leonard,"You know what, this part isnêt that technical. You actually could."
Penny,"Wow, really? Called my bluff. All righty then."
Bernadette,Can we really help?
Howard,"While we finish soldering these boards, itêd be great if you guys could wrap these pipe fittings with Teflon tape."
Leonard,Iêll show you how to do one.
Penny,"Hey, wouldnêt it be funny if after all your years of hard work, Iêm the one who makes a scientific breakthrough? He doesnêt think thatês funny."
Amy,I got here as quickly as I could.
Sheldon,Youêre too late.
Amy,"Sheldon, this is silly."
Sheldon,You got emotional when that lab monkey died.
Amy,That lab monkey told me he loved me in sign language.
Sheldon,Great. Now Iêm gonna have that song in my head all day.
Amy,"Look, Iêm, Iêm sorry for your loss, but I think I have something that might make you feel better. I got you a new computer."
Sheldon,How could you do that?
Amy,Do what?
Sheldon,"Choosing a new laptop Is an incredibly personal ritual. You have taken away weeks of agonizing thought, tedious research, sleepless nights filled with indecision. I, havenêt I lost enough today?"
Amy,"Well, the guy at the store said this one is great."
Sheldon,"Oh, oh, the guy. Oh, pardon me. I didnêt realize youêd spoken to the guy. Yeah, tell me, did the guy choose one with a 4K display and a Thunderbolt port?"
Sheldon,Yeah? Did the guy make sure that this has a one terabyte solid-state drive?
Sheldon,"Yeah? Oh, well, was this guy Rick from Computer Solutions on Colorado?"
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, he does know his stuff."
Leonard,"After you wrap the body in reflective tape, the ends get Teflon tape so we can get a tight seal."
Penny,Like this?
Leonard,"Yeah, perfect."
Leonard,"And it helps to have small, delicate fingers. So donêt be discouraged if you canêt do it as fast as me and Howard."
Howard,I donêt know if we have enough solder to finish these circuit boards.
Leonard,We had a full spool yesterday.
Howard,"What can I say, I play hard, I solder even harder."
Bernadette,Sometimes he solders at home with his shirt off. Itês like a beer commercial.
Leonard,"Well, we got to make a run to the hardware store."
Penny,How can you call yourself a scientist and run out of solder?
Leonard,"Well, funny story. So, we have plenty of the 60/40 tin-to-lead ratio solder, but the spools look a lot like the 63/37 tin-to-leadÑ"
Penny,"Honey, honey, honey, let me stop you. That is, is not a funny story."
Howard,You want to come with us?
Bernadette,Iêm kind of getting into the groove here.
Penny,"Yeah, you guys run to the store and let the women handle the science for a change."
Leonard,Okay. Weêll be back as soon as we can.
Penny,"Okay, so what is solder?"
Sheldon,"I suppose I should set this up. Or would you like to rob me of that, too?"
Amy,Knock it off or Iêll start making W-H sounds for words that just have a W.
Sheldon,You wouldnêt.
Amy,Whatch me.
Sheldon,"Fine. Iêm sorry. Thank you for the thoughtful gift. I really do appreciate it. As you know, I had become attached to my old laptop. But Iêm sure, in time, that this one willÑ Jeepers creepers, that started up fast."
Amy,I thought you might like it.
Sheldon,"Look at the 4K resolution. Next time we Skype, Iêm gonna count all those nostril hairs."
Amy,Or you could just look into my eyes.
Sheldon,But you only have two eyes. You got a lot of nostril hairs.
Amy,"Well, you know, as long as youêre happy."
Sheldon,Oh. I am.
Amy,And Rick said you could bring in your old one to recycle it.
Sheldon,"Oh. Uh, no, no, no, thank you."
Amy,"Oh, but he said you can get store credit."
Sheldon,"Well, no, I just, I, I donêt want to recycle it. And I donêt want store credit."
Amy,But why wouldnêtÑ
Sheldon,Can we please change the subject?
Amy,Okay. How êbout we change it to why youêre being weird about this?
Sheldon,"Iêm not being weird. I, itês hard to explain."
Amy,"Sheldon, just tell me."
Sheldon,It might be easier to show you.
Sheldon,Weêd have to take your car.
Amy,All right.
Sheldon,And Iêm gonna need you to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
Amy,"Well, I signed one before we slept together. Why not now?"
Leonard,Penny says theyêre having fun working on the prototype.
Howard,Remember when her fun was nightclubs and drinking games?
Leonard,I know. Iêm lowering the bar so slowly. This time next year sheêll have a coin collection.
Leonard,"Oh. Sorry, we canêt."
Howard,"Well, hang on. What movie is it?"
Howard,Wait. I bet itês Suicide Squad. Letês check it out.
Leonard,What about the girls?
Howard,"Penny just said theyêre having fun. Honestly, you want to wrap tape around a bunch of pipe fittings all afternoon?"
Leonard,"Okay, weêll take êem. But, I swear, if itês Will Smith in Shark Tale 2, it better be at least as good as the original."
Penny,"I mean, itês crazy, isnêt it? I moved here from Nebraska to be an actress, and now Iêm sitting in an engineering lab at Caltech helping to build a prototype for a high-tech guidance system."
Bernadette,It is crazy. Itês also crazy that Iêve made fourteen of these and youêve made three.
Raj,Hey. Where are the guys?
Penny,"Oh, they went to the store to get solder, which is metal you melt to make science things."
Bernadette,Since when do you work on weekends?
Raj,Iêm an astrophysicist. The stars donêt take a day off.
Penny,You were home alone and had no one to play with?
Raj,"Well, the cleaning lady was there, but she doesnêt like me. You need any help?"
Bernadette,Not with Lightning McQueen here.
Penny,I think weêre good.
Raj,"Okay. Thatês cool. I guess everybodyês involved in this project but me. So, see ya."
Bernadette,I feel bad. Should we have asked him to stay?
Amy,Will you please tell me where weêre going?
Sheldon,"Sorry, youêre on a need-to-know basis."
Amy,Iêm driving the car. I need to know.
Amy,So where are we going?
Sheldon,"No, I meant turn right, and you missed it. Maybe you do need to know."
Leonard,What are we gonna tell the girls?
Howard,Itês not a problem.
Leonard,I mean without lying.
Howard,And now youêve made it a problem.
Leonard,Come on. Weêre a couple of smart guys. Iêm sure we can come up with a way to explain this that doesnêt make us look bad.
Penny,"Oh, the boys had to drive all the way to San Bernardino for the solder and got a flat."
Leonard,They bought it.
Howard,But weêre gonna have to put the spare on before we go back.
Leonard,"Oh, youêre good at this."
Howard,"Well, I lie a lot."
Leonard,"Hey, you were right."
Howard,"Well, I keep telling you, good things happen to bad people."
Leonard,Who are you texting?
Howard,Raj. He really wants to see this movie.
Leonard,Heêll never make it in time.
Howard,I know. I want to make him feel bad.
Leonard,"Ha, ha. Leonard and I are about to see Suicide Squad. Spoiler alert, when I see you Iêm gonna spoil it. Youêre a good friend."
Raj,Okay. Would you ladies please leave the room for a moment?
Raj,I need to rub my genitals on their prototype.
Bernadette,Whatês going on?
Raj,Leonard and Howard donêt have a flat. They went to the movies. Look.
Penny,Un-freakinê believable.
Bernadette,Son of a bitch.
Raj,Oh. You know what? Iêm gonna let them know that Iêm here with you and that theyêre busted.
Penny,You know what? Donêt. Donêt. Letês let them think theyêre getting away with it.
Bernadette,"Yeah, letês see how deep a hole they can dig for themselves."
Raj,"Interesting. I mean, itês not testicles on a cryostat, but I like it."
Amy,Why do you have a storage unit?
Sheldon,Just wait.
Amy,How long have you had it?
Sheldon,Just wait.
Amy,Do you want me to hold that computer?
Sheldon,"Just wait. You know what? Actually, yes, thank you. Welcome to my Fortress of Shame."
Amy,Iêm sorry. what am I looking at?
Sheldon,"Itês basically everything Iêve ever owned. Um, every book, every tee shirt, every piece of broken electronics. Just all of it."
Amy,All of it?
Sheldon,I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc bags.
Amy,"Okay. Well, I would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of. So Iêm gonna need a minute."
Penny,"All right, how are we gonna play this when they return?"
Raj,I know. You guys should totally be making out with me.
Penny,"Sweetie, I know you think jokes like that are funny, but do you really think you could handle making out with both of us?"
Raj,"No, maêam."
Bernadette,"Okay. Okay, how about this? They donêt know youêre here with us, so you hide in the closet. When they show up, weêll hear whatever their dumb story is about where they were, weêll pretend to believe them and just when they think they got away with it, you jump out."
Penny,"Yeah, thatês pretty good."
Raj,"I love it, Iêll be all like, busted, and theyêll be like, what? And then weêll all be like, oh yeah. Yeah, I get it. I wouldnêt make out with me, either."
Sheldon,"In here is every clock radio Iêve ever owned. Calculators, VHS tapes. Yeah. Oh. Sporting equipment."
Amy,You have sporting equipment?
Sheldon,"Well, oh, itês just a, itês a, a golf ball that my brother threw at my head. You can still feel the dent. Itês right next to the hockey puck dent."
Amy,"Okay, why do you have a bin of pine cones?"
Sheldon,"I used to collect them as a child. The spiral of scales open in the Fibonacci sequence. A fact that, when you tell your brother, gets a golf ball thrown at your head."
Amy,"So, why do you feel you need to save these things?"
Sheldon,"Iêd like to say itês nostalgia, but every time I think of throwing anything away, my ears start to ring, and I get butterflies in my stomach. And then it feels like the butterflies get eaten by rats, and then the, the rats get eaten byÑ"
Amy,Okay. I get it. I get it.
Sheldon,It ends with dinosaurs. Iêm sorry if you think less of me.
Amy,I donêt.
Sheldon,"Really? ‚Cause every time I come in here, I think less of me."
Sheldon,"Because Iêm a fraud. I purport to be a man of the mind. Iêve been such a, a vocal champion of the singularity, but how can I leave my body behind and become one with the internet when Iêve never even thrown a toothbrush away?"
Amy,"Itês okay, Sheldon. You know, Iêve saved a lot of weird things, too."
Sheldon,Like what?
Amy,"Well, um, did you know I have a microscope slide with a little bit of tissue from the first brain I ever dissected?"
Sheldon,I have an old teddy bear I secretly wiped my nose on for years.
Amy,Itês not a contest.
Penny,"Okay, here they come."
Bernadette,Go hide.
Raj,"Oh, man, when I come out of the closet, Iêm gonna nail those guys. Yeah, I heard it. Shut up."
Penny,"Hey, whatês this?"
Leonard,"Listen, we did a stupid thing."
Howard,"We went to a movie and lied about it, but we feel bad and want to make it up to you."
Leonard,"So, these are for you, and if youêre not too mad, weêd love to take you guys to dinner."
Howard,Yeah. Anywhere you want.
Bernadette,"Oh. Well, thank you for being honest."
Penny,"Yeah. You know, I want to be upset, but we did kind of have fun working on the prototype."
Raj,Donêt forgive them. Stay mad at them.
Howard,What is he doing in there?
Raj,Busting you.
Bernadette,Itês okay. They apologized.
Penny,"Yeah, itês fine."
Raj,Well this is kind of anti-climactic.
Howard,You know what wasnêt anti-climactic? The end of the movie. Get this.
Raj,No spoilers. No spoilers.
Penny,And heês back in the closet.
Howard,Ready for dinner?
Bernadette,Should we invite Raj?
Amy,"So, no one else knows about this?"
Sheldon,Only you.
Amy,Thank you for trusting me.
Sheldon,What good is having a girlfriend if you canêt unload your psychological sewage on her?
Amy,"Thatês me, your emotional outhouse. You know, if you ever decide you want to do something about this, Iêm, Iêm here for you."
Sheldon,Thank you. I wouldnêt even know how to begin.
Amy,"Baby steps, I guess."
Sheldon,I suppose I could try getting rid of the golf ball.
Amy,Oh. Okay.
Sheldon,I will always have the dent to remember it by.
Amy,You did it. Do you feel okay?
Sheldon,"Actually, yes. I do."
Amy,"Well, Iêm proud of you."
Sheldon,Iêm glad I told you about the storage unit.
Amy,"Well, I feel closer to you now."
Sheldon,"Oh, I feel closer to you, too. You know, itês still a couple of hours until my bedtime."
Amy,What did you have in mind?
Sheldon,"You look amazing. I mean, this resolution is remarkable."
Amy,I really had to go home for this?
Sheldon,"Yes, but itês like youêre right here in the room."
Amy,"And yet, Iêm not."
Sheldon,But I feel like I could reach out and touch you.
Amy,"And yet, you canêt."
Sheldon,I know.
Sheldon,"Itês nice to get back to nature. Why donêt I do this more often? What a beautiful forest. Hello, little butterfly. Whatês your Na-oh!"
Leonard,Whatcha doing?
Sheldon,"I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face."
Penny,What am I smelling?
Sheldon,"Oh, itês car air freshener. I was simulating the smell of the forest."
Penny,Thatês not what the forest smells like.
Sheldon,"Well, how would I know?"
Leonard,Why are you pretending to be outdoors? You hate it.
Sheldon,Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.
Leonard,"Buddy, I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there."
Sheldon,"Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return."
Penny,"Okay, if thatês true, why arenêt there more genius squirrels?"
Sheldon,You may need this more than I do.
Amy,Hereês your tea.
Sheldon,Oh. Do not sneak up on a guy when heês sitting on a log.
Amy,"You know, if you really want to be in nature, why donêt we rent a cabin?"
Sheldon,"Look, Iêm sorry, when did you even get here? IÑ"
Penny,"You know, thereês a cabin in Big Bear that a doctor I work with keeps offering me."
Leonard,Because heês hitting on you?
Leonard,"Oh, good."
Penny,But I could get her.
Amy,We could all go for the weekend. Itêll be fun.
Sheldon,"Excuse me. Here, look up fun, get back to me."
Leonard,You and I could still go and have a nice weekend.
Amy,"Come on, Sheldon, letês go with them."
Sheldon,"I hardly think so. You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars."
Penny,Iêll see if itês available.
Amy,"You know, if that studyês real, Leonard might come back smarter than you."
Sheldon,Are you trying to manipulate me?
Sheldon,"Well done, it worked, weêre going."
Bernadette,"Come on, Raj, give me a bag."
Raj,"No, no, youêre pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow."
Howard,"Hey, where you been?"
Bernadette,"Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store."
Howard,"Did you get graham crackers? I mean, are, wuh, is the baby okay?"
Bernadette,Yes and yes.
Howard,I didnêt know you needed help running errands today.
Bernadette,"I didnêt, but Raj volunteered."
Bernadette,"Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant, heês really been making a fuss over me."
Howard,"Oh. Well, I guess thatês kind of sweet."
Raj,"Bernie, I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite, but Iêd love to hear what you think."
Howard,And it just got weird.
Penny,Hey. Amyês downstairs.
Leonard,"Okay, one sec."
Penny,"Uh, what, what you got goinê on here?"
Leonard,I bought a baseball cap.
Penny,I can see that. What team did you get?
Leonard,"Uh, Hufflepuff, from Harry Potter."
Penny,"Well, weêll be in the woods."
Sheldon,Iêm ready to go.
Leonard,Anything youêd like to say to him?
Penny,"Nice hat, Sheldon."
Leonard,Why are you so mean to me?
Howard,What the hell are you watching?
Bernadette,Raj found all these childbirth videos online. This one is of a woman giving birth in a river.
Howard,"Okay, that is the least Jewish thing Iêve ever seen in my life. You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff?"
Bernadette,I donêt think so. He just wants to be part of the experience.
Howard,"All right, if you say so. Whatês in the box?"
Bernadette,"Oh, itês an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the babyês heartbeat."
Howard,Oh. Thatês cool. Can we try it?
Bernadette,"Actually, Raj ordered it. He made me promise to wait till he was here."
Howard,So he can be part of the experience?
Howard,Iêm surprised he let us conceive without him.
Bernadette,"Itês a sore spot, donêt bring it up."
Penny,Itês so cute and rustic up here.
Leonard,I know. Did you see they still have a video rental place? itês like Colonial Williamsburg.
Sheldon,"Well, cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, nowês the time."
Amy,Have you ever been off the grid before?
Sheldon,Once. The battery ran out on my phone. I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.
Leonard,I was afraid he was gonna eat me.
Howard,Raj just pulled up. Iêm gonna say something to him.
Bernadette,Leave it alone. He means well.
Howard,So you donêt think he needs to rein it in a little?
Bernadette,"No, not really."
Howard,"And youêre not concerned heês acting like somehow this is his kid, too?"
Bernadette,Heês just trying to be supportive.
Howard,Just supportive. Not over-the-top in any way?
Bernadette,You saw him carrying that.
Howard,Astronauts saw him carrying that.
Penny,This place is great.
Leonard,So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.
Penny,"Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert, so hold that thought."
Sheldon,"Okay. Well, shall we check each other for ticks?"
Amy,"Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car."
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, suit yourself. Who wants to check me?"
Amy,"On the other hand, safety first."
Amy,"Wow, itês really coming down."
Penny,This sucks.
Leonard,And there goes our hike.
Sheldon,"Oh, not our hike, now we have to stay safe and warm."
Penny,"You know, we could still go. A little rain isnêt gonna kill us."
Leonard,Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?
Leonard,Youêll wish it would kill you.
Amy,So what do we do now?
Leonard,They have some board games.
Sheldon,"Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it, move on."
Penny,"Hey, letês light a fire."
Amy,"Ooh, that sounds cozy."
Leonard,I donêt think Iêve lit a real fire before.
Sheldon,"Ah, itês basic thermodynamics. Iêm sure we can figure that out."
Leonard,I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.
Sheldon,That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.
Leonard,Right. So all we need is toÑ
Penny,Got it.
Leonard,A scientist made that.
Howard,"Look, Raj, youêre my best friend in the world and I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby."
Raj,"Please, my pleasure."
Bernadette,"And, of course, Howie and I both want you to be a part of all this."
Howard,But we have to set some boundaries.
Raj,I donêt understand.
Howard,The three of us arenêt having this baby. Just the two of us.
Howard,"Oh. Okay. Yeah, I get it. Iêll back off."
Howard,Thanks for understanding.
Raj,Of course. Iêll give you guys some space. Let me just get this out of your way.
Howard,You need some help?
Raj,"No, I got it."
Bernadette,"Raj, Raj, wait."
Raj,"Please, Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity."
Penny,"Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?"
Sheldon,"Oh, well now, weêll never win. You always play the drinking game."
Penny,"Not the drinking game, a drinking game."
Leonard,"To be fair, good at both."
Amy,Whatês the game?
Penny,"All right, itês called Never Have I Ever. The rules are simple. Someone says something theyêve never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink."
Leonard,Iêve never played that before.
Sheldon,"Hey, now, wait. Have we started? Do I drink? What is happening?"
Penny,"Okay. Calm down. Iêll go first. All right, letês see. Never have I everÑ"
Amy,Sheês trying to think of something sheês never done before. This could take a while.
Penny,"Very funny. Okay, never have I everÑ yeah, you know what? Letês just circle back."
Leonard,"Okay, Iêll go. Never have I ever been arrested."
Sheldon,So I drink.
Amy,"No, itês only if youêve done it."
Sheldon,Got it.
Amy,I canêt believe youêve been arrested.
Sheldon,I canêt believe Penny hasnêt.
Penny,"Sheldon, what did you do?"
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm not proud of it, but I jaywalked."
Leonard,"Oh, no, itês like a horror movie. Weêre trapped in a cabin with a maniac."
Amy,Iêm surprised you would do that.
Sheldon,"No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldnêt, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing."
Penny,he arrested you for that?
Sheldon,"No, he didnêt do anything. So I said, you just saw me jaywalk, why arenêt you doing your job? You know? May, maybe I should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer."
Penny,And then you got arrested.
Sheldon,"Oh, and how."
Howard,I feel like I just made a horrible mistake.
Howard,"But on the other hand, I didnêt kick him out of our lives. I just asked him to back off a little."
Howard,Are you gonna cry?
Howard,Is it baby hormones or actually sad?
Bernadette,I canêt tell anymore.
Howard,Iêll go get him.
Bernadette,And bring back the bear.
Leonard,This gameês dangerous. I could get you in trouble.
Leonard,"Well, never have I ever used Sheldonês toothbrush to clean the sink."
Penny,"Fine, is that how you want to play this? All right, never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals."
Leonard,Never shouldêve told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.
Amy,"Okay. My turn. Um, never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriendês world in bed."
Amy,You know the rules. Drink.
Penny,"Yeah, go ahead."
Leonard,Thatês right.
Sheldon,"All right, my turn. Mm. Oh, I know. Never have I ever kept a secret bank account, because I think my wife canêt handle money. Did I win? I feel like I won."
Penny,I canêt believe this. You realize I make more money than you?
Leonard,"I donêt, I know, but this isnêt a big deal. Itês just a little savings I put aside."
Penny,Weêre married. Weêre supposed to share everything.
Leonard,"you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?"
Sheldon,Iêm calling it. I won.
Raj,"I appreciate the apology, but itês really not necessary. I overstepped my bounds."
Howard,"No, Raj, youêve been great. I just, I need to start doing my part around here."
Bernadette,I hear that.
Raj,"Well, if thatês the case, is there anything I can do to help?"
Howard,"Well, not right now. But we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the babyês heartbeat."
Raj,Really? Itês okay if I listen with you?
Bernadette,Of course.
Raj,Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?
Howard,"Hey, look at that. Itês weird again."
Leonard,"Okay, you have every right to be mad. And what you said is true. You do make more money than me. So I had no right to do what I did. And Iêm so sorry. I hope you can forgive me."
Penny,How long have you had this secret account?
Leonard,"A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies."
Penny,"Well, how much you got in there?"
Leonard,Six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. Forty seven dollars once my nanaês birthday check gets here.
Penny,"My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do with that kind of money?"
Leonard,"No, I do, and thatês why I hid it."
Penny,What good is it if you donêt use it?
Leonard,"Uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. I have money I love, but never spend. Weêre kind of a cute couple that way. Again, Iêm sorry. I shouldnêt have kept it a secret."
Penny,"Well, I have a secret Iêve been keeping from you, too."
Leonard,Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome.
Penny,I hate my job.
Leonard,Really? Why?
Penny,"Because I donêt feel good flirting with doctors for sales. I mean, I know I make a lot of money. But I havenêt been happy for a while."
Leonard,Why didnêt you tell me?
Penny,Because I know how important it is to you that Iêm having some success.
Leonard,Thatês not true.
Penny,"Okay, really? So youêd be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?"
Leonard,"If thatês what you want to do, yes."
Penny,"Well, itês not what I want to do."
Leonard,"Oh, yes."
Penny,"Doesnêt matter what I want. Look, this job is gonna get me out of debt. So Iêm gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through."
Leonard,"Well, that is the grown-up thing."
Penny,I guess.
Leonard,I love you.
Penny,"I love you, too."
Leonard,"You know, never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining."
Penny,"Well, guess I gotta drink."
Howard,"All right, here we go."
Bernadette,Iêm not hearing anything.
Howard,"Well, give me a second."
Raj,Are you sure you can do this?
Howard,"Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?"
Raj,"I buried it there, so we could go home."
Bernadette,"Wait, thatês it."
Bernadette,Isnêt that the best?
Raj,You guys made a person.
Howard,We did.
Raj,And I like to think I helped.
Howard,You didnêt.
Sheldon,"Oh, never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date."
Amy,Never have I ever cancelled a dentist appointment.
Sheldon,"Oh, uh, never have I ever put my foot in the ocean."
Amy,Never have I ever honked if I liked anything.
Sheldon,"Oh, uh, never have I ever thrown, caught or touched a Frisbee."
Amy,Never have I ever put salt on my food without trying it first.
Sheldon,Oh. Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator.
Amy,"Well, we all have a past."
Sheldon,"I have a question about Batman. Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be Man-Batman?"
Leonard,"No, heêd be Bat-Man-Bat."
Raj,But wouldnêt Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?
Howard,But Batman is a man. Youêre talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. Thatês just Man-Man.
Sheldon,"Well, isnêt Man-Man just Man?"
Leonard,But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?
Raj,"Well, thatês just Batman."
Leonard,"No, if a man dresses as a bat, thatês Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, thatês Batman-Man."
Howard,So does that answer your question?
Sheldon,"Oh, I havenêt asked it yet."
Raj,"Oh, thatês Claire. Got to run."
Leonard,I thought you were back with Emily.
Raj,"Uh, actually Iêm seeing both of them."
Leonard,You mean like through their window from behind a bush?
Raj,"No, Iêm actually dating two women. Later."
Leonard,Really? The guy who for years couldnêt even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them? How is that possible?
Howard,"I know. Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up."
Leonard,"Seriously, that guyês dating two women?"
Sheldon,why did you get a party sub?
Leonard,"People are coming over, it looked fun."
Sheldon,"Well, weêre only watching Game of Thrones. A party sub implies itês a party."
Leonard,Your attendance implies itês not.
Sheldon,"I like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesnêt like a party. Oh, by the way, donêt forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting."
Leonard,"Oh, Sheldon, we donêt need a meeting every three months."
Sheldon,"Hmm? Well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting. Lucky for you itês tomorrow."
Leonard,"Oh, you know what? Iêm not going."
Sheldon,"Well, you have to go. Itês Pennyês first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance."
Leonard,This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kelloggês Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.
Sheldon,You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.
Leonard,Youêre the only one who eats them.
Sheldon,"And yet you get to weigh in. Democracy, itês pretty cool, isnêt it?"
Leonard,"Iêm not going, you canêt make me."
Sheldon,"Well, weêll just see about that."
Penny,What is the problem?
Sheldon,He says heês not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow.
Penny,"Well, why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?"
Leonard,You have fun. I will not be attending.
Sheldon,"Oh, fine. We donêt have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you donêt want to."
Leonard,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Of course, it will require a vote. Unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom, but luckily, I have my travel gavel."
Leonard,Youêre being ridiculous.
Sheldon,"Thereês a motion on the floor, Iêm ridiculous. Do we have a second? Hmm? Hmm? There is no second. The motion is denied. Next time, make sure you have the votes first. That was embarrassing."
Leonard,Can you please talk to him?
Penny,"Well, why are you fighting him on this?"
Leonard,"Because I am tired of him always getting his way. We donêt need a stupid meeting. We donêt even need a roommate agreement, and I hope that sandwich does cause a party."
Penny,"Well, I will still come to your meeting."
Sheldon,"Well, I should hope so. Tomorrowês picture day."
Leonard,Why are you taking his side?
Penny,"Because itês important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal."
Sheldon,"You keep talking like that, youêre gonna make colour guard."
Raj,"Man, Iêm worn out."
Howard,I know. Imagine if we were actually moving.
Raj,"No, itês just, ever since I started dating Claire and Emily at the same time, itês exhausting."
Howard,Youêre exhausted? Try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you read it.
Raj,"But, dude, youêre so lucky. Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love."
Howard,I guess I am lucky.
Raj,"You are, because dating two women, I mean, I canêt even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and Iêm like, am I at Claireês or am I at Emilyês? Is there a third girl Iêve forgotten about? Like, where am I?"
Bernadette,"Hey, Raj."
Raj,"Hey, howês the mommy-to-be?"
Bernadette,Good. A little tired.
Raj,I feel you. Iêve been dating multiple women.
Howard,You sure you donêt want to come watch Game of Thrones with us?
Bernadette,You guys have fun. Iêm just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.
Raj,"Oh, that sounds great, a bed to yourself. Canêt even remember what thatês like."
Sheldon,Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?
Penny,"Mm, I think so. Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead."
Sheldon,"Oh, I donêt know. Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off."
Penny,"Uh-oh, somebodyês still pouting."
Leonard,Leave me alone.
Penny,"If itês because you lost a stick, I know where it went."
Leonard,Not funny.
Penny,You know youêre gonna make up with him. Can we just skip to that part?
Leonard,"Oh, of course, because Iêm the only adult around here."
Penny,Really? The only adult?
Leonard,"Yeah, thatês right."
Sheldon,"Tonight Iêll be watching a show rated M.A., and that stands for mature audiences, buster."
Penny,"All right, you would think the only adult wouldnêt let something silly ruin our entire night."
Leonard,And Iêd think youêd understand why Iêm annoyed.
Sheldon,All this could be avoided if youêd just come to the meeting.
Leonard,I donêt want to.
Sheldon,"Oh, itês just a meeting. One simple meeting."
Leonard,Stop saying meeting.
Sheldon,"Meeting, meeting, bo-beeting, banana-fana, fo-feeting, fee-fi mo-meeting."
Amy,I brought my famous spinach dip.
Sheldon,"Yeah, Amy, just one second. Meeting."
Howard,"Iêm not sure if Iêm hoping for a boy or a girl. I mean, if itês a boy, Iêm gonna have to teach him to play catch. Which means Iêm gonna have to google how to play catch. If itês a girl, I mean, theyêre so innocent and you know how guys are."
Raj,"Totally, guys are the worst. I mean, look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claireês fridge that night. Iêm such a dog."
Howard,There you go again.
Raj,"Iêm sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?"
Howard,"Actually, what youêre doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag."
Raj,How could you say that?
Howard,"Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me."
Raj,I never said that.
Howard,Donêt you hate it when you canêt remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?
Raj,"Okay, that I said. But thatês a real problem. You give a girl another womanês bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl, but not her."
Amy,Whatês going on with him?
Penny,"Oh, heês all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting."
Sheldon,"Apparently, perfect attendance isnêt cool any more."
Penny,"Donêt worry, heêll come around."
Amy,"Well, I get why heês annoyed."
Sheldon,"Well, then you donêt understand whatês happening. See, Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like."
Leonard,You love The Simpsons.
Sheldon,I love Lisa Simpson.
Amy,"Well, I know how he feels. I never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings."
Sheldon,Wait. You were pretending?
Sheldon,I donêt believe you. I could tell.
Amy,"Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating."
Sheldon,"Hmm, what do you think?"
Penny,You donêt know?
Raj,"Hey, did I say something to upset you?"
Howard,"No, Iêm fine."
Raj,"Really? Because usually we walk side by side, and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom."
Howard,Just drop it.
Raj,"Okay, I think I see whatês happening here. Youêre jealous of me."
Howard,"Oh, please. What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?"
Raj,"Itês not what I have, itês how many people Iêm having it with."
Penny,"Come on, Sheldon, weêll watch Game of Thrones over here."
Leonard,"Oh, good, go. You know, itêll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, I read the books, donêt get too fond of this character."
Sheldon,"Itês not always because they die. In one case, itês because theyêve become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. Yeah, but I wonêt say who it is. Itês Brann."
Howard,"Wait, what is going on?"
Penny,"Leonardês being a jerk, so weêre gonna watch over here."
Amy,Do you guys want to watch with us?
Howard,As long as I donêt have to watch with him.
Raj,"Fine, I donêt want to watch with you either. Iêll go over here."
Howard,Why do you get to pick?
Raj,"Okay, then you go there."
Howard,Donêt tell me where to go.
Leonard,"Howard, just come in here."
Penny,"Yeah, come on, Raj."
Raj,"Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?"
Sheldon,She did.
Howard,And Iêm gonna eat it all.
Howard,So what the hell happened?
Leonard,"Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldonês nonsense."
Howard,"Tell me about it. Iêve had it with Raj, too."
Amy,"You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. Dips in testosterone can cause irritability."
Howard,Interesting. Maybe my male cycle synced up with Rajês actual period.
Leonard,"If Sheldonês testosterone dipped, heêd become a butterfly.  Oh. Maybe someoneês here to apologize."
Penny,May I take your cloak?
Sheldon,"Well, Iêll catch you up. Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonardês angry at me and Penny, Iêm angry at Leonard and Amy, Raj is angry at Howard, and Iêm angry at George R.R. Martin êcause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard."
Raj,"Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily, and I accused him of being jealous."
Leonard,"I donêt know how you put up with it. Heês impossible. I mean, holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy."
Howard,"Yeah. Capên Crunch with Crunch Berries, move on."
Leonard,"Anyway, Amy, thank you for sticking up for me."
Amy,"Oh, I honestly couldnêt care less."
Amy,"Well, I just took your side êcause sometimes I get annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are."
Leonard,"Well, they argue all the time. They arenêt that close."
Amy,Whoês always comforting him when heês upset?
Leonard,"Penny, butÑ"
Amy,Whoês the only one who can make him take his medicine when heês sick?
Leonard,"I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out."
Amy,Okay. And did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?
Leonard,Son of a bitch. Why is that funny?
Howard,I donêt know. I like the pain of others.
Leonard,"Oh, well, then youêll enjoy this. Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali."
Howard,"No, she doesnêt."
Leonard,She defends him all the time.
Howard,She does not.
Amy,Who told you to stop making all those Gandhi jokes about him?
Howard,"Well, she did. And human resources."
Leonard,Who do you think told Koothrappali to go to human resources?
Howard,Son of a bitch.
Leonard,"Youêre, youêre right, it feels good."
Raj,"All right, itês almost game time. Get it? Game of Thrones, game time?"
Sheldon,"Oh, perhaps itês Amy coming to her senses."
Penny,Whatês up?
Leonard,"You know, you donêt need to use Sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement."
Penny,Whereêd you get that from?
Leonard,From Amy.
Penny,"Ugh. Amy, why did you tell him that?"
Amy,Because you were defending Sheldon like you always do.
Penny,I donêt always defend Sheldon.
Leonard,"Oh, yes, you do. You know you have a weird brother-sister-Elliott-E.T. relationship with him."
Penny,What about your weird relationship with him?
Leonard,Thatês different. Iêm like the little girl in Poltergeist and heês the creepy thing in the TV.
Howard,"Um, guys? Were there any nuts in that food?"
Leonard,I donêt think so. Why?
Howard,Well just a feeling.
Leonard,It just said Italian sub. I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.
Sheldon,"Interesting fact, in Italian, the morta in mortadella means death."
Sheldon,I didnêt say fun fact. Iêm not a monster.
Bernadette,Heês gonna be okay.
Sheldon,Now itês a fun fact.
Bernadette,Why are you dressed like that?
Bernadette,That wasnêt nice.
Raj,"You know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones."
Raj,"Well, Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned."
Penny,"Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident."
Raj,Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the Kingês Guard to do her bidding.
Sheldon,Cersei uses her body to manipulate men. Penny just takes me to The LEGO Store.
Raj,"Okay. Oh, how about this? Stuartês dressed like a brother of the Nightês Watch, and they donêt have sex."
Penny,There you go.
Leonard,Thatês true.
Sheldon,Fair enough.
Bernadette,You all right?
Howard,Iêm fine. Just a little embarrassed I had to be carried down the stairs like a baby. Thanks.
Leonard,Letês get out of here.
Amy,That was scary.
Sheldon,"Well, the important thing is I said that big sandwich would ruin everything, and I was right."
Raj,"Hey, Jon Snow. How come your horse has a basket on it?"
Sheldon,"They donêt wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones. Youêre thematically inaccurate, but I applaud your commitment to safety."
Leonard,Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girlês bike? Nope.
Sheldon, Leonard.
Sheldon,I never got to ask my question about Batman.
Leonard,What is it?
Sheldon,"If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat, and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat, would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?"
Penny,Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?
Sheldon,Iêll be back.
Penny,"Oh, hey, if you guys are free this weekend, I won a night of wine tasting from work."
Leonard,That sounds fun.
Leonard,How come scientists donêt win free stuff like salespeople do?
Howard,‚Cause weêre not in it for the stuff. Weêre in it for the groupies.
Sheldon,"Personally, I find the notion of external rewards demeaning. I pursue science for the intrinsic joy of discovery."
Amy,But you always say that you want to win a Nobel Prize.
Sheldon,"I also say donêt contradict me in front of my friends, but that you donêt remember."
Penny,"All right, well, let me know if you guys want to go."
Raj,I would love to. I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir.
Leonard,Iêm sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken.
Amy,"Well, it sounds like a nice night. We should go."
Sheldon,"Wine again? Yeah, no, thank you. I like my grapes the old-fashioned way, in a juice box."
Amy,"Well, Iêm going. You couldnêt stop me from getting a massage at the mall, and youêre not stopping me now."
Sheldon,I shouldnêt have to see my girlfriend get groped in public by another man.
Amy,And I shouldnêt have to see my boyfriend riding on a train for children around the mall.
Penny,The little choo-choo for toddlers?
Amy,And now you know why I needed the massage.
Howard,"Well, weêre out. Bernie canêt drink êcause sheês pregnant. And sheês pregnant because we had sex. And we had sex because, well, come on."
Bernadette,"Itês okay, you should go."
Howard,You sure?
Bernadette,Of course.
Penny,"Yeah, give her a break from, well, come on."
Sheldon,"Well, Bernadette, looks like Saturday night, itês you and me."
Bernadette,Me? How? Why?
Sheldon,"Well, it makes perfect sense. Because youêre an expectant mother, you canêt drink alcohol. I donêt like to. You canêt have sushi. I donêt like to. You canêt go in hot tubs. I consider them vats of sweaty people soup."
Bernadette,"Gee, Sheldon, I donêt know."
Sheldon,"Oh, come on. Roller coasters, caffeine, runny eggs, Iêve been avoiding these things all my life. And now, because youêre pregnant, you have to."
Leonard,"The difference is sheês bringing life into the world, and you suck it out."
Bernadette,I guess we could give it a try.
Sheldon,"Well, little lady, youêve heard of party hearty, get ready to party hardly."
Howard,I bet youêd like a drink right now.
Raj,"Hey, you think itêd be okay if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?"
Leonard,Sure. Iêd like to meet her.
Raj,"Oh, thatês great. Iêve been wanting her to meet you guys, too, so this seems like the perfect opportunity."
Sheldon,"Oh, but I wonêt be there."
Raj,Funny how that worked out.
Leonard,Does this mean Emilyês not in the picture anymore?
Raj,"No, Iêm still dating her."
Leonard,"Okay, help me out. How are you doing this? Do they know about each other?"
Raj,"They know that weêre not exclusive, and we just donêt ask too many questions."
Sheldon,"You know, itês like how I play Warlords of Kaêa with you and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia."
Leonard,Whoês Frank and Alicia?
Sheldon,"You, you and I spend a lot of time together. Can there be a little mystery between us?"
Howard,Okay. Everythingês hooked up. Weêre ready.
Sheldon,I am going to record this for posterity.
Leonard,"All right, here goes nothing."
Sheldon,Here goes nothing? This is the initial test of our prototype. Can we give it a little more gravitas?
Leonard,"Fine. Preliminary trial of the infinite persistence gyroscopic navigational system, phase one commencing."
Sheldon,"Eh, maybe itês your voice. Iêm gonna see if I can get James Earl Jones to do it in post."
Raj,"Itês, itês beautiful."
Howard,"Actually, itês making me dizzy."
Leonard,"Good, itês not just me."
Raj,"Hey, Claire."
Raj,"Hi, yeah. Um, I was wondering, if youêre free Saturday night, all my friends are going to a wine tasting."
Raj,Why would it be too big a step?
Raj,"Nothing to worry about. People meet people all the time, and it isnêt weird. I met Bon Jovi once, which youêd think might be weird. Turns out, total sweetheart."
Raj,"Boy, it wasnêt this hard with Bon Jovi. I said you rock, he said, thanks, man, and that was that."
Penny,"Hey, you ready to go?"
Leonard,Hang on.
Penny,What are you doing?
Leonard,"Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book about wine tasting. It teaches the different flavour notes to look for."
Penny,You actually smell the wine?
Leonard,I mostly just smell my nasal spray.
Penny,Are your sinuses acting up?
Leonard,Since my preschool got a bunny.
Penny,"Hey, are you still hanging out with Bernadette tonight?"
Sheldon,Yes. And weêre going to prove that we donêt need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.
Penny,"Oh, good for you."
Sheldon,"Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese, processed meats and jacuzzis, which can all be harmful to an unborn baby."
Penny,"No honey baked ham in a hot tub, got it."
Sheldon,"Oh, no bubble baths either. They can increase the risk of a urinary tract infection."
Leonard,"Okay, have fun."
Sheldon,"Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel, shark or tilefish, which are all high in mercury."
Leonard,Weêre leaving now!
Sheldon,"Oh, and no contact with guinea pigs or hamsters or their droppings, uh, no-no cat litter boxes, no paint fumes."
Penny,"Okay, weêre leaving, love you, bye."
Sheldon,"Boy, do I love restrictions."
Howard,Hey. Where is everybody?
Amy,"Oh, weêre the first ones here."
Howard,Oh. Cool.
Amy,Yeah. Cool.
Howard,"You know, I donêt remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out."
Amy,"Oh, I do. It was three years ago."
Howard,"Oh, yeah, and we said we should do it more often. And, and, and, and, and here we are."
Amy,"So, Sheldon and Bernadette are hanging out."
Howard,I know. What are they gonna talk about?
Amy,I donêt know. I really donêt know.
Howard,"Oh, good."
Amy,"Oh, thank God."
Penny,You guys been here long?
Howard,"No, two minutes."
Amy,But yes.
Howard,Whereês Claire?
Raj,"Oh, sheês meeting us here. Hey, guys, do me a favour and donêt ask too many questions about the relationship. Weêre just keeping it casual."
Leonard,"Oh, so I shouldnêt ask her how she feels about being a member of your harem?"
Raj,"Yeah, I know youêre teasing, but watch out for karma."
Amy,"Hey, Penny, isnêt that your old boyfriend Zack?"
Penny,"Oh, yeah."
Amy,Are you gonna say hi to him?
Penny,"Uh, I donêt know."
Raj,"Hey, while you decide, who was better in bed, big hot Zack or wheezy little Leonard? Neener neener."
Bernadette,I brought sparkling cider.
Sheldon,"Oh, the bubbles tickle my nose. Iêll just open this now so it can get nice and flat before we drink it."
Bernadette,So what do you want to do tonight?
Sheldon,"Oh, I have quite the evening planned. Our foetus-friendly festival of fun begins with an in-depth look at the world of model trains, and then weêll kick things up a notch and explore all the different ways that you can make toast."
Bernadette,Thereês more than one?
Sheldon,Youêve heard of French toast?
Sheldon,Cinnamon toast?
Sheldon,Melba toast?
Sheldon,You get where Iêm going here?
Amy,Iêm getting an earthy note.
Penny,"Ah, thereês definitely some oak."
Raj,"Also, uh, cherries?"
Leonard,I smell nothing.
Howard,Really? Nothing?
Leonard,Just a whole lot of Afrin.
Penny,"Oh. Zack, hi. You guys remember Zack."
Howard,"Yeah, hey, buddy."
Penny,We did.
Leonard,"Yeah, mm-hmm."
Howard,Weêve actually been working on a prototype for a navigation system we invented.
Leonard,But we wonêt bore you with the details.
Amy,Mike deGrasse Tyson?
Howard,"Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew a moustache and became a scientist."
Howard,"Well, weêre using quantum vortices to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems."
Leonard,Whatês neat is that they can maintain angular momentum indefinitely.
Howard,"You could put it in a satellite or a rocket, and itêll run forever."
Howard,"Yeah, but we didnêt create it for weapons."
Leonard,And I doubt the military would be interested in our little guidance system.
Howard,A lot.
Leonard,Way better.
Sheldon,"H-O gauge trains are 1/87th scale. N gauge are 1/160th scale. And that brings us to Z gauge, at a, you could easily swallow it, donêt ask how I know, 1 to 220."
Bernadette,"Iêm sorry, I have to ask."
Sheldon,"When I was five, I ingested a Z gauge locomotive. I spent the next three days saying, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it."
Bernadette,What is it about trains that you like so much?
Sheldon,"What an interesting question. When I was a child, life was confusing and chaotic for me, and trains represented order. I could line them up, categorize them, control them. I guess you could say that they gave me a sense of calm in a world that didnêt."
Bernadette,"Thatês lovely, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Well, other than when theyêre chugging through your bowels, these things are magic."
Leonard,"I have to admit, Iêve been worried about the military applications since we started talking about this."
Howard,"Me, too."
Leonard,Why didnêt you say something?
Howard,Same reason I donêt talk about ass cancer. Itês not a pleasant topic.
Raj,You canêt let this stop you. Almost any scientific advancement can be used for destructive purposes.
Amy,Itês true. Even Einsteinês theory of relativity was later applied to the development of nuclear weapons.
Penny,"E equals MC squared. Yeah. E is for energy, M for mass, and C for the speed of light."
Amy,How do you know that?
Penny,"Oh, Leonard mumbles it when he wants sex to last longer."
Raj,"Hey, Claire. Good, youêre here. Guys, this is my friend Claire. Weêre casually dating, and thereês no need for any further questions about it."
Leonard,Would you like a glass of wine?
Raj,I said no questions.
Sheldon,"And last but not least, this is one that I like to call Star Wars Toast because it has a light side and a dark side. All righty, itês time for Dungeons & Dragons."
Bernadette,Dungeons & Dragons? That sounds about right.
Sheldon,Youêre gonna enjoy this. I designed it especially for you.
Bernadette,"Okay, but just for a little bit."
Sheldon,"Oh, I have a feeling that once you start, youêre not gonna want to or be allowed to stop."
Bernadette,All right.
Bernadette,You bet.
Sheldon,"Your name is Bernatrix. You are a warrior queen. Youêre strong, beautiful and tall."
Bernadette,Oh. I like the idea of being tall.
Sheldon,"I think youêre gonna like a lot of things I have in store. For example, in this world, only the men get pregnant, so your husband is home trying not to pee when he laughs."
Bernadette,This is getting fun. Whatês next?
Sheldon,"Youêre parched and weary from battle. You stand in front of a tavern that serves the coldest, most delicious ale in all the realm."
Bernadette,"Oh, I havenêt had a drink in months."
Sheldon,What do you do?
Bernadette,"I storm in, slam my sword down, and say, barkeep, bring me the strongest ale you have and serve it in the skull of a goblin."
Sheldon,He wants to see I.D.
Amy,"So, Claire, weêve heard so many wonderful things about you."
Amy,"Uh, mostly Pennyês heard them."
Raj,"Zack, this is my friend Claire."
Raj,"Uh, sheês seeing me."
Raj,Weêre just keeping it casual.
Leonard,Maybe we should take a step back.
Howard,Take a step back? Iêm not a young man any more.
Leonard,"No, I mean re-evaluate what weêre doing with the guidance system."
Howard,But I got a baby on the way. I got to make some money.
Leonard,What good is money gonna do if we inadvertently bring about Armageddon?
Howard,"Okay, let me stop you right there. We absolutely know our invention will not be used to destroy the world."
Howard,Because no one from the future has come back to kill us.
Leonard,Very funny.
Howard,You got something better?
Leonard,"Well, not really."
Howard,"Okay, then. Geez, how much wine did you drink?"
Leonard,Not a lot. I just couldnêt start until you walked away.
Sheldon,The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring. You block it with your shield. Do you attack?
Bernadette,Does it have eyes?
Sheldon,Three giant red ones and they never blink. Itês unsettling.
Bernadette,I stab it in the middle eye.
Sheldon,"Good choice. Critical hit. Your sword goes through its eye into its tiny brain. With its final dying gasp, it says, you have reduced me to a pile of sushi. Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce. Itês low sodium. Aaaah."
Bernadette,"Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn."
Sheldon,"Using your sword, you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner. You slip into the hot spring and enjoy the warm water on your aching joints. As you happily close your eyes, you recall the incredible evening youêve had and notice that your feet and ankles are smaller than theyêve ever been. The end."
Bernadette,"Wow, this night turned out to be so much more fun than I thought."
Sheldon,"Oh, the fun doesnêt stop. Youêre still going home with a goodie bag full of toast."
Bernadette,"Thank you for this. You know, ever since people found out Iêm having a baby, I feel like I became Pregnant Bernadette. It was nice to take a little break tonight."
Sheldon,"I can understand that. From the moment people realized I was a genius, Iêve been Sheldon the Genius. Although Iêve never really wanted a break from that, so I suppose I donêt understand. Which is ironic êcause, you know, genius."
Bernadette,"Well, thanks again."
Sheldon,"Youêre welcome. And any time you need a break from being Bernadette the Pregnant, Bernatrix the Warrior Queen is here waiting."
Bernadette,I might just take you up on that.
Sheldon,"Well, mind you now, that offerês only good until the third trimester. I canêt risk getting amniotic fluid on my spot."
Raj,"Hey, dude, youêre killing me with Claire."
Raj,"I mean, come on, look at you. Youêre classically handsome, youêve got a swimmerês body. Next to you, I look like me."
Raj,"Yeah, okay, just do me a favour and stop talking about how great Claire is."
Penny,"Uh, you know, Iêm not really around that much. Amy knows much more than I do."
Leonard,"I donêt think you have anything to worry about. Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault."
Howard,Yeah. He still has an AOL address.
Raj,"Donêt listen to him. He says crazy things all the time. Uh, watch. Marco."
Raj,"So, uh, what are you guys talking about?"
Raj,Why would you do that? I specifically asked you not to do that.
Penny,We didnêt.
Amy,You just did.
Leonard,Ugh. Too much wine.
Sheldon,"Oh, I overdid it myself last night. Hair of the dog."
Leonard,"Hey, did you ever think about the military applications for the guidance system?"
Sheldon,Of course.
Leonard,Does it bother you?
Sheldon,"No, it did at first, but then I talked it through with Frank and Alicia, and they really helped put things into perspective."
Leonard,Who are these people?
Sheldon,"Leonard, friends are like toilet paper. Itês good to have extras under the sink."
Sheldon,Taylor Swift.
Penny,Yes. Pi.
Sheldon,Yes. Kardashian.
Penny,More specific.
Sheldon,"See, I remembered because if it looks like Kim itês Kim, if it looks kind of like Kim itês Kourtney, and if it looks nothing like Kim itês Khloe."
Penny,"Oh, thatês a Venn Diagram, and I remember because I thought to myself, venn is he gonna stop talking about this diagram?"
Leonard,What are you guys doing?
Sheldon,"Oh, well, we decided to use our breakfast time to expand our respective knowledge bases."
Leonard,"Oh, let me try."
Leonard,"Hmm, atom of hydrogen, Adam of Maroon 5, mic drop."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, who is Mike Drop?"
Leonard,"Oh, hey, Penny, do you want to go to the airport with me later to pick up my mother?"
Penny,No problem.
Leonard,"Hey, Penny, um, since youêre already gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?"
Sheldon,Why donêt you want to get your mother from the airport?
Leonard,"Well, I can do without the 40-minute car ride where she criticizes every aspect of my life."
Sheldon,She can cover it in a car ride? I could do 40 minutes on your posture alone.
Penny,You really want me to pick up your mother all by myself?
Leonard,"Hmm, I just feel like it would be a good chance for you to bond."
Penny,Or a way for you to avoid her?
Leonard,"I donêt know what heês putting on those cards, but you are smarter than ever."
Penny,"Fine, if you really want me to, I will pick your mom up."
Penny,"Yeah, you know what, she is my mother-in-law, and Iêd like for us to have a good relationship."
Leonard,"That is very mature of you, so Iêm gonna go ahead and say, suckah."
Sheldon,"All right, back to learning."
Sheldon,"Oh, easy, Bill Nye the Science Guy."
Penny,Or as I know him?
Sheldon,Creepy old dude from Dancing with the Stars.
Penny,"Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding."
Raj,Did you guys see thereês an Avengers screening? Joss Whedonês gonna show some deleted scenes and do a question and answer session.
Sheldon,"Oh, well, I have a few questions for him about the last Avengers movie, and a whole lot of answers."
Leonard,Whenês the screening?
Raj,"Uh, itês tonight, but itês first-come, first-served, so we should probably get there early and wait in line."
Howard,Letês do it.
Leonard,"Pennyês busy with my mother, so Iêm in."
Sheldon,"Oh, bad news. Amyês making me go shopping with her later, so looks like none of us can go."
Leonard,You do realize weêre allowed to have fun without you?
Howard,"In fact, thatês usually the trick to it. What time do we need to get there?"
Raj,"Uh, Iêd say by three."
Sheldon,Youêre really going without me?
Leonard,"Itês not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy, and weêll save a spot in line for you."
Sheldon,"You donêt have the authority to save places in the line. If I do that, Iêll be cutting."
Leonard,People do it all the time.
Sheldon,"You know the golden rule of line etiquette. No cuts, no buts, no coconuts."
Howard,"If you really care that much, there are apps now thatêll let you hire people to do stuff like errands and wait in lines."
Howard,Some of these guys make over $20 an hour.
Penny,"Wow. Didnêt even make it out of the parking lot. Uh, you know what, enough about Leonard. Letês talk about you. What would you like to do while youêre here?"
Penny,"Well, Iêd actually like for us to be close, but maybe we start with our favourite books and work our way up to my husbandês sex organs."
Penny,"Um, does Pottery Barn, Spring count?"
Penny,"Uh, for starters, maybe you can not psychoanalyze everything I say?"
Penny,"Oh. Sorry. Didnêt know you made those. Hey, listen, what if we have a little mother-in-law, daughter-in-law dinner tonight?"
Penny,"Or I invite a few girlfriends, êcause hearing you say the two of us just sent a chill right down my spine."
Amy,What are you doing here? Youêre not Sheldon.
Amy,Hold on. He paid you to get out of spending time with me?
Amy,Weêre not going shopping together.
Amy,Can you understand why I might be annoyed right now?
Howard,"Weêve waited in a lot of lines together, havenêt we?"
Sheldon,Remember when we camped out for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?
Raj,"Yeah, sleeping under the stars with other fans who love the show as much as we do."
Leonard,"Waking up, wondering which one of those fans stole our wallets."
Sheldon,"Stuart, what are you doing here?"
Sheldon,"I donêt understand. You were happy to do this when I hired you. Why, why are you upset with me now?"
Sheldon,"Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play."
Amy,"You know, just when I think weêre making progress in our relationship, we revert to our old patterns where thoughts and feelings go unexpressed. I mean, if he didnêt want to go shopping with me, why didnêt he just say so?"
Amy,"Iêm sorry, Iêve been going on and on."
Amy,I called him babe once. He asked me to get a drug test.
Amy,Thank you.
Penny,"You know, sheês my mother-in-law. Why canêt I bond with her like that?"
Bernadette,"Amyês with Sheldon who she loves like a son. Youêre with her son, who she doesnêt."
Amy,Do you realize it took me five years to get a massage from him?
Amy,Three minutes. And he used a kitchen timer. I felt like a soft-boiled egg.
Penny,"You know, being in a relationship with Leonard also comes with its challenges."
Amy,"Maybe itês Sheldon, here to say heês sorry."
Amy,"Bernadette, Iêll give you five dollars to slam the door."
Raj,"Boy, all this standingês making me tired. Good thing I brought my collapsible stick chair."
Howard,Not the stick chair. You look like an idiot on that thing.
Raj,"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but chairs on sticks are comfy."
Sheldon,Hey. Is everything smoothed out with Amy?
Sheldon,Did you make the apology as sincere as I would have?
Sheldon,"Oh, well, thatês laying it on a little thick."
Leonard,You think itês time you apologize to her yourself?
Sheldon,"I suppose so. But if I get out of the line, Iêll lose my spot."
Sheldon,You would do that?
Sheldon,Youêre a good man.
Bernadette,"So, Beverly, did you know Penny is the number three sales rep at our pharmaceutical company?"
Bernadette,"Well, we donêt exactly. Iêm a microbiologist for the research team."
Bernadette,Some exciting new anti-anxiety drugs.
Amy,"Oh, was it, uh, Dr. Jenofski? I just saw his TED Talk."
Bernadette,"Well, letês get back to Penny. Hey, werenêt you telling me something great about your company car?"
Penny,"Um, it has seat warmers."
Sheldon, Amy.
Amy,Come in.
Sheldon,"Hello, everyone. Oh, Beverly, good to see you. Iêd love to chat, but thereês a line that could start moving any minute, so letês do this. Amy? A proper apology requires three steps. Step one, an admission of wrongdoing. Amy, I was wrong. Step two, a promise never to repeat said action. Amy, that action will never be repeated, and thatês a promise. Step three, an earnest request for forgiveness. Amy, I hope you can forgive me. And I hope you do it right now, êcause thereês an Uber waiting downstairs, and I donêt want to repeat this apology nonsense with my driver Ganesh."
Sheldon,"Oh, thanks, youêre a peach. Beverly, weêll catch up soon. Bernadette, it was a pleasure as always, Penny, you have spinach in your teeth."
Penny,How long have I had spinach in my teeth?
Howard,You look like you come with a kickstand.
Raj,You canêt make me feel bad.
Howard,"Hmm, maybe not. Leonard?"
Leonard,"So, when the aliens brought you back, they just left the probe in?"
Sheldon,Iêm back.
Leonard,"Hey, howêd it go?"
Sheldon,"It went well. Yeah, Iêve learned that if you never say youêre sorry, the times you do really puts them on their heels. Uh, Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties."
Howard,Iêll give you a dollar if you make fun of Raj.
Howard,"Uh, if you ever need a reference or anything, just let me know."
Sheldon,Did you see that? He just cut the line.
Leonard,Heês just joining his friends; itês fine.
Sheldon,"No, itês not fine. It is a breach of line etiquette."
Howard,Weêre near the front of the line. Weêll get in either way.
Sheldon,What if every person in front of us let someone cut?
Leonard,Weêd still get in.
Sheldon,What if each of those people let someone cut?
Leonard,Still get in.
Sheldon,But then each of those people let someone cut?
Leonard,"Weêd still get in, but first Iêd hit you over the head with his stick chair."
Sheldon,Excuse me.
Leonard,"Oh, please donêt."
Sheldon,"Uh, uh, I couldnêt help but notice that you cut the line."
Sheldon,"Well, no. Itês not cool. If there were reserved seating, and we all had tickets, that would be fine. But this line is first-come, first-served. Not show up tardy and nevertheless be first served. Right here."
Sheldon,You need to go to the back of the line.
Sheldon,Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade. And my slogan was a line thatês straight is a line thatês great.
Leonard,"Boy, I wish I could say no."
Amy,"Well, heês come a long way. Or a short way very slowly, so it feels like a long way."
Amy,"Oh, sure. Iêll, Iêll talk to Sheldon about it. You know, Bernadetteês husband is a former astronaut."
Bernadette,Do I think heêd be interested? Sometimes I hear him pretending to be interviewed when heês alone in the bathroom.
Bernadette,"Um, you should probably talk to Penny, too."
Penny,"Okay, you know what? This is ridiculous. Iêve been trying to make a connection with you all day, and clearly Iêm getting nowhere."
Penny,"What I was seeking was some sort of friendship. But at this point, Iêll take you not insulting me to my face."
Penny,Youêve been doing it all day. Do you even know what an insult is?
Penny,"Okay, good example."
Sheldon,What about Joss Whedonês work makes you think heêd be okay with rule-breakers and line-cutters?
Sheldon,"They work for SHIELD, which is a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government. Do you work for a sanctioned department of the U.S. Government?"
Raj,Heês got him there. The D even stands for department.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, excuse me, can I please see a show of hands? Who here takes issue with this person cutting the line?"
Sheldon,"Well, what a sad state of affairs. That youêve all been so ground down by life, you donêt even notice when someone disrespects you."
Howard,"I canêt believe weêre gonna get beat up, and itês not because of your chair."
Sheldon,"You know, right now, at the back of this line, thereês a movie fan like you whoês not going to get in, because this person simply doesnêt care. Yeah, well, 61 years ago, there was another person at the back of the line and her name was Rosa Parks."
Leonard,"Okay, you may have to pretend youêre black to get us out of here."
Sheldon,"Now, letês follow in that brave womanês footsteps, and stand up for ourselves. And, and I realize that she stood up by remaining seated, but now is not the time to enjoy the irony of that. Now, I ask you again. Who here takes issue with this personÑ"
Sheldon,I most certainly did not.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, I paid someone to wait in line for me, and then when I arrived, he left, so what you saw, my good woman, was swapsies, not cutsies. Oh, no, no, no, no, wait, I ask you all again, a show of hands. Who here takes issueÑ well, stop moving. heês gonna get in."
Leonard,"Buddy, let it go."
Sheldon,"No, I canêt. This isnêt right."
Leonard,You did everything you could.
Sheldon,"No, I couldêve done more."
Leonard,"Now, now, you denigrated the memory of a great civil rights pioneer. Thatês all anyone could ask."
Penny,"To be honest, Iêm surprised you cared about the wedding at all."
Amy,I know how you feel. She didnêt invite any of us.
Penny,It was spur of the moment.
Bernadette,But we did get to see a live stream of it on the Internet.
Penny,"Thank you. So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas to see us get married, you wouldêve come?"
Penny,You really think we made a mistake?
Penny,"Wow. Okay. Well, um, how about this? Maybe while youêre still in town, Leonard and I could have another small ceremony. You know, if youêre interested."
Penny,She would find it perfectly acceptable. You guys saw it. We bonded.
Bernadette,Howie? You doing okay? Youêve been in there a while.
Howard,"Iêm fine. Be right out. Am I an American hero? Well, thatês a good question, Jim. Donêt you think once an astronaut leaves the planet, heês a hero to all the nations of the Earth? Okey dokey. I think I have time for one more question."
Penny,"Hi, how was the screening?"
Leonard,"Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks to make somebody who cut the line feel bad, but only the white people felt bad."
Penny,"Ugh, I shouldêve never bought him that colouring book that explains Black History Month."
Leonard,Howêd it go with my mother?
Penny,"Uh, you know, it started a little rocky, but I think we got to a good place."
Leonard,Wow. Well done.
Penny,"Yeah, and when I dropped her off at the hotel, she even gave me a hug."
Leonard,"Did she think you were choking orÑ Iêm sorry, thatês great. Thank you for spending time with her."
Penny,"No problem. Um, so listen, I donêt know if you have any plans next weekend, but I kind of promised your mom weêd have another wedding ceremony so she could attend this time."
Leonard,"Wait, weêre gonna get married again?"
Penny,"Yeah, kind of, but now we can invite our friends and family."
Leonard,Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.
Penny,"Come on, itêll be fun, and, you know, your mom was genuinely hurt we didnêt invite her to the first one."
Leonard,"Look, in our defence, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing, and also, we donêt like her."
Penny,"Leonard, come on, sheês your mom. If we can do something to make her happy, why wouldnêt we?"
Leonard,"I just said why, we donêt like her."
Penny,"Hey, look, then forget about her, letês do it for us. We could keep it small and informal. This time we can invite our families."
Leonard,Is your brother out of prison?
Penny,"Thanks to overcrowding, yeah."
Leonard,Iêd love it if my dad could come.
Penny,"Oh, you have to invite him. I havenêt seen him since the divorce."
Leonard,"Oh, heês like a different man. He stopped twitching, and I think he grew an inch and a half."
Penny,"Well, then itês settled. Yay. So funny. I never thought my second marriage would be to you."
Penny,"Okay, so itês not a legal ceremony, itês just a chance for us to redo our vows so everyone can be part of it."
Amy,So thereês no maid of honour?
Amy,"Huh. But if I were to, say, wear a purple satin dress with a sweetheart neckline and stand near you, you wouldnêt be able to stop me, right?"
Penny,I donêt see how I could.
Amy,Then I graciously accept.
Bernadette,Whoês going to officiate?
Penny,I was kind of hoping you would.
Amy,"Wait, now Iêm just some lousy maid of honour?"
Sheldon,"Hey, good news, I just got off the phone with my mother. She is coming to the wedding."
Penny,"Okay, wait, youêre inviting people to our wedding?"
Sheldon,"Yes, Iêm inviting people to our wedding. Yeah, Iêve already asked Stephen Hawking and Robert Downey Jr, and, now donêt get your hopes up, êcause heês pretty busy, but Erno Rubik."
Bernadette,Whoês Erno Rubik?
Sheldon,Seriously? He invented the Rubikês Cube.
Penny,"Okay, fine, but why would you invite him to our wedding?"
Sheldon,"Because, despite his fame and fortune, he strikes me as a lonely man."
Bernadette,"Well, itês very sweet of you to go to all this trouble for Leonardês mother."
Penny,"Yeah, Iêm also doing it for Leonard. I think this could really help their relationship."
Leonard,"Sorry, but I donêt think I need your permission to have my father at my wedding."
Leonard,"I know, and thereês no excuse for that."
Leonard,"I was wrong, thereês three excuses for that."
Howard,"Oh, my God. Itês working."
Raj,You sure?
Howard,"Look. The system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation."
Raj,Youêre right. You realize what this means?
Howard,Yeah. I do. Itês proof of concept. Weêve got a workable guidance system.
Howard,"Thanks. Hey, I just got an e-mail from the U.S. Air Force."
Raj,Open it.
Howard,"Hmm. We request a meeting at your earliest convenience regarding your quantum guidance system, provisional patent 62/295118. Thatês weird."
Raj,Is there a window around here we donêt know about?
Howard,Iêm sure itês just a coincidence.
Raj,"Yeah, of course. What else could it be? Boy, do I love America."
Sheldon,"Oh, youêre welcome."
Amy,"My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper."
Amy,"Okay, Mary."
Sheldon,"You know, that doesnêt work for me, letês stay with Mrs. Cooper."
Sheldon,"Wu-wu, what? Thatês what I called you till I got to know you better."
Sheldon,"Well, actually, IÑ"
Amy,It sure was.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, I take care of him."
Amy,"Oh, well, the usual gang. Pennyês family is coming tomorrow."
Sheldon,"Yeah, and Leonardês motherês already here."
Amy,"Youêve met her, right?"
Sheldon,"Mother, sheês an atheist, not a vampire."
Sheldon,"I donêt know what we were worried about, theyêre getting along great."
Penny,"Whew, chilly."
Amy,I think I can see my breath.
Howard,I canêt believe I was so naive. The military is just gonna take over the whole project. And you know what happens if we object? We disappear. Like off the map. Like every American Idol winner since season four.
Bernadette,"Come on, Howard, youêre overreacting."
Howard,Am I? Am I? what do you want to bet some black ops guy is reprinting my high school yearbook and Iêm no longer in it? That chess club picture is now just David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.
Raj,"Okay, look, Iêm on the Air Force Web site, and the department that e-mailed you is in charge of acquisitions. So maybe they just want to give you a lot of money for your invention."
Howard,"Oh, please, thatês not how it works. You saw E.T., Avatar, Jurassic World. The military just shows up and takes over."
Bernadette,"You do realize those werenêt documentaries, right?"
Howard,"Iêm sorry, you find this funny?"
Raj,"No, I was just thinking about Jurassic World. Boy, that was terrible."
Leonard,"Oh, we have to use the stairs."
Leonard,"Uh, I donêt, any day now."
Leonard,"Hey, I, I know things are a little rough with you and Mom, but Iêm really glad youêre here."
Leonard,Pennyês really looking forward to seeing you.
Leonard,"Thanks, Dad."
Sheldon,Isnêt this nice?
Leonard,"Hey, weêre here."
Penny,Alfred. Thank you for coming!
Penny,Thank you.
Leonard,"Dad, you remember Sheldon."
Sheldon,Dr. Hofstadter.
Leonard,"This is Sheldonês mother, Mary."
Leonard,"And his girlfriend, Amy."
Leonard,"And, of course, Mom."
Sheldon,"All right, now Iêm starting to sense a little tension."
Leonard,"All right, you two, donêt start. Penny and I are throwing this second wedding for your benefit. Can you please not ruin it?"
Penny,"Uh, whoês hungry? We have a reservation at the best restaurant in town."
Sheldon,It only got three-and-a-half stars on Yelp.
Sheldon,Iêm not sorry. Thatês true.
Howard,"I donêt know what to do. Itês the Air Force. I mean, should I respond to their e-mail? Ignore it?"
Raj,You canêt ignore it. Itês not that postcard that says itês time to go back to the dentist.
Bernadette,"Guys, come on. Weêre meeting everyone for dinner."
Howard,"One sec. Iêm just afraid if I respond, then theyêll know I got it."
Raj,"Oh, dude. The minute you opened that e-mail, they knew you got it. I mean, theyêre probably looking at you through the camera right now. I love America."
Bernadette,Are you done with this nonsense?
Howard,Itês not nonsense. This is how the U.S. military works.
Raj,"Oh, if itês even the U.S. Military. It could be foreign military pretending to be American."
Howard,"Youêre right. We turn our guidance system over to them, next thing we know, theyêre using it against us."
Raj,I also love the enemies of America.
Penny,"No, of course not."
Leonard,"Mom, please save something for the toast."
Sheldon,"Donêt laugh, she wasnêt joking."
Amy,Play with your phone.
Raj,"Howard, there must be someone at the university you can go to for help."
Howard,Are you kidding? Theyêre probably the ones who leaked it to the military in the first place.
Raj,"What about the guy on the Channel Four News? You know, Four on Your Side? Maybe he can be on your side."
Howard,"Iêm being harassed by the government, not trying to get to the bottom of a dog-walking scam."
Bernadette,"Oh, stop. You know whatês really happening? All the movies youêve watched, the TV shows, the comic books, theyêve completely twisted your thinking. No oneês after you, no oneês listening to you, no one cares about you."
Raj,Iêd like to think the Four on Your Side guy cares about me.
Penny,"You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred have your differences, but if you think about it, if you hadnêt married him, thereêd be no Leonard. So thatês good, right?"
Leonard,Is that Howard in front of us?
Penny,"Oh, maybe. Get closer."
Howard,"Oh, God. I think someoneês following us."
Bernadette,Youêre being ridiculous.
Howard,"Iêm not being ridiculous, heês right on my tail."
Raj,"Uh, turn left here and see if he turns with us."
Penny,"Well, why is he turning here? The restaurantês the other way."
Leonard,I donêt know. He uses that traffic app. Maybe thereês an accident.
Penny,"Oh, so follow him."
Raj,"Oh, no."
Howard,I told you.
Bernadette,"Itês probably just a coincidence. Speed up a little, see if he stays with you."
Penny,"Well, go faster. Youêre losing him."
Leonard,What is his hurry?
Penny,"You know what, flash your lights. Let him know itês you."
Howard,Heês flashing his lights. Whatês that mean?
Raj,"I, I think he wants us to pull over."
Bernadette,Do not pull over. Iêm not raising this baby alone.
Howard,Hang on.
Amy,Do you realize whatês happening here?
Sheldon,"Yeah, I do. Theyêre filling up on bread and ruining their meal."
Amy,What took you guys so long?
Leonard,"Oh, we were following Howard, but for some reason, he turned off his headlights and went up a one-way street."
Penny,"So, what did we miss?"
Leonard,"Okay, Mom, you sit over there."
Penny,"Yeah, Iêm gonna call Bernadette and see whatês keeping them."
Sheldon,"If Iêd known you were broke, I wouldnêt have made a big deal about the bread."
Bernadette,"Hey, Penny. What are you talking about? Oh, that was you? Long story. Why donêt you go ahead and eat. Weêre gonna be a while."
Howard,"Iêm telling you, Iêm not on drugs. The governmentês out to get me."
Sheldon,"Thatês funny, because my father was not a very clever man."
Amy,Iêd be lost without you.
Leonard,"Uh, I would like to propose a toast to my wife and bride-to-be."
Sheldon,"See, thatês funny becauseÑ"
Amy,Back to your phone.
Leonard,"Penny, Iêve always known I loved you, but this last year has shown me that I also love being married to you. Thank you for saying yes."
Penny,"Oh, thanks for asking until I did."
Amy,"Hear, hear."
Penny,"Um, if, if we want to order the souffl_, we might want to get on that."
Leonard,"Sure, Dad."
Leonard,What is happening there?
Sheldon,I think itês pretty obvious. They donêt want dessert êcause they filled up on bread.
Sheldon,Sheês still not answering.
Leonard,My fatherês not texting me back.
Penny,‚Cause they both turned their phones off.
Sheldon,I donêt like this at all.
Leonard,I donêt like it either.
Penny,Really? ‚Cause I love it.
Sheldon,Leonard? Leonard?
Sheldon,You realize you and I could become brothers.
Leonard,Weêre not gonna be brothers. Weêre not gonna be stepbrothers. Go to sleep.
Sheldon,I hope youêre right. ‚Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brotherês wife is weird.
Leonard,Go to sleep.
Sheldon,Okay. Do you think your fatherês doing unspeakable things to my mother?
Sheldon,Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?
Penny,Your parents are old. Anything unspeakable was finished by 9:30. Go to sleep.
Sheldon,Very well.
Leonard,Iêm sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward.
Penny,"God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this."
Sheldon,"Hey, if you want me to sleep youêre gonna have to stop talking."
Penny,"Okay, Iêm gonna go pick up my family. Like an hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic."
Leonard,"Yeah, drive safe. "
Penny,"Oh, hey, and do yourself a favour, all right? When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All right? As far as youêre concerned, you donêt know anything, you didnêt see anything. I want you just to play dumb."
Sheldon,It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.
Penny,"Oh. Hi. Okay, hey there, I got, Iêm sorry, I got to go now."
Leonard,"Well, why? Whatês wrong?"
Sheldon,"Whuh, are we still doing the dumb thing? Okay, why, whatês wrong?"
Sheldon,"Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?"
Sheldon,"Do I say stop what, or just throw in the towel?"
Sheldon,"Oh, excuse me, that is my mother youêre talking about, however accurately."
Penny,"Okay, Beverley, arenêt you overreacting a little? All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap. "
Sheldon,And turned their phones off.
Leonard,"Not helping, buddy. Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this. Please stay."
Penny,"Yeah, plus if you leave, Alfred will know he got under your skin."
Sheldon,"You know, also, if they did have coitus, weêll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist."
Raj,It is funny when you think about it.
Howard,Maybe to you. You didnêt get a $500 traffic ticket.
Bernadette,Because you were driving like a lunatic.
Howard,"Hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then, yeah, okay."
Raj,"Oh, Iêll get it."
Bernadette,It didnêt help that you couldnêt walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over.
Howard,I have performance anxiety. You of all people should know that.
Raj,Howard Wolowitz?
Raj,"Um, no. "
Raj,May I ask what this is about?
Raj,Very well.
Howard,"Raj, whoês at the door?"
Raj,Thatês not him.
Penny,"Oh, I canêt wait for you to meet everyone. I told them all about you."
Penny,"Uh, not everything, just, like, the jail and drugs part."
Penny,"Well, Mom, Iêm sorry, butÑ"
Penny,"So, uh, Randall, canêt believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in California."
Howard,"Thatês great, now they know where I live."
Raj,What are you talking about? Theyêve always known where you live.
Bernadette,"Yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your motherês house."
Raj,Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?
Howard,Yeah. I would not have done that for you.
Bernadette,"Howard, please just call the man, see what he wants."
Howard,"All right, all right."
Raj,"Hey, make sure you tell him that you werenêt home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door."
Howard,"Yes, hello. Uh, this is Howard Wolowitz for Colonel Richard Williams."
Raj,"Oh, I take it back, donêt mention me."
Howard,"Hi, Colonel Williams, how can I help you? Oh, uh, yes, he is from India. No, I donêt know his immigration status. Relax, Iêm still on hold. Speaking. Okay, sure, I can meet with you on Thursday. Caltech is fine. Yeah, and may I ask what this is about? I may not?"
Raj,Thatês what he said to me.
Leonard,"Here you are, Mother."
Leonard,Iêm glad you decided to stay. Itês gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.
Leonard,"Yeah, special, like that.  Thatês them. Please donêt make things any more awkward than they already are."
Sheldon,"All right, so less or equally awkward, got it."
Leonard,"Hey, guys, come on in."
Sheldon,"So, did you defile my mother or not?"
Sheldon,Did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?
Leonard,You donêt know his girlfriend very well.
Sheldon,Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.
Penny,"All right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then weêll go across the hall and say hi to everyone."
Penny,I thought it was really funny.
Penny,"Okay. Listen, Mom, I know youêre nervous, but I promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family."
Sheldon,A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa. Youêre kind of a sucker.
Leonard,"Well, nothing happened, right? Itês over. Until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again."
Sheldon,In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia? I canêt be the only one that knows thatês halfway.
Leonard,"Mary, Iêm sorry youêre in the middle of this."
Sheldon,"But heês a mediocre academic. And according to Beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. Heês basically Leonard with a bigger prostate."
Leonard,Are you saying that my dadês not good enough for your mom?
Sheldon,"Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. Pretty efficient, huh?"
Leonard,This is ridiculous. Iêm going across the hall.
Sheldon,But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?
Leonard,"Fine, then you go."
Leonard,That still leaves me here with him.
Sheldon,"Hang on, hang on. Weêre smart, we can figure this out. Okay, so: Mary and Beverley canêt be together. Uh, Alfred and Beverley canêt be together. Leonard and I canêt be together. Now, I could be with Alfred but I donêt like his face. Oh, here. Iêve got it."
Amy,Whoês ready for a wedding?
Sheldon,"Great, now I have to start all over."
Penny,Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.
Penny,"Well, I learned from the best."
Leonard,"Oh, you, too. Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverley."
Amy,Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?
Sheldon,"You made God sad today, Mom."
Amy,"Sheldon, they havenêt done anything wrong. I think itês nice theyêre hitting it off."
Sheldon,"Well, thatês still no reason to rush into anything. I mean, look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I, we didnêt even hold hands for two years."
Amy,It was a lot hotter than it sounds.
Sheldon,"Hey, hey. Sheês mine, take a cold shower, grandpa."
Howard,Why wouldnêt that colonel say what the meetingês about? It has to be bad news.
Raj,"Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it."
Howard,Thatês really stupid advice.
Raj,You know that hurts my feelings.
Howard,"Calm down, try not to think about it."
Raj,Okay. 
Howard,Why do I bother talking to you?
Raj,"Oh, come on. Whatês the worst that could come of this meeting?"
Howard,"I donêt know. They take the invention away, and I get nothing?"
Raj,"Okay, thatês not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation."
Howard,Whatês the point of that story?
Raj,"I just read a book about Oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off.  There he is, thereês my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah, thatês the smile Iêm gonna remember when youêre living in the desert and Iêm living with your wife."
Leonard,"And he canêt wait to meet you, too. Can I get anyone a drink?"
Penny,Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?
Bernadette,"Okay, I think weêre ready."
Sheldon,Why do people cry at weddings?
Bernadette,Weêre here today to celebrate love.
Bernadette,"Not just Leonard and Pennyês love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other."
Sheldon,"Speaking of love, STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing."
Bernadette,"Love is patient, but itês not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so letês knock it off."
Howard,At least sheês yelling at someone else for a change.
Penny,"Okay, I understand everyoneês a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff. Leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. But also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for marrying me. Hopefully for the last time."
Leonard,"Penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. But I donêt think Iêll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. You know, maybe I donêt"
Bernadette,Anybody have anything snarky to say about that? Didnêt think so.
Bernadette,"Thank you. All right, letês continue."
Sheldon,"Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something to someone pretty special, and I just canêt wait any longer."
Amy,Itês happening.
Sheldon,"Leonard, you and I have our ups and downs. But I have always considered you my family. Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. I donêt always show it, but you are of great importance to me. Both of you. "
Leonard,Thank you.
Bernadette,Okay. I now pronounce you husband and wife. And weird other husband who came with the apartment.
Leonard,"Hey, Iêm just thrilled weêre all getting along for a minute."
Leonard,Thatês okay. I can make it over.
Leonard,That was almost a minute.
Amy,Youêll be at the airport an hour before your flight.
Sheldon,Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.
Sheldon,Yes maêam.
Amy,"Sheldon, youêre motherês an attractive woman. You need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interested in her."
Sheldon,"Well, and you need to drive the car and mind your business."
Amy,I will not have you be disrespectful to me.
Sheldon,youêre not my mother.
Sheldon,Yes maêam.
Penny,"Oh, thanks, Mom."
Penny,Is he? I never noticed.
Sheldon,Look at this. Elon Musk has a theory that weêre all just characters in some advanced civilizationês video game.
Leonard,So some alien kid spent his money on the asthma-and-glasses upgrade for me?
Sheldon,"Well, he doesnêt say itês a good game."
Howard,"All right, we got a problem."
Leonard,Whatês up?
Howard,The Air Force contacted me about our quantum gyroscope. They want to have a meeting.
Raj,Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howardês door. He was terrifying.
Sheldon,"Oh, what did he say?"
Raj,He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.
Sheldon,That doesnêt sound terrifying.
Raj,"To a white guy born here, no. If you are a brown guy whose name has a lot of syllables in it, terrifying."
Leonard,"You realize if the military declares our research classified, they can take the whole thing away from us."
Howard,"And if that happens, weêll never be able to sell it commercially."
Leonard,There goes our big payday.
Howard,I was counting on that money. I need to make as much as my wife so I donêt have to try so hard in bed.
Leonard,"You do that, too?"
Howard,"Oh, yeah. How do you think I stay this thin?"
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I think we are losing sight of the real issue. We are on the precipice of becoming faceless cogs in the military-industrial complex. Isnêt that exciting?"
Raj,"Well, youêre kidding, right?"
Sheldon,"Not at all. In Star Wars, when the stormtroopers would march in perfect formation, harassing civilians, didnêt you ever think, hey, that could be me?"
Howard,"Sheldon, we could be contributing to a weapons system that oppresses mankind for the next thousand years."
Sheldon,"Okay, Howardês on board. What do you think, Leonard?"
Bernadette,"Iêm worried about Howard. Ever since that guy from the Air Force showed up, heês been a nervous wreck."
Penny,"All right, we work at a giant pharmaceutical company. Get him some anti-anxiety meds."
Bernadette,He wonêt take any pills that arenêt chewable and shaped like a Flintstone.
Penny,"You know, when Leonardês feeling anxious I make him take a long walk."
Amy,Does that help?
Penny,"Well, for a while. Then he comes back."
Bernadette,I donêt believe this.
Amy,Whatês wrong?
Bernadette,This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.
Amy,"You did already know, right?"
Bernadette,No one at the office did. Did you tell anyone?
Penny,You told me not to.
Bernadette,"I bet it was Barbara Chen in retrovirus. She might have heard me throwing up one morning. Every since she got the hearing aid, she thinks sheês so great."
Amy,Why donêt you want anyone to know?
Bernadette,"‚Cause Iêm up for a major immunotherapy study, and if they find out Iêm pregnant they might give it to someone else."
Penny,Would they really do that?
Bernadette,"I know they would, they did it to Barbara Chen last year when I told everyone she was pregnant."
Raj,Wail till I Snapchat that my friends might be working on a top secret government project.
Leonard,Are you crazy? You canêt put that on Snapchat.
Raj,"Fine, Iêll put it on Facebook like a caveman."
Howard,"You know, maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer."
Leonard,Thatês not a bad idea.
Raj,"Well, you must have someone in your family thatês a lawyer."
Howard,"Why? Because Iêm Jewish? Thatês like me saying, hey, youêre Indian, doesnêt your cousin work in a call centre?"
Raj,My cousin does work in a call centre.
Howard,And my cousinês a lawyer.
Sheldon,"We donêt need Howardês cousin. No, we have me. "
Leonard,"Youêre not a lawyer, Sheldon, youêre just a know-it-all."
Sheldon,I am not a know-it-all. Iêm a person who knows lots of things and likes to correct other people when theyêre wrong.
Leonard,Thatês the definition of being a know-it-all.
Sheldon,"Or in German, a Besserwisser."
Penny,How did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy?
Bernadette,I had a plan. I kept leaving Dove Bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain.
Amy,Where did you get empty Dove Bar wrappers?
Bernadette,"From all the Dove Bars I ate. Iêm pregnant. Try to keep up. Iêm sorry, I have to go find out if my boss knows."
Amy,"Well, whatever happens, weêre here for you."
Bernadette,Thanks. You guys are the best.
Penny,"Yeah, drive safe. We love you. And give us a callÑ Oh, my God, it was me, it was me. Iêm the one who blabbed she was pregnant!"
Penny,I didnêt mean to. It just slipped out in front of her assistantone day. IÑ
Bernadette,I forgot my coat.
Penny,"Oh, hereês your coat, honey. Thatês such a cute jacket. Oh God, I feel so bad, I just lied to her."
Amy,"Oh, but you did it so well. Thatês amazing, itês like watching a sculptor, but your clay was lies."
Penny,Is that really whatês important right now?
Amy,"I mean, seriously, you have got to let me scan your brain when youêre being dishonest so I can see what lights up."
Penny,"Thatês super helpful, Amy. Thanks a lot. I canêt wait to do that."
Amy,I can see a clump of bitch cells lightinê up from here.
Howard,Give me a second to call my cousin.
Sheldon,I donêt see how a tax lawyer from Fort Lauderdale could be helpful regarding intellectual property.
Howard,"First of all, heês in Boca Raton, which is better than Fort Lauderdale. But more importantly, he lasted two days on Jeopardy, so heês clearly a smart guy."
Howard,"Hey, Marty. Thanks for talking to us."
Howard,"Well, I married a little Catholic girl, so weêre even. Anyway, this is Leonard and Sheldon. The three of us came up with the guidance system."
Howard,"And this is my friend, Raj."
Raj,"Oh, Iêm not on the patent. Iêm just here because thereês a bumblebee in my office."
Leonard,I saw it. Itês big.
Howard,"Anyway, like I said in the e-mail, this meetingês on Thursday. Do you have any advice for us?"
Sheldon,"Donêt sign anything? Thatês your advice? Okay, so, uh, if during this meeting, one of us were to, say, complete an oil painting, youêd recommend that we leave that unsigned?"
Sheldon,Thatês what you said.
Sheldon,"This must be how you practice law in Boca Raton, by saying things you donêt mean and meaning things you donêt say."
Sheldon,"All right, you were on Jeopardy. Allow me to Alex Trebek this and put it in the form of a question: Who has been a complete waste of our time?"
Howard,"Marty, let me call you back."
Leonard,"Someday, when Iêm up on murder charges, youêll be hearing from me."
Sheldon,You donêt need him. Iêll represent you.
Bernadette,Hey. What brings you by?
Penny,"Oh, had to go to a sales seminar on our new sleeping pill."
Bernadette,Oh. How was it?
Bernadette,Fell asleep?
Penny,"In, like, two minutes. Yeah. So, how is everything going around here? Are you still upset about people finding out youêre pregnant?"
Bernadette,Iêm furious.
Penny,"Sure, sure. Uh, did you ever figure out who told?"
Bernadette,"I confronted Barbara Chen, but she claimed she didnêt know what I was talking about."
Penny,"Hmm. Well, I guess itês just gonna remain a mystery, you know, like whatever happened in that seminar after they dimmed the lights."
Bernadette,It had to be Barbara. Iêve been trying to figure out a way to get back at her. Do you think using her work computer to Google how to be a prostitute is over the line?
Penny,"Uh, you know, when I was in high school, there was this girl who was talking about me behind my back, so me and all my friends, we cornered her in the bathroom and forgave her."
Bernadette,What kind of revenge is that? This woman screwed with my job. Sheês got to pay.
Penny,"Okay, all right, honey, you know what? There was something I was too scared to tell you yesterday, and now Iêm just balls-out terrified to tell you, but the truth is it wasnêt Barbara Chen, it was me. Iêm the reason everyone knows."
Bernadette,Why did you do that?
Penny,"Well, it was an accident.I am so sorry I lied."
Bernadette,Get out.
Penny,"Oh, you know, I also lied about the girl in the bathroom. Yeah, we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet and put it back in her mouth."
Sheldon,I donêt understand why I canêt talk at this meeting.
Leonard,"‚Cause when you talk, it enrages people."
Sheldon,Okay. Quick question. Am I allowed to exchange pleasantries upon meeting this colonel?
Sheldon,Am I allowed to inform him that Colonel Sanders was never actually in the military?
Leonard,Iêm getting enraged.
Sheldon,Fine. Ooh. Can I use text-to-speech software?
Leonard,Donêt speak.
Howard,"Itês a group effort, but I guess if we had to pick a main brain, it would be me."
Sheldon, 
Leonard,"Exactly. Yeah, you have a good grasp of the physics."
Howard,Really? Youêre a physicist?
Leonard,Where did you go to school?
Howard,"Oh. Well, hey, me, too."
Howard,"Well, thanks, but you should know weêre a little concerned about this being used in weapons."
Leonard,I donêt know how I feel about this.
Leonard,Thatês a lot less big.
Howard,Iêm not even sure thatês possible.
Howard,Four months?
Sheldon,"Yeah, weêll do it in two. Hi. Iêm Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Iêm the actual brains behind this project. Also, engineers arenêt real scientists, MITês a trade school, and the Death Star is from Star Wars, not Star Trek. But otherwise, thank you for your service."
Amy,"Hi. Howard told me you were working late, so I brought dinner."
Bernadette,"Oh, thanks. You know, I just wanted to get some work done without people congratulating me about the baby every five minutes."
Amy,I spent my day alone in the lab waiting for a rat to die of anthrax.
Bernadette,Did you come here to bring me dinner or to gloat?
Amy,"Well, I came to see how you were feeling, but Iêm guessing still angry?"
Bernadette,"Iêm sorry. My boss wants to meet with me, and Iêm stressing."
Amy,You really think theyêre gonna start treating you differently?
Bernadette,"Are you kidding? Iêve always been treated differently. Look at me. Listen to me. I mean, the first thought when you see me isnêt thatês a scientist, itês I wonder if her mommy"
Amy,I am really regretting that I got you a Happy Meal.
Bernadette,"Iêve worked so hard to get where I am, and I donêt want to get sent back to square one because Iêm pregnant."
Amy,I understand how you feel.
Bernadette,Thank you.
Amy,I wish there were some way I could make it better.
Bernadette,"Well, you brought me French fries. Thatês a start."
Amy,"Uh, actually, I got you apple slices êcause youêre pregnant."
Bernadette,Apple slices? What kind of lunatic goes to McDonaldês and gets fruit?
Amy,Iêll be right back.
Bernadette,And a chocolate shake.
Penny,What are you doing?
Sheldon,"Oh, Leonardês mad at me, so Iêm making him lemon bars."
Penny,Does he even like lemon bars?
Sheldon,"Not really. But Iêm mad at him, too, so lemon bars it is."
Penny,Something happen at the meeting?
Sheldon,They made me promise I wouldnêt talk.
Penny,And you talked?
Sheldon,"Well, now, see? You knew what was gonna happen. Why didnêt they? Anyway, now weêre committed to completing this project in a ridiculously short time frame, and everyoneês upset with me."
Penny,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, Bernadetteês mad at me, too."
Sheldon,"Mm. If it makes you feel any better, a parasitoid wasp known as Oobius depressus has been rediscovered after 101 years of presumed extinction."
Penny,Why would that make me feel better?
Sheldon,Why would your Bernadette thing make me feel better? At least mine was educational.
Penny,Okay. Never mind.
Sheldon,"Look, Iêm sorry. Tell me why Bernadette is upset with you."
Penny,"Well, I told people at work that sheês pregnant. She wasnêt ready for them to know."
Sheldon,Why would you do that?
Penny,"Well, it just slipped out. I feel terrible."
Sheldon,"See, thatês exactly what happened to me, except that I said it on purpose, and I have no regrets."
Raj,Is it even possible to get this done in two months?
Howard,"Well, maybe. I donêt know. Weêll have to work 12 hours a day, seven days a week."
Leonard,"Which means I wonêt be able to make Penny breakfast every day, and sheêll realize my brioche French toast was the only thing keeping her in the marriage."
Howard,I love your French toast.
Leonard,"Oh, thanks, man. "
Raj,"So, why did you guys even agree to the deadline?"
Howard,We didnêt. Sheldon did.
Raj,And you just let him?
Leonard,"Well, the colonel said it was for the good of the country, and the funding is substantial."
Howard,"No, but mostly, there was an awkward pause, and I broke it by saying okay."
Raj,So I guess I wonêt be seeing you guys for a while.
Leonard,"Oh, looks like it."
Raj,"Wow. Youêre going off to work with the military, leaving me behind. Now I know how all those army wives feel."
Howard,Would you stop? Weêre just gonna be on the other side of campus.
Raj,And right here.
Howard,You are a deeply silly man.
Raj,He is so afraid of his feelings.
Penny,"Oh, hi."
Bernadette,Got a minute?
Penny,"Yeah, come on in."
Bernadette,I just wanted to apologize. I know what you did was an accident.
Penny,"Oh, thank you, and Iêm sorry I lied about it. "
Bernadette,"For what itês worth, youêre a great liar."
Penny,"Oh, thatês what Amy said. So whatês going on with the research project? Are they gonna let you run it?"
Bernadette,"Well, my boss said he hadnêt decided yet, so I gently reminded him that heês an old rich white guy, and Iêm a sweet little pregnant lady whoês not afraid to crying front of a jury."
Penny,You threatened to sue?
Bernadette,"Hey, I learned a long time ago, when youêre four feet eleven and eye level with every guyês crotch, thatês where you punch."
Penny,Thatês funny. I learned something totally different.
Bernadette,Do you know what? Itês just a research project. The most important job in the world is gonna be raising this child. Itês all I need to give my life meaning.
Penny,"Oh, thatês so beautiful."
Bernadette,"You believe me? Oh, good. 11 more chumps like you, Iêll have the jury eating out of my hand."
Sheldon,I never realized this building was classified.
Howard,Maybe thatês because itês classified.
Leonard,Wish we werenêt so far from my parking space.
Sheldon,"The way you put away those lemon bars, perhaps thatês a good thing."
Leonard,Iêd like to reinstate the you-not-talking rule.
Sheldon,Why? It clearly doesnêt work.
Howard,I guess this is it. 
Leonard,Is that a retinal scanner?
Howard,Letês find out.
Leonard,No way.
Leonard,"Oh, my turn, my turn."
Leonard,I didnêt even have to take my glasses off/
Howard,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, guys, hold me upside down."
Howard,Itês pretty late. You think Iêve got time to run some more simulations on the cooling system?
Leonard,"Sure, Iêm still figuring out the thermo-acoustic expander."
Sheldon,"Oh, while you do that I am going to pump cerebral spinal fluid through my brain cells to remove the metabolic by-products of the dayês thoughts."
Sheldon,"Itês called sleep and itês my bedtime. Nighty-night, yêall."
Howard,"Hey, hey, hey, youêre not going anywhere."
Leonard,We only have two months to deliver this to the Air Force because of you.
Sheldon,"I know, I was there."
Howard,"Well, wake up, weêre gonna put in a lot of late nights."
Sheldon,How late?
Howard,"Well, I donêt know, midnight, one."
Sheldon,One oêclock? Iêm not a raccoon.
Howard,"If youêre tired, have some coffee."
Sheldon,You have some coffee.
Howard,I am having coffee.
Sheldon,And look how irritable itês making you!
Leonard,"Guys, weêre not gonna get anything done if we start fighting. Now, can you please try"
Sheldon,Fine.  I donêt think I can go much longer.
Leonard,"Itês been three and a half minutes, wake up."
Sheldon,I had a bad dream that my best friend became a tyrant and forced me to stay up all night to work.
Leonard,"Oh, I had a good dream that when I carried you to bed, I let your head hit the wall and I laughed."
Penny,Good morning.
Leonard,What is this?
Amy,"Well, we didnêt see you last night, weêre not gonna see you today, so we thought we could have breakfast together."
Leonard,"Oh, that is so nice."
Sheldon,"Ow, it does hurt."
Leonard,"So, what are you guys gonna do today?"
Amy,"Well, Sheldon was supposed to go to this party with me this afternoon, but I donêt think thatês happening."
Sheldon,"Oh, that was never happening."
Penny,"Oh, Iêll go. I like a party."
Amy,"Well, to be honest, itês not like a party party, itês more like a gathering where scientists of different disciplines get together to share their work and keep current on whatês going on in other fields. I donêt know why I called it a party, sorry."
Penny,"Itês okay, Iêll still go."
Leonard,You donêt think youêll be bored?
Penny,"Oh, Iêll have some wine and listen to people go on about crap I donêt understand. I mean, how is it any different than every single day of my life?"
Sheldon,I wonêt be there.
Leonard,"Look at that, it is a party."
Howard,Sorry I have to work all weekend.
Bernadette,Itês okay.
Howard,Thanks again for breakfast.
Raj,"Well, I didnêt get to see you last night. It was the least I could do."
Bernadette,You shouldnêt have made the alarm code his birthday.
Raj,"So, what should we do today?"
Bernadette,"Oh, I appreciate it, but you donêt have to spend your day off with me."
Raj,"Well, I donêt mind. Oh, you want go to the mall and look at baby stuff?"
Bernadette,Not really.
Raj,"Oh, come on, we could share a pretzel and get sideways glances from racist old ladies."
Bernadette,I get enough of that when I take Howard to my grandmotherês for Christmas.
Raj,"Oh, I know, why donêt we get started on clearing out the babyês room?"
Bernadette,Isnêt it a little early for that?
Raj,You have to get to it eventually.
Bernadette,"Oh, thereês so much junk in there, itês embarrassing."
Raj,How can you be embarrassed around me? Iêm gonna be in the room with you when you give birth.
Bernadette,I donêt think you are.
Raj,"You didnêt think I was gonna be in your kitchen this morning, yet here I am."
Sheldon,"Huh, what?"
Sheldon,"Oh, no, thank you, those have caffeine in them."
Sheldon,"I am cool. This is Yoo-hoo, chocolate milkês delicious watery cousin."
Sheldon,Superheroes take performance-enhancing chemicals?
Sheldon,I am facing a great deal of work. And I do like things better when famous people also like them.
Sheldon,"The first oneês free? Flash, how do you stay in business?"
Amy,"Hi, Bert. This is my friend, Penny."
Amy,Bertês a geologist. 
Penny,How early are we?
Amy,"Oh, actually, weêre an hour late."
Penny,I suddenly wish Sheldon was here.
Bernadette,I donêt even know where to begin.
Raj,"Well, in The Sound of Music, Julie Andrews says letês start at the very beginning, a very good place to start."
Bernadette,"Oh, I was gonna start at the end. Thank God youêre here."
Raj,"Well, I think the first thing we should get rid of is that tone."
Bernadette,Sorry. I should probably keep this in case we have a girl.
Raj,"Oh, thatês a nice one. Was it yours when you were little?"
Bernadette,My dad built it for me.
Raj,"Wow, itês so cute."
Bernadette,"This was the husband and this was the wife. Theyêd go out on adventures together. Cruises, skiing, horseback riding. That was really me just duct taping them to our dog."
Raj,"Oh, and did they have kids?"
Bernadette,"They did, but the mommy and daddy didnêt like them, so they shipped them off to an orphanage I made out of a shoebox."
Raj,"Yeah, thatês not worrisome at all."
Bernadette,Not every girl dreams about being a mom. Sometimes you think youêre never gonna have kids and one day you wake up and youêre pregnant. And it doesnêt matter that your careerês going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere taped to a dog.
Raj,I skipped spin class for this.
Howard,Why is it taking him so long to get a drink out of a vending machine?
Leonard,"Oh, itês complicated. He finds pushing that little door and reaching up into the machine"
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, I am ready to work. To quote The Martian, letês science the faeces out of this. Thatês The Martian the book and The Martian the movie, not Marvin the Martian. Although to quote Marvin the Martian, I claim this planet in the name of Mars."
Leonard,Are you okay?
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm fantastic, never been better. I had my first energy drink and I feel great. Hey, you guys want to wrestle? We can do arm, thumb, mud, sumo. Nah, weêre not fat enough, or wearing diapers."
Howard,You wanted him awake.
Penny,So should we talk to each other or mingle?
Amy,I donêt know where everyone is.
Penny,"Yeah, I mean, I could see him eating one or two guests, but not a whole party."
Amy,Okay. I feel so bad about leaving him here.
Penny,"Oh, itês funny, I was just thinking the same thing about you."
Penny,"Wait, what do you mean sheês her?"
Penny,"You tell me about your foot fungus, but this is a secret?"
Amy,Iêm sure itês just êcause Iêm dating Sheldon.
Penny,Now Sheldonês popular? What is happening?
Howard,Maybe we should break for lunch. What time is it?
Leonard,"According to the worldês worst cuckoo clock, itês two."
Sheldon,My head hurts and Iêm more tired than ever.
Howard,Why donêt you just go home?
Sheldon,"No, I can do this. I just, I just need another energy drink. Oh, no."
Sheldon,I want another one.
Sheldon,Thatês a craving. Thatês a sign of chemical dependency.
Leonard,You only had one.
Sheldon,"No, I know, but plenty of things are addictive after a single exposure. I mean, crack cocaine, nicotine, Pringles. You know once one pops one just canêt stop."
Howard,You canêt develop a problem that fast.
Sheldon,"You want to bet? Oh, great, now Iêm addicted to gambling."
Leonard,We canêt afford to lose any more time.
Howard,"Well, this probably wonêt work, but has anyone ever tried to just haul off and whup the crazy out of him?"
Leonard,"Thatês not helpful. Itês fun to think about, but itês not helpful. Hey, Sheldon, we are on a serious time crunch. We canêt do this without you. Can you please pull it together?"
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry. Yes, of course."
Leonard,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Just, please, bear with me if I display symptoms of caffeine withdrawal."
Howard,No worries.
Sheldon,You guys stink.
Bernadette,Sorry I flipped out on you. I think itês just hormones.
Raj,"I think you were mean before you were pregnant, but itês fine. So, uh, instead of cleaning out the room, why donêt we just decide on a theme for the nursery?"
Bernadette,Does it really need one?
Raj,Of course it does. Didnêt your baby room have a theme?
Bernadette,"Well, it doubled as my dadês office, and he was a cop, so I guess the theme was bloody homicide photos."
Raj,"Oh. Mine was Winnie the Pooh. But anyway, why donêt we just take a step back and start with a colour? Right? There are so many amazing ones. Red, blue, green, purple."
Bernadette,Are you just gonna name all the colours?
Raj,"Well, not now."
Bernadette,I donêt care what colour the room is.
Raj,"Okay, well, Iêm just trying to help you."
Bernadette,"Well, youêre not, so just drop it.  Iêm clearly upset. Why arenêt you following me?"
Raj,Sorry. Sorry.
Penny,You trend setter.
Amy,Just the right idea at the right time.
Penny,"Okay, okay, so Amyês cool, Sheldonês cool. Tell me about Leonard."
Penny,Leonard Hofstadter.
Penny,"Thatês me, Iêm her. You know, he didnêt trick me, he just wore me down."
Amy,And you thought this wasnêt gonna be a great party.
Penny,"You know, I had no idea Caltech is exactly like my high school."
Amy,"Well, itês not exactly like it. Weêre all extremely smart."
Penny,"Wow, you popular girls are mean."
Leonard,Iêm gonna get some coffee. You want some?
Sheldon,"Uh, youêre really going to have caffeine in front of me when Iêm trying to get my life back on track?"
Leonard,"Uh, okay, letês pretend you do have a problem."
Sheldon,I do.
Leonard,You donêt.
Sheldon,"Yeah, but I do."
Leonard,"No, you donêt. But letês say you do. And donêt say you do, because you donêt. Now, wouldnêt you think that throwing yourself into your work would be the best way to deal with it?"
Sheldon,With what?
Leonard,Your problem.
Sheldon,I thought I didnêt have a problem.
Howard,That was painful to watch.
Raj,So where are we going?
Bernadette,I donêt know.
Raj,Okay. How Thelma and Louise of us.
Bernadette,"Raj, why donêt I care about anything?"
Raj,Iêm sorry?
Bernadette,"Itês my baby. I, I should care about nurseries and colours, and I donêt. Whatês wrong with me?"
Raj,"Well, crime-scene photos near your crib spring to mind."
Bernadette,"I keep waiting to feel excited, but itês not happening. What if it never happens?"
Raj,"Bernadette, come on, look, youêre overthinking this, okay? Youêre gonna be an amazing mom. Even if you donêt believe it, I know you have maternal instincts."
Bernadette,"Once, I was supposed to babysit my brothers. Our neighbour found them naked in the backyard eating crickets."
Raj,"Happy and well-fed. You see, thatês what Iêm taking from that story."
Sheldon,"Leonard, can I ask you a question?"
Leonard,Is it about the rotational symmetries you should be figuring out or your fake caffeine problem?
Sheldon,"Howard, can I ask you a question?"
Sheldon,"All right, Iêll just toss this out to the room. Um, I was thinking that the best way to fight my addiction is by weaning myself off in steps. Now, I couldnêt find a caffeine patch, but I did find what claims to be a mind-boosting caffeine suppository. You know, the interesting fact about the rectumÑ"
Leonard,"Sheldon. We are dealing with an impossible deadline from the Air Force because of you. So have an energy drink, donêt have an energy drink. Order suppositories and shove êem wherever you want, I donêt care."
Sheldon,You donêt shove them. They come with an easy-glide applicator.
Leonard,Right. Listen to me. We canêt do anything until you do your part. So get up in front of this whiteboard and do it.
Sheldon,I canêt.
Leonard,"Yes, you can."
Sheldon,"No, I canêt figure out the math. Iêve been racking my brain for days, and Iêve got nothing."
Sheldon,I canêt do it. Iêm not as smart as I think I am. Iêm so sorry. This is all my fault.
Leonard,"Itês okay, weêll figure something out."
Sheldon,But what if we canêt?
Leonard,Itêll be fine. Youêll see. Sheldon? Buddy? 
Howard,"When the baby gets here, you gotta teach me that."
Amy,"Thank you so much, Bert. This was great."
Amy,I think weêre good.
Penny,"Well, so are you. In fact, you know what? We will never take you for granite. Did you get that? Granite? A little geology joke."
Raj,"Uh, pull over."
Bernadette,"Why? Who are you calling? Youêre gonna rat me out to Howard, arenêt you? Youêre such a snitch, no wonder I donêt like you."
Raj,"Whoa, Iêm calling my dad, okay? Heês got experience dealing with pregnant ladies because heês an OBGYN. And experience with crazy ladies because of my mom."
Raj,No.
Raj,"This is my friend, Bernadette. Sheês pregnant, and sheês a bit worried, so I thought maybe you could talk to her."
Bernadette,"Somethingês wrong. I donêt care about any of the baby stuff every other mom is so into. Honestly, Iêm not even sure I like babies."
Bernadette,But I thought Iêd be more excited.
Bernadette,Thank you. I feel better now.
Raj,Well I donêt.
Leonard,"Um, I donêt really know how to say this."
Leonard,"Right. Sorry, sir."
Sheldon,"He said start with it, not end with it."
Howard,Weêve hit a bit of a snag. Weêre already behind schedule.
Sheldon,The computations required to overcome the deployability issues are more significant than we thought.
Leonard,"I understand that weêre under contract, and I donêt know what the consequences of violating that are, but, uh, weêre not gonna be able to deliver in the time we promised."
Howard,"We, weêre thinking, two years."
Howard,Thatês it? Youêre okay with that?
Leonard,"Thanks for understanding, sir."
Howard,"Yes, thank you so much."
Sheldon,"We, we really appreciate it."
Leonard,"All right, pressureês off"
Howard,Wanna see a movie?
Sheldon,Popcornês on me.
Amy,"And there was water everywhere, it was such a mess."
Leonard,That stinks. How long are you out of the apartment?
Amy,About five weeks.
Penny,"Ugh, did you lose anything valuable?"
Amy,"Well, the pipe was over my closet, so all my clothes are gone."
Penny,"Oh, so nothing. Great. Do they know why the pipe burst?"
Amy,They didnêt say.
Leonard,Buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water. Canêt have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did and not pick up a few things about plumbing.
Penny,"Well, if you need a place to crash, you can stay with us."
Penny,"Of course. You can stay in Leonardês room, and weêll stay at my place."
Amy,Youêre sure thatês not an inconvenience?
Penny,"No, not at all."
Leonard,"And we live with Sheldon, so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning."
Amy,"So, technically, Iêd be moving in with my boyfriend?"
Penny,I guess so. And Iêd finally get to live alone with my husband.
Amy,"Oh, my, this is a big step."
Leonard,"Mm-hmm. For two of us, itês in the right direction."
Sheldon,Why are you all smiling like crazy people?
Sheldon,Cohabitation with my girlfriend? Thatês a great deal to process.
Leonard,Itês only for five weeks.
Penny,"Yeah, and weêll be right across the hall."
Amy,What do you think?
Sheldon,I donêt know. What if living together kills the romance?
Penny,"Okay, you guys had sex one whole time. Nothing can put out a fire like that."
Sheldon,"Yeah, but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain? I mean, sheês never even seen me unshaven."
Leonard,You just shaved yesterday. Youêre good for three months.
Amy,"Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you. Given the five-week end date, isnêt it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?"
Sheldon,Donêt try luring me in with sexy talk.
Leonard,"Okay. Star Trek, the original series, the Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds. Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same."
Sheldon,"If you want to lure me in with sexy talk, thatês how you do it."
Penny,Donêt be proud of that.
Amy,"So, is that a yes?"
Sheldon,"Not yet. How will I learn if Iêm comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because Iêm in my own apartment? Now, if this experiment is going to be valid, I suggest a neutral environment."
Penny,"Well, where would you go?"
Sheldon,"Well, ideally, an enclosed, self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico, where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste. "
Leonard,"And you were worried about the romance. 00:03:18,914"
Penny,"Wait. Why donêt you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?"
Sheldon,"Interesting. If my official residence were across the hall, I wonder if Iêd need to knock every time I came over here."
Leonard,Thatês a good question. Maybe just donêt come over.
Sheldon,"Historically, I donêt do well with change."
Penny,"Okay, it wonêt be that bad. We wouldnêt even sit in your spot while youêre gone."
Sheldon,"Youêre darn right, you wouldnêt. No matter where I am, this will always be my spot. Like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom."
Leonard,Just nod and smile. Heês almost gone.
Amy,"Sheldon, what do you think?"
Sheldon,Very well. Iêm on board.
Sheldon,Yes. I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.
Amy,Oh. This is so exciting.
Sheldon,"Well, now, donêt be surprised if, like Star Trek, itês cancelled in three."
Raj,"I have to say, I am happy with your OBGYN."
Howard,Cool. ‚Cause she says youêre doing a great job as weird friend who doesnêt have to be at every appointment.
Raj,Iêm the son of a gynaecologist. I could be helpful. 
Bernadette,It would help if you stopped telling me I have a textbook cervix.
Raj,"The polite response is, thank you for noticing."
Bernadette,"Let me see the sonogram again. Oh, yeah, thatês a good-looking baby for a little grey blob."
Howard,"Yeah, we could name him Blobert."
Bernadette,What if itês a girl?
Howard,Bloberta. Or Blobbi with an I.
Bernadette,Are we being silly not finding out the sex?
Howard,"Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing."
Raj,"If you want, you can find out right now."
Bernadette,"Hmm. The doctorês gone for the day, so it doesnêt matter."
Raj,"Well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder."
Bernadette,You looked in our folder?!
Raj,It was an accident. The doctor left the folder out on her desk. Itês not my fault I opened it and looked.
Howard,"So you know the sex of our baby, and we donêt?"
Raj,Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot.
Howard,Itês unbelievable.
Bernadette,"God, Raj."
Raj,"This is not a problem, okay? If you donêt want to know, I donêt have to tell you."
Bernadette,We donêt want you to know.
Raj,"Okay, well, thatês a problem."
Penny,"You know, Iêm very proud of you for trying to live with Amy."
Sheldon,Oh. Thank you.
Penny,Mm. 
Sheldon,"Of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys. One pair that was neither dating nor living together. One pair that was dating but not living together. One pair that was living together but not dating. And then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating. Although, with that many Sheldons, itêd be such a party, weêd never get anything done."
Penny,"That was a cute story. So, um, what did you want to ask me?"
Sheldon,"Well, youêve lived with your significant other for some time. I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?"
Penny,"Mm. Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible."
Sheldon,"You know, Leonard and I were very happy before you came along."
Amy,Youêve been roommates with Sheldon forever. Do you have any advice?
Leonard,Iêm trying to think of an answer that wonêt stop you from doing this. 
Penny,"I know it sounds like a clich_, but compromise is key. "
Leonard,"Never leave a belt on the floor. At night, they look like snakes."
Penny,"Do little things, like bring her a cup of coffee in bed."
Leonard,Keep M&MêS in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line.
Penny,"Youêre gonna be seeing each other a lot, so respect each otherês personal space."
Leonard,"He startles easily, so, please, no flash photography."
Sheldon,How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?
Amy,I donêt know. I didnêt count.
Sheldon,You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.
Amy,"Thatês me. Listen, you and I are gonna be sharing a bed. You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. How are you feeling about that?"
Sheldon,"Oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain."
Amy,"Well, if youêre nervous about the sleeping arrangements, maybe we should talk about it."
Sheldon,Okay. Talk.
Amy,"Well, I imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations. "
Sheldon,"Wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it. "
Amy,"Look, I know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone. So why donêt we take being physical off the table and maybe later on, once weêre more settled in, we can revisit it."
Sheldon,Youêre really okay with that?
Amy,"Iêve never lived with someone, either. This is a lot for me, too."
Sheldon,"This is such a relief. Honestly, if it didnêt get you all worked up, Iêd kiss you right now."
Amy,Good call. Seeing your Teen Titans underwear really got my motor running.
Sheldon,I know. They probably shouldnêt sell those to children.
Penny,"Well, hereês your key."
Amy,Thank you.
Sheldon,Enjoy having the place to yourselves.
Leonard,You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.
Sheldon,Itês Pennyês bedroom. Plenty of men have gone before.
Penny,"Now, now, thereês no need to make this emotional."
Amy,Shall we?
Sheldon,I guess this is it.
Leonard,You guys have fun.
Sheldon,"You, too. Oh, donêt forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed."
Penny,"Yeah, you wrote it on my hand."
Sheldon,"Oh. Oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit."
Leonard,"Iêm on it. 15 years from now, weêll make guacamole together."
Sheldon,"Leonard, please, let me go."
Amy,"Come on, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Oh. Bye.
Leonard,Good night.
Penny,Good night.
Amy,"Well, thatês it. For the next five weeks, we are officially living together."
Sheldon,I guess the experiment begins.
Penny,"Wa-how, we did it."
Sheldon,Which side of the bed would you prefer?
Amy,Doesnêt matter to me. Your choice.
Sheldon,"No, no, weêre living together now, everythingês equal. You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling, so I would rather you choose."
Amy,"Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want."
Sheldon,"Well, clearly, itês not whatever I want, because what I want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that."
Amy,"Well, Iêm not refusing. Iêm just trying to be considerate."
Sheldon,"Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?"
Amy,"Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?"
Sheldon,"Fine. Okay. Now, on this side, I am closer to the exit in case of emergency."
Amy,Great. Thatês your side.
Sheldon,"No, but Iêm also closer to the entrance in case of attack."
Amy,"Okay, Iêll take that side."
Sheldon,"Ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?"
Amy,Rising rapidly.
Sheldon,"Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep."
Amy,Okay. What if we do this?
Sheldon,I suppose that works.
Sheldon,Although now Iêm kind of worried someoneês hiding behind those drapes.
Bernadette,"This is ridiculous. The doctor knows what the baby is, the ultrasound tech knows, Raj knows, his Greyês Anatomy online fan group probably knows. Is it weird we donêt?"
Howard,I donêt know. Maybe the surprise will make it more fun. Like magic tricks. Remember how disappointed you were when I explained the never-ending hanky?
Bernadette,I was disappointed to see the man I was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.
Howard,But how delightful was it when I pulled out a bouquet at the end of those scarves? Itêll be the same thing when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.
Bernadette,Everyone said I could do better.
Howard,"But you didnêt listen, and presto change-o, my babyês inside you. Ta-da."
Sheldon,Be grateful Iêm still in the room.
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm just happy I donêt know what this memory foam remembers."
Amy,"Sheldon? I know we took coitus off the table, but I was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling."
Sheldon,"Well, itês funny you should ask, because I was wondering how youêd feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall."
Amy,"Sheldon, Iêve made more than enough accommodations for you. Weêre both grown adults, weêve been far more intimate than this. If you donêt want to snuggle, fine, but weêre not building a pillow wall."
Sheldon,"Okay, well, I am sorry. Iêm just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. And no offence, but your bottom radiates enough heat, Iêm surprised there arenêt iguanas lying on it."
Leonard,"Thatês it. Itês Sheldonês bedtime, he is in for the night."
Penny,Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.
Leonard,"Itês weird. This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. Unless they feel sad, then itês different."
Penny,"So, what do you want to do?"
Leonard,I know exactly what we are gonna do.
Penny,"Really? Youêre a genius, and thatês the first thing you come up with?"
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldonês not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear."
Penny,Ugh. Can we just have sex?
Leonard,"Oh, donêt worry. Once you see my sweet moves, sex is inevitable."
Penny,"Inevitable, you say?"
Leonard,Iêll just let my hips do the talkinê.
Howard,Screw it. Iêm calling and finding out.
Bernadette,"Good. Call him. Wait, Iêm not sure I want to know."
Howard,But you just said you wanted to know.
Bernadette,"Well, now I donêt know if I want to know!"
Howard,Call you back.
Sheldon,"No, Dr. Feynman. If I solve it for you, youêll never learn."
Penny,"Wow, where did you learn these moves?"
Leonard,"The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution, but not this smooth criminal."
Howard,"Okay, youêre positive you want to know?"
Howard,Okay. Here we go. Itês ringing.
Howard,Wrong number.
Penny,I told you not to do the worm.
Leonard,You were right. 
Bernadette,"I changed my mind, hang up, hang up."
Amy,"Oh, oh, oh."
Sheldon,What are you doing down there?
Amy,Hang on.
Sheldon,Who are you calling? Aaargh!
Amy,Iêm so sore. I donêt think I slept two minutes last night.
Penny,"Yeah, get it, girl."
Amy,Itês not what you think.
Leonard,I feel like I pulled something. Why didnêt you tell me to stop?
Penny,Even more not what you think.
Amy,I donêt know if I can make it through five weeks living with him.
Leonard,"If you ever need a break, the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee."
Sheldon,"Good morning. See? I didnêt knock, but itês fine. I didnêt knock, but itês fine. I didnêt knock, but itês fine. So, how is everyone?"
Amy,Miserable and exhausted.
Sheldon,Really? I slept great.
Amy,"Well, I didnêt, and itês your fault."
Sheldon,How? You had the whole floor to yourself.
Amy,"Sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea."
Sheldon,"Well, but what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?"
Amy,The kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.
Sheldon,"Wow. I anticipated weêd have problems, but I never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them."
Amy,"Iêm sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?"
Sheldon,If the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.
Penny,Was that a science diss?
Penny,Was it a good one?
Amy,"What would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway? I mean, you wouldnêt know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time. And you donêt even get that joke, êcause you donêt even work with confounding variables."
Sheldon,How dare you?
Amy,"Oh, you heard me. Your experimental bona fides are laughable."
Sheldon,"Whoa, whoa! Now youêre making fun of my bona fides?"
Amy,Canêt make fun of something thatês a null set.
Penny,I feel like I should say damn.
Leonard,Do it.
Penny,Damn. 
Sheldon,"Well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started."
Amy,"Well, for science, maybe I will."
Sheldon,"For science, maybe you should."
Amy,Do you want to go to our place and make out?
Sheldon,Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?
Penny,The new neighbours are weird.
Penny,"Okay, Iêm confused. Which one is Mr. Robot?"
Leonard,Iêll give you a hint. Weêre watching Daredevil.
Sheldon,Will you two please inform Amy how much you enjoy adhering to a strict bathroom schedule?
Amy,"I told you, you canêt regulate every aspect of our lives."
Sheldon,I can if youêd just roll over and accept your fate.
Amy,Iêm sorry for bringing this over here. 
Penny,"Believe me, we know what youêre going through."
Leonard,And I think the most helpful thing we can tell you is no backsies.
Amy,"Sheldon, I understand that you like things a certain way and Iêm willing to make some concessions, but you have to be open to compromise."
Penny,Sheês right. Thatês reasonable.
Sheldon,"Oh, look whoês in favour of compromise, the woman who married Leonard Hofstadter."
Leonard,"Hey, she didnêt compromise. She settled. Thereês a difference."
Penny,"Yeah. You tell him, babe."
Raj,What time do you and Bernadette head out?
Howard,As soon as I get home. Weêre hoping to make it before dark.
Raj,Iêve never been to Palm Springs.
Raj,"I donêt know. If I want to watch old people sweat, I can just FaceTime my family in India."
Howard,"Well, she wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes."
Howard,"Well, he wants us to spend more time together before the baby comes."
Leonard,"When you live with someone, thereês gonna be conflict. You just have to keep communicating."
Sheldon,Well Iêm open to that.
Amy,"Okay. Well, for starters, thereês nothing wrong with keeping our toothbrushes in the same holder."
Penny,"Sheldon, what do you say to that?"
Sheldon,I think we should see other people.
Sheldon,"Well, as a male, I have an evolutionary drive to perpetuate my DNA. Restricting myself to a single partner is against my nature."
Amy,We sleep together once a year. You want other partners?
Sheldon,"Donêt blame me. Blame your pal, biology. Heês the pervert pulling the strings here."
Amy,You wanna see other people? Go see other people.
Penny,"I hope one of those people is a monkey, êcause this is bananas."
Leonard,"Hey, you can make jokes, but if this keeps up, heês gonna move back in here."
Penny,"All right. Well, letês just get them apart for a while so they can cool down."
Leonard,"Good. Then before we reintroduce them, weêll give him one of her sweaters so he can get used to her scent again."
Penny,So itês okay for you to joke around?
Leonard,"No, thatês actually what we did with him when Howard came back from space."
Howard,"Honey, how ya feeling?  So thatês good news, right?"
Bernadette,The only thing I hate more than you right now is that book.
Howard,"There she is. Whoês ready for a hot, three-hour car ride to the desert?"
Bernadette,Next vomit is gonna be in your lap.
Howard,Iêm sorry. We donêt have to go.
Bernadette,But itês our last chance to take a vacation thatês just the two of us.
Howard,How êbout we stay here? We donêt even have to tell anyone. Itêll be like a secret vacation at home. 
Bernadette,"Keeping secrets from our friends, it does sound kinda fun."
Howard,Does it sound sexy?
Bernadette,You just heard me throwing up.
Howard,You bet I did.
Bernadette,Youêre so weird.
Howard,You know whatês weird? How turned on you are right now.
Sheldon,"You know, people are quick to accuse me of being difficult to live with, but the truth is, Amy is just as challenging."
Penny,Just as challenging?
Penny,As you?
Penny,Just as challenging as you?
Sheldon,"When weêre sleeping, she breathes on me. One night, it got so bad I almost grabbed Toto "
Penny,"Leonard breathes on me, too. Itês not a big deal."
Sheldon,Sheês always complaining about people at work.
Penny,"Well, so does Leonard. Itês kind of annoying, but itês not the end of the world."
Sheldon,"Do you know that when I get out of the shower, she eyes me up and down like Iêm a piece of meat?"
Penny,"You know, so does Leonard. Canêt I just get ready in the morning without him giving me his goofy thumbs-up? Hey-hey-hey."
Sheldon,I know. Sometimes I would just like to be appreciated for my mind.
Penny,Agreed. Thank you.
Bernadette,That feels great.
Howard,"Well, pulling a quarter out of your ear isnêt the only magic these hands can do. In fact, whatês this between your toes?"
Bernadette,Can you please stop making money come out of me for two minutes? Was that the front door?
Howard,"It sounded like it. Oh, my God. Someoneês in the house."
Bernadette,"Lock the door, lock the door."
Howard,We should call the police.
Bernadette,"Uh, I left my phone downstairs."
Howard,"Damn, so did I."
Bernadette,"Wait, I have my iPad."
Howard,"What are we gonna do, e-mail 911?"
Bernadette,Thatês not helpful.
Howard,You know I rely on humour in times of stress.
Bernadette,"Let me know when you start, because that wasnêt funny."
Howard,Is that the hot tub?
Bernadette,Who would use our hot tub?
Howard,"Well, the answer is both more and less disturbing than you think."
Bernadette,Who is it?
Howard,Stuart. He heard me talking about us going away. I guess he decided to invite himself over?
Bernadette,Should we say something to him?
Howard,"Maybe. How êbout, hey, you look like a boiled chicken breast?"
Bernadette,"I meant like, what are you doing here?"
Howard,"Nah, thatês not gonna hurt his feelings."
Amy,Why is nothing easy with him?
Leonard,"Look, hereês the thing you need to understand about Sheldon. Heês the worst."
Amy,I prefer to think of it as high-maintenance.
Leonard,"I prefer to think of myself as five-ten, but I still need to get all my pants hemmed."
Amy,I guess I should have known what I was getting myself into.
Leonard,Donêt beat yourself up. Youêve never lived with anyone before.
Amy,Thatês true.
Leonard,"And youêre starting out with Sheldon Cooper. Thatês like getting your first pet and having it be, I donêt know, whatês a kind of pet that ruins your life?"
Amy,Youêre not making me feel better.
Leonard,"Look, even when Penny and I started living together, there was a learning curve. But I promise you, it does get easier."
Amy,"He put a sign up in the bathroom that says, number of days without Amyês hair on the soap."
Leonard,Yeah. My record was six.
Bernadette,"Is it me, or is there something fun about watching him just float there?"
Howard,Maybe this is why people get fish tanks. Who just turned the porch lights on?
Bernadette,Is someone else here?
Raj,Hmm. They must have left the tub on. Good thing I stopped by. Ah. Aaaaah! What are you doing here?
Raj,Maybe Howard and Bernadette said I could be here.
Raj,"Answer the question, what are you doing here?"
Bernadette,I told you raccoons donêt say uh-oh.
Penny,"You know, one night, Leonardês nose whistled so loud, I swear it was like sleeping on a train track."
Sheldon,Have you noticed itês always an A-flat?
Penny,Is it? Oh. Itês like his sinuses are right here in the car.
Sheldon,"If weêre just going to drive around aimlessly, the least you could do is take me for ice cream."
Penny,"Yeah, Iêll take you for ice cream."
Sheldon,"Well, see, why canêt Amy be that subservient? She has coitus one time, suddenly sheês Gloria Steinem. Anyway, I suppose an ice cream parlour will be a good place to meet other women."
Penny,"Oh, please, youêre barely interested in a physical relationship with one person. Why would you want to confuse and disappoint others?"
Sheldon,"Being with Amy has awoken the sexual creature within. When I see a pretty gal walking down the street, I think, hubba hubba, like any other guy."
Penny,You kiss your mother with that mouth? ‚Cause itês fine.
Raj,Here you go.
Raj,Shall we toast?
Bernadette,You said you got it back.
Howard,"Well, clearly, I lied."
Raj,So howês your apartment?
Raj,So why donêt you get it fixed?
Raj,"If you ever need somewhere to crash, thereês always my place."
Raj,"Actually, Iêm single now."
Raj,"Itês okay. Itês by choice. Well, their choice, and itês not okay."
Raj,Nobody does. I was embarrassed so I didnêt say anything.
Bernadette,Why wouldnêt he tell us? Are we bad friends?
Howard,Heês in our hot tub drinking our wine.
Bernadette,"Yeah, he deserves to be alone."
Raj,"Yeah, yeah, a little."
Raj,"Iêm in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad."
Amy,Maybe I should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule.
Leonard,"No, donêt do that."
Amy,But you did.
Leonard,"Exactly. Learn from my mistakes. No matter where I am at 7:18am, there better be a toilet nearby."
Amy,Itês just so much easier to give him what he wants.
Leonard,"Oh, true, but think of how much youêve accomplished. Who got him to stop Purelling his pocket change?"
Leonard,And who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment?
Amy,Me. It was mittens.
Leonard,And who got him to try a turkey dog?
Amy,"That was actually Koothrappali, but I did let him spit it out in my hand."
Leonard,How can you stop now? Thatês like walking out of Pinocchio right before he becomes a real boy.
Amy,"You know, youêre right. Iêm in this relationship, too. I need to stand up for myself."
Leonard,Of course you do.
Amy,"And if he doesnêt like it, he can move back here."
Leonard,Oh. He can try. Heêd just need a good locksmith.
Penny,"Well, who you gonna hit on? The girl in front of us got strawberry. Thatês your favourite."
Sheldon,"No, if we both like it, Iêll spend the rest of my life opening the freezer and going, aw, no strawberry."
Penny,What about the girl behind the counter?
Sheldon,"Hmm? Well, she spends her whole day scooping. One armês probably bigger than the other."
Penny,Is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone?
Sheldon,You are truly wise.
Penny,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Iêd say wise beyond your years, but youêre getting up there."
Penny,All right. Come on. What is really going on with you?
Sheldon,"Penny, I am going to tell you a story that Iêve never told anyone."
Penny,All right.
Sheldon,"I was 13 years old, and on spring break from college."
Penny,Not relating. Go on.
Sheldon,I came home early because they ran out of math to teach me.
Penny,"Oh, now Iêm with ya. Okay."
Sheldon,"My mother was at bible study. I walked in the house expecting to find it empty, and I heard a sound coming from my parentsê bedroom. When I opened the door, I saw my father having relations with another woman."
Penny,"Oh, thatês awful."
Sheldon,"I know. Itês also why I never open a door without knocking three times. I mean, the first"
Penny,"Well, what happened with your dad?"
Sheldon,"We locked eyes, I ran to my room, and we never, ever spoke of it."
Penny,You poor thing.
Sheldon,"Since Amy and I have been living together, weêve been bickering like my parents used to."
Penny,And youêre afraid youêre gonna do something like your dad did?
Sheldon,Yes. I need to prepare her now to save her from pain down the road.
Penny,"Down the road? Sheldon, she wanted to share a toothbrush holder with you, and now youêre at an ice cream parlour trying to pick up women."
Sheldon,"Well, anything can sound silly when you put it in that tone."
Penny,"Honey, instead of worrying about pain you might cause in the future, how about trying to fix the pain youêre causing her right now?"
Sheldon,"Iêm sure youêre right. I suppose I should apologize to you, as well."
Sheldon,That must have hurt watching me look for other women without ever even considering you. Please understand that I think of you as more of a nanny.
Penny,Just finish your ice cream so I can get you home to bed.
Raj,I wonder if this is what it feels like to be Bernadetteês baby.
Howard,"Those jets are for my secret spot, not his."
Bernadette,What do you do in there?
Howard,"Itês called relaxing, and thatês all you need to know."
Raj,"Well, itês getting late. Maybe we should head home."
Raj,You coming?
Howard,You jackasses just bought yourselves a hot tub!
Leonard,What do you think?
Amy,"Itês a nice enough spot. You know, if Iêm going to start standing up for myself, this is exactly the kind of thingÑ"
Penny,Weêre back.
Amy,"Oh, hi. Hi."
Leonard,How you guys doing?
Penny,Weêre doing good. I think Sheldon has something he would like to say to Amy.
Sheldon,"I wanted to apologize for my behaviour today. It, it was unnecessary. This is warm. Oh, and also, I am willing to forego the bathroom schedule."
Amy,Oh. Really?
Leonard,Why does she get that? We never got that.
Penny,Do you want him back?
Leonard,Iêm very happy for you.
Sheldon,"Amy, you should know I was never really interested in seeing other women. And to prove how serious I am about us, Iêm willing to take our relationship to the next level. "
Sheldon,"Amy Farrah Fowler, will you share this toothbrush holder with me?"
Amy,I would love to.
Leonard,Did we really need to be here for this?
Penny,"Call me crazy, but I found it moving."
Penny,"Hey, have you ever heard of the Van Nuys Comic-Con?"
Leonard,_Yeah. Itês a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?
Penny,I got asked to sign autographs there.
Leonard,Thatês awesome. Is this for Serial Ape-ist?
Penny,"Well, it could be for the monkey movie. It could be my haemorrhoid commercial. The list does not go on."
Leonard,When is it?
Penny,It doesnêt matter. Iêm not doing it.
Leonard,Why not?
Penny,"You just said yourself, itês sad."
Leonard,"Yeah, but itês not pathetic, thatês where I draw the line. Come on, weêll have fun."
Penny,I donêt know.
Leonard,"Youêll have nerds fawning all over you. If you donêt love that, this marriage is in trouble."
Penny,I guess it wouldnêt hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money.
Leonard,"Yeah. Wow, An appearance by George LucasÑ ‚s dermatologist. Oh, I want that autograph."
Penny,"Oh, yeah."
Amy,"You know, with us living together, maybe we could think about having people over."
Sheldon,"We have people over all the time. We have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man, that UPS driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging."
Amy,You know what I meant.
Sheldon,"All right, fine. Letês say that we were to entertain people. What type of gathering did you have in mind? Huh? A meal? Lunch? Brunch? Dinner? Afternoon tea? A formal tea? Hmm? Is it a party? And if so, what kind of party? Is it a cocktail party? A Tupperware party? Ooh, is it a surprise party? Oh, I hope itês not a West Coast party, êcause according to the man on the radio, a West Coast party donêt stop."
Amy,Iêm sorry I mentioned it.
Sheldon,"Oh, donêt be. You get your hopes up, I knock them down. Thatês called teamwork."
Howard,Thatês a kick. Thatês an actual kick.
Bernadette,What are you doing?
Howard,I felt a kick. Thereês a baby in there.
Bernadette,"Oh, yeah, thatês where I put it."
Howard,"Oh, I mean, I know youêre pregnant. I just never connected the idea of pregnancy and you actually having a baby."
Bernadette,Which MIT did you go to?
Howard,"Oh, God, we are not ready to have an infant in this house. We donêt have a crib, we donêt have diapers, weêre not baby-proofed. Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!"
Bernadette,"Howie, we have time to do all that stuff."
Howard,Do we? Look at you. Willy Wonka would roll you to the juicing room.
Bernadette,The next person kicking you will be me. Good night.
Howard,Are we even in a good schoolÑ? Ow!
Bernadette,"I warned you, and I did it."
Penny,Whatês all this?
Leonard,"Oh, everything we need for your autograph session, head shots, markers."
Penny,"Okay. Leonard, itês sweet youêre excited about this, but itêll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph."
Leonard,Are you kidding? I once paid twenty dollars for Theo Sasslerês signature.
Penny,Whoês that?
Leonard,"Oh, I donêt even know. I just liked his name. Theo Sassler. Okay, and look at this. I even got a change maker. How much change you want, little lady?"
Penny,"Oh, thereês so much I want to change."
Leonard,"Yeah, well, if itês a dollar, youêre in luck."
Amy,Whatês going on here?
Sheldon,"You expressed an interest in having people over, and I feel I dismissed it too quickly. So, I took matters into my own hands, and I arranged a brunch."
Amy,"Well, thatês so nice. Whoês coming?"
Sheldon,"Oh, uh, Stuart, Bert from the geology lab, and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs."
Amy,You mean the Romanian lady on the second floor?
Sheldon,"Yes. Oh, fun story, she grew up with ten siblings. Or possibly penguins. Her English is atrocious."
Amy,Thatês an odd mix of people.
Sheldon,"Well, for our first time hosting, I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station."
Amy,You never went into that haunted house.
Sheldon,You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.
Amy,"Well, thank you, Sheldon. This is a fun surprise."
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, the real surprise is how surprised you are that Iêm great at surprises."
Amy,"Well, thatês not a surprise at all. I mean, if I knew you were good at surprises, I would have"
Sheldon,Donêt get me all randy. Guests are on the way.
Bernadette,"Hey, where you been?"
Howard,"Oh, we went and did a little shopping for the baby."
Raj,Wait till you see the crib we found.
Bernadette,You bought a crib without me?
Howard,Youêre gonna love it.
Raj,"Yeah, itês the highest rated one on the market. I wouldnêt even call it a crib, Iêd call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies."
Bernadette,Sounds expensive.
Howard,"Okay, well, I may have gone a bit overboard, but you canêt put a price on safety. "
Raj,"Though if you did, itês more zeroes than youêre expecting."
Howard,"But itês the safest crib you can buy. And if you donêt like it, we can return it."
Howard,"In our new minivan. Hey, whatês for lunch?"
Bernadette,You bought a minivan?
Howard,"Itês for the baby, and I didnêt buy it. The dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive."
Raj,"Though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib, so you might have bought a minivan."
Bernadette,I donêt want to drive that. Itês such a mom car.
Howard,The guy at the dealership said theyêre not just for moms anymore. 
Raj,"Then again, he did think you were my husband."
Bernadette,"They thought it at the ultrasound, why not at the car dealership?"
Leonard,Never been on this side of the table before. I feel powerful.
Penny,Really? I feel like Iêm selling candy so our team can get new uniforms.
Leonard,"Okay, so itês four seventy-five for a signed black-and-white and nine ninety-five for a colour. "
Penny,"Alright, why not five and ten bucks?"
Leonard,"Well, I brought my moneymaker. Let me shake it. "
Penny,"Hey, that guyês looking over here. "
Leonard,Oh. You think heês your first autograph?
Penny,I donêt know. Be cool. Heês coming. Heês coming. Hi. 
Penny,"Well, thanks."
Penny,Your love confuses me. 
Leonard,Would you like an autograph?
Penny,Okay. Who do I make it out to?
Penny,That did not clear things up.
Leonard,Thatêll be four seventy-five.
Leonard,"But I-I-I, oh. Nothing about that was good."
Amy,"Thereês nothing to be afraid of, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"The average cork speed is 25 miles per hour. If that is too fast around a school, it is certainly too fast around a kitchen."
Amy,Been 15 minutes. Just sayinê.
Sheldon,Okay. I can do this. Just give me a momentÑ Oh! Mimosas coming up.
Amy,How old was it
Sheldon,"Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?"
Sheldon,Sheês learning English from TV.
Amy,"Hi, Stuart."
Amy,"Oh, theyêre pretty. Thank you."
Sheldon,"Stuart, this is Bert from the Caltech geology lab, and this is Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs."
Penny,Whatês your name?
Penny,Been hearing that a lot today.
Penny,"Yep, there they are."
Leonard,"Okay, letês keep it moving."
Penny,Here you go. 
Leonard,Shouldêve punched that guy.
Penny,"Well, go ahead. Heês right over there."
Leonard,Why do you do that? Canêt you let me have my moment?
Penny,Thank you.
Penny,"I assume weêre still talking about the movies, but after today, who knows."
Penny,"Oh, sure."
Leonard,She cannot kiss. What is wrong with you people?
Leonard,"No, no, no. Itês not okay."
Leonard,Iêm her husband.
Leonard,I am.
Penny,"Yeah, he really is."
Howard,"Itês got a rearview camera, thereês a DVD player, oh, and check this out. Itês like weêre living in the future."
Raj,"Hey, show her the trunk. Show her the trunk."
Howard,"Imagine this, youêve got the baby in one hand, groceries in the other, and youêre thinking, how am I gonna open this trunk?"
Bernadette,"Iêm probably thinking, whereês my husband, and why isnêt he helping me?"
Howard,You donêt need my help when you can open the trunk with a simple kick of the foot.
Raj,"No, itês a gentle kick, youêre doing it wrong. Here. Give me those."
Howard,"Uh, maybe it was more of a circle?"
Bernadette,Itês weird that guy thought you were a couple.
Howard,"See? Easy. And look at all this cargo space. Now weêll get the crib out and you can take it for a test-drive. Iêm telling you, this van is gonna beÑ uuh-uuh, uuh-uuh."
Bernadette,"Oh, is it your back?"
Howard,"Oh, yeah, oh, anyway, letês just get in and see if the GPS can take us to the nearest emergency room."
Sheldon,"So until Amyês apartment is fixed, she and I are living here together."
Amy,Things didnêt work out?
Sheldon,This is it. You are the practice round.
Amy,"Uh, no. He, he just means that you were the first people we thought of."
Sheldon,"You know, exactly. Weêve never thrown a brunch before, and I wanted to work out all the kinks."
Sheldon,"Hmm. You see, your words sound reasonable, but your face looks angry. Help me out here, this is not where I shine."
Amy,"Stuart, you know youêre one of our favourite people."
Sheldon,"Okay, now, see, you look sincere, but your words are completely false. Iêm glad we did this test run, these brunches are wild."
Leonard,"Well, she moved in across the hall."
Penny,And he started to slowly wear me down.
Leonard,Like a river carves a canyon.
Penny,"Yeah, except the river kept showing me his Pok_mon cards."
Penny,I think itês hot.
Leonard,Thatês right. Iêm her change daddy.
Howard,Aaaaah. What was I thinking? Wolowitzes are not a lifting people. We tip the lifting people.
Bernadette,Do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room? Theyêre just gonna give you ice and Advil like last time.
Howard,"Youêre gonna feel terrible when Iêm in a wheelchair. Which, by the way, would fit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan."
Bernadette,"Fine, weêll go to the E.R. Just stop selling me on the van."
Howard,Youêre right. It sells itself.
Raj,"You have to admit, itês a pretty smooth ride."
Bernadette,I was hoping itêd be quieter.
Howard,"If childbirth is half this bad, you are so screwed. Are we there yet?"
Howard,Why is it taking so long?
Raj,"Howard, Howard, look at the DVD screen. I put on Batman: The Animated Series. Your favourite."
Howard,"Iêm in too much pain to watch cartooÑ oh, this is a good one."
Raj,Iêve been babysitting him way longer than you have.
Bernadette,Fine. Iêll buy the stupid van.
Sheldon,Oh. Thank you. 
Amy,"No, Stuart, donêt."
Amy,Weêre so sorry.
Sheldon,"Well, no, thatês not true. I mean, sometimes itês Koothrappali. But weêre not supposed to say that êcause heês a minority."
Sheldon,"Stuart, wait. I do know what it feels like to be left out. "
Sheldon,"All right, this is about me and him, youêre not part of it. Stuart, perhaps we do take you for granted, and that is not acceptable. Please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group."
Sheldon,"You know, in fact, Iêd like to propose a toast. To Stuart. A fine man, a good friend and a wonderful guest."
Leonard,And that is how a short asthmatic scientist landed a stone cold fox.
Leonard,"The third time I did it in skywriting, but she never looked up."
Penny,"You know, once, I proposed to him."
Leonard,Yeah. I said no.
Leonard,I just wanted to make her work for it.
Penny,"Yeah, thatês gonna cost you later."
Leonard,She makes more money than I do.
Sheldon,Do you know what else I love about you?
Sheldon,Your handwriting is impeccable.
Sheldon,"No, I mean it. I mean it. Itês like you have the soul of a label maker."
Sheldon,You never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner.
Sheldon,"You know, it turns out, you can hurt people just as well without êem."
Amy,Maybe I can get a little help putting some of this stuff away.
Sheldon,"Oh, calm down. I already put away five of these. You see? No muss, no fuss, not a single cuss."
Sheldon,"Hello, Iêm Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
Amy,And Iêm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.
Sheldon,And welcome to the first on location episode of Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler presentÑ
Sheldon,Hit it.
Howard,For joy and fun thereês no better manner than to fly a pennant flag or banner.
Raj,What fills my heart and makes my eyes moist? Sending a flag up a pole on a hoist. 
Howard,"Oh say can you see, itês fun with flags."
Amy,"As you may notice, just one of the changes around here is our new house band. "
Sheldon,Who havenêt learned their place yet.
Amy,Weêre also coming to you live from a different apartment.
Sheldon,"Dr. Fowler and I began an experiment in living together after her apartment became water damaged. This is our friend Pennyês place. You may remember her from our episode, Flags and the People Who Donêt Understand Them."
Amy,"So, in the spirit of cohabitation, the theme of todayês episode is flags of two regions coming together as one. Such as the flag of St. Kitts and Nevis."
Sheldon,"So, letês roll up our sleevis and get to know Nevis.  Well, I, I like that, but next time check with me."
Amy,Did you know that the flag was designed by a student named Edrice LewisÑ
Penny,"I canêt believe Iêm saying this, but can we watch the news or something?"
Leonard,"Itês cute, theyêre having fun living together."
Penny,"Yeah, I wonder what theyêre gonna do when her apartmentês ready."
Bernadette,"Actually, itês been ready for weeks."
Leonard,What do you mean?
Bernadette,"Well, they finished the work early, but sheês been telling Sheldon theyêre behind schedule."
Leonard,"So, sheês just been lying to him?"
Penny,"Well, youêve lied to Sheldon."
Leonard,"Yeah, but to make him leave, not to make him stay."
Sheldon,Buda and Pest united to form Budapest. And thatês why Budapest is the Budabest. Now.
Howard,"Oh, right. "
Sheldon,"Thank you for your services, gentlemen. Now, Iêm hoping to broaden our audience with your youthful rock and roll music."
Howard,"Aw, you think you have an audience, thatês funny."
Raj,We donêt get paid? Nothing? Not even a sandwich?
Amy,Itês almost dinner time. You in the mood for anything?
Sheldon,"Yeah, we could get Thai food near your apartment and then drop in and check on the progress."
Amy,"Oh, you donêt want do that, itês a construction zone."
Amy,"Well, what about your fear of stray nails and butt cracks?"
Sheldon,I am terrified of stepping on a nail and falling into a butt crack.
Amy,"Anyway, how about dinner?"
Sheldon,"You know, if youêd like, I could call your landlord and complain."
Amy,"Thanks, but you donêt have to."
Sheldon,"Oh, I donêt mind, Iêm very good at complaining. If it were an Olympic sport, Iêd complain about what a stupid sport it is and then Iêd take home the gold."
Amy,"Good stuff. So, uh, what about dinner?"
Sheldon,"Is it me, or are you purposely changing the subject?"
Amy,"And on the subject of subjects, is your use of the word subject the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king?"
Sheldon,"I have a feeling youêre still doing it. But I find that topic irresistible, so, now, in ancient Mesopotamia, the king referred to the people as his property."
Howard,"Iêm serious, JPLês actually developing a robot arm that could grab an asteroid before it hits us."
Leonard,So their plan for saving the Earth from Armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?
Raj,"If weêre all gonna die, why am I eating so much kale?"
Leonard,"Youêre awful quiet, everything okay?"
Sheldon,Iêm concerned about Amy. Sheês acting a bit odd lately.
Howard,"Oh. Well, just out of curiosity, what registers as odd to you?"
Sheldon,"Her behaviour. No, I have the feeling that sheês hiding something."
Leonard,I wouldnêt worry about it. Sheês probably just distracted by work.
Sheldon,"Well, whatever it is, itês troubling me. And I canêt eat, I canêt sleep. And donêt even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements."
Howard,"You heard him, guys, donêt ask."
Sheldon,"Why would she keep something from me, you know? I shared my body with that woman. And my Netflix password. They recommended Stella Got Her Groove Back because of her."
Leonard,"Buddy, buddy, listen, nothing bad is going on, she just, she just didnêt want you to know that the work on her apartment was finished a couple weeks ago."
Sheldon,I donêt understand.
Leonard,Sheês enjoying living with you and she didnêt want it to end early.
Sheldon,"So, sheês deceiving me in order to spend more time with me?"
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, I feel both flattered and hurt. Like when people say I look like that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas."
Raj,"Oh my God, thatês who you look like."
Leonard,"Sheldon, this is not a big deal. Itês a little white lie, everyone does it."
Raj,"Not me, Iêm a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships."
Howard,And how single are you right now?
Raj,Eating cake on the toilet single. 
Sheldon,"Well, I wonêt tolerate deception in my relationship. I have no choice but to confront her."
Howard,"Donêt do that, youêve got gold here. Hang onto it until youêre in trouble and then throw it in her face."
Leonard,Why would you tell him that? Thatês terrible advice.
Howard,So you wouldnêt want to have anything on Penny?
Leonard,"Well, of course not."
Howard,"So, if I actually know something right now, and I do, you donêt want me to tell you?"
Leonard,"Uh, no. "
Howard,Iêll take that as a yes. Sheês secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you havenêt noticed.
Leonard,Are you kidding me?
Howard,"See, Iêve known that for weeks, but, you know, I waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain."
Leonard,"Supermanês gone, my stormtrooperês gone."
Sheldon,Your Klingon word-of-the-day calendarês gone.
Leonard,"Iêd say damn it in Klingon, but that wasnêt until next month."
Sheldon,Itês khoo-vakh. 
Leonard,Khoo-vakh! She took my Whereês Waldo.
Sheldon,"No, no, heês over there."
Leonard,"Oh, yeah, there he is."
Penny,"So, whatês the deal with your apartment? Whyês it taking so long?"
Amy,"Um, it was a drywall problem."
Penny,"Oh, no, what happened?"
Amy,"Well, the drywall got wet, and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet, itês really moreÑ"
Penny,Wet wall?
Amy,"Or damp wall, just as bad."
Penny,Mm. So why donêt they just get more drywall?
Amy,"Well, they went to get some, but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savingsÑ"
Penny,"Okay, are you done? Bernadette told me your apartmentês ready."
Amy,"I was done at wet wall, but you wouldnêt let it go."
Penny,But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?
Amy,"Well, he started to question it, but then I fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower. Please donêt say anything, I feel terrible about this."
Penny,"Oh, donêt worry, I wonêt."
Penny,The woman at the wall store?
Amy,Let it go.
Sheldon,Are you going to confront Penny?
Leonard,"Eventually, I guess. Although, I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing."
Sheldon,"Hmm. You know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far theyêre willing to spin their tangled webs. Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk."
Leonard,"Oh, my God, Iêm going blind."
Amy,Foodês here.
Sheldon,"Excellent. Iêm very hungry. Speaking of which, whatês going on with your apartment?"
Amy,"Oh, uh, theyêre still working on it."
Sheldon,Interesting. Very interesting.
Penny,"Yeah, we swung by her apartment on the way to the restaurant, and theyêre gonna be fixing it for a while."
Sheldon,"Wait, uh, you saw her apartment?"
Penny,"I did, still a mess."
Sheldon,jlyajbeê. DaH nepêaê Penny? 
Leonard,jISovbeê 
Amy,Why are you speaking Klingon?
Sheldon,Why are you speaking English?
Amy,"This is ridiculous. Penny, do you remember when I taught you Ubbi Dubbi?"
Penny,Ubabsubolubutubly ubi duboo.
Amy,Ubexcubellent. Duboes Shubeldubon knubow ubiêm lubyubing?
Penny,"Ubif Lubenubard tubold hubim, ubitês pubossubibuble. "
Sheldon,"Oh, wait, stop that."
Amy,You stop that.
Sheldon,Dayajêaê 
Leonard,ghobeê 
Sheldon,Quêvatlh 
Penny,Okay. Thatês enough. You know what? What is going on?
Leonard,"Fine, I told Sheldon that her apartmentês been finished, but then you just said itês not, so now Iêm all confused."
Amy,Penny was just covering for me. My place has been ready for two weeks.
Sheldon,How could you lie to me?
Penny,"Uh, sheês enjoyed living with you. Itês called being in love."
Leonard,"Mm-hmm, and whatês it called when you secretly get rid of all your husbandês stuff?"
Penny,ThaÑ That is not true.
Leonard,"Bernadette told Howard, Howard told me, plus, I can see all my stuff is gone."
Penny,"Oh, so, you believe your friend, and your friendês wife and your own eyes over me? Wow."
Leonard,You really didnêt think Iêd notice my stuff was missing?
Penny,"Uh, did you notice your key chain?"
Leonard,Whereês Batman?
Penny,Why did you tell Howard I was hiding Leonardês things?
Bernadette,One sec. Why did you tell Leonard I told you Penny was hiding his things?
Howard,"It just came up because we, we were talking about secrets andÑ wait, juH qachHom Dotlh Sov ‚Iv "
Amy,Everybody stop it with that.
Raj,"Iêm not really a part of this, so Iêm just gonna dig in."
Amy,And Iêd like to know why you blabbed about my apartment.
Howard,"Youêre up, blabby."
Bernadette,"Amy, Iêm sorry, I shouldnêt have said anything."
Amy,I guess itês okay. Iêm sorry that I lied about my apartment.
Sheldon,Itês all right.
Penny,And what? Your wizard robes are next to go.
Raj,"Now that everythingês out on the table, you, you think you two will keep living together?"
Sheldon,"Despite recent events, I do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive."
Amy,Are you saying youêd like to live with me?
Sheldon,Iêm open to the possibility.
Penny,Ubamy bube cubool.
Howard,"You know, if he moves across the hall for good, Leonard could keep the stuff you donêt like in Sheldonês old room. Solves everything."
Penny,Thatês a great idea.
Leonard,"Ooh, maybe I could turn it into a gaming den."
Raj,That would be amazing.
Sheldon,"Wuh wuh hold on, excuse me, thatês my room."
Leonard,But you wonêt be living here.
Sheldon,But thatês my room.
Leonard,But you wonêt be living here.
Sheldon,But thatês my room.
Leonard,You guys might want to start eating. But you wonêt be living here.
Penny,"Sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is really yours."
Sheldon,But thatês my room.
Amy,Thank you for understanding.
Sheldon,"Hey, I get it. Everybody wants to spend more time with me. Iêm like a man made of sugar in a world of ants."
Amy,Good night.
Sheldon,"Night. If we did continue living together, would it be here?"
Amy,"I donêt know. It, it could be. "
Sheldon,"Of course thereês, thereês always your apartment."
Amy,"Sure, sure, we, we could live in my apartment."
Sheldon,I hate your apartment.
Amy,"Sorry, you brought it up?"
Sheldon,"Well, I suppose we could find a whole new place. You know, and, technically, we donêt even have to stay in Pasadena. We could, we could move to Altadena or a place that doesnêt even end in dena."
Amy,Itês kind of exciting. I mean we could do whatever we want.
Sheldon,But what if we move and we donêt like it? What if thereês a smoker in the building? Or pets? Or there could be mould? There could be traffic noise. Iêm gonna have to learn a whole new bus route. Are you trying to soothe me by singing the Star Trek theme as a lullaby?
Sheldon,"Iêm not a child, donêt do that."
Sheldon,"Do you know 2001: A Space Odyssey? All right, now thatês soothing."
Leonard,"Look, I get it, this is still my room, we havenêt really made it yours."
Penny,Thank you.
Leonard,Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger. Put it anywhere you like.
Penny,"Okay, but you may feel some discomfort."
Leonard,"Iêm kidding, I want you to feel at home here. Decorate it any way that makes you happy."
Penny,Do you really mean that?
Leonard,I really do.
Penny,"Great, and just so you know, Iêm not getting rid of all your stuff."
Leonard,Yeah? What are you keeping?
Penny,That candle and you.
Leonard,What about my robot poster?
Penny,"Uhbubububuh, I can make do with just the candle."
Amy,Whatês going on?
Sheldon,Iêm struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom.
Amy,Can it be more of an internal struggle?
Sheldon,"I need to see it. While Iêm gone, donêt breathe on my pillow."
Amy,How about if I just donêt breathe at all?
Sheldon,Thatês my girl. What on earth? What is going on?
Leonard,"Oh, hey, Sheldon."
Penny,We turned your room into a sex dungeon.
Amy,What is happening?
Howard,"Okay, last question. The chaps he was wearing, assless?"
Sheldon,Can we just focus on the decision Iêm facing?
Raj,"We can, but for the record, all chaps are assless."
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, please, this is a significant decision. Now, do Amy and I continue living together? Or do I move back in with Leonard?"
Leonard,Over my assless chaps you will.
Howard,This isnêt complicated. Do you love Amy?
Raj,Do you like living with her?
Leonard,Do you know what you need to do now?
Sheldon,"Apparently, figure this out on my own êcause you guys are no help at all."
Amy,What are you doing?
Sheldon,Iêm just contemplating Buridanês donkey.
Amy,I understand. Iêll leave you be.
Sheldon,youêre familiar with the reference?
Amy,Of course. Jean Buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death.
Amy,"Well, I wouldnêt want you to starve to death, so hereês an eggplant."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Amy,"You know, some people believe that Buridan was plagiarizing Aristotle."
Amy,"Although, in Aristotleês example, he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink."
Sheldon,"Huh. Yeah, I wonder if thatês related to the 12th century Persian philosopher, Al-Ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates."
Amy,"Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali was Aristotelian? ‚Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian."
Sheldon,"Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian? Boy, you think you know a guy."
Penny,Okay. Open your eyes and see your new room.
Penny,I know I went a little overboard. We can always dial it back.
Leonard,"No, no, no, no, no, itês, itês important to me that you have the bedroom you want."
Penny,"Oh, that means so much. I love you."
Leonard,"I love you, too."
Leonard,"Just hiding some stuff in your closet, donêt tell Penny."
Sheldon,How much will it hurt?
Amy,Itês just a tiny skin sample. You saw me do it to myself.
Sheldon,"On a scale of one to ten, where one is a pebble in your shoe and ten is the monkey you thought was your pet biting your face off."
Amy,A two.
Sheldon,Eating a whole Altoid?
Amy,"Sheldon, if Iêm gonna synthesize a neural network from our skin cells, I need to harvest them. Now, Iêve done this dozens of times, but if youêre too scared you donêt have to."
Sheldon,"No, this is for science. I can be brave for science."
Amy,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Oh, jiminy, thatês cold."
Amy,Just think how happy youêll be in a few weeks when Iêve converted our skin cells into functional brain cells.
Sheldon,"All right, just warn me before you do it."
Amy,"Okay. Three, two, and weêre done."
Sheldon,You tricked me. You didnêt say one.
Amy,"It didnêt hurt, did it?"
Sheldon,"No, but three, two and weêre done is incomplete. You know those things bother me. Itês like hearing da-da-da-da-da-dah without yellingÑ"
Amy,"Okay, fine, one."
Sheldon,Thank you. Now yell charge and we can get out of here.
Raj,"Oh, my God, I just got it. Fun onions, Funyuns. Hold on. Is that a wobble? Yes. Thatês definitely a gravitational wobble."
Raj,"Oh, no, itês okay. I just found a wobble."
Raj,Itês a gravitational wobble. It could be a sign of an extrasolar planet that may contain life and someday be named after me.
Raj,"Yeah, but itês probably difficult to pronounce."
Raj,Good point. And you are?
Raj,"Oh, well, nice to meet you."
Raj,"Oh, please, show me a ten-year-old who knows to dip Tootsie Rolls in Nutella. "
Raj,"Oh, please, allow me. Thatês a lot of empty calories."
Raj,Youêre welcome.
Raj,Thank you. Good luck with your future endeavours.
Sheldon,Did it work? Are they brain cells yet?
Amy,"If youêd give me a minute, Iêll tell you."
Sheldon,"Oh, just let me look. Oh, my goodness. I see quivering black lines. Those must be neurons, oh, theyêre so thick and beautiful."
Amy,"Those are your eyelashes, move. Well, Sheldon, I see astrocytes. Our combined skin cells are now a primitive neural network."
Sheldon,"I have such a profound sense of creation. I, itês like when I hatched sea monkeys, except that this is from my DNA, so this is like me monkeys. "
Amy,These cells come from both of us.
Sheldon,"Yeah, but us monkeys doesnêt pop. Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, we monkeys, there you go. Hey, when can we start running tests on it?"
Amy,No reason we canêt start right now.
Sheldon,"What stimulus should we introduce it to first? Light, sound, temperature, oh, oh, letês"
Amy,"Sheldon, this is a rudimentary collection of neurons. I mean, itês remarkable, but itês still limited in what it can do."
Sheldon,"I understand. Sheês the mean one, Iêm the fun one."
Howard,"Huh, they screwed up and gave us steamed broccoli."
Raj,"Oh, no, thatês mine."
Leonard,Really? The last green thing I saw you eat was a Skittle.
Raj,"Well, I canêt eat like a ten-year-old all the time."
Penny,"Youêre dating somebody, who is it?"
Raj,What are you talking about?
Penny,You only watch what you eat when youêre afraid you might have to take your shirt off.
Howard,"No, sheês right. As long as Iêve known you, youêve always been self-conscious about your cleavage."
Raj,Thatês because you keep trying to stick pencils in it.
Penny,"All right, fine, donêt tell us."
Raj,Thereês nothing to tell.
Penny,All right.
Leonard,Howês that broccoli?
Raj,Itês gross but I have to eat it because I met somebody.
Penny,Bam. Thank you. Whatês her name?
Raj,Isabella. 
Howard,"Oh, did you meet her at work?"
Raj,"Yes, in the telescope room."
Leonard,"Oh, so sheês an astronomer?"
Raj,"Yes, which is why she was in the telescope room. Yes, this is all making sense. Good."
Penny,"Well, thatês great, Raj. You must have so much in common."
Howard,"So, when do we meet her?"
Raj,"No, no, this is brand new. We havenêt even been on a proper date yet."
Leonard,"Okay, well, good luck with it."
Raj,Thank you.
Penny,How come you never eat broccoli?
Leonard,"Iêm married, I donêt have to be attractive."
Amy,"You know, most people donêt realize this technique has actually been around for a few years."
Bernadette,"Still, I canêt believe you can turn ordinary skin cells into functioning brain cells."
Amy,"Well, I turned this one into a functioning boyfriend, so skyês the limit."
Sheldon,"Look, look, here I am standing next to the incubator. Uh, here is a microscopic view of the cells."
Bernadette,"Look at that, put them in a tiny Flash T-shirt and itês you."
Sheldon,"Aw. Yeah, this little guy can already recognize electronically transmitted images 20% faster than any other sample in Amyês lab."
Bernadette,Iêm running out of ways to act excited.
Amy,"So, enough about us, how are things going with you?"
Bernadette,"Great, the doctor said the babyês head is facing down now."
Amy,"Good, you know, in case the exit isnêt clearly marked."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I have to say, it is nice to share this experience with someone whoês on the same journey. Although right now ours is testing off the charts while yours is floating around in its own waste."
Bernadette,Are you actually comparing my human baby to your brain in a bowl?
Sheldon,"Well, I didnêt make you waddle up four flights of stairs for the heck of it."
Bernadette,You do realize my baby has functioning organs and can recognize voices.
Sheldon,"Yeah, but ours can recognize a specific data stream among background noise."
Bernadette,Mine has a fully developed immune system.
Sheldon,Ours doesnêt need an immune system because it lives in a state-of-the-art German incubator.
Amy,"Sheldon, thatês enough."
Sheldon,"Okay, fine. Letês just agree that both creations are special in their own way and it is foolish to try and compare them. Although, we didnêt need to have sex with Howard for ours, so we win."
Raj,This is fun. I have never cleaned a toilet before.
Raj,"No, I grew up with a house full of servants and now I have a cleaning lady who is a lovely woman who I have great respect for."
Raj,"Oh, good, because she also walks my dog, buys my groceries and cuts my hair."
Raj,"Uh, so forgive me, forgive me for being nosy, but is, is there a wedding ring under those pretty rubber gloves?"
Raj,"Oh, so, you are unencumbered?"
Raj,"I love kids, how old is he?"
Raj,Thatês a cute age. They can do so many things.
Raj,"Thatês wonderful. A lawyer, my sisterês a lawyer. Look at that, we have something in common."
Raj,"Maybe there are other things we have in common. Come dinnertime, do you enjoy eating food?"
Raj,"Yeah, sure. I understand. Yeah, Iêm very busy, too."
Raj,I think youêre very nice as well.
Raj,"Oh, yes. Oh, okay. Uh, Good night. I donêt know, maybe itês the fumes from the urinal cakes, but I feel like something is happening between us."
Raj,"Okay. Iêll leave. But just know, every time I come in here, Iêll be thinking of you."
Sheldon,"Would you look at that? The image we gave it was 45% white noise, and it still managed to reconstruct it."
Amy,Iêve never seen results like this before.
Sheldon,"Yeah, we need to stop for magnets on the way home, this is going right on the fridge."
Amy,Arenêt you glad you participated in this?
Sheldon,"Oh, I am. And you realize what the next step is?"
Amy,Set up a second culture and try to replicate our results.
Sheldon,"Uh, no. We lock that door, lower our underpants a little and make a baby."
Amy,Make a baby? What are you talking about?
Sheldon,Clearly the combination of our DNA is exceptional. Our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind. Weêll be able to get into any preschool we want!
Amy,"Sheldon, Iêm not ready to have a baby."
Sheldon,"Oh, yes, you are. I track your cycle. For the next 36 hours youêre as fertile as a manure-covered wheat field."
Amy,"Wow. I, I can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up."
Sheldon,I donêt understand. I thought youêd be thrilled to procreate with me.
Amy,Not right now.
Sheldon,"Oh, I see whatês happening here. Youêre playing hard to get."
Amy,Iêm not playing anything. Weêre not making a baby today.
Sheldon,"Very well. Oops, how clumsy of me. You know what? Let me get that. Hey. Where are you going? I, did you even look at my bottom?"
Raj,"Oh, well, you said you didnêt have time to go out for dinner, so I thought we could have one right here."
Raj,"Oh, come on, weêre in the telescope room. Itêll be like dining under the stars. You see this, uh, double zero? When it says zero one that means itês twinkling. Sometimes it takes a while."
Raj,Thatês why I already cleaned up in here and all the other rooms in the hall.
Raj,"Oh, please sit. I tried to cook you a meal from your homeland."
Raj,"That depends, do they have Mexican food in Cuba?"
Penny,"Now, when he said make a baby, is it possible he meant out of Legos?"
Amy,He was explicit. Needlessly and freakishly explicit.
Leonard,Why does he need a baby? Heês already hairless and smells like talcum powder.
Penny,Could you two really have some sort of super-intelligent child?
Amy,"Well, there is a genetic component, but that doesnêt guarantee anything."
Leonard,Thatês true. Sheldonês father once picked a fight with a cactus.
Penny,"Yeah, but thatês just his Earth parents. We donêt know anything about the ones that sent him here."
Leonard,"Well, we know they were smart enough to send him away."
Amy,"Hey, youêre talking about the person I love and have been avoiding for the past three hours. Oh, man. "
Penny,"Ooh, Sheldon gonna get some."
Leonard,"Well, have fun with whatever nightmareês behind door number two."
Sheldon,"Well, hello."
Sheldon,Would you care for a brandy?
Amy,I donêt think so.
Sheldon,"Good choice, itês disgusting."
Amy,"Sheldon, please stop trying to seduce me."
Sheldon,Whoês trying to seduce you? After a long day I always turn on smooth jazz and spray deer musk on my inner thighs.
Amy,I thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here.
Sheldon,Anything youêd like to pet? Not my hair. Thereês a lot of goop in it.
Amy,"Okay, Iêve had enough."
Sheldon,"Amy, come back. I donêt know how to open the oysters."
Raj,"So, um, what surprised you the most when you first came to America?"
Raj,"I thought that, too. But then I got my first waffle maker and never questioned her again."
Howard,"Hey! I saw your carÑ Oh, sorry. Am I interrupting?"
Howard,Hi. Howard Wolowitz.
Howard,"Oh, yeah, the astronomer. Raj told us about you. Hey, free toilet paper."
Raj,Uh. 
Raj,"No, p-please donêt."
Howard,"I can keep this, right?"
Raj,"Isabella. Isabella wait, wait, let me explain."
Raj,"Iêm sorry. Honestly, I didnêt think your job would bother me, but I guess it did. And I hate myself for that. But thereês a lot of things about me that would totally embarrass you."
Raj,"Well, prepare to be mortified. I let my dog eat food out of my mouth, not because she likes it but because I do. Also, I know theyêre pretty, but Iêm scared of butterflies."
Howard,"Sorry, just passing through. I think this fell off your cart."
Raj,Come on. What do you say? Let me make it up to you.
Raj,Itês my one move.
Raj,Great. Where would you like to go?
Raj,"Excuse me, but Iêm Indian."
Penny,"So, were you turned on even a little bit?"
Amy,It was like being hit on by Rat Pack Pee-wee Herman.
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, is that a yes?"
Sheldon,"Amy, I didnêt want it to come to this, but you have left me no choice but to employ the most passionate, seductive dance known to man. The flamenco."
Amy,"For Godês sake, youêre ridiculous."
Sheldon,"You guys are aroused, right?"
Amy,That was a close one.
Leonard,That is unbelievable. Good for Bert.
Howard,"Damn, the MacArthur Genius Grant."
Raj,Couldnêt have happened to a nicer guy.
Sheldon,Everything is stupid and I want to go home.
Leonard,"Thatês Sheldonês way of saying heês proud of Bert, too."
Sheldon,"Hey, itês not even called the Genius Grant, itês the MacArthur Fellowship. Just like itês not Frankenstein, itês Frankensteinês Monster. Which brings us back to that hulking simpleton over there. And if anyoneês a genius, itês me for the way I brought that full circle."
Leonard,How much money did he win?
Raj,Over half a million dollars.
Howard,"And he doesnêt have to use it for research, he can do whatever he wants with it."
Sheldon,"Oh, good, maybe he can build a nicer bridge to live under."
Howard,Here he comes.
Leonard,Right. Be polite.
Sheldon,I know how to behave.
Howard,Do you?
Raj,"Hey, congratulations Bert."
Leonard,"Yeah, good for you."
Howard,Thatês amazing.
Sheldon,"Someone call George R. R. Martin, this guy knows how to finish a story."
Sheldon,"Some genius. I zinged him with sarcasm, he didnêt even notice."
Leonard,"I know, and it was the greatest sarcastic quip Iêve ever heard."
Sheldon,"Well, arenêt you a peach."
Sheldon,"Who leaves their bike in the hallway? You know, if I knew how to ride one, Iêd steal it."
Leonard,"Ignore him, heês just cranky because Bert from the geology lab won a big grant."
Penny,"Oh, I heard him interviewed on the radio. You know, when they told him he won, he didnêt believe it, but then he did believe it. It was so funny."
Sheldon,Who listens to the radio any more?
Amy,Bert is studying the way microbes in rocks can survive in extreme environmental conditions.
Leonard,They say it could be a potential indicator of life on other planets.
Penny,"You know what, Iêve met Bert. Isnêt he an indicator of life on other planets?"
Sheldon,"You used to make those jokes about me. Now everything is Bert, Bert, Bert."
Amy,"You know, Sheldon, maybe if you take the time to actually read Bertês research, youêd be less bitter about him winning."
Sheldon,You want me to read a geology paper?
Amy,"Honestly, I just want you to be quiet but Iêm all out of taffy."
Howard,You busy? Thereês somebody out here who wants to meet you.
Bernadette,Who is it?
Howard,"Say hello to everybodyês little friend, remote control Stephen Hawking."
Bernadette,Where did you get that?
Howard,I found him in an old box.
Bernadette,Why would you buy it?
Howard,I didnêt buy it. I made it.
Bernadette,Last question. What is wrong with you?
Howard,Whatês the big deal?
Bernadette,"Howie, itês in poor taste."
Howard,"No, itês not. Check it out, he says fun stuff."
Howard,His eyes also light up in the dark.
Leonard,Itês always fun watching him read someone elseês work.
Penny,Itês like scrolling through the emojis on my phone.
Sheldon,"Yeh, why? Eh, why? Oh, thatês why."
Amy,Sounds like the night we had coitus.
Sheldon,"I hope youêre happy making me read this. Bertês work is remarkable, and Iêm more upset than ever. This is worse than when I had to admit that Cedric the Entertainerês actually entertaining."
Amy,"Sheldon, itês foolish to be angry that Bertês work has merit."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well I am angry. And you telling me not to be angry makes me angry. And do you know how hearing myself say the word angry over and over makes me feel?"
Penny,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, angry?"
Leonard,What are you doing?
Penny,"I, I knew the answer. I got excited."
Leonard,"Hey, buddy, why donêt we go for a walk, so you can calm down."
Sheldon,Thatês a good idea. I guess everyoneês having them now.
Leonard,"Hey, Iêm trying to help you."
Sheldon,Fine. You can walk ahead of me and scare off the pigeons.
Leonard,"You just wave your arms a little and they fly away, itês notÑ"
Howard,"Okay, Raj, Iêm gonna show you something. Now, one of us thinks itês offensive, the other thinks itês hilarious and a great idea. But, Iêm not going to tell you who likes it."
Raj,"This is tough, but Iêm going to say itês the guy who shows me YouTube videos of people getting hit in the nuts."
Howard,"Youêre crazy. Iêve worked with Hawking. Heês got a great sense of humour, and I think heêd like it."
Bernadette,"Okay, call him and show him. I dare you."
Howard,I have no problem calling him.
Bernadette,"Fine, then do it."
Howard,"Fine, I will."
Bernadette,"While youêre bothering the worldês most famous scientist, be sure to show him how funny he looks getting stuck under our dishwasher."
Raj,Whatês this button do?
Howard,You laughed when that guy got hit in the nuts.
Raj,I laughed because the guy was Leonard.
Sheldon,"I admire you, Leonard."
Leonard,"Really, why?"
Sheldon,"Youêre happy with who you are. You donêt get jealous of other people. Instead of being weighed down by ambition, you just float along like a dead body in a river."
Leonard,"I couldnêt just take the compliment. I had to ask why. You know, I do understand what youêre feeling. My brother and sisterês accomplishments have always been held over my head."
Sheldon,How did you deal with it?
Leonard,"I wet the bed until college, but I donêt think thatês a quality fix."
Sheldon,"I canêt believe I was surpassed by a geologist. I mean, rocks. He studies rocks. If rock is so great, how come paper beats it? Leonard, Iêm having a primal urge to throw this rock."
Leonard,"Do it. Visualize it as your anger and, and toss it out of your life."
Sheldon,Perhaps I will. This rock encapsulates all my negative emotions. I will cast you far away. Feel free to take out a pigeon while youêre at it.
Leonard,Let it fly.
Sheldon,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, owÑ"
Amy,What happened?
Sheldon,I tried to let go of anger and threw a rock into my foot.
Leonard,Then he got more angry and kicked the rock with his other foot.
Penny,"Well, and what happened to you?"
Leonard,"Oh, I laughed so hard, I burst a blood vessel in my nose. Itês fine."
Amy,"You know, itês one thing to be envious, but now youêre injuring yourself. It has to stop."
Leonard,"Although if you are gonna do it again, please let me know, so I can get it on video."
Amy,"You know, Sheldon, instead of fixating on what Bert has, you should appreciate all of the good things in your life. Youêve got love, youêre in good health, youêve got a roof over your head."
Sheldon,"Yeah, but youêve got all those things, and no oneês lining up to be you."
Amy,Anybody else want to try? Iêm gonna go make some more tea and question my life choices.
Leonard,Youêre up.
Penny,"This is getting old fast, Dolores, knock it off."
Sheldon,"Uh, do you really think calling me names is helpful?"
Penny,"I do, your life is fine you big baby. "
Sheldon,Maybe youêre right.
Leonard,"If it helps, Iêm questioning your life choices, too."
Sheldon,"Thank you, Penny. You know, I just need to keep reminding myself that Bertês success is not my failure."
Penny,There you go.
Sheldon,And that men of his large stature are more susceptible to a wide array of life-threatening diseases.
Penny,There you go.
Amy,Whatês up?
Howard,Iêm conducting a quick survey. Do you think this respectful and loving tribute to a great man is in poor taste?
Howard,Do you think this is in poor taste?
Leonard,Does it spin around and do tricks?
Leonard,Then yeah.
Howard,What do you think?
Howard,"All right, weêre done. Itês offensive."
Sheldon,"Top of the afternoon, gentlemen."
Howard,Youêre in a good mood.
Sheldon,"Well, itês a new day. I have a new outlook. You know, I realized I donêt need to worry about other people. I just need to think more about myself."
Leonard,"Oh, how will we ever get used to the new you?"
Raj,"Well, Iêm glad to see you moving forward."
Sheldon,"Bert did quality research, and he deserves whatever accolades he receives."
Howard,What is going on? Did you upgrade his software last night?
Leonard,I think he might be learning on his own.
Raj,Then the robot uprising has begun.
Sheldon,"Excuse me, I need to pay Bert a proper congratulations."
Raj,"He doesnêt just look like C-3PO, now he walks like him."
Sheldon,"Bert? I wanted to let you know that I read your research, and your award is well-deserved."
Sheldon,"Well, just this once, you can count me as people, too."
Sheldon,Really? I didnêt know that.
Sheldon,"You know, Iêm not sure. You know, youêd have to ask him. Excuse me.  Aah. Leonard, I hurt myself again."
Leonard,"Excuse me, I have to go take some pictures."
Amy,I canêt believe you head-butted a water fountain.
Sheldon,"No, I went to punch the water fountain, slipped in water in front of the water fountain, and hit my head on the water fountain."
Bernadette,I canêt imagine you being violent.
Leonard,"Itês not hard. Just picture the Three Stooges, and then take away two stooges."
Sheldon,Iêm so disappointed in myself. Jealousy is completely illogical.
Raj,"Itês a human emotion, Sheldon. Everyone gets jealous. Iêm jealous of Leonard and Penny and Howard and Bernadette for being in such happy relationships."
Amy,What about me and Sheldon?
Leonard,Iêve always been jealous of how much money Rajês family has.
Raj,"Thank you for saying that. Next to buying things, that is the best part about having money."
Amy,"Ever since I met Penny, Iêve been envious of her looks."
Penny,"Aw, thank you."
Amy,Thatês why I was so happy when you cut your hair off.
Amy,"You know what I mean. You were still hot, but more like a whyêd that hot girl cut off all her hair, hot."
Penny,"You liked my short hair, right?"
Leonard,"Yeah. I loved it. Love you, love the hair, would love to change the subject."
Penny,"Seriously, none of you liked it?"
Bernadette,I thought it was brave. Does that count as liking it?
Penny,"You know, how come nobodyês talking about Howardês dopey haircut?"
Bernadette,I think he looks cute.
Howard,And I think youêre cute.
Raj,I think youêre both cute.
Penny,I think I hate all of you nerds.
Sheldon,Sorry Iêm moving slowly.
Leonard,"Oh, I donêt mind. If you pull a butterscotch out of your pocket, it would be like Iêm walking with my grandma."
Sheldon,"Oh, no. A plaque? Nobody wants to see this."
Leonard,"Well, change plaque to mixed-race couple and you are my grandma."
Sheldon,I canêt take this any more.  Bert. 
Sheldon,"All right, letês do this, Bert? We need to talk."
Sheldon,"Rock, rock, water fountain. I am not proud of this, but I have been envious of your recent success."
Sheldon,"I was hoping by admitting my weakness to you, Iêd somehow be unburdened."
Sheldon,"Now that you know my weakness, I hate you more than ever."
Sheldon,"We, hang on, youêre my enemy. Now, the enemy of the enemy is my friend. And right now, Iêm my own worst enemy. That makes you my friend. Okay, Iêm good to go."
Sheldon,You know what? This isnêt gonna work.
Sheldon,"Yes, thatês right. I have Amy. In the past, youêve professed feelings for her. Does it eat you up inside that I have her and you donêt?"
Penny,I canêt believe you punched Bert.
Sheldon,"I didnêt punch him. He turned around, and I gave him a Captain Kirk karate chop. Iêm not even sure he knows I did it."
Leonard,"Hey, Sheldon, Iêve got someone here who might make you feel better."
Sheldon,Professor Hawking.
Sheldon,"Thanks, Leonard, now heês not gonna think Iêm cool."
Penny,"Oh, wow, that doesnêt seem fair."
Sheldon,How do you deal with the success of your colleagues?
Leonard,"Oh, it was a good one. He played poker with Sir Isaac, you donêt care."
Amy,How can you feel bad if Stephen Hawking says youêre brilliant?
Sheldon,"I canêt. Thank you, Professor Hawking. You are a gift to mankind. There should be statues of you everywhere. You know, the Lincoln Memorial has a big chair. We could swap you right in."
Sheldon,"What a wonderful idea, how does this man not have a Nobel?"
Leonard,Do not tell Wolowitz.
Amy,Way ahead of you.
Sheldon,Do people know about her? ‚Cause sheês delightful.
Amy,"If weêre going to be staying in this apartment, would you be interested in doing a little redecorating?"
Sheldon,"Oh, actually, I would."
Amy,"Great, whatêd you have in mind?"
Sheldon,Letês take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here.
Amy,"Well, how about we start a little smaller? Like moving the furniture around."
Sheldon,"You know, I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building."
Amy,"Look, we canêt just throw away Pennyês stuff, but we can ask if she wants any of it back."
Sheldon,"You know, I wonder how she feels about all this artwork."
Amy,"Well, Iêm sure she misses this one. I mean, itês the greatest gift Iêve ever given anybody."
Sheldon,It truly does capture the beauty of your friendship with Penny.
Amy,It may have appreciated in value. The artist killed himself shortly after painting that.
Sheldon,"Yeah, it seems only right that she have it back."
Amy,I canêt wait to see the look on her face when I give it to her again.
Sheldon,"Look, itês the same smile she has in the painting."
Sheldon,"Yeah, thereês hooks in the closet, I can hang it right now."
Penny,"Oh, no, no, those hooks are gone."
Sheldon,What happened to them?
Penny,"Uh, we ran out of candy on Halloween, I was just giving everything away."
Leonard,"Hey, guys, what are you, oh, thatês here, cool."
Penny,Amy wants me to have it.
Amy,"Well, it would be selfish of me to keep it."
Penny,But itês a picture of you.
Amy,And you.
Penny,But you commissioned it.
Amy,To give to you.
Penny,But you like it so much.
Amy,So do you.
Penny,I seem to be losing.
Leonard,"Yes, you do."
Sheldon,"You know, Leonard, the more I think about it, there are a number of mutually owned items in this apartment that you and I should go through. Uh, for example, who gets our beloved sword, Longclaw?"
Penny,Why donêt you keep it?
Sheldon,"That seems fair, we did just give you the painting."
Penny,"Yeah, I donêt need anything around that I can stab myself with."
Sheldon,"Wonderful, Longclaw is mine. And how about you keep our avocado plant?"
Leonard,"Sounds right, a limited edition collectible worth hundreds of dollars and a thing that grew out of a thing we fished from the trash."
Sheldon,"Although, Amy and I did just move in together, and a plant is a lovely housewarming gift."
Leonard,"Fine, take the plant."
Sheldon,"Oh, we got a sword and a plant, our apartmentês really shaping up."
Bernadette,"Stuart, you didnêt have to get us a baby gift."
Bernadette,A foot massage?
Howard,"This is very nice Stuart, thank you."
Bernadette,How come this oneês on the back of an eviction notice?
Bernadette,"Stuart, weêd love to help you out, but this a bad time, weêre about to have a baby."
Bernadette,"Thank you, but Iêm not really sure."
Howard,"Hang on, maybe itês not the worst idea. I mean, he did do a good job taking care of my mother."
Bernadette,I guess you could stay for a few days and weêll see how it goes.
Howard,When would you move in?
Bernadette,Hmm. Actually I just did that this morning.
Bernadette,"I did that, too."
Bernadette,Howard just did that.
Howard,"Yeah, let him do it."
Sheldon,Oh. Remember when we got this at Comic-Con?
Leonard,"Oh, yeah. The Mr. Spock cuckoo clock."
Sheldon,Itês one of a kind.
Penny,So if it breaks thereêd be none of it?
Sheldon,"Well, Leonard, you know, who should keep this? On the one hand, I love Mr. Spock more than you do. On the other hand, I care more about clocks than you do."
Leonard,So you think you should keep it?
Sheldon,Iêll be right across the hall. Youêll probably be able to hear it.
Leonard,"Keep the clock, Sheldon."
Sheldon,Thank you.
Penny,Thank you.
Amy,Thank you?
Sheldon,"Oh, now, what about our 3-D chess set?"
Leonard,"Let me guess, you want it."
Sheldon,"Well, no, I just didnêt think youêd want a physical reminder of a game you never managed to win. As a kindness, I should probably take all the games."
Leonard,"You know what, Sheldon, take it. In fact, you can have everything, I really donêt care."
Sheldon,Are you sure? These items represent our shared times together.
Leonard,"Well, now theyêre yours."
Leonard,"Well, you know whatês gonna happen, heês just gonna come up with some reason why everything should be his."
Sheldon,"For a man so good at predicting my moves, how come you stink at 3-D chess?"
Amy,"Sheldon, youêre, youêre being a little selfish. Why donêt you let Leonard keep a few things?"
Sheldon,"Itês not my fault Iêm bad at sharing, I skipped kindergarten."
Leonard,You know what? There is one thing I would like.
Sheldon,"Yeah, take whatever you want."
Leonard,I would like to keep the official flag of our apartment.
Sheldon,But you donêt even like flags.
Leonard,"Yeah, I like this one."
Sheldon,But I designed it.
Leonard,But you made me order it because you were too well-known in the flag community and theyêd jack up the price.
Sheldon,But you donêt even understand its symbolism.
Leonard,"Oh, I do. The, the field of blue represents you being miserable, and the lion sticking its tongue out means Iêm happy about it."
Sheldon,"Come along, Amy. I know when Iêm not wanted."
Amy,"I donêt think you do, but all right."
Bernadette,"Stuart, you cooked?"
Howard,How did you know it wasnêt me?
Bernadette,"Thereês only three people in this house, and youêd still be my fifth guess."
Howard,Thatês Raj.
Howard,Itês like we have a butler. If I had a Batsuit Iêd be Bruce Wayne.
Bernadette,You have a Batsuit.
Howard,"Itês pajamas, thereês no cape."
Raj,"Hey, Stuart. What are you doing here?"
Raj,"Do, uh, Howard and Bernadette know? Or is it like a possum in the walls kind of thing?"
Raj,"Okay, cool."
Raj,"Oh, but I bought Chinese takeout."
Leonard,Is the Wi-Fi working for you?
Penny,"Uh, hang on. I donêt think so, Iêm clicking on one weird trick for a flat belly, but Iêm still seeing celebrities who look like their pets."
Leonard,"Oh, I knew it, Sheldon changed the password."
Penny,Are you sure?
Leonard,"Well, the new network name is ha ha ha, now Iêve got you, so itês either Sheldon or Gargamel from The Smurfs."
Penny,What a jerk.
Leonard,"Youêre good at revenge, how do we get him back?"
Penny,"Well, my go-to move is usually sleep with the personês boyfriend, but I kind of feel like Iêm already doing that."
Leonard,"Sheldon, I know what you did, now change the password back."
Sheldon,"Well, powder me in sugar and call me a doughnut, if it isnêt Leonard Hofstadter."
Leonard,"Sheldon, Iêm warning you, I can play this game, too."
Sheldon,"If itês like your 3-D chess game, then youêre out of your length, width and depth. Amy, get the Neosporin, somebody just got burned."
Leonard,"All right, I tried."
Sheldon,"All right, I tried. That should be the title of your autobiography. Ooh, a second-degree burn."
Amy,Iêve got the Neosporin. Who got hurt?
Sheldon,Itês a good thing youêre cute.
Raj,"So, I was reading how itês a good idea for new parents to take an infant CPR class."
Bernadette,"Yeah, weêve been meaning to do that."
Howard,Thatêd be great.
Bernadette,Thank you again for cooking. Itês getting tough for me to be on my feet all day.
Raj,Although it was already under control.
Raj,Itês just that theyêve had plenty of help.
Raj,"Well, they already had a village."
Raj,"Yeah, well, maybe the village was too busy checking out the local Montessori school for the new arrival."
Bernadette,"Do something, Batman."
Sheldon,What do you think youêre doing?
Leonard,Separating my delicates.
Sheldon,This is the level youêre stooping to.
Leonard,"This is the level I am stooping to. I believe that is flag to crotch four, checkmate. Easy-peasy, ooh, so breezy."
Raj,Iêm here to put the crib together.
Raj,"Well I donêt know if you realize this, but I bought that crib."
Raj,Why are you being like this?
Raj,"Hey, this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy third wheel way before you came along."
Raj,"Is this what you do when Iêm not here, make really good points?"
Raj,Thank you.
Penny,"I think Iêm gonna go for a run, you want to come?"
Leonard,"No, last time that old lady in the park kept screaming, watch out, heês right behind you. Hello?"
Leonard,"Uh, can I help you?"
Penny,what are you doing in our apartment?
Leonard,"Unbelievable. Okay, uh, I donêt know what he told you, but you canêt stay here."
Sheldon,"So, there are fresh linens on the bed and, oh, well, now, I see youêve met Theodore. Theodore, these are your new room mates, Leonard and Penny. Theyêre very honest, but I would not leave cash lying around."
Leonard,"Sheldon, what do you think youêre doing? "
Sheldon,"My room is paid up until the end of the month, so I can do with it whatever I please, which includes renting it out for a dollar a night."
Sheldon,"Anyway, Iêll leave you be. I have to, oh, oh, heês expecting a newspaper in the morning. Apparently, they still make them."
Penny,"All right, Sheldon, this is over the line."
Sheldon,"Thatês true, but had I done something under the line, there wouldnêt be a man in your kitchen who canêt produce a single form of ID."
Sheldon,And now you know as much about him as I do.
Raj,"Oh, hey, Bernadette, the swing comes with two different mobiles. The giraffes are pretty cute, what do you think?"
Bernadette,"Great, go with the giraffes."
Bernadette,"Yeah, youêre probably right, go with the zebras."
Raj,At least my nose is naturally brown.
Bernadette,"Hey, could you please go to the market for me?"
Howard,Get Stuart or Raj to do it.
Bernadette,"Howie, theyêve been doing everything for you."
Howard,"Mm, I know. Itês really making me lose respect for both of them."
Bernadette,Please just go to the store.
Howard,Fine. Who wants to drive me to the store?
Bernadette,Take Raj. Stuart is supposed to paint my toenails.
Penny,What do you think? Should we go to a hotel?
Leonard,And just leave him here alone?
Penny,"Okay, Iêll go to a hotel. Text me in the morning if youêre still alive."
Leonard,"Uh, Theodore, how long are you planning to stay exactly?"
Leonard,This is ridiculous.
Leonard,"Sheldon, get out here."
Sheldon,Will you keep it down? What kind of vengeful bed and breakfast do you think Iêm running?
Leonard,We lived together 13 years. How can you be so awful to me?
Sheldon,Iêm being awful? Youêre the one who went out of your way to hurt me.
Leonard,Because you were being selfish.
Sheldon,Dividing our belongings is difficult.
Leonard,Why? I said I didnêt care.
Leonard,"Yeah, thanks, but nobody asked you."
Amy,"I think he might be right. Also, who is that?"
Sheldon,"I have to admit, leaving you to move in with Amy has been harder than I thought it would be."
Leonard,"Well, for me, too. Itês not the same with you gone."
Penny,"Weêre good, thank you."
Amy,"So, no oneês gonna tell me? Okay."
Sheldon,"Leonard, I would like us to stop fighting about our possessions."
Leonard,"Well, Iêd like that, too. "
Sheldon,"In fact, I want you to keep the apartment flag, and Iêm not just saying that because it touched your genitals."
Leonard,You promise?
Sheldon,"I do. And to show you that there are no hard feelings, I am willing to rub my genitals on it as well."
Penny,Little lower to the left. A little more.
Penny,"No, still hideous."
Leonard,"Well, Iêm sure at some point, we wonêt even notice itês there."
Penny,"Yeah, youêd think that, but after a while it starts showing up in your dreams."
Howard,"Hey, tomorrow who wants to paint the nursery?"
Raj,Iêll do it.
Raj,Just because youêre starving doesnêt make you an artist.
Howard,"Guys, you heard her, go see what she wants."
Bernadette,I think Iêm in labour.
Howard,"Oh, oh, okay, okay, uh, uh, uh, I can do this. We have a plan. Somebody please tell me the plan."
Raj,Iêll pull the van up.
Raj,"Team Baby, go."
Howard,I love you.
Bernadette,"I love you, too."
Howard,"Oh, man, this is really happening. You doinê okay?"
Bernadette,Here comes another contraction.
Raj,"All right, hold on. Iêm gonna drive like we do in India. Get out of my way, you syphilitic dogs."
Howard,"Stop that, this isnêt India."
Raj,Fine. What do one point three billion people know about having babies?
Howard,Sorry. I know you were just trying to help. I love you.
Raj,"I love you, too. Weêre good."
Sheldon,Amy? Wake up.
Amy,Whatês wrong?
Sheldon,Itês midnight. Happy birthday.
Amy,"Sheldon. Okay, you can have this back in the morning."
Sheldon,"This is for you. I was going to wrap it, but touching Scotch tape gives me the heebie-jeebies."
Amy,Iêll put in on the list with peaches and felt. What is this?
Sheldon,A functional MRI of my brain. I did Sudoku before they took it so Iêd be ripped.
Amy,I love it. Thank you.
Sheldon,And itês not just an MRI. The orbitofrontal cortex is lit up because I was thinking of you.
Sheldon,We seem to be moving on to the annual coitus portion of your birthday festivities. 
Amy,Is that okay?
Sheldon,I didnêt put on my come-hither plaid PJês for nothing.
Amy,"You hate Scotch tape, but you love Scotch plaid. You are a mystery."
Penny,"Guys, wake up. Bernadetteês having her baby."
Leonard,"Come on, weêre going to the hospital."
Amy,"I guess, I guess we should stop."
Sheldon,"Yeah. Iêm afraid so. Childbirth, looming coitus? This is a banner night for female genitals."
Howard,Iêm the father.
Howard,No idea. Ask him.
Raj,12 minutes.
Bernadette,Iêm sorry. Itês our first time.
Howard,"No, weêre keeping it a surprise."
Bernadette,Not that old school. He knows.
Raj,"You see, I was at the doctorês office, the folder was right there, so I took a peek."
Howard,And talking like this doesnêt make it less creepy.
Raj,"Iêm sorry, thatês ambiguous. Is it five minutes apart starting at the top of the hour, or five minutes apart starting with the first contraction, so essentially, like, 65 minutes?"
Penny,"Sheldon, what took you so long?"
Sheldon,Wolowitz might hand out cigars. I had to find my bubble gum cigar so I could join in without looking foolish.
Leonard,"Damn, I need my inhaler."
Amy,Just donêt smoke.
Leonard,"No, I went down the stairs too fast."
Raj,Donêt come to the hospital. Weêre headed home.
Penny,"Oh, that was fast. Did she sneeze the baby out?"
Bernadette,We showed up too early. Weêll keep you posted.
Penny,"Okay, well, weêll talk to you guys later. Bye. She said not to come. Itês gonna be a while."
Amy,"Well, first deliveries can be slow."
Sheldon,Iêm starting to rethink the Flash onesie I bought this kid.
Leonard,"I found it, but itês empty."
Penny,"Well, it doesnêt matter. Weêre not going to the hospital now."
Leonard,Are you sure? Iêd really like to.
Amy,"Well, should we, uh, head back up?"
Penny,"Well while weêre all awake, why donêt we go to a diner or something?"
Amy,"Oh, uh, I donêt know. Sheldon, you donêt want to do that, do you?"
Sheldon,"It doesnêt matter what I want. Itês your birthday, you decide."
Penny,"Oh, my God. Itês your birthday. Letês do something fun."
Penny,We could go to a bar.
Leonard,"Okay, I can breathe again. Babe, they want to have sex."
Penny,"Oh, of course. The annual birthday booty spectacular!"
Sheldon,"Thatês a bit childish, isnêt it? "
Penny,"Iêm sorry, and what flavour is your bubble gum cigar?"
Sheldon,Grape. I find it the most mild.
Penny,"All right, well, you two go have fun."
Leonard,"If we find my backup inhaler, maybe we can get frisky."
Penny,"Oh, you sexy, wheezy little man."
Bernadette,Do you really need to record this?
Raj,"Youêll be happy I did. Okay, little one, here we are back at home because you werenêt quite ready to come out yet. You wanted to make an entrance. I get it. And hereês your daddy. When he tries to tell you he used to be cool, you can see he wasnêt."
Howard,"All right, enough with the camera."
Raj,"Well, this is not for me, this is for the baby. Some day sheês gonna want to see this."
Howard,"Iêm sorry, whoês gonna want to see this?"
Raj,"I, I said she, but lotês of things are she, boats and cars, whales, like thar she blows!"
Raj,"Well, okay, Iêm gonna sign off now. This next part may contain some adult language."
Bernadette,How could you?
Howard,"We made it this far without knowing, and youêve ruined it."
Raj,"Well, you guys have no idea how hard it is to know something like this and not say it."
Raj,You were supposed to keep that to yourself.
Amy,"So, where were we?"
Sheldon,"Well, I believe we were kissing like randy teenagers, and your nose was whistling ever so slightly."
Amy,Iêm sorry.
Sheldon,"Oh, donêt be. You were like a foxy tea kettle."
Amy,"Well, shall we start over?"
Sheldon,Very well.
Amy,Whatês wrong?
Sheldon,"Iêm not sure. Earlier tonight, things began organically, and now itês feeling forced, like all the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels."
Amy,"Okay, that makes sense. I mean, the moodês a little different now. We, we donêt have to rush."
Sheldon,"Oh, I know, but just, Leonard and Penny think weêre doing it, and I donêt want to disappoint them."
Amy,And the mood continues to change.
Sheldon,"No, and also, I donêt want to disappoint you. I, you know, come on, itês your birthday. I can soldier through this."
Amy,Hold on. I think I might have a little surprise that might help get things back on track.
Sheldon,Intriguing. Is back on track a hint that it has something to do with trains?
Sheldon,"Because if it did have to do with trains, and you were gonna giveÑ"
Amy,Itês not about trains.
Sheldon,Not even a cozy sleeper car on the Orient Express?
Amy,Stop talking about trains.
Sheldon,Whoês killing the mood now?
Leonard,"Found the backup inhaler, want to have sex?"
Penny,"Well, I didnêt until I heard that."
Leonard,Hang on. Iêm counting. Itês okay.
Raj,"Hello. Howard and Bernadette kicked me out because I told them theyêre having a girl. Oopsy, I did it again."
Penny,"Maybe if weêre quiet, heêll go away."
Raj,Youêre gonna have to be quieter than that.
Sheldon,Can I look yet?
Amy,"One second. All right, you can open your eyes. I thought Iêd let Harry Potter make things hotter."
Amy,I got a Gryffindor robe for you.
Sheldon,"a Gryffindor sleeping with a Hufflepuff? How scandalous. You naughty girl, you went to the Wizarding World theme park without me."
Amy,I did. Am I in trouble?
Sheldon,"Yes, youêre in trouble, you went to Wizarding World without me."
Amy,"Wait, what just happened?"
Sheldon,You know Iêve been wanting to go.
Amy,"Sheldon, do you really want to argue with me on my birthday?"
Sheldon,"Oh, youêre right. Iêm sorry."
Amy,Ooh. Happy birthday to me.
Amy,Is this about the baby?
Raj,People just keep kicking me out everywhere I go.
Amy,Good. Then youêre used to this.
Penny,"Hey, Bernadetteês water broke."
Leonard,"Come on, everyone to the hospital."
Amy,You have got to be kidding me.
Howard,"Just try to relax, weêll be there any minute. Stuart, stop driving like an old man. Speed it up a little."
Bernadette,"Here comes another one. Hey, Squinty, the gas pedalês on the right."
Penny,Howard and Bernadetteês kid might be born on your birthday. How cool is that?
Raj,"This is not how I imagined this day going, I should be with them right now."
Leonard,"Well, it is their child."
Raj,"I know that. But to be fair, Iêve spent nine months helping Bernadette get ready for this baby, and Howard spent five minutes conceiving it. And Iêm being generous."
Sheldon,Five minutes? We must be doing it wrong. It took us hours.
Raj,"And, and the worst part is that they kicked me out and let Stuart stay."
Amy,"I understand, but this is a special day for them. Can you just try and let it go?"
Sheldon,"Sheês right. You know, I just learned Amy went to a theme park without me, but Iêm not going to ruin her birthday. Iêll wait, and ruin 24 individual hours sprinkled throughout the year. Boop."
Howard,"Deep breaths, slow breaths."
Bernadette,Iêm so thirsty. Give me more ice chips.
Howard,"Uh, Stuart, while youêre out there, donêt come back."
Howard,"So, what are we gonna name this kid? Now that we know sheês a girl, it kind of ruins my plan for Wally Wolowitz."
Bernadette,We could name her after your mom.
Howard,Debbie? She hated that name.
Bernadette,Did she have a middle name?
Bernadette,Letês keep thinking.
Howard,Ah. It sucks that sheês not here.
Bernadette,I know.
Howard,Hm. She wouldêve been the best grandma.
Bernadette,She did always have candy in her pocket.
Howard,Yeah. I was 20 years old before I figured out Tootsie Rolls werenêt naturally warm.
Bernadette,"I didnêt know her five minutes and she asked, are you a Milky Way or a Snickers girl?"
Howard,"Thank God you answered right, we wouldnêt be here today."
Leonard,Itês hard to believe Howardês having a kid.
Amy,"Yeah. Penny, youêre the one who introduced him to Bernie."
Penny,How many times do I have to say Iêm sorry?
Leonard,"Itês not just Howard and Bernadette. I mean, look how far weêve all come."
Amy,Sheldon and I are living together.
Sheldon,"But if my mom asks, we have bunk beds."
Leonard,"Penny was a struggling actress when we met, and now sheês a successful pharmaceutical rep."
Penny,"Okay, you donêt have to say struggling every time. You can just say actress."
Amy,Bernadette got her doctorate.
Leonard,"Sheldon, Howard and I are working with the government on our quantum gyroscope."
Amy,Weêve all come a long way. Thereês a lot to be proud of.
Raj,"For Godês sake, just drive in the knife, why donêt you."
Raj,"Well, youêre all thinking it, Iêm the only one who hasnêt done anything worthwhile."
Sheldon,"I was not thinking it. Although, now that you point it out, it is undeniable."
Raj,"Oh, yay, I have a doctorate in astrophysics and Iêm every bit as awesome as the pasty-faced owner of a comic book store."
Sheldon,"Raj, show some compassion. Those are things that we think but donêt say."
Raj,Excuse me.
Leonard,"Sorry, Stuart."
Howard,"Come on, Bernie, breathe. Remember what you learned in birthing class."
Bernadette,"I remember thinking this is stupid, and I was right."
Howard,Do you want me to get the nurse?
Bernadette,"If one more person puts their fingers near my uterus, Iêm gonna cross my legs and snap êem off."
Leonard,Iêve come to peace with my relationship with my parents. That was a big milestone for me.
Sheldon,"Oh, speaking of personal growth, I recently tried eating Swiss chard. You know, I didnêt swallow it, but Amy said it counted."
Penny,"You know, Raj, honey, youêre being too hard on yourself. When I first met you, you couldnêt even talk to women. I mean, you couldnêt even talk if one was in the room."
Raj,"Oh, great, now I can say things like I canêt believe youêre breaking up with me, why are you breaking up with me? Yes, Iêll still help you move."
Penny,Anyone else want to try?
Penny,"Hey, I bought M&Ms at the vending machine and two bags came out."
Raj,"I bought the first one, it didnêt fall."
Howard,"Sheês here, the babyês here."
Penny,Oh! 
Amy,Howês Bernadette?
Howard,"Tired, but great. Theyêre both great."
Penny,Does the baby have a name yet?
Howard,We have named her Halley.
Penny,_ Oh.
Leonard,"Oh, like Halleyês comet."
Howard,"Exactly. Also like the comet, Bernadette said sheês not gonna have sex with me for another 75 years."
Amy,"Thatês not a real thing, heês just joking."
Howard,"Iêm gonna get back. Thank you for staying up, I canêt wait for Halley to meet her new aunts and uncles and godfather."
Howard,Of course.
Raj,"You hear that, Stuart? Iêve got a dog and a godchild, you have nothing."
Penny,"Oh, look at all the babies."
Sheldon,"Some will be successful, some may be homeless. Itês fun to think about."
Amy,Kind of hard to see the names.
Penny,"Mm, that one kind of looks like Bernadette."
Amy,They all look the same to me.
Raj,"Guys, sheês my goddaughter, I think Iêll know when I see her. That one."
Amy,"Well, that was quite a day."
Sheldon,"It was. Bernadette had her baby, I made it to Wizarding World, and now it is time to complete your birthday celebration. Hankius pankius."
Amy,I was afraid youêd be too tired.
Sheldon,"Amy, I just saw a magic train and reported somebody for cutting the line. If thatês not foreplay, I donêt know what is."
Penny,"Hey, can you help me put some of the food out?"
Leonard,Yeah. Let me finish packing this stuff up. You know how Sheldon is if he sees Christmas stuff lying around after New Yearês.
Penny,"Yeah, but he doesnêt live here anymore."
Leonard,"Well, he doesnêt live at Walmart, but he still threw a tantrum when he saw Marshmallow Peeps after Easter. And thatês the same man who complains you canêt find Marshmallow Peeps after Easter."
Penny,"Oh. Itês Bernadette. She says theyêre running late. The baby threw up on Howard, and then Howard threw up on Howard."
Leonard,"Well, he didnêt throw up on the baby. Thatês a win."
Penny,Hi. Welcome back. How was Texas?
Sheldon,"Oh, you know., the lone star state. Hmm. That should be its Yelp rating."
Amy,It was not a great trip.
Penny,"Well, youêre home now."
Sheldon,"Yeah. It is good to be home. Oh, good lord, is that mistletoe? Donêt you maniacs own a calendar?"
Penny,I told him to take it down. He would not listen to me.
Leonard,Did you at least have a good flight down there?
Sheldon,"It was fine. Other than the weird-tasting juice Amy gave me, I slept the whole way."
Penny,"So, what happened in Texas that was so bad? "
Leonard,"And before our next drive to Comic-Con, I need the name of that juice."
Sheldon,"Well, we were on our way to my motherês houseÑ"
Sheldon,How did we get in the car?
Leonard,Hold on. How did you get him in the car?
Amy,"I rented one of those carts, pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest."
Amy,"So, while weêre at your motherês house, it might be a good time to tell her that weêre living together."
Sheldon,Do we have to? I really donêt want to hear the religious lecture.
Amy,Maybe there wonêt be one.
Sheldon,"Thereês always one. She gave it to my sister about her boyfriend, my brother about his girlfriend, my father about his girlfriend. That one had some un-Christian words in it."
Amy,"Well, she likes me. You know, thereês a chance she might be okay with it."
Sheldon,"Eh, I donêt know. I am her precious little boy. And you did take my flower."
Penny,Do boys have flowers?
Leonard,Who knows what he has down there.
Sheldon,"Given that your hands prepared it, isnêt that a little self-serving?"
Amy,"Thank you for cooking, it looks delicious."
Amy,"Well, uh, Howard and Bernadette had their baby."
Sheldon,Welcome to Texas.
Amy,"They havenêt said. Anyway, we, uh, we also have some exciting news to share."
Sheldon,"Oh, wait, wait, shouldnêt we just eat? You know, I mean, God did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these Sloppy Joes."
Sheldon,"All right. This is on you. Amy and I are living together in sin, like a couple of New Yorkers. Now, while you scold us, Iêm going to get a knife and a fork. Joe may be sloppy, but Sheldonês not."
Sheldon,"Wh, whereês the judgment? Wh, whereês the fire and brimstone? Whereês the part where you tell us weêre going to Hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside? Weêre already there."
Sheldon,And what special circumstances are those?
Penny,"Oh, boy, I think itês about to get bad."
Sheldon,so you thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life?
Sheldon,"Well, this is highly insulting."
Amy,"Sheldon, donêt overreact."
Sheldon,"Iêm the child she was worried about? I have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldnêt power a potato clock, if I spotted them the potato."
Amy,"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
Sheldon,"Well, I was in my room, I couldnêt hear what they were saying."
Amy,Iêll take over from here.
Amy,Heês been in there a long time. Should I go talk to him?
Amy,Are you going to?
Amy,"Sheldon, what, what are you doing?"
Sheldon,Just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought I was.
Amy,"Weêre ignoring the fins, okay."
Sheldon,"Yeah. And I donêt understand why youêre taking her side. By being my girlfriend, sheês saying youêre a weirdo, too."
Amy,I donêt think thatês what sheês saying.
Amy,Thatês exactly what she was saying.
Sheldon,Can you believe my mother thinks weêre both strange?
Leonard,Absolutely not.
Penny,Thatês too loud.
Leonard,Absolutely not.
Amy,"Well, after that, Sheldon and I got out of the house for a while."
Sheldon,"Well, first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off, and then we went out."
Amy,"You know, Iêm sorry your mother made you feel bad. But, you know, at the end of the day, she was wrong, because youêre not alone."
Sheldon,"Youêre right. I have Leonard and Howard and Raj, Stuart, Penny, Leonardês mom, Bernadette, Wil WheatonÑ"
Amy,What about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet?
Sheldon,"I was going chronologically. Youêre right between Koothrappaliês father and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy."
Amy,"Well, letês try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip."
Sheldon,I knew we shouldêve never mentioned us living together in the first place.
Amy,She was gonna find out eventually.
Sheldon,"Disagree. Weêve known about evolution since 1859, she still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat. This could have all been avoided if youêd only listened to me."
Amy,"Sheldon, I knew your mother was fine with us living together because I already told her we were."
Sheldon,Why would you do that?
Amy,"This was a potential issue, so I got out ahead of it and I managed the situation for you."
Sheldon,You managed the situation?
Amy,Thatês right. 
Sheldon,"So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks Iêm incapable of running my own life."
Amy,"Not your whole life. I mean, science, you got that. Organizing your sock drawer, youêre the king. But understanding how other people are feeling, thatês a weak spot for you."
Sheldon,I have gotten much better at that.
Amy,Have you? How am I feeling right now?
Sheldon,How should I know? Excited? Itchy? Give me the first letter. 
Amy,"You and I are in a relationship. I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine."
Sheldon,How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back?
Amy,Delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all?
Sheldon,"Delighted? What., not if I guessed for a hundred years."
Howard,"Hey, guys."
Penny,Hi. Thereês the little family!
Leonard,And their Sherpas.
Howard,"The babyês asleep, can we put her in your room?"
Penny,Yeah. Go ahead.
Amy,Do you need help?
Howard,"I got it. Doubtfire, Poppins, follow me."
Bernadette,Sorry weêre late.
Penny,"Oh, itês no problem, Amy and Sheldon were just telling us about their trip to Texas."
Sheldon,Yeah. Here. Iêll catch you up.
Sheldon,How did we get in the car?
Penny,"Stop. Okay. They told Mary they were living together, there was a fight, he got his feelings hurt, then he put underwear on his head."
Leonard,"On purpose, not the way it used to happen in high school."
Sheldon,I was acting odd intentionally.
Bernadette,Really? So you can control it?
Penny,Okay. Then what happened?
Sheldon,"Well, thereês really not much left to tell. I decided that my mother views me as a child because I never went through a rebellious phase, so, I got an earring.  And here we are."
Howard,What did we miss?
Bernadette,I couldnêt explain it if I tried.
Penny,"So tell me, how did Sheldon look with an earring?"
Amy,Like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the Internet.
Howard,So what did you and Leonard do?
Penny,"Actually, we got in a pretty nasty fight."
Leonard,It mightêve been the worst one weêve ever had.
Raj,"Oh, my God, what happened?"
Leonard,"Well, we had started binge-watching Luke Cage together, and it was kind of our thing, and then I find out that she watched two episodes without me. "
Bernadette,Itês like I was excited for a present and got socks.
Sheldon,I donêt understand whatês wrong with socks.
Penny,"To be fair, we may have been on edge because of the Christmas tree."
Howard,What happened 
Penny,You do make a cute elf.
Leonard,"Oh, yeah? And you thought Spock ears were only good for Comic-Con."
Penny,"Hey, hey, I just found a farm where they let you chop down your own tree."
Leonard,"Oh cool, Iêll be like a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan."
Leonard,Stupid idea.
Penny,"No, whatês stupid is a physicist who doesnêt understand when you swing an axe, you donêt let go."
Leonard,"For the tenth time, my mittens were slippery!"
Penny,"Ugh. Itês 70 degrees, you didnêt need mittens."
Leonard,You know how easily I blister.
Penny,"Yes, yes, you bruise, you peel. Itês like Iêm married to an old piece of fruit."
Leonard,"Look, we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night, or, or we can stop and try to salvage the evening."
Leonard,Thank you.
Penny,Thereês something on the windshield.
Penny,You need a break?
Leonard,Do not need a break.
Penny,Thereês no shame in asking for a break.
Leonard,"If I need a break, Iêll ask for a break."
Penny,Ugh. Leonard?
Penny,Thereês a tree on you.
Leonard,You want to decorate it tonight?
Penny,"Yeah, with gasoline and a match? Sure."
Leonard,I hope it kills us both.
Leonard,"By the way, if anyone asks, the elevator shaft always had a tree in it."
Sheldon,"So Bernadette, if I express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it?"
Sheldon,"Hey, howês life with your baby?"
Amy,Really? Youêre never gonna touch their baby?
Sheldon,To this day Iêve never touched Stuart.
Bernadette,"Itês been wonderful, Sheldon, thanks for asking."
Bernadette,"Oh, please stop crying, Iêm begging you. I donêt know what else to do. My boobs are empty. Do you want lasagna? Shh, shh, shh, itês okay, itês okay. Shh. What have we done?"
Howard,"Hey, I found superhero baby wipes, the perfect way to clean up crime, and tushies."
Bernadette,It took me two hours to get her down.
Raj,"You know, in India when my baby brother cried like that, the servants would just take him far away so we couldnêt hear it. Not always, sometimes weêd leave."
Howard,"Hey, he got her to stop."
Bernadette,That was so fast.
Raj,"Oh, heês really good with her."
Bernadette,"Yeah, he has a gift."
Howard,Whatês the matter?
Bernadette,"Nothing, these are happy tears."
Howard,"Oh, good."
Bernadette,"No theyêre not, you bozo. How come Stuart can get her to stop crying, but I canêt?"
Howard,"I mean, itês Stuart. Maybe sheês playing possum until he goes away."
Bernadette,Not funny.
Raj,"Sheês tired, that was funny."
Bernadette,Everyoneês a better mom than me.
Raj,"Oh, donêt take it so personally, maybe your babyês just a jerk."
Sheldon,"Wait, so how does the story end? Is the baby a jerk or is Bernadette a bad mother?"
Sheldon,Is there another twist coming? Is the baby not theirs at all?
Leonard,Ignore him. How did you get the baby to stop crying?
Penny,You poor things you must be exhausted.
Howard,It has been hard to sleep with all the crying.
Bernadette,How can she hate me? I make her food in my chest. Itês like hating a frozen yogurt machine.
Howard,"She doesnêt hate you, stop saying that."
Bernadette,Now you hate me too.
Howard,"Shh, I donêt hate you. "
Sheldon,"It says here that up to 80% of new mothers experience baby blues. And that the best thing to do is reassure them that theyêre doing a good job. Bernadette, you are doing a good job."
Bernadette,"Thank you, Sheldon, Iêm feeling better now."
Sheldon,"Thank you, Internet. Iêm telling you, with the right YouTube video, I can give Howard a vasectomy."
Penny,So things started to turn around?
Bernadette,"Yeah, eventually I figured out how to get the baby to sleep."
Leonard,Please tell me you didnêt use Amyês magic juice.
Bernadette,Shh. Sheês asleep.
Howard,Great. And where are you?
Bernadette,Down here.
Howard,Oh. This is new.
Bernadette,I didnêt know what else to do. It worked.
Howard,"Well, Iêd say thatês thinking outside the box, but, come on."
Bernadette,Donêt make me laugh.
Howard,Do you need help getting out?
Bernadette,I think I live here now. Itês fine.
Howard,Is it okay if I get some sleep?
Bernadette,"Yeah, go ahead."
Howard,"Good job, Mommy. Iêm proud of you."
Bernadette,"Donêt make me cry, either."
Howard,Good night. I love both my girls.
Bernadette,"We love you, too."
Penny,I canêt believe you fit in the crib.
Bernadette,"I could take a bath in the sink. I donêt, but I can."
Raj,So how were your holidays?
Amy,"That was fun, thank you."
Bernadette,"Yeah, thanks."
Penny,Our pleasure.
Leonard,See you guys at work.
Raj,Be there bright and early.
Howard,"Not me, paternity leave."
Sheldon,Oh. A small human wreaks havoc on his wifeês genitals and he gets time off.
Howard,"With pay, sucka. Forgot the baby, still new to this."
Penny,whatês all this?
Leonard,"Well, it sounded like you were having a rough day, so i wanted you to come home to something nice."
Penny,"Oh, that is so thoughtful."
Leonard,"Hey, do you remember when we went wine tasting in Santa Barbara and you said that was youêd ever had?"
Penny,"Yeah, i remember us driving up there, going to the winery and, thatês it."
Leonard,and this wine is why.
Penny,"Oh. Hey, what smells so good?"
Leonard,I made your favourite. Pizza bagels.
Penny,Pink wine and pizza bagels? Itês like eighth grade all over again. I am so lucky to have you.
Leonard,"Well, now be careful, these are hot. i could explain the thermodynamics of why the cheese seems hotter than the crust, but instead Iêm gonna keep it to myself."
Penny,"Oh, you always know what not to say. I just, i canêt believe you did all this."
Leonard,"Well, you know, Itês easy to take each other for granted and I never want to do that to you, because your love, itês like a river. Itês peaceful and deep. Your soul is, itês like a secret that I could never keep."
Penny,You did not just quote an Nsync song.
Leonard,I quoted your favourite Nsync song.
Penny,Oh. 
Leonard,"Damn. I burped so hard, i died in my game."
Sheldon,"Leonard, iêve been meaning to ask you, what size shoe do you wear? "
Sheldon,Iêm trying to take more of an interest in other peopleês lives.
Leonard,Thatês nice. I wear a size eight and a half.
Sheldon,"Thatês small. So, tell me, do you have any plans for the weekend?"
Leonard,Are you gonna laugh at the answer?
Sheldon,Only if the answer is shopping for baby shoes.
Leonard,"If you must know, Penny won a spa weekend from work, and sheês taking me."
Sheldon,"Oh, well you know, that is interesting. I wonder what kind of infection youêll come home with. My moneyês on fungal. Theyêre still having girls night across the hall."
Leonard,"So, hang out with me and weêll have boysê night."
Sheldon,"At our age, why donêt we call it manês night?"
Leonard,Because we just spent our allowance on comic books.
Amy,"Penny, is it weird that weêre having girlsê night here, but you donêt live here any more, so itês basically my girlsê night?"
Penny,I hadnêt really thought about it.
Amy,But now youêre thinking about it and it bothers you? I get that.
Bernadette,Things going well with you and Sheldon living together?
Amy,"Better than ever. He asks about my day, takes an interest in my life. Heês like my boyfriend in college, except heês real, so people can see him."
Bernadette,"Iêve been seeing him for years, Iêm still not convinced heês real."
Penny,"Hey, can I ask you a question? Youêve been married for a while, is it normal for the husband to kind of completely stop giving a crap?"
Bernadette,"Uh oh, whatês going on?"
Penny,"Well, Leonard used to do all these things, like bring me flowers and wear pants."
Bernadette,"Itês okay, Howie never has on pants. The Dominoês guy brings the pizza like this now."
Amy,Well Sheldon always has his pants on. I donêt think I could pick his knees out of a line-up.
Penny,"Well, itês not just the pants, itês just, itês like since we got married he doesnêt really try any more. "
Amy,"Uh, Penny, I donêt know how to say this, but this is my first girlsê night and youêre kind of bumming everybody out. "
Howard,"All right, got Halley to sleep. "
Raj,"Yeah, i heard you on the baby monitor. Didnêt think you could think you could turn the theme from Walking Dead into a lullaby. "
Howard,"Yeah, got to get her hooked on TV or someday sheêll want me to play outside. Boy, that floor is so squeaky. Iêm surprised I didnêt wake her up walking out of the room."
Raj,Have you tried anything to fix it?
Howard,"Well, i put the rug down. It didnêt help."
Raj,"I know. Blue shag, what were you thinking?"
Howard,Did try nailing a couple of the boards down.
Raj,Did that do anything?
Howard,"Yeah, it left little holes in the floor, thatês why I bought the rug. "
Sheldon,"If you do that, iêll win in eight moves. Iêll win in five moves. Iêll win in one move."
Leonard,"Oh, no. Good game."
Sheldon,"Oh, Penny, Iêm trying to take an interest in other people. Uh, how was your girlsê night?"
Penny,"Oh, it was fine."
Sheldon,Hmm. Did you have anything to eat?
Penny,"Uh, chips."
Sheldon,Anything to drink?
Penny,Some wine.
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm just playing tennis against the drapes here."
Leonard,Just ignore him.
Penny,Hm. At least he took an interest. 
Leonard,Whatês that supposed to mean?
Leonard,"Hey, whatês going on with you?"
Penny,I donêt want to talk about it.
Leonard,"Well, hey, come on, just tell me."
Penny,Fine. Lately I kind of feel like youêve been taking me for granted.
Leonard,Where is this coming from?
Sheldon,"Leonard, she might be drunk. All she had was chips."
Penny,"Itês just, since we got married you seem to think you donêt have to try any more."
Leonard,That is ridiculous. 
Penny,This is exactly why I didnêt want to talk about it.
Leonard,"No, no, no, no, letês talk about it. Iêm the one whoês made all the effort in this relationship since day one. Please tell me what more I could do?"
Penny,"Okay, you know what? Maybe Iêll take Amy with me to the spa this weekend instead."
Leonard,"Fine, go ahead."
Sheldon,"Amy is free. She had a harp lesson on Saturday but it got cancelled. Boy, when you take an interest in people, you really uncork a geyser of nonsense. "
Bernadette,"Okay. Thanks, daddy. He said the only way to really fix an old floor like that is to tear it up and replace the whole thing."
Howard,That sounds expensive.
Raj,"Hang on. No offence to her father, but heês not an MIT trained engineer. Thinking and building is what you do."
Howard,"MITês motto is mind and hand, which just so happens was also my motto as a lonely teenager."
Raj,"Oh come on, we just need to be more creative. What if you didnêt step on the floor at all? Like, what if you swung on a rope from the ceiling?"
Raj,"Okay, um, okay, what if you rig up a pulley system and move yourself across the room in a harness?"
Bernadette,I have one. What if you got a giant slingshot and flung yourself into the wall?
Howard,Is that supposed to be funny?
Raj,"Hold on. Yeah, thatês funny."
Penny,"All right, weêre heading out."
Amy,Iêll call you when we get to the hotel.
Sheldon,And if they have any of those tiny bottles of shampoo?
Amy,I will bring them home so you can show me how Godzilla takes a shower. 
Leonard,Have fun.
Penny,Thanks. Are you ready?
Amy,"Uh-huh. Bye, Sheldon."
Sheldon,You know what? I feel uncomfortable engaging in a public display of affection while their relationship is strained.
Leonard,"Go ahead, itês fine."
Penny,Letês go.
Amy,Iêll miss you.
Sheldon,"Yeah, Iêll miss you too."
Amy,Iêll miss you more. 
Sheldon,"Well, if x equals the amount that youêll miss me, then Iêll miss you x plus one."
Amy,"If you miss me x plus one, Iêll miss you open paren x plus one, close paren to the secondÑ"
Leonard,Thank you.
Sheldon,"Here. Youêre sad, so I made you tea."
Sheldon,And itês just the way you like it.
Leonard,Earl grey?
Leonard,Unsweetened almondÑ
Sheldon,"Good Lord, I made you tea, just drink it."
Leonard,"Sorry, thank you."
Sheldon,"Well, what can we do to cheer you up?"
Leonard,I really donêt know.
Sheldon,"You want to play Jenga? Or, uh, Ticket to Ride? Hearthstone? What would you be the happiest losing at?"
Leonard,"I donêt want to play a game, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Wow, and I remember when you loved playing games with me. Maybe Penny isnêt the only relationship youêre phoning in."
Leonard,"Its not that Iêd stopped trying, its just how relationships progress. They start with infatuation, but over time mellow into something more comfortable."
Sheldon,"Hmm. Yeah, youêre right. Itês like when I first encountered the Pythagorean theorem. You know, I was blown away that the square of the hypotenuse was the sum of the squares of the opposite sides. But now Iêm just like, eh."
Howard,"Okay, this grid represents the room. All we need to do is plot out where each squeak is, and we can find a quiet path to the crib."
Raj,It looks like a map from Dungeons and Dragons. 
Howard,Mm. Except the creature in the crib is a level-nine poop monster.
Raj,"Okay, uh, you check for squeaks, and I will mark them down. "
Howard,"Okay, space A3, here we go. Itês squeaking. Mark it."
Raj,Itês nice to think that you grew up in this room and now your daughterês going to as well.
Howard,Mm. I hope she has the same amount of sex in it I did. None. Next square.
Raj,Why do you bounce with your hands in the air like that?
Howard,"Itês a tradition of my people.  If I were a rich man, ya ba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dibba dum."
Raj,"Material Girl needs ot be retired, that is your karaoke song. "
Sheldon,Would you like to play a driving game I invented?
Leonard,Is it about the failing state of my relationship with Penny?
Sheldon,"Never mind. You know, Penny went to this spa to be away from you. Are you sure you should be going there?"
Leonard,I donêt want to wait two days for us to work this out.
Sheldon,"Very well. You got married spur of the moment, I donêt see why your divorce should be any different."
Leonard,"I would pull this car over and kick you out, but If Penny dumps me, youêre all I got. "
Penny,When was the last time you got a massage?
Amy,"Sheldon walked on my back two weeks ago, but that was just êcause there was a spider on his pillow and he was trying to get away."
Penny,"Leonard stood on me once, too, but he was just trying to see the Rose Parade."
Amy,"I donêt know the protocol, are you gonna be naked for your massage?"
Penny,"Well, yeah."
Amy,Hmm. Then this is probably too many clothes.
Penny,What are you doing here?
Leonard,I came here to apologize.
Penny,"Okay. Leonard, I really appreciate that, but I need a little time to myself."
Leonard,"Okay. I donêt get it, you said make an effort, here I am making an effort. "
Sheldon,"Hello, Amy. Itês nice to see you."
Amy,"Nice to see you, too."
Sheldon,And thatês how you make effort look effortless.
Penny,All right. Can you please just go and weêll talk about this tomorrow?
Leonard,I donêt understand what you want.
Penny,Iêm trying to figure it out.
Sheldon,"You know what? If youêd like, I could whip up a quick relationship agreement. Well, Iêm at a spa, I might as well do something relaxing. "
Amy,"Sheldon, why donêt we give them some privacy?"
Sheldon,"Very well. Hey, later weêll check out the minibar, Iêll show you how Godzilla gets drunk."
Howard,"So, what we did was map out the entire room to identify every squeak. Watch. Itês easy,"
Raj,"Donêt do that in socks, I almost broke my neck."
Howard,"Then simply sit, spin, stand, stretch, maybe in looser pants, then step, grab, tiny pivot, pull, and youêre there. Easy peasy, mac andÑ you get the idea."
Bernadette,You actually expect me to do this while holding a baby in the dark. 
Raj,"Hold on, I donêt think she was impressed."
Howard,"Bigger problems, I felt something pop. "
Sheldon,Thereês a cucumber in my water.
Sheldon,"Do they know itês there? I mean, should I tell somebody? "
Amy,Itês there on purpose. Itês refreshing.
Sheldon,"Interesting. The worldês most boring liquid and the worldês most boring vegetable, but you put êem together and bleugh. "
Sheldon,"Oh good, youêre here. Are you still fighting? If you get divorced, do I get two Christmasês?"
Penny,Weêre not getting divorced.
Leonard,"Listen, we realized, that, uh, weêre facing some new challenges as a married couple."
Penny,"Yeah. And there are a few things we need to stay on top of. So we thought it would useful, and I canêt believe Iêm about to say this, um."
Leonard,"Would you please help us make a relationship agreement? But one thatês tailored to us, okay, we donêt need a bathroom schedule. "
Penny,Although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance. 
Leonard,What do you say?
Sheldon,"I get to write a contract? I say, letês get this party of the first part started."
Penny,Do you really think thatês funny?
Amy,Itês in our agreement. I have to laugh.
Sheldon,"If you find this draft acceptable, then I believe your new relationship agreement is ready to be signed."
Penny,"Article 8, subsection B, Leonard will restrict videogaming in underpants to hours Penny is not home. This includes boxers, briefs, thongs, G-strings or anything else that calls attention to his pasty little thighs."
Leonard,Does it really need to say that?
Sheldon,"I did this for free, let me get a little something."
Leonard,"Article 10, subsection C, if questioned Penny may not say that everything is fine if it isnêt. Other unacceptable responses include, itês nothing, donêt worry about it, and, I said itês nothing donêt worry about it. "
Penny,I think this all looks good.
Leonard,"Me, too."
Sheldon,"Oh well, great then, here, you sign here, date here, and Penny, if you could initial here to indicate that youêre accepting Leonard in as is condition."
Amy,I remember signing our first relationship agreement.
Sheldon,Mm. You seem to be forgetting the no nostalgia clause.
Amy,"Right, right. Got it."
Leonard,Whatês going on with that woman youêre dating?
Raj,I broke up with her.
Raj,She said she didnêt want to see me any more and I found that insulting.
Howard,I thought things were going well. What happened?
Raj,"I donêt know, she didnêt even give me a reason."
Sheldon,"Thatês not a problem, we can figure this out. What are the reasons women reject Raj?"
Raj,Can we not play this game?
Sheldon,Doesnêt like games. Thatês one.
Leonard,"Ignore him. Yeah, sorry about the breakup."
Raj,"Thatês okay, Iêm fine."
Sheldon,"Of course youêre fine. Not every member of a species finds a mate. Sir Isaac Newton died a virgin, look at the contributions he made."
Raj,"Iêm not a virgin, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"So now you think youêre better than Isaac Newton? Oh, no wonder women donêt like you."
Leonard,Youêre not being very nice.
Sheldon,He said he was fine.
Howard,Sometimes people say things they donêt mean.
Sheldon,"Oh, thatês a paradox. I mean if you meant what you just said, then that means you may not have meant what you just said."
Leonard,"Careful, I saw this on Star Trek. Smokeês gonna come out of his ears soon. Hey."
Penny,"Hey, boys. Howês it going?"
Sheldon,"Well, I thought we were having a nice conversation, but it turns out I was being offensive."
Bernadette,"So, normal."
Amy,"Sheldon, what did you do?"
Sheldon,"We were discussing Rajês recent breakup and apparently, I was insensitive to him."
Raj,"Itês okay, Iêm fine."
Sheldon,"Donêt fall for it. Heêll get you to compare him to a dead virgin, and suddenly youêre the bad guy."
Raj,"Sheldon, when I said I was fine, I meant I didnêt want to talk about it any more."
Sheldon,Then why didnêt you say that?
Howard,Because thatês not what people do.
Sheldon,"Well, I would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind."
Penny,"No, you donêt, you really donêt. I actually canêt say donêt enough."
Sheldon,"Well, it certainly would be easier. You have no idea what itês like to struggle with recognizing emotional cues."
Amy,Iêm sure itês extremely frustrating.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Amy,And also a little sad.
Sheldon,"Okay, now youêre just showing off."
Bernadette,"You know, I just read that a team at MIT. developed a device that helps people read human emotions."
Leonard,And you think we can get those guys to reprogram Sheldon? Cool.
Bernadette,"Itês supposed to be accurate, like, 85% of the time."
Penny,"Wow, I find that hard to believe."
Leonard,That a bunch of awkward scientists with no social skills would invent a machine to do it for them?
Penny,I take it back. I believe it.
Howard,"You if itês at MIT, I can make some calls. Maybe we can get Sheldon a prototype."
Amy,What do you think?
Sheldon,A machine that reads emotions is intriguing. It could help me be a more considerate friend.
Bernadette,Wouldnêt that be nice.
Sheldon,"It could also help me identify my enemies, discover their fears and then I could use those fears to destroy them."
Bernadette,I like the first one.
Raj,"Now that Sheldonês across the hall, have you decided what youêre doing with his old room?"
Leonard,I was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room.
Sheldon,You could make it a train room.
Leonard,I donêt like trains. You like trains.
Sheldon,"I know, and Amy says I canêt have a train room."
Howard,"Sheldon, I just heard from the guys at MIT about that emotion reader. Theyêre sending a prototype for you to beta test."
Sheldon,Wonderful. Although Iêm not sure how I feel about being used as a guinea pig.
Leonard,"Well, when you get the machine, you can find out."
Raj,Maybe I could use it to understand why women keep dumping me.
Howard,"Well, you donêt need a machine for that, just send a survey card to all your ex-girlfriends and tell them if they fill it out they might win a prize."
Raj,"Thatês actually not a bad idea. Maybe I could even get them all together, sort of like a, a focus group, to find out whatês wrong with me."
Leonard,"No, Raj, thatês a terrible idea."
Howard,"Yeah, I was joking."
Sheldon,"Really? Uh, little tip: jokes are often better when you end them with wocka wocka or ha-cha-cha."
Leonard,"Hey, great news. The TV I want will fit in the gaming room, and if I leave the curtains open, I can watch it from work."
Penny,"Hey, can you hold off redoing the room? My brotherês coming out here in a few weeks."
Leonard,"Oh. Yeah. Okay, sure. Whatês going on with your brother?"
Penny,My dad asked if I can get him a job interview at my work.
Leonard,"Huh. Is that a good idea? I mean, you think theyêll consider someone who was in prison for selling drugs?"
Penny,"Well, I sell pharmaceuticals. Thatês just a really hard to spell word for drugs."
Leonard,"Well, Iêm sure heêll appreciate carrying his samples in a briefcase instead of his colon. How long do you think heêll stay?"
Penny,"I, Iêm not sure. Maybe a few days. Unless he gets the job, then who knows?"
Leonard,Hmm. Who knows? Thatês exciting. Iêll get to wake up every morning and see if heês still here.
Penny,"You donêt have a problem with this, do you?"
Leonard,"Of course not. I mean, heês your brother."
Penny,"Okay. Thank you, youêre the best. Mm."
Leonard,Remember that when the new TV falls off the wall and crushes us both.
Howard,This thingês pretty cool. It interprets emotions using a wireless signal to analyse subtle changes in breathing and heart rate.
Amy,Itês amazing a machine can do that.
Sheldon,"Yes. Now, when the robots rise up, theyêll know that Iêve been rooting for them the whole time."
Howard,The display is synced to your phone. Give it a try.
Amy,"All right. Now, Iêm gonna look at some pictures to prompt an emotional response, and weêll see if the machine can identify them accurately."
Howard,"Okay, remember, it can only detect happy, sad, angry and excited. Not other things youêre feeling, like, what have I done with my life?"
Amy,"Okay, Iêm looking at the first picture."
Sheldon,You are happy?
Amy,Yes. Iêm looking at puppi
Sheldon,"Aw. Somebodyês ignoring their tiny needle teeth, but all right. "
Howard,Try another one.
Amy,Okay. What does it say Iêm feeling?
Amy,Yes. Iêm looking at a picture of my grandma.
Sheldon,"Oh, that makes sense, êcause sheês gone and you miss her."
Sheldon,"And youêre worried that turkey neck is in your future. now, see, now it says youêre mad. Make up your mind."
Raj,"Okay, Emily. Yeah, sounds great. See you then."
Bernadette,Is that Emily your ex-girlfriend?
Raj,Yeah. Iêm getting all my exes together in order to discuss why they broke up with me and how I can be a better boyfriend.
Howard,"Oh, God. You went through with that? What is wrong with you?"
Raj,We are going to find out.
Bernadette,"Why would you do that, Raj?"
Raj,"Well, I want information in order to improve myself."
Bernadette,"Youêre not gonna get information, youêre just gonna get criticism that hurts your feelings."
Raj,"Donêt worry, Iêm a grown man. I have a thick skin."
Howard,Youêre so stupid.
Raj,Hey. 
Penny,"Hey, would you take a look at my brotherês r_sum_? Iêm trying to help him clean it up a little."
Leonard,"Yeah, sure. He really worked with the Drug Enforcement Agency?"
Penny,"He didnêt know it till he was cuffed, but yeah."
Sheldon,"Hey, Leonard, if youêre happy and you know it, no need to clap your hands, because I have an emotion detector."
Leonard,Howês it working out?
Sheldon,Surprisingly well.
Leonard,"Thatês great, Iêm happy for you."
Sheldon,"No, wait, uh, hold on. Oh, what, you are. Arenêt you sweet?"
Amy,Whatês that? Are you working on your resume?
Penny,"No, itês my brotherês. Iêm trying to help him get a job out here."
Sheldon,"Oh, ooh! And that makes Leonard angry."
Leonard,"No, it doesnêt."
Sheldon,"Leonard, please. I know an angry face when I see it. Itês this red frowny guy on my phone."
Penny,Are you really upset about Randall coming?
Leonard,I said no.
Sheldon,Itês like youêre twins.
Penny,"Leonard, if youêre mad about this, just tell me."
Leonard,Fine. You invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us for God knows how long and didnêt bother to ask me first.
Penny,Heês my brother. I didnêt think I needed your permission.
Sheldon,"Well, hey. Now sheês angry, too. This thing works like gangbusters."
Leonard,"Iêm not saying you have to ask my permission, but you could have talked to me about it before you said it was okay."
Penny,Like you talked to me about your gaming room?
Leonard,Our gaming room. I was gonna put a scented candle in it.
Sheldon,Heês still mad.
Amy,Stop enjoying their fight.
Sheldon,You first.
Penny,"If you were this upset, why didnêt you say so when I told you?"
Leonard,Because I didnêt want to sound like a jerk.
Penny,"Well, you sound like one now. I donêt see the big deal if my brother comes and stays for a while."
Leonard,"If you get him a job, heês gonna live here forever!"
Penny,He would get his own place.
Leonard,Has he ever had his own place?
Leonard,Did it have a metal toilet next to the bed?
Penny,"It still counts. You know, how is this any different from you making me live with Sheldon?"
Sheldon,"Hey, I shared my Honey Nut Cheerios with you."
Penny,You gave me a bill at the end of every month. 
Leonard,Stay out of this. You and your stupid machine started this fight.
Sheldon,You are lucky that this feelings machine doesnêt have feelings.
Amy,"Come on, Sheldon, letês go."
Sheldon,Gladly. Can we storm out?
Amy,I think it loses its impact if weêre chatting about it.
Sheldon,Fine. Iêll just give them the finger.
Raj,"Okay, first off, I want to thank you all so much for coming. Howard is here to interpret for Emily, and to take notes. "
Howard,"No, he doesnêt think itês stupid."
Raj,"Uh, heads up, both of you are named Emily, so weêll call you red-headed Emily, and you, red-headed Emily, Junior."
Howard,"Hey, you went out with him. I didnêt."
Raj,"Okay, uh, letês get things started. Um, why donêt we go around the room, say your name, and why you broke up with me. Want to kick it off?"
Howard,Like this one?
Raj,"I did do that. I can be insensitive to other peopleês boundaries. Howard, would you write that down?"
Howard,Schmuck. Got it.
Raj,"Uh, next?"
Raj,"Okay, new rule, everybody only gets one. Uh, next?"
Raj,"Oh. Heês here to support me, so anything you have to say you can say in front of him."
Raj,"Howard, get out."
Howard,"Not a chance. So, you were telling us how Raj was terrible in bed."
Amy,"Sheldon, dinnerês ready. I made beef loaf, because I know youêre uncomfortable with the non-specificity of meat loaf. Sheldon? Hey, are you okay?"
Sheldon,Not really.
Amy,Whatês going on?
Sheldon,"I wish I never tried that device. And I know I said the same thing after the massage chair, but this time I mean it."
Amy,Iêm sorry Leonard and Penny hurt your feelings.
Sheldon,"Itês more than that. Itês me. I always knew I had trouble recognizing other peopleês emotions, but that machine just made it so real."
Amy,"Well, everybody has things that they need help with. Like me, I canêt see without my glasses. And right now youêre just a, a cute, pink smudge wearing a childish green smudge."
Sheldon,"I thought I was getting better at it, but clearly Iêm not."
Amy,"Yes, you are. There have definitely been days when I was sad and you could tell."
Sheldon,"Yeah, but thatês shooting fish in a barrel. Youêre kind of a sad sack. Iêm sorry, I shouldnêt have said that. Iêm just upset."
Amy,"No, see, right there, you knew you hurt my feelings. And Iêm proud of you, for reasons Iêm sure have something to do with my father. And if you donêt like that machine, get rid of it. Because I love you exactly the way you are."
Sheldon,"I feel the same way about you. Now, put your glasses back on. You look weird."
Howard,"I thought you were great, but, oh, my God, you were so dominated by your parents."
Raj,"Okay, thatês enough. Write down loving son."
Raj,"Yes, Iêll take you back."
Raj,"Well, thatês hard to hear, but Iêll still take you back."
Howard,"Sorry, is that Gary with one R or two?"
Raj,"Would you stop writing? Wait, so, did all of you go on to better relationships after me?"
Howard,"Oh, wow. Donêt let him get away."
Raj,What did she say?
Howard,"Uh, basically, she traded you for Bruce Wayne."
Raj,"Okay, maybe we should just end this."
Howard,"Wait, hang on. I just want to point out to everyone here, this is a man who is going to great lengths to better himself. Even at the risk of being humiliated. And I, for one, think thatês very brave."
Raj,"Thank you, Howard."
Howard,"Well, like you gals, I had to suffer through him to find Bernadette."
Leonard,We owe you an apology.
Sheldon,"Oh, itês fine. You needed a suitcase, I wasnêt home, you borrowed a suitcase."
Leonard,That was six years ago. Iêm talking about tonight.
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, I thought we were going in order."
Penny,"Look, we got really angry at each other, and you just got caught in the middle of it."
Leonard,"And, sorry about the suitcase."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, you should be. Your socks were still in it. I had to throw it away. Anyway, I, uh, trust that youêve resolved your conflict."
Penny,"Yes, weêre fine."
Leonard,"Mm, Pennyês gonna call her dad and tell him itês not a good time for Randall to visit."
Penny,"Hopefully, he wonêt be too upset."
Leonard,"Oh, youêre his little girl, he canêt stay mad at you."
Penny,"He wonêt be mad at me. I mean, youêre the one who doesnêt want my brother to come, soÑ"
Leonard,So youêre gonna throw me under the bus?
Penny,"Oh, Iêm gonna throw you so hard, I might actually win a stuffed animal."
Sheldon,"Uh, guys, it sounds like youêre getting angry again."
Leonard,Thatês because we are.
Sheldon,Yes. I donêt need an emotion machine. I am one.
Howard,"Thanks, ladies, this was fun. Letês not wait so long for another bizarre, awkward night."
Raj,"Well, that was a waste of time. Iêm such an idiot."
Howard,Donêt beat yourself up. Thatês what Iêm here for.
Raj,Maybe I wonêt settle down. Maybe Iêll just play the field.
Howard,"Yeah, the field was just here. The field said no."
Raj,"Dude, come on."
Howard,"Okay, Iêll tell you what. Iêll make you a deal. 30 years from now, if youêre still single and things donêt work out with me and Bernadette, you and I can give it a go."
Raj,"I appreciate the offer, but if things donêt work out with you two, Iêm swooping in on her like a vulture."
Howard,Too late. Stuart called dibs.
Raj,"But theoretically, if you and I were in a gay relationship, how would we tell people? Like, print up announcements?"
Howard,I donêt know. What difference does it make?
Raj,"Well, I want to make sure we get invited to all the parades. "
Howard,Those do look fun.
Raj,"Yeah. Well, if you want to march in a fishnet crop top, you better lay off that dip."
Howard,"If you didnêt want me to eat it, whyêd you put it out?"
Raj,"It was for the girls. They broke up with me, I donêt care if they get fat."
Howard,Iêm not gonna get fat.
Raj,"Oh, you want to bet? You never exercise."
Howard,"Fine. Look, Iêll exercise right now. One, two. These are crunches, by the way."
Raj,"Very mature. Keep eating like that, youêre gonna have a heart attack."
Howard,Okay. How about if I eat like this?
Raj,Youêre such a child.
Howard,"Hey, is that any way to talk to your future husband?"
Raj,"Hey, I was being hypothetical, okay? I would never marry you."
Howard,"Please. When you see the ring I pick out, youêre gonna melt."
Raj,"Yeah, right. Wait, is it rose gold? Actually, donêt tell me, I want to be surprised."
Penny,"So, did you wind up sending that machine back?"
Sheldon,"I did. You know, Iêm not even sure how accurate it was. I took it to the train store, it said everyone was sad."
Bernadette,I finally got Halley to sleep.
Raj,"You know, I just read a study that suggests new mothers are better at sensing emotions for up to two years."
Amy,Itês true. Pregnancy causes physiological changes in the brain that result in increased empathy.
Penny,"So, all we need to do is get Sheldon knocked up."
Leonard,We canêt. He was already fixed when I found him at the shelter.
Sheldon,"Hey, uh, Bernadette, letês test this theory. What do you think Iêm feeling right now?"
Bernadette,"Letês see. Youêre better than us, a little bit sorry for us, but mostly glad you donêt have to be us."
Sheldon,Keep filling this one with babies. Sheês good.
Howard,"Okay, Iêm zeroing out the electro-osmotic flow rate in the micro-fluidic channel."
Leonard,"Nicely done, Howard."
Howard,"Well, my wife is four-foot-ten and sexually satisfied, so clearly I know my way around tiny things."
Leonard,"Good for you, on the cutting edge of new technology and still making inappropriate comments about the mother of your child."
Howard,Those are just the things I say out loud.
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, we need to stop immediately."
Howard,Whatês wrong?
Sheldon,"Iêm looking at the math, and I think we can make the device between eight and ten percent smaller."
Leonard,"Thatês great, but the Air Force approved the specs. Weêre good to go."
Howard,Yeah. It doesnêt need to be smaller. 
Sheldon,"Shame on you. Where would we be if poodle breeders had that attitude? Iêll tell you. We would have the standard and the miniature poodle, but no toy or teacup. Which by the way, is not an officially recognized breed, but thatês just poodle politics."
Leonard,Can we please stop talking about poodles?
Sheldon,"Fine. Candy bars. Now, do you enjoy a fun size? I know you do."
Howard,"Sheldon, we donêt need to make this smaller, and your work is done. Go home."
Sheldon,I donêt want to go home.
Leonard,"Fine, go for a little walk."
Sheldon,Then what?
Leonard,Just keep walking.
Leonard,At least itês quiet when he takes bathroom breaks.
Howard,I know. Thatês why I keep refilling his water when heês not looking.
Leonard,Youêre kidding.
Howard,"I donêt care if weêre in a drought, itês worth it."
Leonard,"You know, I do have a way to get him out of our hair. Iêve been holding onto this for a few years, but maybe nowês the time."
Howard,"We can just lock the door, you donêt have to kill him."
Leonard,"You canêt kill him, heêll just respawn at the last save point."
Sheldon,"Oh, that was my sixth trip to the bathroom. As long as thatês not a urinary tract infection, thatês a personal best."
Leonard,"Hey, uh, buddy, I got you a little present."
Leonard,"Yeah. Go ahead, open it."
Sheldon,"Congratulations. The bearer of this certificate is entitled to the ultimate train experience at The Nevada Northern Railway. You are at the throttle. You are the engineer. You are running the locomotive. This doesnêt happen very often, but here comes a hug. Oh, dear, I have to tinkle again."
Leonard,Okay. Where were we?
Bernadette,"For Howieês occupation, should I include that he was an astronaut?"
Amy,"Well, he mentioned it in his motherês eulogy, so why not?"
Penny,I canêt believe you have to fill out a preschool application for an infant.
Raj,"Uh, the one at Caltech has a crazy wait list. I warned you, a lot of people apply when theyêre still pregnant."
Bernadette,"Well, I didnêt. I also skipped a birthing class to see Zootopia so back off."
Raj,Whoa. Just trying to help.
Bernadette,Sorry. Howieês back at work and thereês just so much going on.
Amy,Is there anything we can do?
Bernadette,"Sure. Open up a college fund, shop for life insurance, and in the laundry room, thereês a mountain of dirty laundry. Wash it or burn in, your choice. Ugh, be right back."
Raj,"No, no. I will take care of it."
Bernadette,"Oh, thank you."
Raj,"While Iêm gone, you can think about how mean you were to me."
Penny,"All right, you know what you need? A night away from all of this. You know, where you can just kind of relax and, Iêm just gonna turn this off. Much better. Seriously, letês plan a night, you know, give you a break. We could go dancing."
Bernadette,That sounds really nice.
Amy,"Oh. All this week, the Early Music Society of Pasadena is doing a joint concert with the San Gabriel Renaissance Choir."
Penny,"Okay, thatês the one to beat."
Amy,Good luck. People have been saying that for 600 years.
Amy,"Hey, youêre home early."
Sheldon,"Youêll never believe it. Leonard gave me the most incredible gift, a trip to a historic railway, and I get to operate an actual locomotive."
Amy,Wow. He finally used it. Whatêd you do?
Sheldon,No idea. All I know is Iêm gonna be working on the railroad all the livelong day.
Amy,"Well, Iêm really happy for you."
Sheldon,"Oh, no. Itês not just me. The railway is four hours from the nearest airport, and guess who gets to drive me."
Amy,I give up.
Amy,I really give up.
Sheldon,"Oh, oh. And guess where we get to sleep? Our choice of a turn-of-the-century railway bunkhouse or a working caboose. Now, the problem with a caboose is thereês no bathroom, but the problem with the bunkhouse is itês not a caboose. On the first day, I get to drive a steam engine. Oh, and the second day, a diesel engine. Oh, and if I volunteer to do track maintenance and paperwork, theyêll let me stay as long as I want. So you might want to pack enough clothes for the rest of our lives."
Amy,Can I pee now?
Sheldon,"Oh, get this. I get to take a test based on a 125-page manual. I get to learn things like hand signals. Ooh. Thereês forward, uh, reverse, set the brakes. Are you done yet? Youêre missing"
Leonard,This train thing worked out better than I thought. Heês home studying the engineerês manual.
Howard,Itês so peaceful without him here. Can I ask you how much that cost?
Leonard,"Four thousand dollars, worth every penny."
Leonard,Colonel Williams. Sir.
Howard,Great. We found a cooling solution that allowed us to get the size of the prototype down to the target specs.
Leonard,"As a cooling solution, itês pretty cool."
Leonard,"Oh, nothing. Just some math we donêt need."
Leonard,"Itês just a theory. Uh, itês not even worked out."
Howard,But weêve already met the agreed upon specs. Going smaller would require weeksê worth of new computations. 
Leonard,"Sir, uh, if I may, uh, weêve put a lot of thought and effort into this current prototype. Itês a really elegant solution, and most importantly, it works."
Howard,"Okay, but thatês just a theory. Itês not even a complete thought."
Howard,The kid with the two shirts screwed us again.
Penny,All right. You guys ready to get crazy?
Amy,"Well, the bra under here ainêt beige."
Raj,Okay. You ladies have fun tonight.
Raj,Under the careful supervision of her godfather.
Raj,"Like I said, you ladies have fun."
Bernadette,"We will. Got my dancing shoes, got my breast pump. Letês party."
Penny,"You know, if you pump at the bar, I promise weêll get free drinks."
Bernadette,Call if thereês any problems.
Penny,Sheês busy. You call Howard.
Raj,Got it.
Bernadette,Call me. Donêt call Howard.
Raj,I would never call Howard.
Raj,"Yeah, great. Um, Iêll put food in her top half, you deal with whatever comes out the bottom."
Howard,I canêt believe we have to ask Sheldon to come back and help us.
Leonard,"Oh, boo-hoo. I spent four grand on a gift that only got rid of him for an afternoon. What is that?"
Howard,"I donêt know, but if he yells Itês alive, we run."
Sheldon,"Oh, hey. If you knocked, I couldnêt hear you. Iêm welding this locomotive engine. And if you didnêt knock, how about some manners?"
Howard,Howêd you even get that up the stairs?
Sheldon,"I said to myself, I think I can, I think I can. And then I couldnêt, so I paid two men who promised not to come rob us later."
Leonard,"Okay, look, Sheldon, the Colonel wants us to make the guidance system smaller, and we canêt do it without you."
Sheldon,"Interesting. Well, so I was right."
Howard,Open a window. Itês about to get smug in here.
Sheldon,"Well, I would love to help you, but since I discovered the satisfaction of working with my hands on a train engine, I donêt think I can go back to theory. Iêm an engineer now. And, hey, just to be clear, a train engineer. Not that goofy kind you are."
Leonard,"Sheldon, you can still go on the trip in a few weeks. Just help us out."
Sheldon,Sorry. I need to work on this engine so when I get to the train yard I wonêt look foolish.
Howard,Heês worried about looking foolish. Thatês a heapinê helping of irony right there.
Leonard,"Come on, you know youêre not leaving physics. Why are you doing this?"
Sheldon,"Leonard, in the world of theoretical physics, you never finish. So much is unprovable. But when I was studying that railway guide, it was so tangible and so satisfying that something just clicked. Then it clacked. Then it clicked, then it clacked, click-clack clickety-clack, and here we are. Whoo-whoo."
Amy,"Hey, did you hear anything back from the Caltech preschool?"
Bernadette,"Not yet, but weêre gonna apply to a bunch of others just to keep our options open."
Penny,"Okay, stop that. No more preschool talk. Tonight is about having fun."
Amy,Nothing says fun like being scolded.
Bernadette,"Oh, itês Raj. Everything okay?"
Raj,Donêt worry. Everythingês fine.
Raj,I donêt need your help deciding when we need help!
Bernadette,"Raj, whatês going on?"
Raj,"Yes, so, I was just warming up some milk for Halley, and I thought it smelled a little funky, so I checked the date that you wrote on the bottle, and it says Flerbsday."
Raj,How is that a T?
Bernadette,"Iêm sure itês fine, but if youêre worried, thereês extra milk in the freezer."
Raj,"Okay, yes, I will err on the side of caution and defrost a fresh batch."
Raj,"Fine, you drink it."
Bernadette,"Stuart, donêt you drink my milk."
Penny,"Okay, give. Can you guys handle this or not?"
Raj,"Oh, of course we can. Uh, you girls have a good time. She said I was in charge."
Raj,What else are you gonna do with it? Put it in your coffee?
Leonard,Okay. This is everything he had on the board. Iêm sure we can figure the rest out.
Howard,All right. Hmm. Feel free to jump in. Hmm is all I got.
Leonard,"Oh, we can get this. Is there any chance itês upside-down?"
Howard,Maybe we can find another theoretical physicist to help us.
Leonard,"Itês classified. If we tell anyone, weêd get in trouble."
Howard,"Hey, I came up with that and hmm. You havenêt pitched anything."
Leonard,Just keep thinking. I got it.
Howard,You really figured it out?
Leonard,"No, but when we show this nonsense to Sheldon, it will make him crazy, and heêll have to fix it."
Howard,"Oh, youêre a genius."
Leonard,"Yeah, I know. Thatês not even a math symbol. Thatês just Charlie Brownês hair."
Penny,"Sorry, guys. This club was so great, how could they turn it into a bookstore? I thought we got rid of all those."
Amy,"Renaissance Choirês looking pretty good right now, huh?"
Raj,"Nothing to worry about. Sheês just been crying for a little while, and I was wondering if you had any tricks to get her to sleep."
Raj,She was blowing a spit bubble. It was adorable.
Bernadette,You guys got this? Do you need me to come home?
Raj,"Oh, okay, false alarm. Little parenting tip, sleeping babies hate flash photography."
Penny,Is everything okay?
Bernadette,Yeah. I may have just left my infant daughter with Patrick and SpongeBob.
Amy,"Hey, thereês another dance club nearby. I mean, I donêt know how you feel about Latin music, but according to their horas of operaci n, theyêre open."
Penny,Maybe we should just call it a night.
Amy,You sure? Theyêre open till dos.
Bernadette,"Yeah, weêre all dressed up. Why go home?"
Penny,Iêm just not really in the mood anymore.
Bernadette,Whatês going on with you?
Penny,I donêt know. This is all starting to feel like a sad attempt to recapture our youth.
Bernadette,Iêm not sad. I just wanted to get drunk and not wear sweatpants.
Amy,"Iêm not sad. I mean, hello."
Penny,"Okay, maybe Iêm the one whoês sad."
Amy,What are you sad about?
Penny,Maybe the fact that you went and had a baby. 
Bernadette,Youêre upset I had a baby?
Penny,"No, of course not. I just, I didnêt think it would make me have all these feelings."
Amy,What feelings?
Penny,"Pressure. I mean, sheês looking at preschools, she has a minivan, she has a 401K. Before she talked about it, I just thought that was a race."
Bernadette,"You think that stuff is fun? Being a parent is terrifying. Iêm constantly worried, Iêm always tired, and in a few minutes Iêm gonna milk myself in a bookstore parking lot."
Penny,"I get that, okay? Itês just, Leonard and I have been married for two years, and weêre no further along than when we were dating."
Amy,Come on. Youêve got so much to feel good about. Youêve got a great job now.
Penny,"Yeah, I guess I am making decent money. "
Amy,You make more than I do.
Bernadette,"You may not have a house yet, but your apartmentês great."
Amy,Itês bigger than mine.
Bernadette,"And Leonard loves you so much, he married you twice. "
Amy,"Iêm not even engaged once. I donêt even know if Sheldon thinks about marriage. Iêm not getting any younger. Honestly, I kind of thought by now, we might have had some sort ofÑ"
Bernadette,Careful. The sound of crying can make me lactate.
Amy,Iêm sorry. I canêt help it.
Penny,"Oh, thatês gonna make me cry."
Bernadette,And there they go.
Leonard,"Well, Sheldon, turns out we didnêt need you after all."
Howard,Thatês right. We figured it out all by ourselves. Wasnêt even that hard.
Sheldon,"Well, good for you guys. Look, I have a grease smudge on my hand, and Iêm okay with it."
Leonard,Arenêt you gonna look at the board to see how right we are?
Sheldon,"No, thanks. Iêm busy trying to fix this fuel pump."
Howard,Itês a manifold.
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, I guess itês fixed."
Leonard,Just look at the board.
Sheldon,Thatês wrong.
Leonard,"Oh, no, what should we have done differently?"
Sheldon,"Well, first of all, you canêt use relativistic and non-relativistic vectors in the same equation."
Howard,Told ya. Can you fix it for us?
Sheldon,"Okay, but this is the last time. Nice try, blockheads."
Leonard,"Come on, Sheldon. You canêt turn your back on physics, and besides, you have no idea what youêre doing with this stuff."
Howard,"But if you really want to learn the mechanical side, I can teach you anything you want to know."
Leonard,"And instead of standing around watching, you can help us build your smaller guidance system."
Howard,"And with all these new skills, youêd be able to fix any model train. Youêd be the king of the train store."
Sheldon,Excuse me. I have a girlfriend. Iêm already king of the train store.
Leonard,"So, what do you say?"
Sheldon,"Oh, what choice do I have? You need me. Iêm like the crankshaft of this team."
Howard,Thatês a turbo.
Sheldon,"Well, whatever it is, it looks heavy. Iêm gonna need you two to get it downstairs before Amy comes home."
Sheldon,I apologize that itês so warm in here.
Amy,It is warm in here.
Sheldon,Iêve worked up a bit of a sweat.
Amy,"Me, too."
Sheldon,May I borrow your water?
Sheldon,The lightês green.
Sheldon,GPS says weêll be at the railway in three hours.
Amy,I can get us there in two.
Howard,"Go. Come on, Raj."
Leonard,You can do this.
Sheldon,Thereês no way.
Penny,What is happening?
Leonard,"This is an Eulerês Disk. Itês a physics toy that demonstrates angular momentum, potential energy, and kinetic energy."
Penny,"Aw, look at you watching sports."
Howard,Weêre betting to see if Koothrappali can hold his breath longer than the disk can spin.
Sheldon,"Its weight and smoothness, along with the slight concavity of the mirror, means it can spin for a long time."
Leonard,"But Raj is from India, which means heês no slouch at holding his breath."
Penny,"Okay, I want in. Ten bucks says Iêll lose interest before that thing stops spinning."
Amy,"Hey, Sheldon, I found a great restaurant for date night."
Sheldon,Kind of busy right now.
Amy,"Oh, an Eulerês Disk, fun."
Howard,"Yeah, weêre seeing if Raj can hold his breath longer than it."
Amy,Oh. Immature.
Leonard,How ya doing?
Sheldon,Heês not gonna make it.
Howard,"Yes, he is."
Sheldon,"You know, deep-sea divers holding their breath for several minutes have shown elevated markers of a protein that can signal brain damage."
Penny,"Yeah, see, whatês happening here signals brain damage. My God, how long does this thing spin for?"
Howard,"Ha, youêre interested. Youêre out ten bucks."
Sheldon,Itês slowing down.
Leonard,"Dig deep, like when we bet you couldnêt fit into Howardês pants."
Sheldon,Heês not gonna make it.
Leonard,"Yes, he is."
Howard,"Come on, Raj, itês like your favourite movie, youêre just Waiting to Exhale. Yeah, I knew you could do it."
Raj,"And j, and just so you know, my favourite movie is Princess Bride."
Raj,"Good, good. Uh, listen, I just wanted to let you know when you get my credit card bill, it might be a little high this month."
Raj,"Oh, Daddy, youêre so rich and funny."
Raj,"Uh, well, I was dating a woman at the university, but we broke up."
Raj,"I know you are. Thatês why you just bought me a new iPad. And before you start, I am not interested in you arranging a marriage for me."
Raj,You did?
Raj,"What are you saying, that youêre giving up on me? What kind of father gives up on his son?"
Raj,I canêt believe what Iêm hearing. This is deeply hurtful.
Amy,The food hereês supposed to be great. Donêt fill up on chips.
Sheldon,"Oh, I wonêt. I only eat equilateral triangles. Isosceles, isosceles, oh, scalene. You didnêt see that."
Amy,"Oh, look. Itês Bert, at the bar. We should go say hi."
Amy,Because thatês what you do when you see someone you know in a public place.
Sheldon,I have multiple restraining orders that say otherwise.
Amy,"Sheldon, thereês a difference between greeting a friend and following a celebrity into a bathroom."
Sheldon,"If the judge couldnêt explain it to me, I donêt see how you will."
Amy,"Hi, Bert."
Amy,"Oh, weêre having date night."
Amy,"Oh, really. Anybody we know?"
Amy,Thatês a real thing?
Sheldon,"Well, have a lovely evening."
Sheldon,"If you think thatês more fun than talking to Zachary Quinto through a stall door, youêre crazy."
Penny,"You know, we couldêve come to you guys. You didnêt have to bring the baby here."
Bernadette,"Oh, itês okay. Itês good to get out of the house."
Howard,And the car ride puts her to sleep.
Leonard,"Aw, that used to work with Sheldon."
Penny,"Yeah, until someone left him in the drugstore parking lot and he freaked out."
Leonard,Who forgot to crack the window?
Penny,"Oh, someoneês been shopping at Gucci."
Raj,"Yeah, I saw something for Halley and I couldnêt resist."
Bernadette,Thatês so sweet of you.
Raj,"Yeah, itês a crushed velvet baby cape."
Howard,"Oh, no, now we have two."
Penny,That mustêve been expensive.
Raj,"Yeah, it was. But itês my fatherês money and Iêm mad at him."
Leonard,Whatês going on with your dad?
Penny,"And if you really want to hurt him, I look great in Chanel."
Raj,It turns out he doesnêt care if Iêm married or if Iêm single. Heês basically given up on me.
Bernadette,"Oh, Iêm sure thatês not true."
Raj,It is. He stopped trying to find Indian girls for me to marry. 
Leonard,But all you did was complain when he did that.
Penny,"Wait, Leonard, heês hurting. Let him feel how he feels."
Raj,"Thank you, Penny."
Penny,"Yeah. Shoes, Iêm a seven-and-a-half, boots, Iêm an eight."
Sheldon,"MSN Search, AltaVista, and Ask Jeeves. You?"
Amy,"Sorry, I donêt have a list of defunct search engines that I miss."
Amy,"Oh, no. Are you sure you donêt want to give her a few more minutes?"
Amy,Iêm so sorry.
Sheldon,"Bert, I insist that you join us."
Sheldon,Not at all. Amy?
Amy,Fine with me.
Amy,"Sheldon, that was so sweet of you."
Sheldon,"Well, I could deduce by his facial expression and body language that he was sad."
Amy,So the part where he got stood up didnêt clue you in?
Sheldon,You want me to look at him and listen to him?
Raj,My father thinks the reason I canêt make a relationship work is because Iêm spoiled.
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, is he waiting for someone to disagree?"
Raj,Just because he helps me out doesnêt automatically mean that Iêm spoiled.
Penny,"All right, how much exactly does he pay for?"
Raj,"Okay, Iêll tell you, but please donêt judge me. He pays for my car, my rent, and my credit cards."
Leonard,"Iêm trying, but Iêm judging."
Howard,Maybe your dadês right.
Penny,"Yeah, women do like a man that can support himself."
Raj,But Bernadette makes more money than Howard. She basically supports him.
Bernadette,"Yeah, maybe your dadês right."
Amy,"Okay, literally any other topic."
Sheldon,"Actually, we met online."
Amy,Our-our first date was at a coffee shop.
Sheldon,"Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up. Oh, he looks sad again."
Amy,You-you know about that?
Amy,Were you aware of this?
Sheldon,"No, I only told Leonard, Howard, Raj, Kripke, uh, Professor Wu, Professor Klein, and a lunch lady in the cafeteria. How everyone else found out is a mystery to me."
Sheldon,Why arenêt you talking to me?
Amy,Because Iêm mad at you.
Sheldon,"Oh. Well, now Iêm sorry I asked."
Amy,"Sheldon, itês humiliating. Thanks to you, my colleagues are gossiping about our sex life."
Sheldon,What is there to gossip about? We barely have one.
Amy,Thatês why theyêre doing it.
Sheldon,"Is it safe to assume youêre not speaking to me again? If youêre not answering because youêre not speaking to me, perhaps we could come up with a signal. That works."
Howard,You donêt need your dadês money. You can get by on your salary.
Leonard,"Yeah. Well, we work at the same place as you, and weêve always been fine."
Raj,"Oh, please. Look in the mirror. You both look ten years older than I do."
Penny,"All right, hang on. We can figure this out. Letês just go over your expenses. How much is your rent?"
Raj,I donêt want to say.
Bernadette,Is it really that high?
Raj,I donêt want to say because I donêt know how much it is.
Penny,You donêt how much your rent is?
Raj,My father pays for it. Do you know how much your rent is?
Raj,"Well, then double it, because my buildingês a lot nicer than this dump."
Leonard,Do you know how much your car costs?
Raj,Not really.
Howard,"Well, how much do you spend on food?"
Raj,The housekeeper does the shopping.
Bernadette,"Oh, my God, you really are spoiled."
Raj,Iêm spoiled? Your baby has a cape that costs $300.
Amy,Iêm going to bed.
Sheldon,"Well, wait. This is our first fight as a couple who live together."
Sheldon,"Iêm not sure of the protocol. Television teaches us that the manês supposed to sleep on the couch, but of the two of us, youêre clearly more sofa-sized."
Amy,Iêm not sleeping on the couch because you donêt know whatês private and whatês not.
Sheldon,This isnêt fair. Youêve discussed aspects of our physical relationship with Penny.
Amy,"Thatês different. Sheês a close friend, not the lady in the cafeteria who cuts the crust off your sandwiches."
Sheldon,"That lady has a name. I donêt know what it is, but one time I accidentally called her mom."
Leonard,Sounds like youêre gonna need a cheaper place to live.
Bernadette,"When you moved here, you didnêt have a lot of money. Howêd you get by?"
Penny,"Well, sometimes you can get free food and Wi-Fi from the neighbours. Just know you might have to marry one of êem."
Leonard,"Hey, you guys let Stuart live with you. Why not Raj, too?"
Howard,"what are you doing? I, I, I schlepped the baby over, I brought imported beer. Why donêt you like me?"
Raj,I thought we were best friends?
Howard,"We are, thatês why Iêm sad my best friendês gonna be homeless."
Bernadette,"Iêm sorry, Raj. We really just donêt have the space."
Leonard,What if he lives in your garage?
Bernadette,What if you stop helping?
Raj,"Guys, Iêm not living in a garage."
Howard,Wait. Why are we talking about our place when Sheldonês old room is sitting there perfectly empty?
Bernadette,Thatês a great idea.
Penny,"Raj, if you need a place to stay, of course you are welcome here."
Raj,"Thank you, but if Iêm gonna just take advantage of my friends, I might as well keep on relying on my father."
Penny,"Okay, only if youêre sure. Whew."
Sheldon, Amy?
Sheldon,"Not exactly the welcome wagon, but Iêll take it."
Amy,What is this?
Sheldon,"Iêm mapping basic topics of conversation and with whom they can be discussed. I call these circles zones of privacy. Donêt Google that unless you want to see pictures of peopleês genitals. This circle contains only me and you. It represents subjects we only share with each other, details of physical intimacy, bathroom habits. Although, as Iêm saying it, I may need to add Dr. Fink in here."
Amy,Are you really worried about revealing secrets to Stephen Hawking?
Sheldon,"No, I was just excited to list him as a friend."
Amy,"Well, I do appreciate you working on this."
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry you were embarrassed. And now I understand that some things are just between you and me, and in the event of redness and swelling, Dr. Fink."
Amy,Whatês that little dot in the middle?
Sheldon,Thatês reserved for thoughts I donêt share with anyone.
Amy,Interesting. You really have secrets you donêt tell me?
Sheldon,Of course. 
Amy,Can I hear one?
Sheldon,"No, theyêre private."
Amy,Why? Are they naughty?
Sheldon,A little.
Sheldon,Fine. Two years ago I got my driverês license.
Amy,Why didnêt you say anything?
Sheldon,I like being chauffeured around. It makes me feel important.
Amy,"So when I got up at 4am. to drive you across the desert to an antique train museum, I didnêt have to?"
Sheldon,"No, you didnêt. But keep in mind, I felt extremely important."
Raj,"Hello, Father. We need to talk."
Raj,"I have come to an important decision. I will not be accepting your money any more. Iêm a man, and I can take care of myself."
Raj,"Yes, that is wonderful. You will no longer be able to accuse me of being spoiled."
Raj,"Dad, Iêm trying to tell you off, and youêre ruining it with your delight and relief."
Raj,"Yeah, thatês right. Keep asking yourself that. But I still love you very much, so donêt cut me out of the will."
Leonard,"Oh, you brought your own lunch. Good for you."
Raj,"Yeah, Iêm making a bunch of changes. This morning, I fired my dog walker."
Howard,Oh. Howês the dog gonna go to the bathroom?
Raj,"Uh, I gave her an Imodium. Thatês tomorrowês problem."
Sheldon,"Excuse me. May I have your attention, please? I have recently been made aware that my personal relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler has become water cooler gossip. And I just want to say, shame on all of you. Weêre scientists. Our minds should be focused on the advancement of human knowledge, not the intimate details of other peopleês lives."
Sheldon,"Thank you, Bert. Youêre a good man. That woman who stood you up and humiliated you last night really missed out."
Sheldon,"Oh. Oh, Iêm sorry. Correction, that woman not only had vigorous coitus with Bert, she also tipped him a dollar for a job well done. _ That better?"
Sheldon,"All right, well, to sum up, focus on science, keep your nose out of other peopleês business, and, uh, whoa, for a good time, call Bert."
Leonard,What brought that on?
Sheldon,"Well, last night Amy was angry with me because Iêd been foolishly telling people about certain personal matters."
Howard,Thatês understandable.
Sheldon,"Oh, I know that now. At first, I thought she was cranky because of her horrific menstrual cramps, but it turns out, no, she was genuinely mortified."
Sheldon,Uh-huh. Interesting. Okay.
Raj,How bad is it?
Sheldon,"Let me put it this way, do you own a barrel and suspenders?"
Raj,Are you serious?
Sheldon,Iêm not wearing this visor to play womenês golf.
Penny,"Oh, let me guess. You guys are drafting your fantasy accounting firms."
Leonard,Weêre helping Raj figure out his finances.
Penny,"Well, he has a job. How bad can it be?"
Sheldon,"Well, his rent and car lease are exceedingly high. You couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping."
Penny,"Wait, wait, not shopping for clothes, right? Because look."
Sheldon,He also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt.
Howard,I thought your dad paid your cards.
Raj,I have a card for emergencies that I pay for myself.
Sheldon,What emergency happened at the L.A. Zoo?
Raj,"Thatês a penguin I sponsor. Theyêre losing their homes to global warming, and my car gets, like, seven miles a gallon, so I felt bad."
Leonard,What is Pink Cheeks?
Raj,Itês intimate waxing. Quit looking at that.
Leonard,Maybe you should find someone to help you get your finances under control.
Raj,Like a business manager?
Sheldon,"No, absolutely not. You canêt afford to hire someone whoêll forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses. That is a foolish expense, and I forbid it."
Howard,What if thereês someone who just likes controlling other people and stealing joy from their lives?
Sheldon,He sounds like a sociopath.
Leonard,"We donêt know, his mother never had him tested."
Sheldon,Youêre talking about me. Very funny. Although I would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing Raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion.
Penny,"Wait, wait, whoês gonna break it to the penguin?"
Raj,"Okay, Sheldon. Yeah, Iêm putting you in charge of my finances. I will not spend another penny that you donêt authorize."
Sheldon,"Very well. Hey, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday. You canêt buy one."
Howard,"Oh, better luck next time, Pink Cheeks."
Amy,Youêre actually going to Comic-Con?
Penny,"Well, Leonard wants me to do more stuff like that with him, so I thought maybe this year Iêd tag along."
Amy,"Well, thatês sweet. I bet youêll have fun."
Penny,"So, do you want to come?"
Amy,"No, thanks. I already live in a place all the nerds come to."
Penny,Please? I went to your boring thing last month.
Amy,My auntês funeral?
Penny,"Come on, even you checked your e-mail during the eulogy."
Amy,"Well, Iêm not going, but I do think itês nice you want to."
Penny,"Itês not that I want to go, I just think itêll make Leonard happy. And if I have to watch him squeeze into an Ewok costume, so be it."
Amy,"Look at you, going to Comic-Con, talking about Ewoks. I really have become the cool one around here."
Howard,You actually think Penny will have fun at Comic-Con?
Leonard,"Which will make me miserable, which is usually Sheldonês job."
Sheldon,Sheês gonna hate waiting in line for the panels.
Howard,And hate all the crowds at the panels.
Sheldon,Sheês gonna hate the panels.
Leonard,Sheês gonna hate how often we say the word panels.
Howard,Why donêt you just tell her not to come?
Leonard,"Well, sheês so excited, I canêt do that to her."
Howard,What if you make it sound so bad she wonêt want to go?
Leonard,That I would do to her.
Raj,"I canêt believe Pennyês gonna get to go, and Iêm not."
Sheldon,"You can always watch the panels online. Oh, boy, we do say that a lot."
Sheldon,"You put me in charge of your finances. If you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over, you should have asked Leonard."
Leonard,See? Miserable.
Raj,"Okay, youêre right, I got myself into this, but Iêve never missed a Comic-Con with you guys."
Sheldon,"Your father may have spoiled you, but I wonêt. If you want a ticket to Comic-Con, I suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself."
Howard,"Yeah, youêre a grown man whoês highly educated. You could charge people money to punch you."
Raj,"Go ahead, make jokes. I donêt know why you think youêre going to Comic-Con, you just had a baby."
Raj,"Well, so? So you think Bernadetteês just gonna let you jet down to San Diego for five days and leave her alone?"
Leonard,"Hang, hang on. So I have to bring Penny, you canêt afford it, Howardês gonna get in trouble, and this guy gets to have a great time."
Sheldon,Iêm gonna go as Dumbledore.
Howard,"Mm-mm, howês my favourite girl?"
Howard,What you doing?
Bernadette,Making lasagna.
Howard,"Oh, sheês sexy, she can cook. Iêm such a lucky guy."
Bernadette,"You want something stupid, or you did something stupid?"
Howard,"I just walked in here, saw how beautiful you are and had to tell you."
Bernadette,"Oh, dear God, youêre cheating on me with Raj. "
Howard,"Ha ha ha, never gets old. Okay, there is something I want, but itês not a big deal."
Bernadette,What is it?
Howard,"Well, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday, and I was hoping I could go with the guys. But before you say anything, Iêll make up for being gone by doing everything around here, I mean everything. Iêm even gonna answer for you. Yes, Howard, you can go. "
Bernadette,Itês so hard to say no to you.
Howard,Thank you.
Bernadette,So Iêll say maybe.
Howard,Why? 
Bernadette,"You said tickets donêt go on sale till Friday, right?"
Bernadette,"You said you were gonna do all this stuff for me, right?"
Bernadette,See where Iêm going with this?
Bernadette,"If you donêt know how to make lasagna, Google does."
Leonard,"Okay, so this is the main Comic-Con floor. Itês where all the vendors and exhibits are."
Penny,"Wow, that is a lot of people jammed in there."
Leonard,"I know. Sometimes Howard wears a striped shirt so we can play Whereês Wolowitz? Okay, now, This is us camping out in line for the Avengers panel."
Penny,"Oh, you really sleep on the sidewalk, huh?"
Leonard,"Yeah. It can get chilly, but Raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag, it helps keep you warm. Hereês the hotel room we all share. "
Penny,"Well, you and I would get our own room, right?"
Leonard,"Every hotel is booked. But, yeah, see this space here between Sheldonês feet and my head? Thatês where you go."
Penny,"Well, itês no different than when Sheldon used to climb in bed with us during a thunderstorm."
Leonard,"Donêt worry, we wonêt be doing much sleeping anyway. Itês like an all-night party. Thereês trivia contests and Dungeons & Dragons. As we like to say, itês off the chain mail."
Leonard,"I even said off the chain mail, and she still wants to go."
Sheldon,Thatês probably my fault. She may have heard about my cool Dumbledore costume.
Raj,But you charged me hundreds for this stuff.
Raj,But I need to earn enough money so I can go to Comic-Con.
Raj,I have no choice.
Raj,Really? Iêll do anything.
Penny,"You know, itês no big deal. I can put up with anything for three days."
Amy,Comic-Conês five days.
Penny,Are you kidding me?
Amy,Why donêt you just tell him you donêt want to go?
Penny,"I canêt, itêll break his heart. You know, heês always making an effort to do things with me he doesnêt enjoy, like going outside."
Amy,He is an indoor cat.
Penny,"You know, maybe it wonêt be that bad. Leonard says itês really mainstream now. Comic books arenêt just for sad nerds any more. I mean, it is still a key part of their demographic."
Bernadette,"Howie, can you get that?"
Howard,Kind of busy.
Bernadette,Busy like Iêll be with the baby if you go to San Diego?
Raj,Whatês with the gloves?
Howard,They complete my ensemble. What do you want?
Raj,Iêm looking to make extra money and was wondering if you had any chores I could do.
Howard,"Hang on. Bernie, can I outsource my chores to an Indian guy?"
Howard,I tried.
Leonard,"Hey, I was thinking, if you want to do a couples costume, we could paint ourselves green and be Hulk and She-Hulk. Or we could paint ourselves blue and go as Nightcrawler and Mystique."
Penny,Is there any scenario where weêre not in full body paint?
Leonard,"Yeah, if you want us to look like losers."
Penny,"Hey, um, are you sure the guys are okay with me coming?"
Leonard,"Yeah, of course, why?"
Penny,"This is just something you usually do together, and if Iêm screwing it up, I donêt have to go."
Leonard,"Oh, why? Do you not want to go?"
Penny,Why? Do you not want me to go?
Leonard,"No, I want you to go."
Penny,"Okay, good, êcause thatês what I want, too."
Leonard,Now weêre going as Hulk and She-Hulk. I donêt want to take my shirt off at Comic-Con.
Sheldon,"If I may speak for Comic-Con, we donêt want that either."
Leonard,Is that nice?
Sheldon,"No, but itês honest, and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship."
Leonard,"Uh, itês more complicated than that."
Sheldon,"Iêm always honest with Amy. The other day she said she was self-conscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder, and I said, you know, you can call that a beauty mark all you want. When thereês hair growing out of it, thatês a mole."
Leonard,Do you think sheês as honest with you?
Sheldon,"I should hope so. When she called me an insensitive jerk, Iêd like to think she meant it."
Howard,Thereês got to be other ways you can make a quick buck.
Raj,"Yeah, youêd think. Ooh, maybe I could sell my blood and sperm."
Bernadette,I really should wear a bell around my neck so you guys can hear me coming.
Raj,"Here, let me help you."
Bernadette,Thank you.
Raj,"Oh, Double Stuffed Oreos, I remember when I could afford you."
Bernadette,There she goes.
Raj,"Stay, Iêll get her."
Bernadette,I appreciate it.
Raj,Thatês fine. She and I can cry together.
Bernadette,Heês such a sweetie. 
Howard,"I know, I wish there was some way we could help him."
Bernadette,"If he could find a girl with a job, all his problems would be over."
Howard,"Yeah, thatês working out great for me."
Amy,Penny says theyêre ready to go.
Sheldon,Very well. Prepare for a long night of deceit.
Amy,"Sheldon, women can wear make up, itês not lying."
Sheldon,"I was talking about Leonard. And if make up is so truthful, why is it called concealer?"
Amy,"Wait, wait, wait, whatês Leonard lying about?"
Sheldon,He doesnêt really want Penny to go to Comic-Con. Heês just doing it to make her happy.
Amy,Really? Because she doesnêt actually want to go. Sheês just doing it to make him happy.
Sheldon,"So theyêre both trying to make each other happy, and the end result is they make each other sad? Thatês hilarious. I canêt wait to tell them."
Amy,"No, youêre not gonna tell them anything. Youêre gonna stay out of it."
Amy,Because itês between them. 
Sheldon,"Well, if you havenêt noticed, Iêve been between them for the last ten years."
Penny,"Hey, babe, you want to drive?"
Leonard,"Sure, or you can."
Penny,"No, itês fine, I know you donêt like the way I drive."
Leonard,I donêt have a problem with your driving.
Sheldon,Are you listening to this? They deceive each other about everything.
Penny,"Just so you know, that guy in the parking lot hit me."
Leonard,"He wasnêt in a car, but okay."
Penny,Just say you want to drive.
Leonard,I honestly donêt.
Penny,"Amy, do us a favour, please drive."
Amy,"Sure, happy to."
Leonard,"If you want to drive, just drive. I donêt see why this has to be so complicated."
Penny,"Itês not complicated. Amyês driving, thatês it."
Leonard,Thatês not it because youêre clearly upset.
Penny,Youêre the one who seems upset.
Leonard,Why would I be upset?
Amy,Because you donêt want her to go to Comic-Con.
Sheldon,This is an interesting way to stay out of it.
Penny,"Wait, you donêt want me to go?"
Leonard,"Well, I just donêt think youêre gonna have a good time."
Sheldon,"Yeah, well, get this, neither does Penny, thatês why she doesnêt want to go. You set êem up, I knock êem down, good job."
Leonard,Why would you say you wanted to go if you didnêt?
Penny,I just thought it would make you happy.
Leonard,"O-o-o-okay, hold on, so if you donêt want to go and I donêt need to bring you, is everything good?"
Penny,"Hold on, Iêm trying to decide if Iêm mad at you. No, Iêm happy I donêt have to go."
Leonard,"All right, problem solved."
Sheldon,"Not entirely, the fight over whoês going to drive is stillÑ"
Amy,"Oh, my God, stop talking."
Amy,The place looks great. Did you guys get a maid?
Bernadette,Kinda. 
Howard,"Dinnerês almost ready. If you like meatloaf, Iêm sure youêll like its cousin, bowl of meat."
Penny,"Hey, if youêre still looking to make money, I will pay you to burn that jacket."
Raj,"Thank you, but it doesnêt look like Iêm going to Comic-Con this year."
Sheldon,"Well, with as much debt as you have, probably not next year either."
Howard,Sure. This is for you.
Raj,Whatês this?
Bernadette,Itês back pay for all the babysitting and taking care of Halley youêve done.
Howard,Thereês more than enough in there to cover Comic-Con.
Bernadette,And you live here for free.
Raj,"This is so generous of you, I, um, I donêt know what to say."
Leonard,Now you can come with us.
Penny,"Yeah, thereês room in the bed by Sheldonês feet."
Raj,"As much as I appreciate this, I canêt accept it, okay? Halleyês my goddaughter, I donêt take care of her for money."
Bernadette,Keep it. Consider it a gift.
Sheldon,Hold on. Is it back pay or is it a gift?
Bernadette,Whatês the difference?
Sheldon,"When the IRS questions us in separate rooms, we need to have our stories straight."
Raj,It doesnêt matter. Iêm not keeping this. Iêm trying to pay my own way and be responsible. Taking handouts wonêt help that.
Amy,So youêre not going to Comic-Con?
Raj,"Iêve been plenty of times. If I miss one, itês fine. Iêm a big boy."
Sheldon,"Iêm a big boy, and if I missed one, Iêd throw a big-boy tantrum."
Leonard,"You know what? Iêve gone 12 times. Maybe Iêll sit out this year, too."
Leonard,Yeah. Maybe you and I can do something fun that weekend.
Penny,"Ooh, how about white-water rafting?"
Leonard,"Oh, how about we compromise and go on the Small World ride at Disneyland?"
Howard,"You know what, Iêm not gonna go either. Iêm a father now. Iêd rather spend time with my family."
Bernadette,You just donêt want to go alone with Sheldon.
Howard,Iêm gonna go check on dinner.
Amy,Sounds like everyoneês staying home. What do you say?
Sheldon,"Nuts to that, Iêm going to Comic-Con."
Amy,By yourself?
Sheldon,Not necessarily. I have four months to find some new friends.
Sheldon,"Thatês very kind of you, Stuart. Check back in with me in July."
Sheldon,Thereês my pretty girlfriend.
Amy,Iêm not going with you to Comic-Con.
Sheldon,Canêt a man just be happy to see his woman and pat her on her second most erogenous ball-and-socket joint?
Amy,"He can, but itês still not changing my mind."
Sheldon,"Well, maybe whatês in my pants will change your mind. Itês a list of this yearês panelists. Itês long, isnêt it?"
Leonard,"Aw, man, did you see this post from Raj?"
Penny,Is it another video of him and his dog Lady-and-the-Tramping some spaghetti?
Leonard,"He canêt afford his apartment, and heês asking if anyone knows of a cheap place to live. I want to say India, but it seems mean."
Bernadette,Whatês so funny?
Howard,"Raj is looking for a cheap place to live, and I wrote India."
Bernadette,"Donêt post that, be supportive."
Howard,"Maybe you should be supportive of my hilarious jokes. Fine, what should we do?"
Bernadette,Weêre smart. Iêm sure we can think of something.
Howard,You want to let him live here?
Bernadette,"Oh, weêre smarter than that."
Sheldon,"I know our apartmentês small, but I think we can make room."
Amy,"No, Sheldon. We are not getting a life-size Spider-Man statue."
Leonard,"We do have Sheldonês old room. If he really needs a place to stay, I guess we should offer it to him."
Penny,Youêre a good friend.
Leonard,Am I still a good friend if I wait and hope that Howard offers him a place to live first?
Penny,Youêre an even better husband.
Howard,"I know if the roles were reversed, he would do it for me."
Bernadette,Where would he stay? We already have Stuart.
Howard,"Well, we can make some space in the garage. Maybe put a cot out there, get him a space heater, maybe a hot plate."
Bernadette,That sounds awful.
Howard,"Letês hope he thinks so, too."
Amy,"For the last time, no Hulk, no Batman, no life-size statues."
Sheldon,Wow. Iêm starting to think you didnêt mean it when you said you wanted to spruce up the place.
Howard,"Hey, uh, so weêve been talking, and if you need a place to stay, weêd be happy to fix up the garage for you."
Raj,"That would be amazing. I was literally just looking at my moving boxes, trying to pick one to live in."
Howard,"I know itês not ideal, but youêd have plenty of space for your furniture, and thereês this cool button that makes an entire wall go up and down."
Raj,I cannot thank you enough.
Howard,"It is our pleasure.  Hey, can you hold on one sec? Hello?"
Leonard,"Hey, buddy, you still looking for a place to live?"
Raj,"Uh, yeah. Why do you ask?"
Leonard,"You know, we have the extra bedroom, and if you need it, itês yours."
Raj,"Oh, my God, thatês so generous."
Leonard,Itês the least we can do.
Raj,"I really appreciate it. Uh, can you hold on one second? Hey, so, Howard, whatês the bathroom situation gonna be?"
Howard,"Well, thereês a sink out there, that takes care of half your problems."
Raj,"But I can use the downstairs bathroom, right?"
Howard,"Yeah. We barely use it, so itêll be like itês yours."
Raj,"Cool, cool, yeah, yeah, hold on one second."
Raj,"Hey, whatês it like sharing a bathroom with Penny? Is there hair everywhere? Does she use your loofah?"
Leonard,I donêt have a loofah.
Raj,"Okay, well, if I move in, you canêt use mine. Hold on a second. Hey, Howard, uh, howês the Wi-Fi in the garage?"
Howard,I donêt know. Why are you asking all these questions?
Raj,"Well, to be honest, Leonardês on the other line, and he offered me their spare bedroom."
Howard,Great. Go live there.
Raj,But you made the garage sound so fun. 
Howard,"I just didnêt want you to feel bad about it. Unless Leonardês apartment also has a raccoon that chews its way in on cold nights, go there."
Raj,"One second. Okay, I think weêre close. How do you feel about a mini-fridge in my room?"
Penny,"Hey, pal, you want to live here or not?"
Raj,"Oh, uh, hi, Penny. Yes, please."
Sheldon,"Hi, uh, Penny, this circular is addressed to occupant, but with our apartment switch, itês unclear whether itês yours or mine."
Penny,Whatês it for?
Penny,"Yeah, itês yours."
Sheldon,"Okay, thanks. Just throw it out. Speaking of occupants, Iêm given to understand Raj will be moving into my old room."
Leonard,"Yeah, for a little while."
Sheldon,What about his dog?
Penny,"Sheêll be in her crate, itês not a big deal."
Sheldon,I suppose thatês acceptable.
Amy,"Well, Sheldonês getting a little better with dogs. He even took a picture with Pluto at Disneyland."
Sheldon,"If real dogs gave me buttons, Iêd like them, too. Well, I think itês very nice that youêre helping out our friend."
Leonard,And I think itês nice that youêre taking whatever medication Amyês clearly giving you.
Sheldon,And what is that supposed to mean?
Penny,"Well, itês like that science thing. For every action, you have a gigantic and annoying reaction."
Leonard,Just when I thought you couldnêt get any hotter.
Sheldon,"If youêre implying that Iêd have some problem with him moving into my room, youêre wrong. Raj is in a difficult financial situation, and Iêm glad that heês making changes to improve it."
Leonard,Do not adjust the dosage. You nailed it.
Amy,Donêt listen to them. Whatês weird is that Penny almost got a science fact right.
Sheldon,"I mean, itês unfair; people just assume Iêm going to be upset by Raj moving into my old room."
Amy,"But you are, arenêt you?"
Sheldon,"Oh, Iêm outraged. "
Amy,Talk to me. Tell me whatês going on.
Sheldon,"Well, thatês been my room since before I met Leonard, and now someone else is going to be living in it. And that someone else is not me. And you know how I feel about people who arenêt me. "
Amy,"There are a lot of memories wrapped up in that room. For me, too. The first time you told me you loved me was in that room."
Sheldon,Wrong. We were standing outside my room in the hallway.
Amy,And there is the love of which I speak.
Sheldon,"I realize itês irrational, but with Raj moving in there, Iêm feeling a bit replaced."
Amy,"Well, this isnêt an easy time for him. Heês losing his apartment, heês in debt, heês probably humiliated."
Sheldon,"Yes, probably. But until we know for sure, how can I feel better?"
Raj,Can I get anyone anything at all?
Penny,"Raj, you donêt have to serve us."
Raj,Itês the least I can do for helping me carry my stuff up.
Howard,It was really no problem.
Bernadette,"Not for you, box of towels."
Raj,"Anyway, thanks again."
Howard,"Hey, look at that. Youêve got a Raj, weêve got a Stuart. Maybe we should take them both to the park and let them run around together."
Leonard,I donêt know. Yours looks like he has worms.
Amy,You ready to go?
Sheldon,All set.
Amy,Whatês that?
Sheldon,A housewarming gift for Raj.
Amy,"Well, a bunch of fake snakes better not spring out of it, êcause that was a lousy anniversary present."
Sheldon,"Itês nothing like that. I just, I thought about Rajês situation, and I had a change of heart. You know, and regarding your gift, you said surprise me, and, boy, did I. Hello."
Leonard,Hey. 
Leonard,Perfect timing. Foodês ready.
Sheldon,"Uh, wait, before we eat, I have a little welcome to the building gift for Raj."
Penny,"Wait, is anything gonna jump out of that."
Amy,I already asked.
Raj,"Thank you, Sheldon. Itês a blank notebook. "
Sheldon,"Well, I had some of my best ideas in that room, and Iêm sure you will, too."
Howard,He also never had sex in that room. Thatês something else to look forward to.
Raj,This means a lot.
Sheldon,"Well, I know this is a difficult time for you. Youêre losing your apartment, youêre in debt, and you just, you must be humiliated."
Sheldon,"Oh, good grief. She is such a stickler for citing sources. Those were Amyês words."
Sheldon,"I know, I know, good grief was originally said by Charlie Brown, geez."
Raj,"Youêre right, I am humiliated. Thanks for pointing it out. Youêre such a jerk."
Sheldon,Can you believe this guy?
Sheldon,I thought that was gonna break the other way.
Amy,"Come on, Sheldon. Maybe we should just eat at our place."
Sheldon,Fine. You took my room. You turned my friends against me. I hope youêre happy.
Raj,What do I have to be happy about? My lifeês a wreck.
Sheldon,How come he can say it and I canêt?
Amy,Just keep walking.
Sheldon,"Honestly, Iêve been better. Do you have time? Leonard says youêre very busy these days."
Sheldon,"Well, our friend Raj moved into my old room, and itês brought up a lot of negative feelings for me."
Sheldon,"Beverley, you know I hold you in high esteem. Can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer, and get to the part where you tell me the answer?"
Sheldon,I have.
Sheldon,I hadnêt thought about that.
Amy,And donêt start thinking about it now.
Amy,Thatês not true.
Amy,This isnêt about me and Sheldon. This is about Rajesh moving in with Leonard and Penny.
Sheldon,"I had no idea all our relationships were such a disaster. Boy, youêre good."
Raj,"Maybe moving in was a bad idea. I havenêt been here one day, Iêm already causing problems."
Penny,You didnêt do anything. Itês Sheldon.
Leonard,"You didnêt do anything, itês Sheldon. Thatêd make a nice needlepoint pillow."
Penny,"So, relax. Weêre happy to have you."
Raj,"Thank you, but how do I know youêre not saying that just to be nice?"
Penny,Do you actually pay for that haircut?
Raj,Thatêll do it.
Sheldon,"Hey, Raj, I owe you an apology. Look, could you please put your dog on a leash?"
Raj,"Sheldon, sheês fine."
Sheldon,"Well, then at least hold her still so I can pretend sheês stuffed. Raj, I let my emotions get the best of me, and I unfairly took it out on you."
Raj,Thank you. I appreciate that.
Sheldon,"No, I canêt take all the credit. I spoke with Leonardês mother, and she made me feel better."
Leonard,"I donêt know who you talked to, but that wasnêt my mother."
Sheldon,"Beverly pointed out that Iêm experiencing insecurities in my relationship with Amy, in the same way that Leonard and Penny are in their relationship."
Penny,What are you talking about? Weêre fine.
Sheldon,"Yes, youêre fine as long as you have a buffer living with you to distract from your marital problems. It used to be me. Now itês Raj and his attack Tribble. Anyway, Iêm sorry for everything. Oh, and FYI, if you cry while theyêre fighting, theyêll take you to McDonaldês."
Leonard,Why are you saying we have marital problems? We donêt have marital problems.
Leonard,"Look, just because we took our friend in does not mean that Penny and I are afraid to be alone."
Penny,"Yeah, this is a special circumstance."
Penny,"Yeah, well, a circumstance can happen twice and still be special."
Leonard,"Well, now that you point it outÑ"
Penny,Are you kidding me?
Leonard,We do seem to keep finding room mates.
Penny,Now youêre taking her side?
Raj,"Howard? Howard? Itês me, itês just me. "
Howard,What are you doing here?
Raj,"Well, I texted you, but you didnêt respond. Leonard and Penny were arguing."
Bernadette,"Itês fine. Itês just Raj. You can hit him with the bat, but itês fine."
Raj,"Iêm sorry, guys. Sheldon was upset, Leonard and Penny were fighting, I just wanted to go some place where I wasnêt causing problems."
Howard,Iêll say it again. India.
Raj,Can I just stay in the garage?
Bernadette,Donêt do that. Weêll make up the couch for you and figure out something in the morning.
Raj,Thank you.
Howard,Never shouldêve had all these kids so close together.
Amy,You okay?
Sheldon,I canêt sleep.
Amy,Whatês wrong?
Sheldon,Beverley believes I unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch.
Amy,Is that bothering you?
Sheldon,Yes. I donêt care for unconscious thoughts. My brain and I are best friends. It should tell me everything. 
Amy,"I mean, how it relates to our relationship, not the bromance between you and your brain."
Sheldon,What if sheês correct? Doesnêt that say something troubling about us?
Amy,I donêt know. I just think youêre the kind of person who likes a contingency plan.
Sheldon,That is true. Did you know I figured out in which order I would eat all my friends in the event of an apocalypse?
Amy,You need to stop hanging out with your brain so much. Itês not a good influence.
Raj,"Well, didnêt think this is where my life would be."
Raj,"You know, weêre both down on our luck. Maybe you and I should try to get a place together."
Raj,Wouldnêt you feel better about yourself if you were more independent?
Sheldon,"Penny would be the entree. Then Leonardês basically a cheese course. And because I love you, youêre dessert."
Amy,"I want to say aw, but Iêm gonna say ew."
Raj,"No, you see, Iêm doing this so I can stop being spoiled and, you know, grow as a person."
Raj,Donêt you even feel a little bad sponging off your friends?
Raj,"Well, no offence, but I didnêt go to art school. I have a PhD in astrophysics."
Leonard,Did you know Raj moved out last night?
Penny,Why?
Leonard,"Leonard and Penny, Iêm sorry for all the trouble Iêve caused. I went to stay at Howardês. PS Cinnamonês with me, but if you feel like messing with Sheldon, tell him sheês loose in the building."
Penny,I feel terrible.
Leonard,Should we go bring him back?
Penny,"Well, youêre the one worried having someone live with us is a sign of problems."
Leonard,"Oh, that was just because my mother got in my head. Itês like being possessed, but instead of Satan itês, actually, itês the same thing."
Penny,"All right, so weêll ask him to come back."
Leonard,"Well, great."
Penny,Donêt you want to get dressed first?
Leonard,"Just one second. Help, Cinnamonês loose in the building."
Sheldon,"Amy, quick, lock the door."
Penny,Weêre so sorry if we made you feel uncomfortable. We really werenêt fighting about you.
Raj,I just never want to be a burden on my friends.
Leonard,"You are not a burden, and we want you to come back and stay with us."
Raj,"But I also upset Sheldon, and heês not gonna want to come over if Iêm there."
Penny,More reasons for you to stay.
Bernadette,"You know sheês at my parentsê house, right?"
Howard,"If you ever want to change things up, youêre always welcome here."
Bernadette,"Just not in our bedroom, you dumbass. "
Raj,"I appreciate it, but I think staying with Leonard and Penny makes more sense for everyone."
Penny,Then itês settled.
Raj,"And just so you know, itês only temporary. Iêm not gonna get too comfortable."
Bernadette,Good. Nobody needs a mooch living in their house forever.
Sheldon,"You know what? Iêm proud of us. Yeah, with Penny and Leonard taking in Raj, and Stuart living with Howard and Bernadette, weêre the only couple of our social group who doesnêt need to fill the holes in their relationship with a third party."
Amy,"Yup, weêre killinê it."
Raj,"You know, downward-facing dog comes from the Sanskrit phrase adho mukha shvanasana."
Penny,"Oh, thatês beautiful. What does it mean?"
Raj,Downward-facing dog. 
Penny,"Yeah, I guess they donêt have Sanskrit for butts up and heads down."
Raj,"Hey, we wrote the Kama Sutra. If it involves butts, thereês a word for it."
Leonard,I thought we were getting breakfast before work.
Penny,"Oh, right, sorry."
Raj,Itês my fault. I asked Penny to do yoga with me.
Penny,"If you want, I can get ready in five minutes."
Leonard,Itês cute that you think that. Donêt worry about it.
Raj,"Hey, can I ask you a favour? Would you mind taking Cinnamon for a walk?"
Leonard,"Sure. Youêre living here for free, I guess I owe you."
Raj,"Bye, Cinnamon. Be a good girl."
Penny,"Yeah, bye, sweetie."
Penny,"Yeah, yeah, bye, Leonard."
Raj,"Okay, and tree pose."
Leonard,"Well, sheês done."
Sheldon,Things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope.
Amy,Thatês great. How so?
Sheldon,"Oh, the project is classified. I canêt tell you. Oh, I suppose I could redact the classified parts. All right, um, I came up with an elegant solution to the  Wow, I wonder what theyêre redacting."
Amy,Why donêt you ask me what Iêm working on?
Sheldon,"Oh, very well. What have you been working on? And feel free to honk during the boring parts."
Amy,Iêm doing some experiments to show that the signal to move a muscle occurs before you know you even decided to move it.
Sheldon,So youêre attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain.
Amy,"Yes, Iêm trying to figure out to the nanometer and the attosecond, precisely where and when an event of awareness takes place."
Sheldon,"Well, what do you know? Here I was, waiting to be bored with biology, and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy. Which, unlike my body, is an okay place to tickle."
Amy,"You know, when I was six, I wanted to marry the gorilla from Good Night, Gorilla. Maybe I was onto something."
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon."
Howard,"Unless it was singing Be Our Guest, I doubt it."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I picked it up without thinking about it. Which raises a neuroscientific question, when did I decide to pick it up?"
Raj,"The bigger question is, what are you gonna eat with that spoon? You didnêt get any food."
Leonard,He does raise an interesting point.
Sheldon,"Amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness, and I realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. Now, I recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you Googling what it means, so Iêll wait."
Leonard,"I understand it, Sheldon."
Raj,"Yeah, me, too."
Howard,"Iêm sorry, I spaced. Are we still talking about the spoon?"
Raj,Itês nice to see you taking an interest in Amyês work.
Sheldon,"Well, donêt get me wrong. Neurobiologyês nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff. But, you know, when it connects to physics, gas up the Ford, Martha, weêre going for a drive."
Raj,So did you confront Jennifer?
Penny,"No, I was going to, but she called in sick. And guess who else called in sick."
Leonard,Whoês Paul?
Penny,"Oh, you met him at the office Christmas party. Heês married to Nancy."
Leonard,"Oh, sure. Wait, Nancy?"
Penny,"I bet Jennifer gets a promotion out of this, which is so unfair because I work twice as hard as she does."
Raj,"Donêt worry, Jerry wonêt be fooled by that type of behaviour."
Raj,"It didnêt work for Randy, it didnêt work for Tina, it sure as hell isnêt gonna work for Jennifer."
Penny,"Well, I hope not. I just hate when people play those kinds of games."
Raj,"With your sales record, you have nothing to worry about."
Leonard,I went to your office Christmas party?
Amy,"You know, I like harp lessons, but Iêm thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons. What are you working on?"
Sheldon,"I was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making, and I realized, if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the Copenhagen Interpretation."
Amy,"Wait, are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations, we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses?"
Sheldon,It could be the most inspired combination since I mixed red Icee into my blue Icee. It was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow.
Amy,"Sheldon, this is really interesting."
Sheldon,"Yeah, and this one wonêt stain my teeth purple."
Amy,"You know, weêve never collaborated professionally before. Are you worried it might affect our relationship?"
Sheldon,That is a valid point. Perhaps we should establish some ground rules.
Amy,"Well, that would make me feel better."
Sheldon,"All right, letês start right now. Uh, rule number one, no using sexuality to get your way."
Amy,Thatês a ridiculous rule.
Sheldon,Is it?
Penny,"Okay, how is that?"
Raj,I can actually feel the toxins being pulled out of my skin.
Penny,"Well, this is a moisturizing mask."
Raj,"Oh, well, then I can actually feel the moisture going into my skin. "
Penny,"Hey, I hope you donêt mind, I used a little of your eye cream last night."
Raj,I thought someone looked brighter and tighter.
Leonard,Iêd still like to know who Jerry is.
Penny,"Donêt worry about it. Hey, after this, how about we all go out and do something together?"
Leonard,That would be great. Thank you.
Raj,You want to go shopping?
Penny,"Ooh, yes. Fun."
Leonard,"Or we could do something weêll all enjoy, like play a board game."
Sheldon,I believe Iêve made some progress on our ground rules.
Amy,"Oh, good. What are they?"
Sheldon,"Okay, uh, number one, in matters of physics, I have the final say. In matters of neuroscience, you have the final say. Unless I disagree. Oh, here. Number two, when we publish,"
Amy,Can I see that?
Sheldon,"Oh, of course. Iêll get that back. Like all my underwear, that notebook says Property of Sheldon Cooper."
Amy,"Sheldon, if weêre gonna have ground rules, Iêll tell you the first ground rule. I make the ground rules."
Sheldon,"Iêd write that down, but I canêt now, can I?"
Leonard,"I mean, they didnêt say anything, but I just kind of felt like I was being a weird third wheel."
Howard,"Huh, so you can tell what that feels like. Interesting."
Leonard,"Anyway, I figured I can hang out with my friends and have fun, too."
Bernadette,"Well, if your idea of fun is riding in a minivan to Target for diapers, things are about to get nuts."
Leonard,"Oh, itês just nice to be with people who are happy to have me around. Isnêt that right, Halley?"
Howard,"Well, at least someone had the courage to say it."
Sheldon,"Thank you, you are a good citizen. Told you. Go ahead, throw my underwear out the window. Same thingês gonna happen."
Amy,Terrific. Do you want to hear our new set of ground rules?
Sheldon,Fire away.
Amy,"Number one, weêre on the same team, weêre not in competition."
Sheldon,"Thatês smart, because Sheldon 1, Amy 0."
Amy,"Number two, disagreements can happen politely. Thereês no need to call an idea stupid."
Sheldon,"Aw, someone drew a penis in it."
Amy,Are you listening?
Sheldon,"Iêm sorry, go ahead."
Amy,"Number three, to avoid getting frustrated, we take built-in breaks and reward our successes with a small treat."
Sheldon,"Ooh, that sounds fun. Now, weêre talking about real treats, right? Not Bible verses like my mother used to give me."
Amy,"Whatever you want. So, shall we get to work?"
Sheldon,"Biology and physics coming together, this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind. Oh, I know what I want my treat to be."
Amy,Wow. Look at that.
Sheldon,"Yes, this is remarkable."
Amy,"So weêre agreed, itês complete garbage."
Sheldon,"By the way, your name can go first."
Leonard,"I mean, Iêm glad theyêre getting along, but itês starting to make me uncomfortable."
Bernadette,"Well, are you worried heês like another man in her life?"
Leonard,"A little, until I saw them in matching tops."
Howard,Nice. 174 diapers. That ought to get us to Wednesday.
Bernadette,"Well, have you talked to them about it?"
Leonard,"Well, what am I supposed to say, stop having fun without me?"
Howard,This one says that every time I go out. See? I listen to you.
Bernadette,"Look, Raj just gets along with women. "
Leonard,"I know, but he was my friend first. Itês like sheês stealing him and theyêre just having the best time doing all their dumb girly stuff together."
Howard,You sure you donêt fit in? You sound like a catty bitch to me.
Amy,I donêt know where we went wrong.
Sheldon,"Yeah, the math is so inelegant. Iêm not even sure it makes sense."
Amy,"Well, donêt give up. Maybe we can fix it."
Sheldon,Can you stop breathing so loud? I can hear your nose whistling.
Amy,"I can hear your face talking, so weêre even."
Sheldon,"All right, either blow your nose or teach it to play Camptown Races."
Amy,"Fine. Fine. You want me to blow my nose? Here, Iêll blow it. Better?"
Sheldon,"No, I can still hear it. Oh, wait, thatês me. Never mind, itês fine."
Amy,"You know, youêre exhausting. I knew working together was a bad idea."
Sheldon,"Hold on. I see whatês wrong here. We did the propagation only to the occipital lobe, not to the prefrontal cortex."
Amy,That would mean that this delayed parameter should be increased 250 milliseconds.
Sheldon,"Oh, that is much better. Yeah, boy, if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose, weêd be in good shape."
Raj,"Now, take a sip, swirl it around your mouth, and try to notice the flavours, the tannins, the textures. Well?"
Penny,I probably should have spit out my gum first.
Raj,"Yeah. You know, the last couple of weeks have been pretty rough, but, uh, staying here with you guys has really helped take my mind off of it."
Penny,"Mm. Well, weêve loved having you around. Right, sweetie? Leonard?"
Raj,When did he leave?
Penny,"Yeah, thatês rude."
Leonard,"You know, itês nice to spend time with people who donêt talk about work like itês some kind of soap opera."
Bernadette,Jennifer still trying to sleep her way to the top?
Howard,You should be happy someone wants to do the stuff with Penny you donêt want to.
Bernadette,"Yeah, I wish I had that with Howard."
Howard,Wait. What do I make you do?
Bernadette,"Letês see, the magic store, the Doctor Who convention, the National Belt Buckle Collectorês meet and greet."
Howard,"It said right there on the invitation, buckle up for fun. Itês not my fault you didnêt listen."
Leonard,Iêm sure Iêm overreacting.
Bernadette,"Youêre entitled to feel how you feel. If you donêt like it, you should just talk to her."
Leonard,I donêt want to sound like a jealous baby.
Bernadette,"Oh, then maybe you shouldnêt talk to her."
Amy,"I had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model, but I didnêt say anything êcause youêre so sensitive."
Sheldon,"Just because I am easily bothered by light, heat, sound, smell and the way birds look at me does not mean Iêm sensitive."
Amy,"Hey, I wonder what kind of success weêd have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex."
Sheldon,That is a daring and insightful solution. 
Amy,Weêre finally making progress. I wish we could do it without fighting.
Sheldon,What if the fighting is the reason weêre making progress?
Amy,I suppose itês conceivable that the hormones associated with our fight-or-flight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes.
Sheldon,"Well, if thatês the case, then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture."
Amy,"How dare you speak that way about my Grammy and hey, wait a second. Wait. Delta T could equal alpha sub-zero."
Sheldon,"It seems we have a choice to make. Abandon all ground rules in the name of science, or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship."
Amy,Thereês only one clear choice.
Sheldon,Science it is.
Amy,"No, you bonehead."
Sheldon,"Name calling, that is perfect. Now, when I get to this equation here, really let me have it. You know? If it helps, Iêm not the sharpest dresser."
Leonard,"Anyway, I know itês silly, but since Raj moved in, Iêve been feeling a little left out."
Penny,"Well, sweetie, thatês crazy."
Raj,"No, no, Penny, donêt dismiss his feelings."
Leonard,Thank you. I just feelÑ
Raj,"Hang on, Iêm not saying that his feelings arenêt crazy. I just donêt want him to think that this isnêt a safe place."
Leonard,"Well, to be truthfulÑ"
Penny,"Well, why wouldnêt this be a safe place? I mean, heês surrounded by his wife and one of his best friends."
Raj,I donêt want to speak for Leonard.
Leonard,Thank you. IÑ
Raj,"But when youêre insecure, no amount of external validation can ever make you feel safe."
Penny,"Yeah, youêre right. You know, youêre really sensitive about this kind of stuff."
Raj,Iêm a good listener.
Leonard,"Hey, Olsen twinsÑ"
Leonard,"Well, I mean, Iêm sitting right here. Youêre talking about my feelings and somehow leaving me out of the conversation."
Raj,Iêm sorry. What did you want to say?
Leonard,"I donêt know, you pretty much covered it."
Sheldon,Can you read them back?
Amy,"Revised ground rule number one, we are on the same team, but it is a competition."
Sheldon,"Excellent. Excellent. And on a related point, youêre going down, punk."
Amy,"Revised ground rule number two, there are definitely stupid questions, and those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face."
Sheldon,I love that one.
Amy,"Thanks, babe. Number three, fair topics for insult include educational pedigree, scientific field, intellectual prowess, and mamas."
Sheldon,"Yeah, that list is strong. Like your motherês urge to be promiscuous with sailors."
Penny,"Hey, Leonard, if youêre not busy tomorrow, I have to do a little reception after work."
Leonard,"Oh, I would, but we need to make a push on the air force project."
Penny,"Oh, are you sure? Weêre celebrating our new ADD drug, and itêll probably be over in, like, six minutes."
Amy,Did you say you guys are working on the guidance system tomorrow?
Leonard,"Yeah, why?"
Amy,"Well, Sheldon said that he was gonna work with me on our quantum perception project."
Leonard,Weêve had this planned for a week.
Amy,"Well, he reconfirmed with me this morning."
Raj,"Guys, before this gets ugly, remember, the winner gets Sheldon."
Penny,"Hey, Raj, do you want to go with me tomorrow?"
Raj,"Are you asking because you want me there or out of pity? Actually, never mind, donêt answer. Iêd love to."
Amy,Why did you tell Leonard youêre working on the gyroscope tomorrow?
Sheldon,Because I am.
Amy,But you said you were working with me.
Penny,Uh-oh. Someoneês got two dates to the nerd prom.
Sheldon,"I have a plan to work on both projects simultaneously. And for your information, the summer conference on algebraic topology at Caltech is nerd prom."
Leonard,"Iêm sorry, what is this plan you have?"
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm not needed at both places at the same time. And I can also free up extra hours with simple tricks, such as using a minimal amount of words to convey my point."
Leonard,When does that start?
Sheldon,"Soon. See, I couldêve said in the near future, but I didnêt say in the near future, because in the near future is three more words than soon. In, one, the, two, near, three, future, four. See, in the near future is four, soon is just one, four is more than one, saving time already."
Raj,"Genius. I was gonna say, why does anyone think Sheldonês a genius? But I didnêt."
Sheldon,"Gentlemen, Iêve got Amy up and running. Shall we get to work?"
Howard,"Uh, before we do, what are you wearing, oh, friend who we pretend is normal?"
Sheldon,"These are hydration backpacks. For efficiency, whenever Iêm thirsty I have access to water. When Iêm hungry, I have lentil soup."
Leonard,Itês getting harder to pretend.
Howard,"Anyway, Sheldon, weêre at a decision point to run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler or through the vacuum filter."
Sheldon,Run down the pros and cons of each for me.
Howard,"Well, if we run the xenon stream through the cryo-cooler, itêll be cooled immediately before it reacts with the conduction."
Sheldon,"Oh, sorry, uh, carrot chunk."
Howard,You can just feel the time being saved.
Sheldon,"Ah, Iêm back, you got me for eight minutes."
Amy,"Sheldon, this is silly. You canêt expect us to do quality work with you popping in and out like this."
Sheldon,"The coefficient isnêt lambda, itês lambda sub one. And over here, you should consider the possibility that the brain itself is in two different quantum states. And lastly, do you have any little soup crackers?"
Howard,The rate of spinning for the central axis centrifuge has to be four revolutions per second.
Leonard,"It canêt be four revolutions, itês got to be seven."
Howard,"Seven? Look at the board, itês four."
Leonard,"Oh, my God, itês seven."
Sheldon,Itês five and a half.
Howard,"Son of a bitch, itês five and a half."
Sheldon,BRB. Thatês short for be right back. Iêm saving so much time.
Sheldon,The two signals meet up in the corpus callosum and T equals zero. And I know a boy who just earned a slurp of soup.
Amy,"Incredible. Sheldon, I didnêt expect that you could work on both projects, but I, I was wrong."
Sheldon,"You know, I felt the same way about the spork. Uh, solids and liquids handled by one utensil? Thatêll never work. Spoiler, works."
Leonard,"I got to admit, we didnêt think youêd be able to do two things at once."
Sheldon,"Yeah, I felt the same way about the platypus. You know, bird and mammal in the same creature? No way. And spoiler, way."
Bernadette,No problem.
Bernadette,Already cleared the browser history.
Bernadette,Trying to catch up on office e-mails before I go back.
Bernadette,"Yeah, I mean, Iêll miss Halley, but itêll be nice to get out of the house, be intellectually stimulated. Go out to lunch instead of, you know, be lunch."
Bernadette,"Yeah, I mean, with you and my parents, sheês gonna be fine."
Bernadette,And that day care is great.
Bernadette,"Plus, I, I think Iêm setting a good example for Halley, to show her that women can be mothers and still have satisfying careers. Sure, she wonêt know where I went or if Iêm ever coming back. Thatêll just make the ten minutes between when I get home and her bedtime even more special."
Bernadette,"Itês okay, Iêm just being emotional about this. Can you not tell Howard?"
Bernadette,"Donêt you think itêd be healthier if you had your own apartment, grown man?"
Penny,"Hey, since when do you do laundry on a Thursday?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I had an accident at work, I slipped and fell on my soup sack."
Penny,"You know, there was a time I would say whatês a soup sack? But Iêm glad weêre past that.  You know, there was a time I would say God bless you, and then you would say if you must invoke an imaginary deity, how about Thor? And I would say, how do you know I didnêt mean Thor? And then you would say Touch_, and that there ends the tale of why I no longer say"
Sheldon,"Well, we have had some fun, havenêt we?"
Penny,"Oh, yeah. So, Leonard tells me youêve had a busy day."
Sheldon,"Hmm? Oh, I did. It hasnêt stopped. I figured out a solution for our navigation system while I was pre-soaking lentils out of my pants."
Penny,Are you getting sick?
Sheldon,Of course not. Iêm too busy to be sick.
Penny,"Well, youêre pretty delicate. Maybe you shouldnêt be pushing yourself so hard."
Sheldon,Iêm fine.
Penny,"All right. Well, weêll just pretend that you didnêt catch a cold watching Frozen."
Sheldon,That didnêt happen.
Penny,You also got a nosebleed watching Up.
Sheldon,Just do your laundry.
Bernadette,"Stuart, you didnêt have to make dinner."
Howard,"Hey, whatês for dinner?"
Howard,"Oh, cool."
Bernadette,Stuart made it.
Howard,"Oh, cool. Hey, I was thinking maybe we take Halley to the zoo this weekend, get in a little family time before you go back to work."
Bernadette,Sounds great.
Howard,"Speaking of which, for day care, itêll be easy for me to drop her off, unless you want to do it."
Bernadette,"Hmm, guess it should be me."
Howard,You okay?
Bernadette,"Of course, why?"
Howard,"Well, I donêt know, you seem a little upset."
Bernadette,"No, Iêm fine."
Howard,You sure?
Amy,"Sheldon, youêre sick, go back to bed."
Sheldon,"I am fine. Here, eat your toast.  Sorry."
Amy,"Itês okay, now I donêt need butter."
Sheldon,"Well, perhaps I am a little under the weather. Itês nothing a little cold medicine and tea canêt fix."
Amy,You need sleep.
Sheldon,What I need is to get to work.
Amy,"Well, I donêt want your germs around me."
Sheldon,"You hold my hand, you kiss my mouth, but you draw the line at a hundred and two fever? What happened to our love?"
Amy,"Sheldon, are you okay?"
Sheldon,Whatês going on? Howêd I get here?
Leonard,"I donêt know, we came home from work and we found you."
Sheldon,Home from work? What time is it?
Penny,Itês nine oêclock. 
Sheldon,Nine oêclock? What happened to eight and seven and all the other oêclocks?
Raj,"Wait, you donêt remember?"
Sheldon,"Well, I remember waking up in the morning, Amy rubbing Vicks on my chest. And her hands were like two frozen chunks of tundra. I took some cold medicine toÑ I took cold medicine."
Leonard,You did seem a little loopy when you showed up at the lab.
Sheldon,"At, at the lab? Why am I naked from the waist down?"
Raj,"I donêt know where your pants are, but we did find your underwear in a pot on the stove."
Sheldon,"My pants are missing, I donêt remember anything. Penny, this is your youth. What do I do?"
Penny,"I donêt know, check your body for tattoos?"
Sheldon,"Leonard, would you be a lamb?"
Leonard,Sheês kidding.
Sheldon,"Wait, wait. Whereês my bag? My phone and my wallet are in my bag."
Raj,Itês right here.
Sheldon,"Whereês my notebook? My notebookês gone. Oh, no. "
Penny,"Okay, itês just a notebook, whatês the big deal?"
Sheldon,Whatês the big deal? Itês full of classified information about the air force project.
Leonard,How could you lose that?
Amy,"Itês okay, Iêm sure weêll find it."
Penny,"Look, itês got to be around here somewhere."
Amy,Maybe itês wherever your pants are.
Raj,"Nope, pants in the microwave, no notebook."
Howard,"Look, somethingês going on with Bernadette. She say anything to you?"
Howard,"Come on, be honest. Did you tell her I tried her breast pump?"
Howard,"Well, I know sheês mad at me about something."
Howard,"Oh, gosh, how much time do you have?"
Howard,"Hmm, letês see. Mm. Okay, here we go, six years ago, I got a call that Bernieês great-aunt, Trixie, died. "
Howard,And I forgot to give her the message.
Howard,"The terrible part is, ever since then, Iêve been sending Bernie Christmas cards from Trixie."
Howard,"Let me finish, and one card had five dollars in it I took from Bernieês purse."
Penny,The notebook isnêt in the bathroom.
Amy,"I canêt find it, either. How can he not remember a day?"
Penny,"Well, people who are abducted by aliens lose time. I mean, maybe it happens to the aliens, too."
Leonard,"Well, itês not across the hall."
Sheldon,Thatês it. Iêm in breach of my security clearance. Iêm going to prison. And you know what happens to people like me in prison. Iêll be forced to be some large manês tutor.
Raj,Youêre not going to prison.
Leonard,"But, boy, it is funny to think about."
Amy,You really canêt remember anything?
Sheldon,Iêm trying.
Raj,"Wait a minute. Hey, let me see your phone."
Raj,"Well, itês, itês possible it was tracking everywhere you went."
Amy,Phones can do that?
Raj,"Yeah, it depends on the privacy settings."
Penny,"Oh, that, thatês so cool. How do you, how do you turn that thing off?"
Leonard,"Relax. I know when you go for a run, you stop for a donut."
Penny,"I donêt even run there, I drive."
Raj,"Hang on, I can see every place you went."
Sheldon,What does it say?
Raj,"Uh, you were in the building, you were at the university, then you were somewhere on Colorado Boulevard."
Raj,"Wait, hang on. Did you go to a cowboy bar?"
Sheldon,"I, no, that is preposterous. Maybe."
Howard,"Hey, howês it going?"
Howard,Good. Love you.
Bernadette,"Love you, too."
Howard,Love you more. 
Bernadette,"Okay, you won. Can I finish what Iêm doing?"
Howard,"Sure, sorry. "
Bernadette,Something on your mind?
Howard,"No, no, nothing. Okay, well, maybe Iêm just feeling like somethingês bothering you."
Bernadette,"Nope, all good."
Howard,"Prove it, make love to me right now on the kitchen floor."
Bernadette,"No, what is wrong with you?"
Howard,"Aha, you are upset. I donêt know a lot about women, but I know I upset them."
Bernadette,"Howard, Iêm sorry if Iêm being weird, but it has nothing to do with you."
Howard,It doesnêt?
Bernadette,"I didnêt want to tell you, but Iêm having a really tough time about going back to work."
Howard,"Oh. Okay, well, I get that. It was hard for me when I went back."
Bernadette,It was?
Howard,Of course. I missed you and the baby and being able to watch Ellen every day.
Bernadette,"I just donêt know what the right thing to do is. If I go back to work, Iêm abandoning Halley. If I donêt go, Iêm giving up everything I worked for. Itês like thereês no right choice."
Howard,"Look, I donêt know what the best decision is, either. But whatever we choose, if weêre not happy, we can undo it."
Bernadette,I guess.
Howard,"And the best part is Halley wonêt remember a thing. Babies are cute, but theyêre dumb. I mean, I go like this, she thinks Iêm gone, then magically Iêm back. I mean honestly, why are we saving for college?"
Bernadette,Iêm not crazy about you calling our baby dumb.
Raj,Does this place look familiar?
Sheldon,Itês hard to say.
Sheldon,Itês getting clearer.
Sheldon,"Uh, no, thank you. We now know why MasterCard sent me a fraud alert."
Leonard,Ask him.
Sheldon,"Um, yes. Howdy, partner. Do you happen to recollect if I left a notebook in these here parts?"
Raj,These here parts?
Sheldon,"Itês called fitting in. By the way, good luck."
Sheldon,"Oh, thank goodness."
Leonard,You understood the math?
Leonard,Thatês just great.
Sheldon,I swear.
Sheldon,Not to tell anyone.
Sheldon,The top secret military information Iêm about to tell you.
Sheldon,We really need to skedaddle. Thank you.
Sheldon,Thank you for making me tea.
Amy,Youêre welcome. How is it?
Sheldon,Yummy. And warm on my back.
Amy,Do you need anything else?
Sheldon,You know exactly what I need.
Amy,"Fine. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."
Sheldon,Thatês nice. Now in German.
Amy,"Weiches K_tzchen, warmes K_tzchen, das nie und nimmer murrt. Liebes K_tzchen, médes K_tzchen, schnurrt, schnurrt, schnurrt."
Sheldon,Great. Now Mandarin.
Amy,Sings in Mandarin. *
Sheldon,Now Navajo.
Sheldon,"All right, weêre about to go live, everyone on their A-game, good energy. Hello. Iêm Dr. Sheldon Cooper."
Amy,And Iêm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.
Sheldon,"And welcome to a special retrospective, where we will take a look back at the history of Fun with Flags on an episode weêre callingÑ"
Howard,Wondering how it all began?
Raj,Youêll need a good attention span.
Howard,For information and entertainment.
Raj,Thatês equally effective.
Sheldon,"Mind you, when we say behind the flags, we donêt literally mean these flags. Thatês just where we have dinner."
Amy,"Now, Iêm sure many of you are wondering how Fun with Flags began. "
Sheldon,"So letês hear from some people who were there at the very start. How, Howard, flashback sounds."
Amy,Could have played that on my harp.
Sheldon,Just roll the clip.  So tell us in your own words about that magical moment when Fun with Flags was born.
Leonard,I honestly donêt remember.
Sheldon,"Sure you do. I was telling you both the story about how Haiti and Lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag. It was at the Summer Olympics of 1936, and two plucky nationsÑ"
Penny,"Oh, wait. I remember."
Sheldon,"Oh, and do you remember what you said?"
Penny,Yes. Please find someone who cares.
Sheldon,And thatês exactly what I did. I found a lot of someones. 
Amy,Almost 200. Many of them on purpose.
Sheldon,"And now weêre going to turn it over to you, the viewers, to call in and share your favourite Fun with Flags moments. "
Amy,"And donêt get discouraged if the phone lines are jammed. Just keep trying.  Oh, thank God, welcome to Fun with Flags."
Sheldon,"Hello, Bert. What is your flag-related comment or query?"
Amy,And what does that have to do with flags?
Sheldon,"Bert, youêre tying up the line. My apologies to all of you trying to call in with legitimate flag comments."
Amy,"Ooh, ooh. All right. We have our next caller."
Howard,"Should we get lunch or you want to eat at the zoo? Oh, Howie, I donêt need food as long as I can look at my phone."
Bernadette,I donêt like when you imitate me.
Howard,You want to hear my Stuart? Itês been a while since Iêve gone on a date. You mind if we watch the monkeys doing it?
Howard,This is supposed to be our family fun day. Whatês so important on your phone?
Bernadette,Iêm on the day careês website.
Howard,Stop looking at that. The day careês great. Itês on campus. My office is two minutes away. Thereês nothing to worry about.
Bernadette,What if she likes the people who work there more than us?
Howard,She already likes soap bubbles more than us.
Bernadette,"When I go back to work, weêre gonna leave her with these people. We donêt know anything about them."
Howard,Theyêre highly-trained educators with background checks. Theyêre even required to be current on all vaccinations.
Sheldon,Whereês Howard?
Raj,He took the day off.
Sheldon,"Oh, letês take advantage of his absence and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get. Iêll go first. Okay, here. Uh, Heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer. And the policeman says, did you know you were going 85 miles per hour? And Heisenberg says, darn it, now I donêt know where I am."
Leonard,So Howard back Monday?
Sheldon,"Oh, hello."
Leonard,Hey. Want to join us?
Sheldon,"Ah-ah-ah, heês a geologist, and I have more physics jokes."
Raj,"Oh, quick, sit."
Leonard,"So, Sheldon says you have a new girlfriend."
Sheldon,"Yeah, which he rudely announced on my flag show. People were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night."
Raj,"Well, Iêm very happy for you."
Leonard,"Hey, weêre all having dinner tonight. Why donêt the two of you join us?"
Sheldon,Hold on. We donêt know anything about this woman. 
Sheldon,Is she a geologist?
Sheldon,"Oh great, see you at seven. "
Howard,How about after this we go see the exotic bird show?
Howard,Learning anything?
Bernadette,"Well, sloth babies cling to their mothersê bodies for almost a year. Iêm going back to work after only four months, so Iêve learned I hate myself, I hate sloths, and I hate you for bringing me here."
Howard,"Me I get, but that sloth is pretty cute."
Bernadette,Itês not just the sloth. Polar bears nurse their cubs for almost eight months. The orangutan mother builds her baby a new home every night. And what do I do? I choose my career over my child.
Raj,Canêt believe Bert has a girlfriend and I donêt.
Amy,I thought you were taking a break from women to focus on your career.
Raj,"Oh, grow up."
Leonard,Donêt you have any friends he can date?
Penny,"Hey, I already set up Howard and Bernadette. Itês your turn to ruin some poor girlês life."
Raj,"Oh, hey, guys. Come in."
Sheldon,Sheês younger and far more attractive than he is. Theyêre copying you two.
Howard,What are you making?
Howard,Finally get Halley down?
Bernadette,"Yeah, eventually. Sheês still not happy about taking a bottle, though."
Howard,"Look, if youêre not ready to go back to work, weêll figure something out."
Bernadette,"No, Iêll be fine. "
Howard,"I mean, why would you say that?"
Bernadette,It would be nice to raise Halley to be a little more independent than you were.
Howard,I guess. It wasnêt until college that I learned you can put a thermometer in your mouth.
Penny,So is this your first time dating a scientist? ‚Cause Iêm thinking of starting a support group.
Sheldon,"Bert, Rebecca. Iêd like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier."
Sheldon,See? It was fine. I didnêt need a time-out.
Amy,It wasnêt a time-out. Letês get some food.
Sheldon,You made me sit on the stairs and think about what I did.
Amy,Get your food.
Raj,So how did you two meet?
Leonard,Is that it?
Raj,Thatês nice. I havenêt had much success meeting people online.
Sheldon,"Whatêd you do, delete your photo?"
Amy,And donêt you slam that door.
Sheldon,"Aw, man."
Leonard,"No, itês always him."
Penny,", Bert, you were telling us how you updated your profile?"
Amy,I was wrong. You can come back in.
Leonard,"So, Rebecca, how did you become a personal trainer?"
Sheldon,"Iêd say sheês copying you again, but Iêm getting tired of sitting in the hall."
Raj,Iêd love a personal trainer. I havenêt seen my abs since they opened a Shake Shack on my drive home.
Penny,"Oh, is that offer for everybody?"
Leonard,Nice try. Iêm not going.
Leonard,"Mm, just down there."
Penny,"Aw, thatês so weird."
Amy,"Iêm sorry, Bert, but arenêt you worried sheês only with you for your money?"
Sheldon,Your first date? Did you even measure her walls?
Penny,"You know, on our first date, Leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel."
Leonard,And we lived happily ever after. 
Penny,The end.
Bernadette,"Well, guess Iêm ready to go."
Howard,Have a great first day back.
Bernadette,You have everything she needs for day care?
Bernadette,"Okay. Okay, sweetie, Mommyês gonna go to work now, so you have fun today."
Howard,"I told her if day care is anything like prison, find the biggest baby and knock him out."
Bernadette,"Stop, youêre gonna make me cry."
Howard,"Great, now everybodyês crying."
Howard,Thatês good.
Bernadette,"Sheês not gonna see us all day, and she doesnêt even care."
Sheldon,Whoês ready to laugh?
Sheldon,"Okay. So, Feynman, Einstein and Schrodinger walk into a bar. Feynman says, it appears"
Leonard,Thatês actually funny.
Raj,You should send that to Jimmy Fallon.
Leonard,"Oh, hello. Join us."
Raj,"Hey. Yeah. Hey, sorry if last night was awkward."
Leonard,"Wow, thatês a big step."
Raj,I think it shows a lot of character.
Sheldon,"Thatês a good one. Okay, now, Leonard, you tell a joke."
Bernadette,Howês she doing?
Howard,Sheês great. Look.
Bernadette,"I see a wall, floor, some Asian baby, there she is."
Howard,See? Nothing to worry about.
Bernadette,"Thank you. Okay, Iêm gonna try and get some work done."
Howard,"Yeah, me, too. Love you."
Bernadette,"Love you, too. Bye."
Howard,What are you doing here?
Howard,I get it. I havenêt even made it to my office yet.
Howard,Probably. We should go.
Howard,"Iêll get her, you grab her bag. "
Amy,What are you looking at?
Sheldon,"Comments from our Behind the Flags retrospective. Get this, people are calling it the longest one yet."
Leonard,Is that Bert?
Penny,I think itês Bert.
Raj,"Hey, whatês up?"
Amy,"Oh. You know, good for you."
Sheldon,Heês not wrong. It was your crackpot idea that he deserves love.
Amy,"You know, you need to start raising your hand before you speak. Yes, starting now."
Penny,"Bert, youêre a good guy, you deserve a woman whoês interested in more than just your money."
Leonard,"If youêre that upset, go get her back."
Raj,"No, you didnêt. Okay? Look, Bert, when I had money, I dated lots of girls who werenêt right for me. And then I gave up my money, and now Iêm alone and living with my friends, and somebody else should probably talk now."
Penny,"Look, sweetie, relationships arenêt about money, okay? Itês about respect and having things in common andÑ yes, Sheldon?"
Sheldon,You and Leonard donêt have anything in common. Maybe you should break up.
Leonard,You called on him.
Howard,Itês Halley. Unless somebody else put an X on the bottom of their kidês foot.
Bernadette,You realize they called when you took her.
Howard,Guess whoês home from the aquarium?
Leonard,You donêt have to go. Youêre welcome to hang with us.
Sheldon,"Actually, our friendship group is at capacity. But if anybody drops out, youêre at the top of the list. Unless itês Raj, in which case, weêll probably get a person of colour."
Raj,I feel bad for Bert.
Sheldon,So heês using his money to attract a mate. Is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract Amy? Or Leonard using his power of grovelling to get Penny?
Leonard,"Itês totally different. Bertês money might run out, but I can beg until the end of time."
Penny,All that and heês shorter than me.
Raj,"Sheldon, what did Amy have that attracted you?"
Sheldon,"Oh, so many things. Her mind, her kindness, and especially her body."
Amy,Relax. Weêre the same blood type. He knew he could harvest an organ.
Howard,She does look happy.
Bernadette,See? This is the right thing for her. Letês all just go to work.
Bernadette,"Let me just say good-bye. Halley. Look at Mommy. Over here, honey. Say good-bye to Mommy. Look at me. Look at your mother. All right, we can go."
Sheldon,Hello. Iêm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
Amy,And Iêm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.
Sheldon,"Based on the glowing reception of our recent Behind the Flags retrospective, we thought you might like to see how it all came together. "
Amy,"So welcome to tonightês episode, "
Sheldon,"Ooh, we already have our first call."
Amy,"Oh. Hello, youêre on Fun with Flags."
Leonard,Weêre pinned down.
Howard,We canêt get through.
Raj,"Sheldon, get over here and help."
Sheldon,"Okay, one second."
Leonard,"Sheldon, why are you jumping up and down?"
Sheldon,Iêm trying to shoot.
Howard,"Then use the shoot button, not the wonderful thing about Tiggers button."
Raj,"Thatês it, weêre dead."
Howard,"Okay, challenge them again."
Leonard,"Doing it right now. Oh, they canêt. Thereês an important Little League game tomorrow."
Howard,"No wonder they beat us, theyêre jocks."
Sheldon,What happened to me? I used to excel at these things.
Howard,Kids are always better at video games.
Sheldon,"Well, I donêt like it."
Leonard,"Mm, if it makes you feel better, you still dress like a child."
Sheldon,"No, but itês not just video games. I downloaded the new O.S. for my phone, took me a week to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone."
Howard,"Oh, so our love is not real?"
Raj,"Well, I know how you feel. I tried one of those electronic Japanese toilets, practically shot myself across the room."
Sheldon,"I guess I just need to face it, Iêm no longer a wunderkind. Now I just wonder whatês for lunch."
Leonard,Hot dogs.
Penny,I didnêt know you could drink while youêre breastfeeding.
Bernadette,"Yeah, they say the yeast in beer helps with milk production."
Amy,"Iêm pretty sure thatês a myth, let me check."
Bernadette,Ruin it for me and Iêll break this glass over your head.
Amy,To denial.
Penny,Ooh. Iêm gonna get another. You want food?
Bernadette,"Yeah, breastfeeding burns, like, 5,000 calories a day. Do not touch that phone."
Penny,"Oh, Zack. Hey."
Penny,"Well, itês a bar, so pretty good. Uh, whatês new?"
Penny,"Well, congratulations."
Penny,"No, on, on getting engaged, good for you."
Penny,"Yes, yes, heês working for the government on an infinite persistence gyroscope. Of course, the first time I say it right, heês not even here."
Penny,"Uh, yeah, sure, Iêll check with Leonard."
Sheldon,Iêve been thinking about our recent humiliation.
Leonard,Youêre gonna have to be more specific.
Sheldon,At the hands of those teenagers.
Sheldon,Boy teenagers.
Leonard,"Oh, the video game. Yeah, that was bad."
Sheldon,"I started doing some reading on cognitive vitality, and I came across an area of research called super-aging."
Raj,"You know whoês a super-ager? Jennifer Lopez. Like, what is her secret?"
Howard,"Now, this is rare. I donêt know which one of you I want to stop talking first."
Sheldon,"The theory is that if you really tax your brain, the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous."
Raj,Like J-Loês hair.
Howard,"Boy, it is neck and neck right now."
Leonard,"How is super-aging any different than, like, doing crossword puzzles?"
Sheldon,"Well, itês not just doing simple cognitive tasks. You need to push your brain out of its comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion."
Leonard,"I drive you to work every day, my brain must look like the Hulk."
Raj,"If you really want to challenge yourself, you could learn to speak Hindi."
Sheldon,Jab mein aat saal ka tha maine seekha tha.  
Raj,"Could you say that in English? I actually, I never learned Hindi."
Penny,"Hey, you ready to go?"
Leonard,"Yeah, I guess."
Penny,Whatês the matter?
Leonard,"Honestly? Itês a little strange having dinner with your ex-boyfriend, and itês not like we have a lot to talk about."
Penny,"He loves you, okay? And heês interested in your work. You could talk about the infinite perspectiveÑ I swear I know it."
Leonard,"Itêll be fine, letês just go."
Penny,"Well, and his fianc_e will be there, so you know, if the conversation lags, we can talk about their wedding."
Penny,"Come on, I spent an entire plane ride with you talking about the trailer for Deadpool 2."
Leonard,"Ha, I knew you werenêt asleep."
Penny,"Hi. Hey, whereês your fianc_e?"
Penny,"Oh, no, what happened?"
Amy,What smells so good?
Sheldon,Raj is teaching me to make croissants.
Amy,Is this part of your super-aging?
Sheldon,"Yes. Yeah, it seemed daunting at first, but then I realized, itês like the chemistry set I had as a kid. Only, when your brother eats this, no one has to call Poison Control."
Raj,"Okay. Shall we? Oh, my God. Itês light, itês flaky, itês buttery. You donêt need to have sex with him, just eat one of these."
Sheldon,"Yes, it is delicious. Physicist, baker, lover, what canêt I do?"
Amy,"Well, clearly mental tasks are not enough. Maybe you need to challenge your motor skills."
Sheldon,"For the last time, I am not having a tickle fight with you."
Raj,"You want a real challenge, try keeping me from eating more of these."
Sheldon,Youêre just using food to mask the fear that youêre fundamentally unlovable and therefore going to be alone forever.
Raj,"Damn it, heês good at that, too."
Leonard,"I have Sheldon, that keeps most people away."
Leonard,"Oh, I know what heês saying, and heês not, heês not funny."
Penny,"Uh, itês okay, Iêm still in pharmaceutical sales."
Leonard,"Sheês doing amazing. She can actually make a side effect, like 10% chance of liver failure, sound like a 90% chance of liver success."
Penny,"Yeah, lying isnêt my favourite part of the job. Actually, Iêm not crazy about a lot of it."
Penny,"Oh, thatês a nice offer."
Penny,"Right, êcause it spells menu."
Howard,"All right, this is everything. What do you want to learn?"
Sheldon,"It really doesnêt matter, as long as itês challenging."
Howard,"Okay, well, how about, oh, I teach you some close-up magic."
Sheldon,"Howard, Iêm trying to make myself uncomfortable, not everyone else."
Bernadette,So you wanted to learn something physical and you came to Howard Wolowitz?
Howard,"Hey, the circus arts are very physically and mentally demanding. Have you ever tried to juggle?"
Bernadette,"Yes, Iêm juggling my love for you and my embarrassment of you right now."
Howard,"And itês hard, isnêt it? So the key is, the moment one ball is at the top of its arc, you toss the next one. Hmm?"
Sheldon,"Okay, I think I got that."
Howard,"Uh, hold on. Thereês an old saying in juggling."
Bernadette,Is it Iêm going to die alone?
Howard,"No, itês if you want to have fun, start with one. Yours we think, but we do not say. All right, just toss it up and catch it a few times, get comfortable with it."
Sheldon,"Okay. Just to be on the safe side, am I in any danger of getting jugglerês elbow?"
Sheldon,Are you sure? ‚Cause Iêm feeling a twinge.
Penny,"See, that wasnêt so bad. He even picked up the check."
Leonard,"Yeah. Although, when he was trying to figure out the tip, Iêm pretty sure I saw smoke coming out of his ears. Youêre not really considering working for him, are you?"
Penny,"Well, maybe, I mean, it seems kind of perfect. I have sales experience, and Iêve been a waitress, so I have restaurant experience, and if heês figuring out my Christmas bonus, we could buy a boat."
Leonard,Donêt you think it might be a little weird to work for someone you used to date?
Penny,"You work with Sheldon, you tell me."
Leonard,"Yeah, itês weird."
Penny,"Okay, are you seriously jealous of me working with Zack?"
Leonard,"No, no, Iêm not jealous, I just think you have got a good thing going where you are right now, and you make great money and you havenêt slept with any of your co-workers."
Penny,"Great, so you want me to stay at a job Iêm not happy at?"
Penny,You okay? You kind of look like Zack trying to figure out that tip.
Leonard,"Of course I donêt want you to be unhappy, but I also want you to be smart, and working for an ex-boyfriend isnêt very smart. You donêt have to stop, just slow down, Iêll jump out."
Sheldon,"Amy, look, Iêm on a unicycle!"
Amy,How did you get from croissants to a unicycle?
Sheldon,I hurt myself juggling.
Amy,Where did you get it?
Sheldon,"Howard said I could borrow it, Bernadette said forever."
Amy,Have you tried letting go of the rope?
Sheldon,are you crazy? Iêm on a unicycle.
Amy,"All right, well, have fun."
Sheldon,"Wait, I need help getting down."
Amy,"Well, what do you want me to do?"
Sheldon,"Drag out our mattress and put it over here, then go across the hall, get their mattress and put it over here. But before you do any of that, scratch my nose."
Howard,So you told her she was being dumb?
Leonard,"No, I told her she was being not smart. Which was dumb."
Raj,Why did you even go to dinner with the guy?
Leonard,"We covered this, Iêm dumb."
Penny,"So heês my ex-boyfriend, who cares? I canêt believe Leonard would be so insecure."
Bernadette,Really? I have no trouble believing that at all.
Penny,And Zackês engaged. Leonard has no reason to feel threatened.
Bernadette,"Weêre talking about the same Leonard, right?"
Leonard,So you think itês fine if she works for Zack?
Howard,"I donêt know, maybe."
Raj,"Well, he is much more attractive than Leonard."
Howard,"Yes, but thatês gonna be true of a lot of guys she works for."
Leonard,"Yeah, but she also used to sleep with Zack."
Bernadette,I would never let Howard work with an ex.
Penny,you wouldnêt trust him?
Bernadette,I wouldnêt trust her. Heês thin and sexy like a Jewish greyhound.
Penny,"Yeah, that, that is the sexiest dog."
Bernadette,And Iêd like to think Howie wouldnêt take a job I was uncomfortable with.
Penny,‚Cause heês scared of you?
Howard,"You know what? Iêm with Leonard, this isnêt cool."
Leonard,Thank you.
Raj,"I disagree. Penny is a strong, independent woman. The more you try to control her, the more sheêll push back."
Leonard,So you think itês okay?
Raj,"Oh, no, sheês gonna leave you for someone, might as well get it over with."
Amy,What are you doing?
Sheldon,Iêm returning this stuff to Howard.
Amy,"Oh. Well, Bernadette made me promise if you didnêt want it, weêd give it to a homeless clown. What happened to learning the unicycle?"
Sheldon,"Oh, I stopped that, it was dumb. Uni, bi, tri, menstrual, all cycles are dumb."
Amy,"You said juggling was dumb, too."
Sheldon,"Well, it is. If I wanted to hold three things at once, Iêd wear cargo pants."
Amy,"Sheldon, is it possible that when things get really difficult, you just give up?"
Sheldon,Are you calling me a quitter?
Amy,"Well, if you honestlyÑ"
Sheldon,This conversation is over.
Amy,"His mother warned me. Everybody warned me. Actually, he warned me."
Penny,You want to talk?
Leonard,That doesnêt seem to be where I shine. How about I just give you one of these?
Penny,"Look, we can have a reasonable conversation and I wonêt get mad. I donêt like it after sex, and I donêt like it now."
Leonard,"Yeah, sorry."
Penny,"Yeah. All right, just come here. Look, I get me working with Zack is weird and I donêt want you to be uncomfortable. "
Leonard,"Well, thanks. And I donêt want you to be stuck at a job you donêt like."
Penny,Then what do we do?
Leonard,"Well, I donêt love it, but if you really want to take this job, Iêll find a way to deal with it."
Penny,"No, I know youêll try, but itêll make you miserable, which will make me miserable, and Iêm just gonna stay where Iêm at for now."
Leonard,"No, no, no, no, youêre, youêre unhappy there and then youêre gonna blame me for making you stay, and itês fine, Iêll just, Iêll suck it up."
Penny,"You donêt need to do that, itês okay."
Leonard,"Yeah, see, now I feel terrible, like Iêm being selfish and holding you back. Say something. Yeah, that is pretty annoying."
Amy,I made you tea.
Sheldon,Thank you.
Amy,Iêm sorry I called you a quitter.
Sheldon,"Itês okay, I stopped being upset about that. And no, the irony is not lost on me."
Amy,What are you reading?
Sheldon,This article says the peak age for making a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is 40. 
Sheldon,So Iêm running out of time.
Amy,"Thatês ridiculous, youêre a brilliant man. The best years of your life are still ahead of you."
Sheldon,"Oh, you have to say that, youêre sweet on me."
Amy,"Well, if youêre really worried about your career, maybe you should consider spending a little less time with video games and comic books."
Sheldon,"Hey, I thought you were sweet on me."
Amy,"Okay, fine, letês say you never win a Nobel Prize. Letês say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you, not for what youêve accomplished but for who you are as a man. Wouldnêt that be a life well-lived?"
Sheldon,Youêre so cute. Iêm gonna go learn how to walk on stilts.
Amy,So many warnings.
Penny,"Okay, are you sure about this?"
Leonard,Absolutely. I just want you to be happy. And maybe a little turned on about how selfless Iêm being.
Penny,"Hey, uh, so Iêve been thinking about it and I want to take the job."
Penny,"Oh, so thereês no job?"
Penny,"Okay, thanks anyway. Bye. Well, his fianc_e thought the idea of us working together was stupid. You were right, I was wrong. Arenêt you gonna say anything?"
Leonard,Not if I want to be doing this later.
Bernadette,"Hey, I didnêt know you were home. Where you been?"
Howard,I went to see your mom.
Bernadette,"Seriously, where were you?"
Howard,"I just told you, your momês."
Howard,"Well, since you find my magic tricks so embarrassing, I got to wondering what cool hobbies you had as a kid."
Bernadette,Oh. Whatêd she say?
Howard,"She didnêt say much of anything. But she said a lot.  Hi, Bernadette, remember me?"
Bernadette,"First of all, thatês not what she sounds like, sheês from South Carolina."
Howard,I canêt believe you made fun of me all these years while you were a closeted ventriloquist.
Bernadette,"Okay, itês not like I wanted to be a ventriloquist. I was in beauty pageants and I needed a talent besides spreading rumours that the other contestants were pregnant."
Howard,"Well, since you enjoyed getting rid of all my stuff, you know, maybe we should throw this little lady in the wood chipper."
Bernadette,And the little lady has a name.
Howard,Which is?
Bernadette,Tammy Jo St. Cloud.
Howard,"Tammy Jo St. Cloud. Oh, and Iêm a dork for juggling."
Bernadette,"Sorry, youêre not a dork.  Look at him, what reason he got to feel good?"
Howard,"All right, very funny."
Bernadette,"Donêt listen to her, sheês been in a box for, like, 25 years.  Yeah, back when his haircut was fashionable."
Howard,"Thatês enough, put her away."
Bernadette,"Oh, big daddy, I donêt think so. You marry Miss Bernie, you marry me. We all family now."
Howard,"All right, youêre freaking me out."
Bernadette,"Donêt be that way. If you donêt mind a few splinters, we can have us a m_nage _ trois. Ooh."
Sheldon,"Iêm doing it. Iêm doing it. Iêm tall and Iêm doing it.  Ah, man."
Penny,"Champagne, champagne."
Leonard,Thank you.
Penny,"And for the worldês tallest second grader, apple juice."
Sheldon,"Thank you. No bendy straw, some party."
Leonard,"Hey, a toast. Thank you all for your support while we worked on our Air Force project. And please know that we could not have done it without you, so cheers."
Amy,"You know, itês nice of you to acknowledge us, but this is your accomplishment."
Bernadette,"Yeah, you guys did this all on your own."
Raj,Without me.
Sheldon,To success without Raj.
Bernadette,So what happens next?
Howard,"Phase two, we test it, perfect it, and hope to live long enough to see the movie based on our lives starring more attractive versions of us."
Sheldon,"Yeah, Iêll definitely live long enough. Vitamin C."
Leonard,"First thing tomorrow morning, weêre back at it."
Raj,Without me.
Sheldon,"I hope his character doesnêt make it into the movie, heês kind of a bummer."
Leonard,"Hmm. I donêt care if this thing is burning out my retinas, it makes me feel special. Now, before we field test, I think weÑ"
Howard,What the hell?
Leonard,Where is everything?
Sheldon,Who else has access to this room?
Leonard,"Itês a secure lab in a classified facility, only the U.S. government and us."
Sheldon,This is disconcerting. 
Howard,But the movie did just get good.
Leonard,"Sir, I, I, Iêm sorry but I just donêt get it. You came into our lab in the middle of the night and took our prototype and all of our research and didnêt even tell us?"
Howard,But why would you do that?
Sheldon,Where did you move it?
Leonard,Are you implementing phase two?
Sheldon,"Wait, so youêre just going to take all the work weêve done for the last year and toss us aside?"
Howard,This is all very upsetting.
Sheldon,"If thatês sarcasm, please save it for our enemies."
Raj,I may be moving out soon. I think I found a place to live.
Penny,"Oh, Iêm sorry to hear that."
Raj,Really? You kept sending me apartment listings.
Penny,"Um, well, I, yeah, you got me."
Amy,Where are you moving?
Penny,And when? But also where?
Raj,Bert has a room for rent.
Bernadette,So youêre gonna be roommates with Bert?
Raj,"Uh, no, itês, uh, pretty private, actually, itês over his garage. So the only time Iêll see him is when he pulls his car in, does his laundry or practices drums in my dining room."
Amy,"Well, good for you. I actually have a little news myself."
Penny,"Okay, weêre just gonna circle back to when heês moving out? Okay, thatês cool."
Amy,"I was, uh, asked to be a visiting researcher at Princeton."
Bernadette,"Hey, thatês amazing."
Penny,Good for you. 
Amy,"Thanks, but the thing is Iêll be gone for a few months and I donêt know how Sheldonês gonna feel about that."
Penny,"Oh, come on, heês a grown man, he can take care of himself."
Amy,You really believe that?
Penny,"Once again, you got me."
Howard,How can you work on something for a year and they just take it?
Leonard,I canêt believe the Air Force would treat us like that.
Sheldon,"You know, I have a good mind to stop paying my taxes. Itês too bad I enjoy doing them so much. The Air Force did it again. Theyêre erasing our lives."
Leonard,"Third floor, wrong apartment."
Howard,"Although, if anyoneês gonna clean out your apartment and disappear, itêd be Penny."
Leonard,"She might disappear, but sheês definitely not cleaning anything."
Sheldon,"Itês okay, everythingês here."
Penny,"Oh, hey, whatês going on?"
Leonard,"You wonêt believe it, the military confiscated our project."
Bernadette,Youêre kidding. Why would they do that?
Howard,They wouldnêt say.
Sheldon,"I feel so betrayed. You know, all my life I thought Uncle Sam was a friendly uncle who brought you presents. Turns out heês the other kind."
Amy,"Sheldon, Iêm so sorry."
Sheldon,Thank you. Can we just talk about something else?
Leonard,"Yeah, whatês going on with you guys?"
Howard,Give us some good news.
Penny,Amyês got some news.
Amy,"Yeah, um, Raj is moving out."
Leonard,"Oh, no. When?"
Bernadette,You doing okay?
Howard,Not really.
Bernadette,Want me to put on some Neil Diamond? That always makes you feel better.
Howard,"Then youêll get all sexed up and Iêm not in the mood. I mean, an entire year wasted."
Bernadette,You might be forgetting another accomplishment of the past year.
Howard,"Oh. Yeah, yeah, we brought life into the world. "
Bernadette,Really? Thatês the importance you put on us having a baby?
Howard,"Iêm happy about it, but, I mean, itês not like I did much. I mean, after the first three minutes it was pretty much all you."
Penny,"So, did you tell him about Princeton yet?"
Amy,"No, Iêm waiting till heês in a good mood."
Penny,"Oh, sweetie, you might not live that long."
Amy,"I donêt know, maybe I shouldnêt go."
Penny,"Oh, stop it, heêll be fine."
Amy,I guess. And heêll have you and Leonard right across the hall the whole time.
Amy,Got to go. Morning.
Sheldon,I apologize for exceeding my allotted bathroom time.
Amy,Are you feeling okay?
Sheldon,Not really. Apparently grief can make one less regular.
Amy,"Oh, Iêm sorry to hear that."
Sheldon,"No, I sat and I sat, but to no avail."
Amy,"Oh, the more details, the more sorry. Well, maybe thisêll cheer you up. I made your favorite oatmeal, plain."
Sheldon,Whatês the occasion?
Amy,"No occasion, I just wanted to do something nice for you."
Sheldon,"Youêre so kind. You know, I donêt know how I ever got by without you."
Amy,"Oh. Thatês sweet, but you, you did just fine on your own."
Sheldon,"Well, I thought that, too, but Iêve come to realize, I am completely dependent on you."
Amy,"Sheldon, youêre, youêre being silly."
Sheldon,"No, to wake up every morning and know youêre there is a great comfort to me. Mmm, tasteless. How do you do it?"
Amy,"You know, what you need to do is put this Air Force project behind you and just dive into something new."
Sheldon,"Well, there is our quantum cognition experiment. You and I could spend more time on that."
Amy,"Oh, I donêt know, I mean, letês say we succeed in proving that our consciousness creates reality. I mean, what will we have really accomplished? You know, a loaf of breadês still three bucks."
Sheldon,Iêm confused. Youêre always saying that you want to spend more time with me.
Amy,"That is true, I have said that."
Sheldon,"Well, a lot, itês very annoying. Has something changed? Um, is there something that youêre not telling me?"
Amy,I was offered a summer research fellowship at Princeton.
Sheldon,"Princeton? A fine institution. The place where Albert Einstein taught. And where Leonard got his PhD, so it may have gone downhill."
Amy,"Yeah, thatês the one."
Sheldon,"Well, thatês wonderful. Congratulations."
Amy,"Well, I havenêt accepted it yet. I wanted to talk to you first."
Sheldon,What is there to talk about? You have to take it. Itês important.
Amy,So are you.
Sheldon,"Thank you, but Iêll be fine."
Amy,"Are, are you sure?"
Sheldon,"Yes. I may have lost my guidance system and my girlfriend, but I still have a colon full of yesterdayês meals to keep me company. Although, thanks to your high fibre breakfast, Iêm sure thatêll be leaving me, too."
Bernadette,Really? He doesnêt put raisins or banana slices or anything in it?
Amy,I donêt think plain oatmeal was the point of that story.
Penny,"I mean, I like a little brown sugar."
Bernadette,"Youêre still gonna go, right?"
Amy,I donêt know. Sheldonês so vulnerable right now.
Penny,"Oh, come on. Look, if the roles were reversed, heêd be on the first train to New Jersey, or the second train if there were teenagers on the first one."
Bernadette,"Well, distance might be nice. The last time a big project ended for Howie, he wouldnêt stop following me around. He even went with me to get a mammogram."
Penny,"Well, whatês wrong with that?"
Bernadette,"No, he wanted to get one with me, like some kind of weird coupleês massage."
Penny,And yet you bore his child. Neato.
Bernadette,"Youêre excited about this opportunity, right?"
Amy,Of course. I get to be part of the first team to use radon markers to map the structures thatÑ
Penny,"Okay, a simple yes will do."
Bernadette,You have to go.
Amy,"I know, but what if SheldonÑ"
Penny,"Okay, listen to me. Your relationship can handle being long distance for a while. Itês not like you two are very physical."
Amy,"Hey, you donêt know what goes on behind closed doors."
Penny,A lot of lectures?
Amy,"All right, so you know."
Bernadette,"Iêm telling you, if you donêt go youêll end up regretting it."
Howard,"Hey, wait up."
Bernadette,"Oh, great."
Howard,You left something at home. A big hug.
Howard,I found it right next to these kisses.
Bernadette,Itês too late for me. Save yourself.
Leonard,"So, are you excited to have your own place again?"
Raj,"I am, but Iêll miss you guys."
Leonard,"Ah, weêll miss you, too."
Raj,You could try saying that without smiling.
Leonard,Iêm trying. This is the best I can do. What are you doing?
Sheldon,What does it look like? Iêm playing sad harmonica in an apartment as empty as my heart.
Sheldon,I got the blues. My baby done left me.
Raj,"Come on, Sheldon. Amyês only gone for a few months. And now that Iêm moving out, your old room is empty, so you can stay there whenever you want."
Leonard,"Uh, could I talk to you in the hall for a sec?"
Raj,"Yeah, sure."
Leonard,"Sheldon, youêre being silly."
Sheldon,"Am I? Yesterday I had an Air Force project, a girlfriend who lived with me, and my good friend Raj right across the hall."
Leonard,Do you really care about that last one?
Sheldon,"No, but that list was sounding a little thin."
Leonard,"Instead of dwelling on the negative, think about this. Your girlfriend was given an amazing opportunity, which gives you an opportunity to show her that youêre a loving and supportive boyfriend."
Sheldon,So trick her.
Leonard,"All right, let me start again. Uh, you and AmyÑ"
Raj,Can I get my stuff? Sounds like itês gonna be a while.
Howard,I missed you.
Bernadette,"Come here, letês talk."
Howard,Ooh. Sounds serious. Have I been a bad boy? Am I gonna get a spanking êcause you know.
Bernadette,"Just listen. I donêt know if you realize this, but whenever youêre between projects, you tend to get a little insecure."
Bernadette,A little clingy.
Howard,I know and Iêm sorry.
Bernadette,"Oh, oh, oh, okay, stop. Stop. I love when youêre affectionate, but this is not coming from a good place."
Howard,"Well, excuse me, but what did you do when you worked on that allergy drug for two years and the FDA shut down your project?"
Bernadette,I signed us up for ballroom dance class.
Howard,"Okay, and what did you do when they took you off the antifungal team?"
Bernadette,I made us have a baby.
Bernadette,Bring it in.
Howard,And now the movie just got rated R.
Amy,Hey. You going somewhere?
Sheldon,"No, but you are, so I got you this as a present."
Amy,"Sheldon, that isnêt necessary."
Sheldon,"No, it is. Leonard pointed out to me that Iêm not always a loving and supportive boyfriend, so hereês some quality luggage."
Amy,Thank you.
Sheldon,"The salesman said it could survive a plane crash, so perhaps you should fly inside it."
Amy,Does this mean youêre okay with me going?
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm not looking forward to it, but it is a wonderful opportunity and you need to take it. Besides, Princeton is in New Jersey, so itês not like youêre gonna want to stay. Uh, I know itês not your birthday, but if youêre interestedÑ"
Amy,I am.
Sheldon,"Okay. Oh, and just to be clear, Iêm not being intimate with you in order to keep you from going."
Amy,I wasnêt thinking that.
Sheldon,"Well, no, itês just, Iêm just warning you, you know, if you find yourself 3,000 miles away and craving a hit of this, you know, I canêt Skype it to you."
Amy,Thatês a risk Iêm willing to take.
Sheldon,"All right, then. Letês go to the bedroom, remove our clothes, fold them neatly and engage in frenzied lovemaking."
Amy,What if we donêt fold our clothes at all?
Sheldon,"Or, what if we fold them?"
Raj,"Well, hereês your key back."
Leonard,Thank you.
Raj,As soon as I have the place set up Iêm gonna have you guys over.
Penny,"Oh, we would love that."
Raj,"I really canêt thank you enough for taking me in. You know, I was in a pretty low place in my life."
Sheldon,"Oh, Amy, you naughty vixen."
Raj,"Anyway, uh, as I was saying, I was at a pretty low place in my life and, uh, if it wasnêt for friends"
Amy,"My goodness, that form of stimulation is highly efficient."
Raj,I canêt compete with that. Bye.
Leonard,Should we give them their privacy?
Penny,"I want to, but I donêt think I can."
Penny,"Okay, Iêm good now."
Amy,"Okay, the car is waiting. Do you want to walk me downstairs?"
Sheldon,"Of course. Here, here, let me. Iêve been doing a little research on New Jersey, and I was delighted to learn that their chief agricultural product is sod."
Amy,Is it?
Sheldon,"Hmm, yes. Yeah, perhaps Iêve been harder on them than they deserve."
Amy,Do you think itês possible you might enjoy being on your own for a little while?
Sheldon,Itês hard to say. Iêve never really lived by myself. What if I become strange and eccentric?
Amy,Iêll love you no matter what.
Sheldon,Howard Hughes saved his urine in milk bottles.
Amy,Weêll cross that bridge when we come to it.
Sheldon,And youêll text me when you arrive at the airport?
Amy,I will.
Sheldon,And when youêre at the gate?
Sheldon,And if you see any actors from Game of Thrones in first class?
Amy,"I donêt know what they look like, but sure."
Sheldon,And donêt forget to Skype me when you arrive.
Amy,I wonêt.
Sheldon,And every morning.
Amy,Got it.
Sheldon,"Now of course, my 9am is your noon, so letês avoid the whole good morning, good afternoon minefield, and letês just say hello. "
Amy,Good thinking.
Sheldon,"And just remember, I am proud of you and I support you in all that you do."
Amy,Thank you. That means a lot.
Sheldon,"Oh, and one last thing. If you find yourself working with a male scientist whoês as smart as me, as tall as me and has hair like Thor, well, then I want you to step away from the situation and call me immediately."
Sheldon,How are you settling in?
Amy,Pretty well. Princeton has a beautiful campus.
Sheldon,"Now, Iêve learned some fun facts about New Jersey to help you make small talk. Would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate? Theyêre both shocking."
Amy,"Actually, I want to hear about you. How are things at home?"
Sheldon,"Well, Iêm a lot less likely to see an Eastern Goldfinch or be murdered, Iêll tell you that."
Amy,I miss you.
Sheldon,"I miss you, too."
Amy,"Itês so strange, earlier today I ended a sentence with a preposition and you werenêt there to correct my grammar."
Sheldon,Iêm sorry you had to go through that.
Amy,"In fact, thatês when I started to really miss you."
Sheldon,You know you just split an infinitive.
Amy,Did I? Are you gonna teach me a lesson?
Sheldon,I am. It is naughty to put an adverb between the word to and the verb stem.
Amy,What are you gonna do about it?
Sheldon,Iêm going to admonish you.
Sheldon,Thatês the only kind of admonishing I do.
Howard,Howês Sheldon doing with Amy gone?
Leonard,"Well, the last three nights Iêve had to take him to get a haircut, to the train store, and to a Walgreens in Arcadia where they still have the good ibuprofen. Now ask me how Iêm doing with Amy gone."
Raj,How are you doing withÑ
Leonard,Shut up.
Howard,"If youêd like, we can help you out."
Leonard,"Oh, that would be great."
Howard,"I mean, not me, Iêve got a wife and child, but this one posts video of himself flossing on Instagram."
Raj,"It was a tutorial. And yes, Iêm happy to keep Sheldon company."
Leonard,Great. Tonight he wants to look at ladders at Home Depot.
Raj,"Oh, why does he need a ladder?"
Leonard,He doesnêt; he just likes looking at them. Bring a book.
Sheldon,"Gentlemen. You may remember Dr. Nowitzki, Sheês back at Caltech for her postdoc."
Raj,"Hi. Oh, let me bring a chair for you. "
Sheldon,"Oh, thanks. Dr. Nowitzkiês going to tell me about the work she did at CERN. And she brought me this duty-free Toblerone."
Leonard,Oh. I love those.
Sheldon,Letês sit somewhere else.
Raj,What just happened?
Howard,A stranger just lured Sheldon away with a candy bar.
Leonard,"Wait, isnêt she the grad student that used to follow him around?"
Howard,"Oh, yeah. Back before he hit puberty and grew man parts."
Raj,So what do you guys think thatês about?
Leonard,"Knowing Sheldon, nothing."
Sheldon,"So, tell me about your scalar dark energy experiment."
Sheldon,Oh. You must be one of those dessert before dinner people.
Leonard,"He just made her laugh, somethingês wrong."
Raj,Do you see the way sheês looking at him?
Howard,Yeah. Like Bernadette used to look at me.
Raj,"I keep telling you, close the bathroom door."
Leonard,"Ah, did you see that? She just touched his hand and he didnêt swat it away. What is happening?"
Howard,"Okay, the simplest explanation is usually the right one."
Raj,Which is?
Howard,That ainêt Sheldon.
Penny,"Not only did they eat together, Leonard said he made her laugh."
Bernadette,"Thatês nothing, Howie said she touched his hand."
Penny,Did he Purell?
Penny,I cannot believe Leonard mentioned the Toblerone but left that part out.
Bernadette,Should we call Amy?
Penny,I donêt know; we shouldnêt worry her if itês nothing.
Bernadette,I guess we could wait till we have more information about this girl.
Penny,Yeah. Do you think living with Amy has somehow stirred up Sheldonês sexual appetite?
Bernadette,Ugh. How can you think that? Why would you even put those words together?
Penny,"All right, then we agree. Heês not making any moves, itês this Dr. Ramona chick."
Bernadette,"Nowitzki. I googled her, sheês pretty cute."
Penny,Really? All I got from Leonard was the Toblerone bar had nuts.
Sheldon,"And get this, I saw an articulating ladder with dual-leg leveling, which delivers stability and adaptability to uneven terrain."
Amy,Sounds like a big night.
Sheldon,"Yeah. Raj made the funniest joke, he said, which is the best ladder to use to hang myself?"
Amy,So youêre keeping busy? Youêre not lonely?
Sheldon,"Oh, not at all. Iêve had outings with Leonard and Raj in the evening, and, oh, I had lunch"
Amy,Whoês he?
Sheldon,"Oh, Dr. Nowitzki is a woman. "
Amy,"Oh. Really? Uh, when did you meet her?"
Sheldon,"Many years ago. Back when she was a grad student. Sheês always been a huge fan of my work, and now sheês doing research at Caltech."
Amy,"Huge fan, you say?"
Sheldon,"Yes. I think youêd like her. Sheês extremely intelligent, just like you. Unlike you, sheês tall, blonde and used to be an Olympic swimmer."
Amy,Thatês terrific. Iêll call you right back.
Penny,"Oh, hey, Amy."
Amy,I gave you one job. Keep an eye on him. How hard is that?
Penny,We thought you meant not letting him run out into traffic.
Bernadette,Which he only did once.
Amy,Why didnêt you tell me?
Bernadette,We didnêt want you to worry.
Amy,Should I worry?
Penny,"Come on, itês Sheldon. Nothing is gonna happen."
Amy,"Thatês what you said to me when I started dating him. And then five years later, bingo bango, something happened."
Bernadette,"Yeah, but youêre gonna be back in three months."
Amy,You donêt get it. Iêve been smacking that ketchup bottle for a long time. All sheês got to do is tip it over and point it at her fries.
Penny,"Well, what do you want us to do?"
Amy,"I donêt know. Might be the New Jersey talking, but this Nowitzki broad needs to disappear."
Bernadette,"Thatês ridiculous. As far as we know, all that happened is two scientists had lunch."
Amy,"Yeah, but one of those scientists is a tall, blonde Olympic swimmer."
Penny,Come on. Looks donêt matter to Sheldon. Because he only has eyes for you.
Amy,Nice try.
Penny,Thanks. I was scrambling.
Howard,Itês unbelievable. Sheldon has lunch with another woman and somehow my wife yells at me.
Leonard,"Penny laid into me, too. Apparently, Iêm overly fixated on premium Swiss chocolate bars."
Raj,Can you even eat those things?
Leonard,If I take a Lactaid a half-hour before and some Pepto right after.
Raj,Sounds like a lot of work.
Leonard,"Eh, Iêm worth it."
Howard,Guys. Focus. Should we do something about Nowitzki?
Leonard,Like what?
Raj,"Uh, well, sheês single, so if somebody else asks her out and she says yes, then we know sheês not into Sheldon."
Leonard,"No offence, Stuart, but the womanês a doctor."
Howard,Sheês not that kind of doctor.
Raj,"Actually, I was going to suggest me."
Howard,"Great. Anybodyês better than, mmm."
Raj,Dr. Nowitzki. Good to see you.
Raj,May I join you?
Raj,Good to see you.
Howard,"We should call Guinness, that might be a record."
Raj,Sheês clearly having a working lunch and preferred to eat alone.
Raj,I could have made her very happy.
Leonard,You kept walking. I think you did.
Penny,Do you really think thereês reason to worry?
Leonard,"Yeah, sheês definitely going after Sheldon."
Raj,I made a play for her and she shot me down.
Penny,"All right, well, that doesnêt prove anything."
Bernadette,"Yeah, thereês a million reasons a woman would shoot Raj down."
Raj,"Like, really, a million?"
Bernadette,"Fine, hundreds."
Raj,Thank you.
Penny,The point is this could be nothing and we are all overreacting.
Sheldon,"Hey, everybody. This is my friend, Dr. Nowitzki."
Sheldon,We just went swimming.
Leonard,And you actually got in a pool?
Sheldon,"I was scared, but I told myself itês just a big bathtub. Then I got scared again êcause there are all these strangers in my bathtub."
Sheldon,"Well, I was hiding from a bee, but it still counts."
Bernadette,Can I just squeeze in here?
Penny,"So, Sheldon, have you talked to Amy?"
Sheldon,"Yes, we skyped this morning and Iêm sure Iêll check in with her before I go to sleep."
Sheldon,That is true. She keeps asking how long Amyês going to be gone.
Leonard,"Uh, so, Ramona, tell us about yourself. Do you, do you have a boyfriend?"
Sheldon,"Leonard, your wife is sitting right here. What are you doing?"
Raj,I think you made that very clear.
Sheldon,She was part of the American team at CERN.
Sheldon,"Do you know, Iêve corresponded with Peter Higgs. Would you like to see some of his letters?"
Sheldon,Iêll get them.
Sheldon,"Oh, fun. Like a play date."
Penny,"Okay, correct me if Iêm wrong, but isnêt that exactly what we were supposed to stop from happening?"
Bernadette,"I threw my body at them, what else did you want me to do?"
Leonard,You think you should call Amy?
Penny,"You got fingers and a mouth, you call her."
Sheldon,Here you go.
Sheldon,"Hmm? Oh, no, no, no. Theyêre from many famous people. See? Oh, like this one. This is from Patrick Stewart. It says if I come to his house again, I get to meet his dogs. Oh, excuse me."
Amy,"Hello, Sheldon."
Sheldon,"Oh, hello, Amy."
Amy,I was missing you again.
Sheldon,"I miss you, too. Hey, this is good timing. Remember that Dr. Nowitzki I told you about? Sheês right here."
Amy,Sheês what?
Amy,"Uh-huh. Hang on.  Hello. A little late, Leonard. Sorry."
Sheldon,What is Leonard doing calling you at this hour?
Amy,Itês not important.
Sheldon,"I must tell you, that seems a little inappropriate. Donêt you agree?"
Sheldon,See? We both think so.
Penny,"All right, this is making me crazy. Somebodyês got to go over there."
Leonard,"You got feet and legs, you do it."
Penny,Will you go with me?
Bernadette,To do what? Shake a can of nickels at them?
Raj,Weêre being ridiculous. Thereês no way a woman that attractive is trying to seduce Sheldon Cooper.
Howard,You done trying to make yourself feel better?
Raj,I havenêt played the race card yet.
Sheldon,"Hey, I hate to break up the party, but Amy says Iêm tired and have to go to bed."
Leonard,Our pleasure.
Sheldon,Of course.
Penny,Weêll all go.
Bernadette,Excuse me.
Penny,"Pardon. I just need to., yeah."
Sheldon,That was fun. It was like Mario Kart.
Penny,We need to talk.
Sheldon,Is this about Leonard and Amy? I donêt like it either.
Penny,"Okay, I know you donêt have a lot of experience with women, but Ramona seems to have a romantic interest in you."
Sheldon,That doesnêt make any sense. She knows I have a girlfriend.
Penny,"Well, sometimes women donêt care. Sometimes it makes them want a guy even more."
Sheldon,"That may be true, but Dr. Nowitzkiês just a friend. In fact, I wouldnêt have even noticed sheês a woman if she hadnêt worn that bathing suit that highlighted her bosom."
Penny,"Okay. Um, letês try this. Think of yourself as one of those limited edition toys people like to collect."
Sheldon,I already do.
Penny,"Well, then you get it."
Sheldon,"Because thereês only one of me, Iêm more valuable."
