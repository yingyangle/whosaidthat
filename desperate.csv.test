2048,Bree,"uh, excuse me. i'm looking for my son. have you seen him? have you seen him?"
4097,Bree,"i don't know. but i swear to you, we may have our differences, but i would never hire someone to attack you. you have to believe me."
2054,Bree,"andrew, please, can't we just talk about this? i'm your mother, for god sakes! you're my son."
7,Bree,"so susan, is he going to stop seeing that woman?"
2056,Bree,thank you.
4102,Bree,not by resorting to physical violence. i would never have given my permission for that.
2058,Bree,"no, i don't think he will. i failed him."
12,Bree,"it's ok? andrew, i spent 3 hours cooking this meal. how do you think it makes me feel when you say it's ok, in that sullen tone?"
13,Bree,excuse me?
2060,Bree,"because there is a bottle of chardonnay in the refrigerator, and right now, this little chore is the only thing that's keeping me from going inside and drinking the whole damn thing."
2067,Bree,mr. faladi.
23,Bree,"if you think i'm gonna discuss the dissolution of my marriage in a place where the restrooms are labeled ""chicks"" and ""dudes "", you're out of your mind."
4119,Bree,"well, who says he has to know how i spend my free time?"
25,Bree,what?
26,Bree,oh wait?
27,Bree,"yes, well, i feel badly about that. i told you, mrs. huber came over and i got distracted. it was a mistake."
2074,Bree,yard work?
2077,Bree,"how does this dr. keck fit into all of this? i mean, is he treating andrew for some awful disease?"
4122,Bree,oh my god. you're bleeding
2079,Bree,"this is a nightmare, an absolute nightmare."
2085,Bree,"be that as it may, do we all agree that i should tell this man's wife?"
2088,Bree,"yes. yes, we do."
41,Bree,"you're gonna cancel the meeting with that divorce lawyer, and we're gonna find ourselves a marriage counsellor."
2091,Bree,so you could do something.
2094,Bree,oh?
2095,Bree,what is?
49,Bree,"oh, i.."
50,Bree,of course not.
2097,Bree,don't you dare leave this house!
2099,Bree,i just--i've tried so hard to set a good example. i've done the best i could to teach you kids right from wrong. why isn't it taking?
59,Bree,"that is not true, rex."
64,Bree,"rex, rex! you need to get up!"
65,Bree,"please hurry, if the kids see you sleeping down here, they're gonna start asking questions."
2113,Bree,when you start acting like an adult.
68,Bree,"well, why don't you move back upstairs and sleep in our bed?"
71,Bree,i think it's a great idea.
72,Bree,works for me. should we all make something?
73,Bree,lynette!
74,Bree,really? wouldn't that be in poor taste?
2123,Bree,pump her.
79,Bree,"well, given that we're hosting it, i say so. by the way, you won't be drinking at this party."
2127,Bree,i didn't call you that.
2128,Bree,i have never in my life used the word retard.
83,Bree,"my backhand's improving immensely, but you're still having problems with your serve."
88,Bree,hello zach! i hope this isn't a bad time.
90,Bree,"oh. well, i'm sorry it's such late notice, but well, we weren't sure whether you and your father were ready for any kind of social engagement yet. but, well, we're, we're sort of throwing it in your mother's honour."
2138,Bree,"yes, danielle made it quite clear that i'm powerless to stop this relationship, and since she assures me that you love her. you do love her, don't you?"
93,Bree,"oh. that's too bad. well, i should go."
100,Bree,"i'm packing your swimsuit. there's a pool there, and i know how swimming relaxes you."
107,Bree,"if you would just tell me what he told you, then i could fix the problem."
2157,Bree,did you see that? she just deliberately snubbed me.
2158,Bree,"rebecca, i just spoke to her. and call me paranoid, but amy griswold did the same thing to me on the golf course last week. what is going on?"
112,Bree,"well, it's now or never. i saw what he's asking for the place it's going to sell really quickly."
115,Bree,dinner is on the table.
121,Bree,where were you last night?
128,Bree,it's a tough call.
2177,Bree,#name?
132,Bree,i am perfectly capable of handling this without your father.
134,Bree,call andrew and find out where he is.
2184,Bree,carolyn.
137,Bree,keith. ian. andrew.
2186,Bree,"all right, i accept your explanation. i just wish there were fewer things for you to explain. by the way, to remove a red wine stain, you sprinkle salt to absorb it."
2190,Bree,it means you should stop worrying about my marriage and start worrying about your own.
2191,Bree,okay. does the name monique mean anything to you?
2195,Bree,"uh, yes, um--i just-- ran into her this morning."
2198,Bree,"thank god i found this stale baguette so i can make bruschetta, and there's shrimp in the freezer, so i'm gonna make my rice and seafood dish."
151,Bree,"andrew, i know you blame me for what's happening with your father, but it's not entirely my fault and i need you to understand that."
2200,Bree,you can peel a clove of garlic.
153,Bree,yeah?
154,Bree,three months.
157,Bree,are you okay?
163,Bree,"well,i had hoped someday to get my grandchildren into barcliff. but i suppose that doesn't matter to you, does it?"
2213,Bree,"but, orson--"
2214,Bree,hi.
168,Bree,"well,that doesn't make it any less frightening. i mean, he could have been a sexual predator."
171,Bree,"rex, the truth is, with the kids gone i'll be all by myself in this house for the first time in seventeen years."
2219,Bree,"well, how does he disappoint you?"
2225,Bree,"now you listen to me. that woman gave you life, and the fifth commandment tells us to honor our parents no matter how hideous or repellent they may be."
179,Bree,"wow,this place is just immaculate."
2231,Bree,"paprika! there, it's out!"
186,Bree,"it was right before christmas as a matter of fact. we were all singing carols and the dog was howling, because everyone in my family sings off-key except for me.anyway, it was just a terrible ruckus.so no-one noticed when my mother wenta cross the street to give the neighbour their gift. the next thing we heard were brakes screeching."
2235,Bree,what are you doing?
190,Bree,ooooh.
2238,Bree,how can you be so cold?
192,Bree,what did you do??? zach? sweetheart?
196,Bree,nothing.that's it. just that mary alice killed herself because of something he had done.
197,Bree,"oh, i tried. but he was so nervous he actually started shaking and then he just left."
199,Bree,"girls,you don't understand. this poor kid is scared out of his mind."
2249,Bree,"right, from here i can see a bail bondsman and an adult bookshop."
2252,Bree,of course she likes it. there's a 24-hour liquor store across the street.
2256,Bree,are you insane? she obviously can't be on her own.
210,Bree,"zach,why did you do this?"
211,Bree,take off those handcuffs please.
2258,Bree,and i will not hear another word on the subject.
213,Bree,"hi,zach. i just wanted to see if everything was alright."
214,Bree,are you sure?
218,Bree,it just doesn't make any sense. zach is such a sweet kid. i can't imagine him doing anything that terrible.
220,Bree,"oh, hey there, you two!"
2269,Bree,monique polier? i thought that was harvey bigsby's mistress.
2271,Bree,no. i'm done.
2273,Bree,i know--but it scares the hell out of me.
2278,Bree,we also have cable.
2279,Bree,decided?
233,Bree,"oh, maisy does love to rule her little kingdom."
2284,Bree,"oh, no, no, these things practically build themselves."
237,Bree,"well, what a coincidence. so am i. it seems a shame for us to eat by ourselves. shall i, pull up a chair?"
238,Bree,"oh,"" ""i suppose it can wait."
2285,Bree,actually--i could probably use the distraction.
2288,Bree,"i know it sounds suspicious, but in my heart of hearts, i just can't believe that orson could do such a thing."
241,Bree,is that how you see me? as some sort of prude who just lays there like a cold fish? i love sex.
247,Bree,then perhaps you shouldn't say anything.
248,Bree,"oh, rex, oh baby, stop, i just need a minute."
2298,Bree,"well, needless to say, i won't be cooking dinner for ian's parents."
254,Bree,i was there. i was willing. normal men don't say no to that.
2303,Bree,orson. why haven't you returned any of my calls?
2307,Bree,"well, you could've left her."
2309,Bree,so you stayed in a loveless marriage because of your mother?
262,Bree,"no, i don't. i sound like a woman whose husband won't touch her. rex, after mary alice killed herself, it all hit me. we all have our secrets, and i think it's time for you to tell me yours."
2312,Bree,"oh, we've rented you a condo in a lovely retirement community. it's our christmas gift to you."
266,Bree,"god, i couldn't wait to get rid of them! so, lynette said that you found zack."
273,Bree,you went to an attorney?
2324,Bree,thank you for clearing things up.
2326,Bree,susan. hi. it's bree.
280,Bree,wait a minute. what's all this about a modeling academy?
2330,Bree,"oh, susan, you know, i feel exactly--"
283,Bree,"a car? a modeling academy? you should have discussed these gifts with me first. i'm sorry kids, but we cannot accept them."
2331,Bree,"i'm so sorry to keep you waiting, but i don't want to introduce you until all my guests are here."
2334,Bree,"oh, okay, just one minute. that'll be susan."
2337,Bree,"now that we're all assembled, i'd like to introduce the guest of honor. i hope you'll all be as delighted to meet her as i was. you can come in now."
2339,Bree,"oh, about that apology--any time you're ready."
292,Bree,"oh, no? that's mr. conlan, the locksmith. he's been very helpful today. of course, i could give you the new keys, which would mean you'd have to adhere to my rules, which would include giving back your father's gifts."
2343,Bree,can't this wait? we're having a dinner party.
2344,Bree,susan?
297,Bree,"oh, andrew, i need your help, honey."
2345,Bree,i don't believe this. you called the police?
302,Bree,how is juanita doing?
2350,Bree,you heard me. get out!
305,Bree,"this is the most impoverished neighborhood in the city. trust me, somebody will steal the car."
306,Bree,because i have faith in the poor.
2354,Bree,"oh. well, um--i don't want to keep you. i'm sure that edie has lots of other houses to show you."
2355,Bree,what?
2357,Bree,"well, are you aware of its history? the previous owner was harboring a murderer."
2358,Bree,"they had a dungeon in the basement.i mean, people say they still hear groans coming from the house at night."
312,Bree,"all right, then what's the appropriate punishment for a child who drives over a woman?"
313,Bree,"""you know, no matter how the kids turn out, i still love them.''"
2360,Bree,don't i wish.
2364,Bree,"how can i be calm?! for months, people thought you killed your first wife. no sooner does she show up and clear your name, than the police haul you off to ask you about another murder!"
2371,Bree,about what it's gonna take to get you to sell this house and move.
325,Bree,"of course not. it's just that the accident probably stirred up a lot of emotions, and it would be normal for you to be feeling confused or depressed or ashamed--"
2373,Bree,"oh, please. orson made it perfectly clear we don't want you here."
2374,Bree,that's not true.
2376,Bree,"well, okay-- i have to go."
2379,Bree,who knows? she's probably gonna sneak in and plant them in our house.
2380,Bree,orson! not on the duvet!
334,Bree,lynette? honey?
2384,Bree,thanks for the heads-up. now off you go.
2385,Bree,i wouldn't worry about orson's soul. he won't be sleeping with alma.
2388,Bree,no reason.
2392,Bree,"orson, i have caught you cheating. at least have the courtesy to wake up! oh, for god sakes. orson! orson? what have you done to him?!"
346,Bree,"well, if it insures he grows up with some trace of humanity, then that's a risk i'm willing to take!"
347,Bree,"well, that's because you just don't love him as much as i do!"
2399,Bree,you raped my husband.
356,Bree,why are you smiling?
2409,Bree,"yeah, but you weren't just trying to protect me, were you?"
364,Bree,it's the container you'll be urinating into.
2412,Bree,"i don't care if you go to jail. you have done a horrible thing, and you have to make it right. i mean it, orson. if you don't fix this, i will."
366,Bree,"i think andrew has been smoking marijuana, so i want you to take this and get it tested right away."
368,Bree,"yes, i am."
369,Bree,"not all of us! rex, i thought you moved back home to try and straighten andrew out! to, to teach him the consequences of his actions. i don't understand why you're fighting me on this."
2416,Bree,"she raped you,and your mother helped."
2419,Bree,"oh, that's right. is orson here?"
2421,Bree,but why?
2422,Bree,for what?
2423,Bree,and you think--
379,Bree,i take it you've met maisy gibbons.
387,Bree,"oh, okay. i tell you what then. why don't you just call up your mystery woman and invite her over. i'll pull out the sofa bed and you can take her right there. andrew! danielle! daddy's gonna fornicate for us!"
2435,Bree,alma?
2442,Bree,"oh, darling, i don't deserve you."
395,Bree,because i have faith that he'll come back. and that he'll do the right thing.
2444,Bree,"i have missed you, sweetheart!"
398,Bree,"oh! well, that's um, very thoughtful of you."
399,Bree,"sure! why don't you, uh, come by tomorrow?"
400,Bree,"hello. this is she. yes, he's my husband."
402,Bree,could i at least poke my head in? i'm his wife.
2453,Bree,"it is so good to be back. i can't believe how much is happening. i mean, you and gaby getting married, and i'm having a baby. what's going on with you, lynette?"
2455,Bree,andrew?
2456,Bree,do young people still say awesome?
2461,Bree,"look, i am gonna say this one last time. you are gonna stay put until that baby is born. now don't forget, we're driving up this weekend, and i am bringing your favorite--lemon squares, and--"
2466,Bree,"oh,for heaven's sakes.orson,could you come help me,please?i'll remember this the next time you want money for leather pants."
2469,Bree,"well,uh,dining chairs.there's a clue."
422,Bree,"i'm sorry to disappoint you, andrew, but my plan is to have an embolism and to die young!"
423,Bree,andrew!
426,Bree,"oh, i don't need your gratitude. you're only here because your children are master extortionists."
2474,Bree,it's my pride and joy.
430,Bree,and why do you think that?
432,Bree,"hello, george."
434,Bree,"listen, i have a prescription here for rex. i don't know if you heard, but he had a heart attack."
436,Bree,so i hear.
2486,Bree,"you're missing the point! it's a convent,not the four seasons.you have mustard on your chin."
2489,Bree,"no,no,no!it's just,uh--oh,it's a little barbecue sauce."
2490,Bree,"no,it's nothing!"
2491,Bree,yes.
446,Bree,hi.
448,Bree,"oh! come on in. george, you remember rex?"
449,Bree,"oh, we are, emotionally. physically, he just lives here because his mistress refuses to care for him. would you like a drink?"
2496,Bree,we're already in too deep.
451,Bree,"i'm going to go put these in water. george, why don't you have a seat, and i'll be right back."
452,Bree,"oh, these flowers are stunning. they're the best ones i've ever gotten."
2502,Bree,absolutely.
455,Bree,"well, i guess i should go inside."
2503,Bree,no more secrets.
2504,Bree,it's my pride and joy.
2512,Bree,"well, thank you. i don't think i did anything differently."
472,Bree,"yes, i'm angry with him. i am going to divorce him. i may even marry someone else, but make no mistake about it, your father is, and always will be, the love of my life. he gave me the best eighteen-year marriage that i could have ever hoped for. for that, you will respect him."
2520,Bree,"it's true. everyone thought so. even me. oh, and that simple green salad--mache and baby arugula with duck confit and candied walnuts!"
2528,Bree,"well, as long as we're swapping pie recipes, i would love the one for your fabulous lemon meringue."
2529,Bree,excuse me?
490,Bree,"another gift? i hope it's not another orchid, they're so expensive."
2539,Bree,"yes, and it has nothing to do with pie."
2540,Bree,"hey, it's our chemo party, and we'll laugh if we want to."
2544,Bree,"well, i doubt a woman like katherine is gonna spill her secrets just - because she's had a little win"
499,Bree,"oh, george, that's so sweet. now come on, let's go shoot something!"
500,Bree,"now before i fire a handgun, i like to go over a few of the basics just to make sure i'm ready. okay? so, number one, a strong stance."
2548,Bree,"god,it's getting harder and harder to keep her at arm's length. i never knew she was such a hugger."
502,Bree,here. take the gun.
2549,Bree,"i'm getting good at props. no,no."
2550,Bree,"hey, susan! what's up?"
522,Bree,you can lean on me.
524,Bree,you shouldn't listen to a woman who's just had her heart broken.
2573,Bree,some wine?
529,Bree,hardly? how about never!
2579,Bree,two mules for sister sara!
2586,Bree,something's come up. we'll talk tomorrow.
2587,Bree,"i said i was sorry. for god sakes, susan, not everything is about you."
540,Bree,"it was my first week in college, and i went to a meeting of the young republicans where rex gave a speech, and i went up to him afterward and introduced myself, and i told him that i agreed with his stance on the death penalty. he took me out to a diner, and we, uh, stayed up till two in the morning talking about big government, gun control and illegal immigration. ah. it was just--it was just such a magical night, and i knew, by the time he got me back to my dorm, that one day i was going to be mrs. rex van de kamp."
2590,Bree,it's the only thing she asked for.
543,Bree,"oh, i should not have done that. i am--"
547,Bree,"aside from the adultery, yes."
549,Bree,"oh, he's chaperoning. he called a couple of hours ago and volunteered."
2602,Bree,oh!
2603,Bree,that is so kind of you.
2604,Bree,yes?
557,Bree,rex and i are hosting a dinner party for ten next week. we're using our best china and serving duck.
2605,Bree,"no, it's for danielle. there you are. thank you."
2607,Bree,"well, i'm not giving it to her. can you think of a worse present for a pregnant girl?"
2608,Bree,you know how i feel about 2-wheeled motorized vehicles. they're too dangerous. we'll donate it to the church.
2609,Bree,reverend sikes said they're looking for items for the raffle.
2610,Bree,"well, it's better than you breaking your neck on it."
566,Bree,"we're, um, wasps, doctor goldfine. not acknowledging the elephant in the room is what we do best."
569,Bree,roses and english toffee?
2619,Bree,nope.
574,Bree,you had an affair. you went to another woman for sex to give you something i couldn't. at least have the decency to tell me what that something is.
2623,Bree,phyllis!
576,Bree,huh?
2625,Bree,"well, i'm, uh, sorry if that offends you, phyllis, but i didn't want orson to feel uncomfortable in his new home."
2627,Bree,"she's, uh, at boarding school--in switzerland."
582,Bree,what do you want me to say? my husband likes to wear metal clamps around his nipples. hooray?
583,Bree,try what? hurting you? you actually want me to hurt you?
2638,Bree,"we're saying that the baby is mine and orson's, and if you hover around like a grandmother, people will be suspicious."
2640,Bree,you think i don't know i'm a failure as a parent? that's why this child means so much to me. it's my second chance.
596,Bree,i want you out of the house!
2645,Bree,thank you for the gift.
2652,Bree,"what do you mean, she's gone? and you believed her? you idiot! i should sue your irresponsible ass off for this. yeah, well, good day to you, too, reverend mother!"
609,Bree,what is wrong with nice invitations?
2660,Bree,"i'm just so mad at myself. i should have realized that the maternal instinct is so strong, that even danielle would develop it."
619,Bree,who were you planning on having sex with?
2667,Bree,"seriously, we hadn't realized you'd matured enough to take on the burden of motherhood all by yourself."
621,Bree,"well, if that's the type of boy he is, then good riddance."
2668,Bree,"she'll do what she can, but you mustn't overtax her. her heart is not very strong."
623,Bree,"honey, i am looking out for your happiness. now, i understand what it's like to be young and feel urges, but i waited until i got married, as did your father, and it was so much better."
2678,Bree,"orson and i go to our club almost every saturday night, if you're-- interested in babysitting."
631,Bree,"well, she feels very passionately about you."
634,Bree,"uh, actually, i would prefer if you didn't."
2683,Bree,"uh, no, my daughter is in switzerland, at boarding school."
637,Bree,are you having an affair with my husband?
2688,Bree,"you are due in three weeks. until then, no windows and no parties."
2691,Bree,"you know, danielle, i just want you to be aware that giving up this baby might be harder than you think."
651,Bree,"i was wondering if, perhaps, you could remove rex's name from that little book."
658,Bree,"oh, sweetie. they didn't abandon you because you're a whore. they abandoned you because you weren't all that nice to begin with."
660,Bree,"serena, hi. how are you?"
2709,Bree,what's wrong?
2710,Bree,"oh, dear heavenly lord."
2711,Bree,"danielle! we agreed to save that till the end of the night. the best part of the costume, and she pops the water balloon when people aren't even looking. orson! andrew!"
2713,Bree,not on the couch. i just had it reupholstered.
2721,Bree,"uh, yeah, and he promised that no one would ever know what happened here tonight."
2722,Bree,"he's perfect. he's, um, he's all cleaned up now, if-- if you want to hold him."
2723,Bree,he looks just like you did. do you want to be alone with him? do you want me to--to go? what should i do?
678,Bree,hi.
2727,Bree,"shh, shh, shh, shh, shh."
2733,Bree,circumcision's not mutilation. it's a simple surgery meant to promote lifelong masculine hygiene.
2734,Bree,we know what it is.
687,Bree,we have to admit that we need help. if we can't get through to andrew then we have to find someone who can.
2736,Bree,that's why the procedure should be done on babies. they won't remember. now can we please just drop this?
690,Bree,"all right, what about this one. it's in the desert and it's very reasonable. barracks are a little bit bleak, but that recidivism rate is to die for!"
2742,Bree,"yes, um, can you tell me who i would talk to about having my baby circumcised?"
700,Bree,you no longer get an allowance.
2751,Bree,let me show you something. you see this breadmaker? this is where i hid a bottle of chardonnay after i told everyone i'd stopped drinking.
705,Bree,"all right, people. we're going to follow the body. this way please."
2753,Bree,"susan, addicts are experts at deception. my advice to you--trust--but verify."
707,Bree,"sweetheart, it's been clear to us for sometime now that you've been unhappy. all this acting out--"
2756,Bree,"i know it might seem tacky piggybacking on deborah's bris, but-- we could do it in the den very quietly."
2758,Bree,i should only have a nickel for every time i've heard that.
711,Bree,"sorry, honey, but you don't have a choice."
2763,Bree,it's just a little unsightly foreskin. he'll never miss it.
719,Bree,nowhere in their brochure did it say that we were expected to attend.
720,Bree,"well, i'm making him this care package. i mean he'll know i'm thinking about him."
2767,Bree,i know that.
723,Bree,no.
2772,Bree,partly. what's your point?
726,Bree,hi. what's going on?
2778,Bree,all right. how was it?
2781,Bree,"no, and i wish we had. if we did, he mightn't have turned out so--"
735,Bree,"don't be common, young man. now come on, if you play around with those cookies one more time i'll have to spank you."
2783,Bree,don't be so sensitive. we'll find something to help you sleep--maybe some warm milk.
2786,Bree,"oh, thank you."
739,Bree,those cookies were made from scratch. your fate is sealed. come here.
2788,Bree,"um, tom, may i ask you something? did you and lynette do the family bed when your children were babies?"
2789,Bree,"so, um, not to pry, but, um, did that create any, uh, issues for you?"
743,Bree,"lynnette, is there a problem?"
2794,Bree,bye.
2799,Bree,"he's in the exam room, readjusting the chair."
761,Bree,"lynette, don't. the fact that you just crossed that street means the world to me. and if anyone should apologise here, it's me."
762,Bree,i would love to.
2812,Bree,"i just don't want us to part on bad terms again, like we did two years ago."
2816,Bree,"oh, my god. this is gonna kill edie."
2818,Bree,i can't believe this.
2819,Bree,and everything will be just the way it was.
772,Bree,"i'll get the door. honey, you pour the wine."
779,Bree,so?
781,Bree,"well, at least i'm trying to be proactive."
2830,Bree,"so, um, why on earth would katherine treat you so dreadfully?"
2835,Bree,"okay. this has been-- lovely. we really should, um, do it again sometime."
791,Bree,"no, i don't. and i need you there. i would be so lonely without you."
2840,Bree,"she's over there, first door on the left, and please hurry."
2845,Bree,"oh, my god. what did you do?"
2846,Bree,so this is why you moved back to fairview?
2852,Bree,"oh, so now it's my fault that that lunatic commandeered our safe room?"
808,Bree,i don't remember that.
2862,Bree,"oh, and, uh, listen. bob and lee introduced us to this wonderful contractor, so we won't be imposing for long."
2863,Bree,"hey, susan, orson likes to sleep with the window open. do you mind if we rearrange the furniture?"
822,Bree,what is going on here?
823,Bree,"it's okay. george has a girlfriend. you brought her, didn't you?"
2871,Bree,"well, then you just have to fix him up with someone, give him back his will to work."
2873,Bree,"oh, hi, susan. i hope you don't mind that i made dinner."
827,Bree,"hi. you left the party so quickly i didn't have the chance to apologise to you for what rex did. oh, george, i'm so sorry he humiliated you in front of all those people. i don't know what got into him."
830,Bree,"well, i decide who i need in my life, and i've decided that i need you. and that's all there is to it."
2881,Bree,andrew is also an out-and-proud homosexual.
836,Bree,"yes. rex and i took a vacation there, right before the kids were born. we had so much fun in those first few years. i guess it was easier to be happy back then. i can't believe i just said that- no more wine for me. "
2884,Bree,i'm just trying to stay out of the way of all those sparks that are flying.
839,Bree,because i'm married! people would talk.
842,Bree,i um. i have to talk to edie.
2890,Bree,"fine, and if you can get him to come in on time and under budget, i'll throw in surround sound."
849,Bree,"i am not having an affair! george and i-we just talk. he's a very good listener and i share my hopes and dreams with him and my innermost thoughts. and that's all there is to it, and you have to believe me."
850,Bree,thank you. i'm glad we cleared this up. i know that it must have looked strange and i didn't want you to think that i was cheating on my husband.
2899,Bree,you. sit.
852,Bree,"oh. oh, i mean, everybody needs someone to talk to."
2905,Bree,we brought you muffins.
859,Bree,sort of? don't you remember the glorious food and the gorgeous scenery?
863,Bree,"miss it, miss it, miss it."
864,Bree,"come on, i'm allowed to psych you out."
865,Bree,"okay, time's up. take your best shot."
2914,Bree,"oh, lynette. hi. you look pretty. what are you all dressed up for?"
873,Bree,"like famine, or disease, or hobos. whatever. just hurry."
875,Bree,"well, you shouldn't be doing that. in case you've forgotten i'm married."
881,Bree,"no, and i know guns and that wound was not self-inflicted."
887,Bree,i could walk across a street tomorrow and be hit by a car.
2938,Bree,"thank you, reverend, and i'm--i'm sure the scavos will be here soon."
2946,Bree,"lynette, please. can't we just go outside and talk for a moment?"
2947,Bree,"well, i was at the service this morning, and it's just not the same without you."
900,Bree,i was thinking that the biggest mistake of my entire life was agreeing to marry you.
2954,Bree,"lynette, why didn't you tell me?"
2955,Bree,"hey, lynette."
908,Bree,rex? what is it?
910,Bree,"um, all right. you, uh, go downstairs and i will be, i'll be right there."
2958,Bree,"yes, i do. you were right. faith shouldn't be blind. you don't threaten it by asking questions. you make it stronger, and i lost sight of that."
2963,Bree,"oh, and, listen, bob and lee introduced us to this wonderful contractor, so we won't be imposing for long."
2964,Bree,"oh, gaby, i'm so glad you're here. i was just about to tell everyone to keep an eye out for their invitation to the founder's ball."
2966,Bree,that would be lovely.
2970,Bree,"oh, i think i know what's going on. somebody had a naughty dream."
2972,Bree,"you know, susan, sometimes i climb into a warm bath with a romance novel. just a thought."
926,Bree,i know.
2976,Bree,"well, they're certainly--assertive. my only fear is--"
931,Bree,because i told you: the best is yet to come.
932,Bree,hello?
936,Bree,you are gonna come through this operation just fine.
937,Bree,hello?
2985,Bree,about what?
2987,Bree,"oh, it's dip. the caterer just said that--"
940,Bree,"oh, do one of you drink soy milk? i was cleaning out the fridge this morning, and rex is the only one who drinks it. i just bought it on friday. i'd hate to throw it away."
2988,Bree,dig in.
2989,Bree,is everyone having fun?
2992,Bree,"oh, no. no, dear. just you. maybe you should go home."
2993,Bree,"oh, no one would expect you to do that in your condition. you know what? um, i could do it."
2996,Bree,"""i was honored when you--"" myeah, myeah, myeah, myeah."
3008,Bree,"susan, i'm just going across the street. there's no need to act like a silent movie heroine."
963,Bree,"reverend, if you don't back me up on this, so help me, i will pull the funeral out of your church."
3012,Bree,"oh, sure, you can. whenever i feel my emotions getting the best of me, i simply picture an empty box, and i take whatever i'm feeling and put that in the box, and then i picture myself putting the box away in a big, empty closet and closing the door. then if i have time, i go back and open the box and deal with the emotion--in private, like a lady."
3014,Bree,"no, thanks. we're almost done."
3015,Bree,"oh, how sweet."
3017,Bree,"katherine, need i remind you we nearly came to blows over floral choices?"
973,Bree,give me your tie.
3022,Bree,that is a cherished recipe from my grandmother.
977,Bree,""" hyllis, we've only been waiting here for two minutes."" \"
3033,Bree,"i know, but i'm the one thing you can't have."
3034,Bree,"orson, every wife understands that her husband will make a few mistakes--a forgotten anniversary, the occasional harsh word, but we all have to draw the line somewhere, and i'm drawing mine at the attempted murder of my best friend's husband."
987,Bree,then why didn't you put me on?
3038,Bree,"exactly, and if you could muster that kind of moral courage, i think i could forgive you. oh, come on. i promise i'll wait for you."
3040,Bree,"orson, what are you doing here?"
3041,Bree,"yes, i can smell the thinking on your breath. are you insane, driving in this condition?"
3042,Bree,except for the occasional hit-and-run.
995,Bree,people have said that?
3053,Bree,"come on, edie. think of our friendship."
3054,Bree,"actually, karen, when i'm done here, i could go try to find toby for you."
3058,Bree,"well, of course. is everything all right?"
3059,Bree,"ah, the key is to keep one car between yours and hers at all times. have fun."
3061,Bree,"what were you thinking, edie? we're supposed to be friends."
3066,Bree,may i help you?
1019,Bree,"yes, let's."
1020,Bree,"oh, my god. what happened?"
3068,Bree,"well, that sounds boring. i know. why don't you take him to edie's house, and he can watch you give her a dental exam with your tongue?"
3071,Bree,not exactly.
1024,Bree,"i don't know what you're talking about, phyllis."
1027,Bree,anomalies? what anomalies?
1038,Bree,get her out of here.
3086,Bree,did you hear something?
3089,Bree,"really? so i just happen to run into you at the dry cleaner, the greengrocer,the post office?"
3091,Bree,"orson, hear me when i say this. it's over. you have done unconscionable things for which i can never forgive you, and no amount of flitting about in my peripheral vision is going to change that."
1045,Bree,i would like to submit myself to a lie detector test to eliminate any uncertainty about what happened with my husband.
3095,Bree,those with roasted green beans as our side dishes. nice tight grouping. you are not rusty at all.
1051,Bree,what does that have to do with anything?
1052,Bree,"well, i'm not gonna respond to something that's none of your business."
1053,Bree,yes.
3099,Bree,so it's been two days now. did you and mike finally land on a name?
3101,Bree,"well, then appeal to his sense of reason, because the name ""maynard"" doesn't go with the name of ""delfino"". one is german and the other is italian, and we all know what happens when those folks get together."
3102,Bree,"come on. you have to do something. i mean, that name is practically abusive."
3106,Bree,"i didn't know she left you. yes, for our korean grocer. i'll tell you, sometimes this merciful god of ours has one sick sense of humor."
3108,Bree,"would you mind terribly if i took your hand? maybe that way, he'll finally get the idea that i've moved on."
3109,Bree,"ah, it worked. thank you for that."
3110,Bree,"now, now. we mustn't play favorites, although i will take that as a compliment."
3116,Bree,ohh!
3124,Bree,orson. orson.
3125,Bree,"hi. i'm, uh, here to check on orson hodge. an ambulance brought him in less than an hour ago."
3128,Bree,"no, you don't."
1083,Bree,"stop it, the two of you, this instant! this was a perfectly lovely evening and now the both of you have ruined it. i will not tolerate this kind of behavior. do you understand?"
3133,Bree,"it's tomorrow! a hundred gay men are descending on this street, and they're expecting a fabulous party."
1088,Bree,part of the reason i'm having him over is so that you can get to know him.
3137,Bree,"and dancing, roll out the cake, you leave for your honeymoon, and i will collapse in a tasteful heap."
1091,Bree,i'll be serving dinner tomorrow at seven. please don't be late.
1092,Bree,"andrew, don't you have a meet at the swim club?"
1093,Bree,doesn't it require a large entrance fee? one that you can't afford by yourself?
3140,Bree,"why are you here? and don't say for the pizza, because i know you're lactose-intolerant."
1096,Bree,andrew is being polite and engaging. he's even laughing at george's jokes.
1097,Bree,"okay, time for cobbler. sorry, one of the dessert plates doesn't match. i tried to replace it but it's spode florence. it's a rare pattern. belonged to my grandmother, but hopefully, once you taste the dessert, you'll forget all about it."
3148,Bree,"andrew--look, i'm on my way back, but it's imperative that you--andrew?"
3149,Bree,"oh, dear god. oh, no. don't die on me now! aah! oh, dear god."
1104,Bree,"well, i think given everything that's happened, um, it's perfectly justified that you'd be frightened of zach."
3156,Bree,"but that's just it, orson. if i forgive you, then i'm forgiving what you did to mike. i can't do that. and-- and you wouldn't want me to. i mean, be honest with yourself. if i took you back now, i wouldn't be the woman you love."
3160,Bree,"no, i did a bang-up job. katherine bailed on me and left town last night."
3166,Bree,i'm home!
1119,Bree,george. george. george!
1122,Bree,stop it!
3175,Bree,"look, i'm sorry. i didn't know a photo shoot would take this long. i mean, who knew it'd be this hard to pose for a book cover?"
3176,Bree,"okay, katherine. i know this book has been monopolizing my time, and you feel overworked and undervalued. but i do appreciate you. in fact, i have a gift for you. it's the galleys of my new book. read page 2."
3177,Bree,"well, you make this all possible."
1130,Bree,"anyway, i was hoping that you were all free friday morning because that's when i'll be hosting the re-burial."
1131,Bree,"look, i know it's an imposition, but danielle is away on a class trip and andrew is back at camp hennessey for a little refresher course. well, it's just gonna be a very brief and, and dignified ceremony and i was hoping that you could say a few words and, um, i'm gonna read a poem."
3178,Bree,andrew-- do we have a backup pie?
1133,Bree,"thank you. ah, the hearse is right outside, so if you'll just follow me."
1134,Bree,that's all right. i'll wait.
3180,Bree,so you're back?
3181,Bree,"well, it's certainly nice to meet you, dave, and let us be the first to welcome you to wisteria lane."
3185,Bree,excuse me?
1140,Bree,what?
1141,Bree,how would you know that?
3188,Bree,never heard anything so absurd.
1144,Bree,"i'm sorry, but i, i have to go. i have some things that i need to take care of."
1145,Bree,"detective, i know exactly what my husband deserves. now would you be a dear?"
1149,Bree,i'm changing it.
1157,Bree,"if you think i'm gonna lay next to someone for eternity who thinks i'm a murderer, you're crazy. as far as i'm concerned, let him decompose with strangers."
1159,Bree,hi. the kids are gone. we have the house all to ourselves tonight.
3211,Bree,"orson, i adore you, but your name-- our name-- it has no music. ""van de kamp"" trips off the tongue. ""hodge"" sounds like the noise a plunger makes."
3213,Bree,"see? the ship has already sailed. oh, don't be hurt. it's my professional name. in this house, i will always be mrs. hodge. now-- would it help if mrs. hodge cooked you your favorite pot roast tonight?"
1171,Bree,"oh, i don't think so. i've made duck, l ate a thousand times."
3219,Bree,"oh, gaby, it's just one party. i'll save you some cake."
3221,Bree,"no, i'm good. how do i look?"
1174,Bree,"yes, it was the strangest thing. and so inconvenient. to be honest, i think we were about the make love for the first time."
1178,Bree,"oh so you uh, think i'm crazy?"
3229,Bree,"katherine, it is not too late to change tonight's menu. if linda flanagan likes my food, she might give me a quote for the book jacket. i have to knock her socks off, and i am not betting the farm on haddock. argue with me all you like. i just bought 40 pounds of pork, so get your tushie over here."
1185,Bree,"well, great. um, how would you feel about the two of us checking into a romantic hotel tomorrow?"
3240,Bree,gaby?
1200,Bree,i was saying i think we should go horseback riding.
3251,Bree,"orson, you're still up. oh, i wish you could've been there. linda flanagan loved my food. she said i was ""god's gift to the table"" and that i could quote her on the book jacket. are you all right?"
1204,Bree,"oh, well, i'm drinking wine. i don't think you're supposed to mix pills with alcohol."
3253,Bree,"i am so sorry. i-i lost all track of time, and linda had so many questions about the food. i'll make you that pot roast tomorrow, okay?"
1210,Bree,that chair looks so uncomfortable. why didn't you sleep next to me?
3261,Bree,"lovely to meet you, leo."
1214,Bree,"george, wait. please don't go. stay here with me."
3263,Bree,"""danielle""? did he just call you ""danielle""?"
1219,Bree,"well, i think mike will calm down in a couple of days and come to his senses."
3268,Bree,oh. well-- since when?
3269,Bree,would it be more acceptable if i shopped for a suicidal pork loin?
1222,Bree,um hmm.
1224,Bree,"oh, my god! congratulations. oh george, i didn't even know you were looking."
3272,Bree,excuse me? you're teaching him?
3273,Bree,"so instead of sending him to a proper school, you're gonna give him the benefit of your straight ""c"" average?"
1232,Bree,okay.
1238,Bree,"no. true love is great, but at this point in my life, i think i'd rather just go to the opera."
1240,Bree,"uh, no, i, i guess not."
1241,Bree,hi.
3290,Bree,that is not meat.
1243,Bree,what happens in nine months?
1244,Bree,"if you'll excuse me, i, uh, i have to go."
3293,Bree,"well, i've apologized till i'm blue in the face, but they're still leaving in the morning. now you're not speaking to me, either? they're just mad. things will be better next time."
3294,Bree,"orson, i'm truly sorry. it's just, seeing--all these mistakes that she's making with benjamin, it's just so hard for me."
1253,Bree,really?
1255,Bree,"oh, dear. what's wrong?"
3309,Bree,very funny. i hardly think you have to worry about me becoming famous.
1263,Bree,motherhood.
1267,Bree,positively glowing.
1268,Bree,"honey, it's open. come on in."
3317,Bree,"well, i'll wait in reception until it's over."
1270,Bree,weird?
3321,Bree,i don't understand. you said the job was going so well.
1274,Bree,"well, i know a store that carries maternity clothes with designer labels."
3325,Bree,"apparently, we've been named businesswoman of the year."
3328,Bree,oh. who?
3331,Bree,partners? oh.
1284,Bree,"so, i don't want every woman in this town talking about me behind my back."
3341,Bree,let mrs. van de kamp turn your oven into a time machine.
3347,Bree,"oh. well, i'm familiar with that award. in fact, i'm this year's recipient."
3348,Bree,"yes. there's a luncheon on the 12th. i do hope you can make it. oh. by the way, you're right about those colors. very--jazzy."
3349,Bree,"orson, what are you doing in the guest bedroom?"
3350,Bree,me? snoring?
1304,Bree,no.
3353,Bree,"hi, everybody! you having a good time?"
3355,Bree,"actually, stu's company is doing all my advertising."
1308,Bree,"yeah, of course we are."
3357,Bree,"oh, that's not until 4:00."
1310,Bree,"i don't think so. but thank you, though."
1314,Bree,"well, i'm sorry, but i'm not going to."
1315,Bree,"because i don't feel like it. and this is the last time we're gonna talk about this, okay?"
3364,Bree,you need to leave now.
3365,Bree,hi.
3367,Bree,you have nothing to be jealous of.
1323,Bree,"see, the thing is, i don't think we are anymore."
1324,Bree,"please, you should go."
1326,Bree,"george, i don't want to!"
1329,Bree,if you'll excuse me for just one minute.
3379,Bree,it's not that easy. you know she'll be furious.
3381,Bree,"careful, dear. you don't want to be ill tomorrow."
1334,Bree,"don't lie to me, george. you've been riding up and down this street for the last hour."
3382,Bree,"uh, would anybody like some more frittata?"
3392,Bree,i don't know if i can make it this time.
1347,Bree,"oh, thank you."
3396,Bree,"no, you will not. i forbid it."
3401,Bree,"orson, i should have never offered you that job. it wasn't fair to katherine."
1355,Bree,"yes, you did. but that's not what i'm talking about. you killed rex. but i know it wasn't totally your fault because you're not well. so, if you'll just be honest with me, i can forgive you. it'll be the hardest thing i've ever done, but i'll do it. but you have to, you have to tell me the truth."
1356,Bree,not until you admit what you've done.
1357,Bree,i called them while you were asleep. they're already on their way.
3403,Bree,i hope you didn't mean what you said earlier. you just don't understand what i owe to katherine.
3404,Bree,"you know that--brunch we had for you right before you left for prison? i was very tense, and i was very unhappy. so i had--a glass of champagne."
3409,Bree,"oh. well, it looks like we're all set until the morning then. hey, why don't you, uh, take the afternoon off?"
1364,Bree,"'""unsavory items'?well,what does that mean?''"
1365,Bree,''what is that?''
1367,Bree,"''i don't understand. i mean what would george be doing with a life-size doll?oh,dear lord.''"
1369,Bree,"don't you worry about me, detective barton. i will be just fine."
1371,Bree,"well, we'll never know."
1379,Bree,justin? is he a friend of yours from school or church? what kind of friend is he?
1380,Bree,"andrew, it is inappropriate for you to have somebody over. you just got home."
1386,Bree,nothing. i just sat there and let him die.
3435,Bree,"peter's a felon? but he's so refined, so handsome."
1388,Bree,george paid for what he did to your father.
1389,Bree,what kind of friend is he?
3436,Bree,"my god, orson. what kind of criminal is he? a killer or a rapist?"
3442,Bree,"oh, my god. you slept with him?"
1397,Bree,i saw what you did with your friend.
1399,Bree,"i may not be able to control what you do outside of this home,but while you are under this roof,you will not mock my values.if you so much as smile at that boy,so help me, i will ship you off to camp hennessey and i will not pick you up again until you are 18.do i make myself clear?"
3450,Bree,"and i'm not family? katherine, all my life, i wanted a sister. and now i feel like i finally have one."
1403,Bree,"no, i wouldn't be so hard on yourself, given her history."
3457,Bree,"charlie, we wouldn't accuse you unless we had concrete evidence, and thanks to my diligent partner here, we do."
1411,Bree,"wake up, sleepyhead.i brought fresh croissants for breakfast!"
3461,Bree,"me, too. you go first."
1414,Bree,"i am serious, andrew.you tell him to get out of here this second or i will call the police, and i will have him removed!"
3462,Bree,"oh. well, are you sure she's trustworthy?"
1417,Bree,andrew--
3465,Bree,"i have to admit, i had some reservations about us working together, but this has succeeded beyond my wildest dreams."
3467,Bree,orson! you can't be serious! here?
3472,Bree,that does it. we're pressing charges.
1427,Bree,what noises?
3475,Bree,"before anything got serious, i made a point of turning the camera off."
3477,Bree,"obviously, you turned it back on."
1431,Bree,bye.
1437,Bree,"oh,you mean your having suspected me of murdering my husband?detective,that is all water under the bridge now."
3491,Bree,"hello, katherine. um, i thought you might want this videota--from our surveillance camera."
1445,Bree,"all right,we'll split it."
1446,Bree,"detective barton,is this some sort of high school ploy to get me back to your place?"
3508,Bree,"""a deeper look suggests something darker, something more ominous, a woman whose perky surface conceals a deep, almost demonic thirst for power."
3509,Bree,you must be sandra. what a sharp outfit. and look at that hair--so thick and lustrous.
1463,Bree,"you know,thank you,but i think it's actually something more mechanical.my car has been making just a terrible noise."
3512,Bree,you say that like it's a bad thing. i think that decade had a lot to recommend it.
3514,Bree,"andrew, please. the machine can get it. we never answer the phone while entertaining. so rude to one's guests."
1468,Bree,"you know,you sound like you don't believe me."
1469,Bree,"i'm sorry,but since when do you know so much about my personal life?"
3517,Bree,what kind of rumors?
1473,Bree,"danielle?honey, are you in there?"
1477,Bree,"danielle, question?is there a black man hiding under your bed?"
1480,Bree,"oh, honey, what happened wasn't my fault.there's no way i could've predicted how betty would react."
3528,Bree,goodness.
1482,Bree,"danielle, that's ridiculous,sweetheart."
3532,Bree,at least the house won't be quiet anymore.
3534,Bree,"orson, dear, because of the way your nose was broken during the fire, you now snore."
3535,Bree,good point. snoring is too mild a word for what you're doing. imagine a terrified elephant summoning his herd.
3542,Bree,"oh, god, susan. can't this wait till after my nap?"
3543,Bree,i didn't think it was my place. i thought katherine should tell you.
1496,Bree,betty.what a surprise.
3544,Bree,i'm sorry.
1498,Bree,i don't know what you mean.
3548,Bree,and how exactly are you gonna stop snoring?
3555,Bree,9:15? huh? 9:15. i'm supposed to be at the mall. did i forget to set the alarm?
1511,Bree,oh! what is it?
1512,Bree,excuse me?
1513,Bree,can we talk about this later?i-i have ice cream in here.
3561,Bree,"of course i can. you are such a nervous nellie, rex."
1522,Bree,"so take good care of your looks, danielle.you don't have any other weapons at your disposal."
1523,Bree,caleb? is that you?
1526,Bree,"yes.your mother told me all about you and i thought it it might be nice if, um,we had a little visit.i brought you some homemade cobbler."
1527,Bree,"so, caleb,besides your mother and brother,does anybody else know that you're here?"
1528,Bree,thank you.that's very sweet.so where have you been living this whole time? upstairs?
3576,Bree,"why the secrecy? did you think i'd disapprove? the man's a doctor, for heaven sakes. you've done better than i did."
1530,Bree,"caleb, have you been down here all these months?"
1531,Bree,did your mother make you wear those?
3583,Bree,"andrew, you can't criticize my parenting and then deny me the chance to make up for it. orson and i will expect you at 8:00."
1537,Bree,"aren't you gonna ask me what we talked about?the name, um--melanie foster came up.i'm gonna pour you a drink now, betty,because we're about to have a very honest discussion,and i think you're gonna need a little help getting through it."
3586,Bree,"all right then, alex. oh, look at you two, sitting so far apart. scootch over."
1541,Bree,"well,i didn't wanna come here because i was afraid it would drudge up memories of my husband.you know,this was our place.rex passed away recently.he was,um,murdered by our pharmacist."
1547,Bree,"look,for the record,i had an allergic reactionto my antihistamine medication,so i would appreciate just a little bit of sympathy."
1555,Bree,"okay,we're done playing hide-and-seek!boys?!"
1567,Bree,"lynette,if i close my eyes even for a moment,it's because of these antihistamines i've been taking."
3619,Bree,what?
1573,Bree,"because what happened was,i accidentally mixed my antihistamine medication with,you know, a little glass of wine i was having, and i-i fell asleep, you know,while i was--watching her kids.i mean,i like a little wine with dinner,i mean,now and then. you know,who doesn't?but,uh,i mean,you know, to trash my entire reputation--"
3623,Bree,i am not bidding on time with my son.
3630,Bree,i don't know if i have it in me. she's such a troglodyte.
1583,Bree,"you know,on second thought, i won't be driving you to school.the walk will do you good."
1590,Bree,this is ridiculous.can't you see this is a performance?
3641,Bree,"hmm. excuse--excuse me, melina. that's my chair."
1596,Bree,"your lawyer left a message on my machine.it seems we have a hearing in four weeks,and i wanna be ready."
3646,Bree,you're gonna have kids?
3647,Bree,i bought you the adams house!
1601,Bree,"if i really thought that,i'd get a gun right now and kill us both."
3649,Bree,"oh, it's nothing you wouldn't do."
3651,Bree,you know it.
3652,Bree,"well, maybe they were only together a short time, and she didn't mean anything to him."
1606,Bree,"my name is bree, and i am an alcoholic."
1608,Bree,"hi.before coming to these meetings,i never realized how messy substance abusers can be."
1609,Bree,you're awful.
3658,Bree,you think you're excited? just imagine the salesman who overcharged you.
1614,Bree,exactly.
3666,Bree,"""tough""? that's not a word i would use to describe myself."
3668,Bree,"hi, mike."
1622,Bree,"andrew,there may be a judge out there stupid enough to emancipate you,but until you find him,i retain all my parental rights,one of which is to ground your sorry behind until kingdom come.mr bormanis,nice to see you again.and,um,please don't get crumbs on my carpet."
1623,Bree,"oh,no,thank you.i have to run. just the check.i have a charity event this weekend,and i have to find a cocktail dress before the store closes.but everything was just yummy."
1624,Bree,what do you think you're doing?you're supposed to be grounded.
1626,Bree,you took that out of my purse.
3680,Bree,"if by ""strings,"" you mean i won't let you be rude to me in my own house, then yes."
3682,Bree,"oh, good. you're back. can we talk?"
3683,Bree,"fine. then as my employee, i authorize a 5-minute break so we can talk about my son's boyfriend and his absurd overreaction this afternoon."
1638,Bree,"i'm raising a monster,is what i'm raising.it's no wonder i drink.i don't know why i said that."
1641,Bree,really?because i don't.
1642,Bree,"i'm curious,peter.what is the easiest way to overcome addiction?"
3689,Bree,we're ready! come on.
3691,Bree,"i don't know. what do you think, gaby? gaby?"
3693,Bree,"no, we don't."
3694,Bree,"and then there's church, of course."
3698,Bree,"great. gaby, do you have your copy?"
3705,Bree,"and i think you would appreciate my value more if, for once, you had to cook your own food and wash your own clothes."
3708,Bree,"since i started writing my own cookbook. remember how you told me i should start making my own money? well, i've been going through all my old recipes, and i've got this great idea for a real home-style american cookbook."
3709,Bree,why wouldn't i be? people are always complimenting me on my cooking.
1664,Bree,"i got,uh,your message that you wanted to see me before the meeting started."
3712,Bree,"thanks, eli."
1670,Bree,hmm. some muffins?
3718,Bree,wait. i wanted to fix something for eli for a change.
3721,Bree,"hello, ladies. what do you think?"
1674,Bree,come on?where are we going?
3722,Bree,"my book just made the ""times'"" best seller list. now they're talking 3-book deal, so i got the urge to splurge. and look what just blew on my windshield at the stop sign! life is good."
3727,Bree,"and here i am, rubbing my fabulous new car in her face. i feel awful."
3738,Bree,we most certainly do--partner.
1694,Bree,"i slapped him once,and he deserved it."
1699,Bree,really?and whose idea was that?
1700,Bree,absolutely not.
1701,Bree,"do you really think that i am enjoying airing my dirty laundry in public?this whole situation is mortifying.but i can't back down because he is my son,and i need more time to get through to him."
3747,Bree,certainly.
3750,Bree,"well, you might have to. excuse me."
1705,Bree,"eleanor,please--"
3754,Bree,"oh, perhaps you do, but my recipe specifies fresh grated."
1709,Bree,oh.why?
3757,Bree,"if this doesn't stop your mother-in-law from criticizing your cooking, i will give you a full refund."
3760,Bree,"oh, dear. i was hoping to spare your feelings, but since you know, i wasn't comfortable having my recipe made with substandard ingredients."
1714,Bree,"so tell me,how are you doing?i mean,your entire world must be turned upside down.you must be exhausted."
1717,Bree,are you sure? i was talking to her in the steam room for about 20 minutes.
3767,Bree,"well, i'm not the one who needed $20,000 to keep my business afloat."
3768,Bree,where are you going?
1726,Bree,"uh,yeah,they wrote you a letter.it seems they came across some personal items of yours that, um,upset them."
3780,Bree,"well, the chamber of commerce just called. they've added 40 people to their guest list."
3781,Bree,"oh, thank god."
3784,Bree,andrew moved into a new home. i simply gave him a cost of living increase.
1742,Bree,"look, you don't have to worry about peter,not while he's with me."
1743,Bree,"because when it comes to sex,i have an unwavering moral compass.truly. a man could beg and plead all day long,and it wouldn't make any difference.so since i have such strong self-control,there's really no reason for us to end our friendship."
3790,Bree,of course it could just as easily be munchy cedarhurst.
1745,Bree,"well, aren't you the renaissance man."
3793,Bree,"orson, why are you being so morbid?"
1755,Bree,"yes, and in that time,i've come to learn that you're good and kind and smart.and, yes,you have a little problem that you need some help with,but i'm willing to be there for you.so what's the big deal?"
1758,Bree,"hi,i'm--i'm looking for,um, peter mcmillan."
1759,Bree,"no, no, i'm--i'm good.i'm just, um, here to pick up my friend peter.he's locked himself in your bathroom,and i'm here to take him home."
1763,Bree,what are you doing here?
1768,Bree,"rex said he'd always be faithful.george said he'd never hurt me.and as it turned out,they were both liars.so as long as you're honest with me,you'd be amazed at what i can put up with.now let's go home."
3817,Bree,yeah.
1772,Bree,"if i hadn't been in the house,he could've raped her--or worse."
1773,Bree,"needless to say,the agreement between us is off.caleb is dangerous,and i want him put away.if he is not gone by tomorrow,i am calling the police."
3823,Bree,i hope you enjoyed that.
3825,Bree,it's orson.
3828,Bree,"well, i just wanted to get you together with tom here. i thought you two might hit it off."
3830,Bree,"well, we're on pins and needles. how's it going?"
3832,Bree,this is not what i had in mind.
3833,Bree,"now, now. he's been very good to me."
3836,Bree,i'll get your coat.
3838,Bree,give it.
1793,Bree,"oh,my god,are you okay?"
1794,Bree,"well,i guess that's important,so--"
1802,Bree,"i packed up some of your things.there's also,um,an envelope in here with some money,and that should tide you over until you get a job."
1803,Bree,i noticed a bus stop about a mile back.you can go anywhere you want.
1807,Bree,i can't be around you anymore.i'm just not strong enough.
1814,Bree,"honey, you've gotta let me make it up to you.i-i'm gonna throw you a birthday party with all your friends, okay?"
3863,Bree,"i don't know, but it's awfully cute."
3864,Bree,"why are you, uh, calling juanita?"
3867,Bree,"gaby! aren't you being a little harsh? i mean, perhaps she didn't take it."
3868,Bree,"juanita! whenever my children stole, i sent them to bed without any supper. just a thought."
3869,Bree,orson? orson! orson! orson! orson! no!
1830,Bree,it just keeps coming out too thick.
3882,Bree,you wanna help? why don't you go down to the pharmacy in the lobby and buy some aspirin? i'm gonna need it. i don't deserve this. i have been nothing but supportive of you since you got out of jail. i even gave you a job.
3885,Bree,all the while thinking i had your support.
1838,Bree,you!
1840,Bree,"it's just a cake, for god sakes.will you please just cut it?"
1841,Bree,open your mouth.i wanna smell your breath.
3894,Bree,"mr. dinsmore, would you mind if i speak to my husband for a moment?"
3897,Bree,"just give me one year. that's not asking too much, is it?"
1851,Bree,"because when i sleep,i dream,and when i dream,i keep seeing andrew's face in that rearview mirror."
1852,Bree,"andrew, didn't run away.i, dropped him off in the middle of nowhere,told him that i couldn't be around him anymore,and then--i drove off.so i just need a little time to forget what i've done,and then i can sleep again."
3899,Bree,"actually, no. i'm not selling."
1858,Bree,"well, it seems that my son stole it from your yard."
3915,Bree,"oh, not, uh, just yet. it's not a bad idea, having an upgrade available. i bet that's a perk people would be willing to pay for."
1872,Bree,"um, listen, i told my friends that i was, um, i was at a spa, so if you run into susan,i--"
1881,Bree,"oh, they're fine.andrew is backpacking through europe, and danielle is away at cheerleading camp."
1882,Bree,what do you mean?
1884,Bree,fine. then i'm going back to my room.
3935,Bree,"my theory--edie knew if she was buried, her true date of birth would be carved into a tombstone for all the world to see."
1890,Bree,hello?
3938,Bree,we brought you some muffins. you can share them with your roommates or maybe a favorite teacher.
3940,Bree,"if you'd like, we could give you a moment."
1894,Bree,"okay, there's no camp. that was a fib on my part.i found out that she ran away with a boy and the boy is a murderer."
1895,Bree,i can tell by your tone that you don't believe me.
1896,Bree,"i don't have time for therapy, you quack!now let me out of here!let go of me!you idiot. let go of me!"
3947,Bree,shouldn't we say something first?
3948,Bree,i don't know. a few words describing how we felt about her?
3949,Bree,perceptive.
3951,Bree,really? that soon?
1904,Bree,"why is my certainty a flaw? i know what i'm about,i know my values, and i know what's right.why shouldn't i stay the course? am i right, mr. williams?"
1905,Bree,"exactly, and look how well you turned out."
3954,Bree,how can you just decide something like that?
1907,Bree,"oh, i was afraid of that."
3957,Bree,he sounded very sincere.
3960,Bree,"well, i can understand why you're a bit cynical, but i'm giving him another chance. he's my husband, and i still love him."
3961,Bree,i know.
1914,Bree,"well, there's nothing like being tied to a bed to change a girl's mind."
1917,Bree,"well, i'm glad that you're having fun."
3966,Bree,"oh, right. i heard she was here."
1920,Bree,probably because i'm ashamed.
1921,Bree,"my children were my life.they were the reason that i got up in the morning, so to have failed them as a parent--"
1922,Bree,"well, my son is a sociopath, and my daughter hates me enough to have run away from home. i'm certainly not gonna get ""mother of the year"" anytime soon."
3973,Bree,wonderful.
1935,Bree,"it's okay, baby."
3990,Bree,"well, that's the rule. there's nothing you can do about it. so stop bitching."
3994,Bree,you don't say.
1948,Bree,"well, um, i wanted to invite you to a dinner that orson and i are having this saturday."
3996,Bree,"no, thanks, i don't drink."
1952,Bree,"i know it's quick but it's just feel so right.orson is just the most warm, wonderful, generous man."
1953,Bree,"actually, no, we haven't had sex yet.we're waiting until we get married."
1954,Bree,"whatever you're alluding to, no."
1955,Bree,"true, i have in the past, given myself away too freely.how charming of you to bring that up while i'm announcing my engagement.but i'd like to think that i've learned from my mistakes.so the dinner is at 8:00 and when we make the announcement, please, everyone look surprised."
1961,Bree,hum.it will be better this way.now can i get you some more ice cream?
1963,Bree,"i just can't help it.i like telling people.makes me feel, i don't know.makes me feel like i'm starting over.feels good."
4011,Bree,"now, m.j., we can find faults with all our friends if we nitpick. what do you say? will you invite him? would you like some ice cream with your macaroons? because i could make that happen."
4012,Bree,"m.j., there's someone in my life who hits me with a dead squirrel every single day. and you are the only one who can help me. please, please invite evan to your party."
1966,Bree,"ahh, excuse me."
1969,Bree,i'm a republican!
4019,Bree,"absolutely not. i am all up for a little creative accounting and some secret bank accounts, but hiring some thug to stage a break-in?"
1972,Bree,"ah.oh, no!"
1976,Bree,"i was, ah, with my fiance.we were lying down, resting."
1978,Bree,"no, no, no.i've had orgasms before."
4026,Bree,we should probably break a window to make it look more real.
4028,Bree,"uh, yes. as i recall, it's quite valuable."
1984,Bree,"oh well, come on in.let's dry you off and get you a drink."
1988,Bree,so are you still married?
1989,Bree,"no, of course not.i love you."
4036,Bree,"yes, being a lady takes effort."
1991,Bree,the buffet is open.
4037,Bree,"you wanna be a neanderthal, karl? that's your choice. i prefer to behave with class and dignity. now may we please finish robbing my home?"
4038,Bree,"oh, thank you."
1994,Bree,i mean i was lucky to find these. it's not easy putting a wedding together in two weeks.
1998,Bree,"orson, i moved the furniture back!"
1999,Bree,don't you want our first dance to be perfect?
4051,Bree,i doubt that.
2008,Bree,i can't talk to orson. it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding!
2010,Bree,none whatsoever.
4061,Bree,"yes, and i'll be single again, and i can concentrate on my business, maybe do some traveling."
4066,Bree,"well, the key is to not let them know what you're doing. this requires observation, cunning and manipulation."
2020,Bree,how do you know him?
2025,Bree,he's kind and decent and nothing you could say will ever make me doubt him again. now please go.
2027,Bree,i'm fine. let's just go back to our guests and forget any of this ever happened.
2029,Bree,"i don't need to be any happier than i am at this very second. oh, my goodness, there's only fifteen minutes before our plane.if you want that latte you should go now."
4078,Bree,excuse me?
4079,Bree,"orson, i understand this is a shock, but you have to face facts. our marriage is over."
2035,Bree,so you can't tell me anything about my son's whereabouts?
4085,Bree,that will never happen.
4086,Bree,"orson, please don't do this. i don't love you."
2042,Bree,"there won't be, not anymore."
2046,Bree,"oh, thank you, miss--"
6144,Gabrielle,"no! ooh, i remember. carlos was so annoyed. what did you say, hon? ""he may have that trophy, but i've got you."" ain't life funny?"
6154,Gabrielle,"yes, you saw my boobs, and you're gonna have that mental snapshot to use as you wish for the rest of your life, but that is all you're getting!"
8204,Gabrielle,"it's an exercise class. why would anyone say ""doughnut""?"
6159,Gabrielle,"stop it, phil. i told you to beat it. no means no!"
8209,Gabrielle,"yeah, yeah, yeah. time-out."
6161,Gabrielle,shut up.
8211,Gabrielle,yeah. are we gonna get a break soon?
6163,Gabrielle,"oh,i have to,carlos.i need you to give up on us.we're not good for each other,and i can't keep doing this."
6164,Gabrielle,you know what? i'm tired. can we talk about this in the morning?
6168,Gabrielle,you're giving me everything i want? just like that?
8219,Gabrielle,are you out of mind? i have two sleeping children.
8221,Gabrielle,"oh, really? well, try this on for size. i'm going back to bed, because i'm tired. and when i wake up, maybe i'll have some cake, and you can't stop me."
8222,Gabrielle,"well, frankly, some of them need it. i just came for a little remodel, and there are some real teardowns out there."
6178,Gabrielle,"well, that's fantastic! i get half, right?"
4131,Gabrielle,how do you think he'll react when we tell him?
8228,Gabrielle,"oh, i think i've changed a little bit."
8229,Gabrielle,"jean, wait."
6179,Gabrielle,"that conniving, underhanded snake! thank god i broke into his desk."
6183,Gabrielle,"oh. well, i was trying to do that with exercise,but why risk a heart attack? make mine a double!"
8233,Gabrielle,"oh, i'll be more willing to forgive once his bonus check comes in."
8238,Gabrielle,"oh, put it on and have a good time. turns out i'm no gonna be able to afford it right now--unless you can help me out on the price."
4143,Gabrielle,"every time i'm around that man, he tries to grab my ass."
8241,Gabrielle,"carlos, get in here! i got a real shockeroo for you! you are not gonna believe this! brad! hi. uh, what's going on?"
6195,Gabrielle,see you later!
4148,Gabrielle,let me see.
4149,Gabrielle,"this table is hand carved. carlos had it imported from italy. it cost him $23,000."
4151,Gabrielle,what?
6199,Gabrielle,"oh,thanks.i'm gonna go meet some new friends for dinner.but my zipper's stuck.can you help me?"
6200,Gabrielle,"huh. weird. well, you know what? i don't wanna be late, so i should, um, probably change."
8251,Gabrielle,so--what's going on? i'm gonna buy a golf club. a baseball bat would be cheaper. maybe i should let you finish.
8252,Gabrielle,"oh, it's a gift. sure, yeah. we'd love to help out. so what's the occasion?"
4155,Gabrielle,i do.
4156,Gabrielle,because i don't wanna wake up some morning with a sudden urge to blow my brains out.
6203,Gabrielle,really? it seems like yesterday to me.
8257,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. i think they do.
8263,Gabrielle,hey. when did you two get here?
8266,Gabrielle,"do you hear that, carlos? godparents."
4171,Gabrielle,"it's open, what's the big deal?"
8269,Gabrielle,"so, brad, what sort of bonus are we looking at?"
4173,Gabrielle,"if mary alice was having some sort of crisis, we'd have known. she lives 50 feet away, for god's sakes."
4174,Gabrielle,"every time i'm around that man, he tries to grab my ass!"
4176,Gabrielle,what's that?
8273,Gabrielle,"shut it, bitch."
8274,Gabrielle,"they had theater tickets, and their sitter canceled. we're only gonna watch their kids for a couple hours."
8275,Gabrielle,shh. hi!
4179,Gabrielle,"i'll find them, just get out!"
4181,Gabrielle,"go, go!"
8280,Gabrielle,you're using me as an alibi now?
4186,Gabrielle,we could always call the police.
8283,Gabrielle,"4:00? let me think. actually, noon would be better for me. could you do noon?"
6237,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!"
4190,Gabrielle,is that white gold?
8287,Gabrielle,katherine hung one of mike's paintings over the mantel till she found out susan painted it. then she took it down.
6240,Gabrielle,"i keep thinking about that crazy lady in the market, and--i understand her. i could be her."
8289,Gabrielle,"fine. fine. i will do it, but you owe me. i gotta go."
4195,Gabrielle,"it's not exciting anymore, carlos."
8292,Gabrielle,what? you can't do that. you'll lose your job and all that money.
8293,Gabrielle,i do-- and so does my personal shopper and pilates instructor.
8295,Gabrielle,it means--tomorrow i'm going to the mall to get my hair cut by a slut.
6247,Gabrielle,"sure, knock yourself out."
8298,Gabrielle,i need a fresh look. i've been going through some pretty intense personal stuff lately.
8301,Gabrielle,"oh, no. she does. she loves him plenty."
4205,Gabrielle,"oh, it's a rose."
4206,Gabrielle,"oh, john."
6253,Gabrielle,"no. no, no, no, no, no, no."
6263,Gabrielle,"are you serious? well, i can't tell because your face doesn't move anymore."
4217,Gabrielle,carlos!
6265,Gabrielle,"well, i guess you're all set then."
8315,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, i'm not that person anymore. i've changed."
4219,Gabrielle,absolutely!
4220,Gabrielle,i really hate the way you talk to me.
6269,Gabrielle,"it's gaby. gabrielle marquez. you shot me in milan, remember?"
4223,Gabrielle,mary alice was so excited about it. so sad.
6271,Gabrielle,"people aren't gonna buy that, so here's what i was thinking. i slap on one of those gowns, i play tanya's big sister home from college to raise a little hell."
8322,Gabrielle,i should have done it sooner.
8327,Gabrielle,i want to go home!
4231,Gabrielle,"well, get here as fast as you can. my husband says i need to relax."
6282,Gabrielle,"well, if something great comes up, i might fly out, but i'm pretty settled here."
8337,Gabrielle,"anyway, juanita went over before breakfast to invite m.j. to her birthday party, and, well, candy plus juanita. you don't have to be sherlock holmes to crack this case."
4242,Gabrielle,"okay. well, you enjoy your new girlfriend. and if there's anything else you need, you just let me know."
6290,Gabrielle,i'm not doing it.
6293,Gabrielle,"i'm here to teach fashion, so i'm fashionably late."
8345,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah. how's that going?"
6298,Gabrielle,"all right, girls, first things first things first. if you can't walk, you can't win. hit it, vern!"
6304,Gabrielle,"you were totally walking! good job! all right, donna, you're next. get up there and make me hate your beauty."
8357,Gabrielle,"well, you can beg all you want. i am not on board with this!"
4261,Gabrielle,yes!
4263,Gabrielle,relax! carlos is at work and he doesn't ring the doorbell.
8360,Gabrielle,i'll bet. so were you surprised when the door opened?
4266,Gabrielle,how long are you going to be?
6317,Gabrielle,"is it about the girls' makeup? 'cause i got them each their own makeup kit, custom-tailored to match their skin tone. and i got melina some wax. i know she's only eleven, but those greek genes are gonna kick in any day now. what?"
4271,Gabrielle,that's a sock.
6319,Gabrielle,those damn tobacco companies!
8370,Gabrielle,to find out what mccluskey's sleeping mexican is doing in my house.
8372,Gabrielle,it's been sitting on mccluskey's porch for years. i keep telling her how racist it is. first the candy bowl and now this? how many times have i told you not to steal?
8375,Gabrielle,"well, then how else did it get here?"
8377,Gabrielle,"hear about it? honey, i did it. i talked to carlos. you're in."
8378,Gabrielle,"say, ""how do i thank you, greatest friend in the world? what's your birthstone?"""
6330,Gabrielle,"amy, small steps. small! little miss snowflake glides. she doesn't stomp."
8380,Gabrielle,because it's a great opportunity.
4284,Gabrielle,really?
6331,Gabrielle,"getting there, sweetie. if she was a horse, we'd have to shoot her."
6334,Gabrielle,"yes, i know, i know, and it's tragic, but we are running a business. amy is sucking up all of our time, and we should be focusing on sherri. she actually has a shot at winning."
8384,Gabrielle,i just wanted to see how your first day went. sit. take a load off. spill it.
4290,Gabrielle,i think he's hiding something. i know it.
6339,Gabrielle,"i'm always diplomatic. now just get in there, you spineless 'mo."""
4292,Gabrielle,so why weren't you sitting with mike tonight? i thought you two were becoming an item.
6341,Gabrielle,vern! he is so competitive. i constantly have to remind him they're just kids. when did you lose the joy?
8391,Gabrielle,you needed a job. i did you a favor. and then i brought you hot cocoa. why don't you ever thank me?
4295,Gabrielle,paul and zach are fighting again.
4296,Gabrielle,mama solis!
6343,Gabrielle,great! it's a date.
6345,Gabrielle,"oh, um, the grass, honey, and my allergies--go ahead and practice. i'll watch you from here. are you sure i can't help with anything?"
6346,Gabrielle,i've got the restaurant thing down. i can't bring myself to cook for one. not that i ever cooked for two.
6347,Gabrielle,"aw, that's sweet."
8398,Gabrielle,but can't lucy cover it?
8400,Gabrielle,"right, that's why i didn't suggest a longie. oh, come on. i'll have your eyes rolling back in your head in three minutes flat."
8403,Gabrielle,"right. well, we'll create new table memoes."
4309,Gabrielle,no.
4312,Gabrielle,now don't be mad.
8409,Gabrielle,okay. we'll start with something a little easier--bitching.
4313,Gabrielle,it's not my fault. juanita hasn't let me out of her sight since she got here.
6361,Gabrielle,"amy, you are so lucky to have such a nice dad."
4318,Gabrielle,so why do you want to go back to something you don't want?
6366,Gabrielle,sherri from class?
4320,Gabrielle,so why are we arguing?
6369,Gabrielle,"oh. well, i think dedication should be rewarded, so i have a little surprise for you."
8186,Gabrielle,have you not noticed me working my butt off? i'm almost back to the weight i was when we got married!
8419,Gabrielle,"oh, if that were true, your pants would be around your ankles right now."
4323,Gabrielle,don't worry. i'll think of something.
4324,Gabrielle,coming!
8187,Gabrielle,"no, no. this'll be way more romantic. i'm one good colonic away from being the old me!"
4328,Gabrielle,"oh, mama, you're in a rut! we need to spice up your wardrobe. oooh, try this one on."
4329,Gabrielle,"go on, try it on."
4331,Gabrielle,"yes, it's form-fitting. you're going to look great."
6379,Gabrielle,i'm so disappointed in her.
6380,Gabrielle,how did you find that out?
8432,Gabrielle,"i know you can't, and that's the part that really scares me."
6385,Gabrielle,hello?
8435,Gabrielle,"well, can you at least put the radio on? i won't feel like bitching if i can sing along to something."
8436,Gabrielle,it's a 4-hour drive. we have to do something to pass the time.
6387,Gabrielle,where the hell are you?
6388,Gabrielle,what are you doing at mike's house?
6389,Gabrielle,what do you mean you live there? since when?
6390,Gabrielle,"well,as you can see, i have more pleasant things to focus on."
6392,Gabrielle,so where were we?
6394,Gabrielle,"that's right, carlos. we have had some pblems with raccoons getting into the trash. so why don't you just put a lid on it?"
6397,Gabrielle,look at you! who knew you were such a romantic?
6400,Gabrielle,that's sweet that you're not jealous. carlos would've hit the roof if some guy sent me--would you excuse me a minute?
4353,Gabrielle,did you find out where zach is?
4354,Gabrielle,"well, he did break into your house. i mean, the kid is obviously troubled in some way."
6401,Gabrielle,"nice try, carlos."
6406,Gabrielle,"bill is not boring. he is vibrant, and, and sexy."
4363,Gabrielle,"well, who am i to argue with sociologists? wow this, uh, this guacamole has got a kick. i'm going to run to the little girls' room. you guys go ahead, i might be a while."
8460,Gabrielle,"okay, you really think you're hotter than me?"
8461,Gabrielle,"yeah? well, i have a vodka soda here that says otherwise."
4364,Gabrielle,why haven't you returned any of my phone calls?
4366,Gabrielle,"well, before you get any friendlier, let me remind you, i can do things to you she can't even pronounce."
8464,Gabrielle,"see ya in an hour, loser."
6411,Gabrielle,hi. i received some flowers from your shop yesterday and the card didn't say who they were from. can you check the name is solis.
6412,Gabrielle,yeah.
6414,Gabrielle,why? they're just flowers. they're not government secrets.
6417,Gabrielle,sorry for doing this.
4373,Gabrielle,was this before we were married?
4374,Gabrielle,"honey, it was only a small neighborhood game."
8471,Gabrielle,"oh, that's ridiculous."
4376,Gabrielle,"oh, i thought we would stop here for lunch first. this place has the best buffet in town. all you can eat crab legs. oh no!"
6419,Gabrielle,"yeah? well, stop by. we'll hot tub."
4378,Gabrielle,"well, if the mall is crowded, it might take over an hour."
6422,Gabrielle,"what?! no, he's obsessed with me."
6423,Gabrielle,"okay, i see what you mean."
6432,Gabrielle,so you are dating. that's why you've been lifting weights and jogging.
8482,Gabrielle,are you sure?
4386,Gabrielle,"this is what we'll do. i'll sell some old jewelry, pay off the credit card, and carlos will never find out!"
8485,Gabrielle,i don't think edie would want us to get all sappy.
8488,Gabrielle,edie would so not be surprised you're welcome.
4394,Gabrielle,so meet me at the motel in an hour? john?
4395,Gabrielle,so cancel.
6442,Gabrielle,"carlos, this isn't funny. i am scared to death of this maniac."
6443,Gabrielle,"the guy broke into the house. he went from secret admirer to stalker. for all i know, he's trying to kill me so no one else will have me."
8495,Gabrielle,"i know i'm new here at the garden club, but what's with all the gardening? i thought this was just an excuse to get together for bitchin' and boozin'."
6449,Gabrielle,"hey, i'm scared, but not of the dress."
8498,Gabrielle,"oh. well, this edna has got to be stopped."
6450,Gabrielle,"carlos! carlos, wake up! i need you!"
8501,Gabrielle,"okay, so the lush gives us six. what about them?"
6453,Gabrielle,"carlos, be careful! he might have a gun!"
4409,Gabrielle,"oh, don't be that way."
4410,Gabrielle,i don't want us to end on a bad note. carlos has this black tie thing tonight. i could slip--
4411,Gabrielle,"john, please, what we had was so special. i think it deserves a proper goodbye."
4416,Gabrielle,"well, that's it then."
4418,Gabrielle,do you have a cell phone?
8515,Gabrielle,patty lives six blocks away. i live down the street. why didn't you ask me to take you?
6469,Gabrielle,so what does this diary look like?
6470,Gabrielle,"oh, god!"
8519,Gabrielle,i trump your mother. i am garden club president.
4424,Gabrielle,"um, no, i think i will stay here with mama."
6478,Gabrielle,"wow, someone got an advance on their allowance."
8527,Gabrielle,exactly.
4432,Gabrielle,we'll talk about this later.
6482,Gabrielle,"next time? honey, let's get real. you are way too young for me."
6484,Gabrielle,you've heard about my divorce.
8533,Gabrielle,"no. i get it. when we first moved here, carlos was working round the clock, and he'd come home and barely say hello to me."
8534,Gabrielle,it was like i was invisible.
4437,Gabrielle,you need to keep a low profile right now.
8536,Gabrielle,i never thought i'd do it to carlos.
4440,Gabrielle,"oh, for god's sakes, between you and carlos! listen to me carefully, you didn't do anything wrong."
6485,Gabrielle,and let me guess--now you're my upgrade?
8539,Gabrielle,"yeah. there's gonna be a huge dinner, and we're taking a picture with the mayor and his wife."
6487,Gabrielle,"well, they were wrong. thank you for lunch, zach."
4445,Gabrielle,"father, i'm so glad you could come and pray for mama. please, sit, sit."
8542,Gabrielle,there's an extra piece of cinnamon toast on the table.
6491,Gabrielle,"uh, it was fabulous. thanks for asking."
6496,Gabrielle,"yeah, about that--um, i'm installing an alarm system tomorrow, so i'm not gonna need you to look after me anymore."
8546,Gabrielle,why?
4450,Gabrielle,"well, aren't you just a ball of fun. so, if i confess, it'll clean the slate, right?"
4451,Gabrielle,"so what happens if i repent, later, like, say, when i'm 75?"
8549,Gabrielle,"well, it's a big, fancy dinner. of course."
6498,Gabrielle,i won't. but thank you.
8551,Gabrielle,"okay, see? your daddy's got a great idea."
6504,Gabrielle,what did you do?
4458,Gabrielle,my life. it hasn't turned out like i thought it would.
6506,Gabrielle,"listen to me, you pimply psychopath. you and i are never going to party. in fact, the only reason we're ever gonna be in the same room again is if you strangle a cheerleader and i wind up on the jury!"
4461,Gabrielle,"betty, listen to me."
6510,Gabrielle,"susan, do you know what your obsession with mike has cost you? first you piss off bree and then ian, and now you're pimping me out to a teenager!"
4466,Gabrielle,for what?
6515,Gabrielle,"yeah, here's how it's gonna work. we drive to the restaurant separately, we will not have dessert, and under no circumstances will you touch me. capisce?"
8565,Gabrielle,"fine. but just so we're clear, you're also latino jerk of the year."
6517,Gabrielle,"he's in jail--for murder. but susan swears he's innocent, and she wants you to get him a good lawyer. all right, we have a deal?"
8567,Gabrielle,"ladies! attention, please. i am in a jam, and i need lipstick and eyeliner. come on. chop chop."
8568,Gabrielle,"oh, that doesn't really go with my skin tone."
4471,Gabrielle,i don't know what his problem is. he's making money left and right. i just wish he'd relax.
6518,Gabrielle,no?
8571,Gabrielle,"oh, don't worry. i'm as healthy as a horse."
6524,Gabrielle,i know! you're such a good dancer! where'd you learn how to salsa?
8573,Gabrielle,"okay, okay, look. i'm sorry. you're right. i never should have asked."
6525,Gabrielle,when did i say that?
4479,Gabrielle,really?
6526,Gabrielle,"you researched me? that's sweet! in a, uh, stalkery kind of way. thanks again for a surprisingly enjoyable night. see you around."
8578,Gabrielle,"yes, i was. and my whole life, people told me how pretty i was. so you know what? i never--thought i had to work hard in school or work on friendships or my personality--none of it. and then i stopped modeling, and i realized i didn't have much on the inside. and i don't want that for you. i want you to be brave and funny and creative--to be more than just a shell. i want you to have the whole rich, gooey center. will you promise to do that for yourself?"
6530,Gabrielle,by who? the same girl that taught you to use your tongue like a windshield wiper?
8580,Gabrielle,we're rich again! hallelujah!
8582,Gabrielle,it is such a stunning piece. it's simple and elegant. don't you think?
6535,Gabrielle,"okay, i'm just a little--grossed out, that's all!"
8584,Gabrielle,"so when daddy finds out how much i spent, would it be okay if i used you as a human shield?"
6541,Gabrielle,i don't know. maybe it's because i think we're both-- adrift. it'd just be nice to have a pal who gets what i'm going through. why don't you play me something you wrote?
4496,Gabrielle,"you know, i think that's a great idea! okay, let's go!"
6546,Gabrielle,you can buy me that toilet seat cover.
4499,Gabrielle,"susan, i feel awful about what happened. susan, talk to me!"
6548,Gabrielle,"it means something to me.being alone at this age, it's hard,and it's only gonna get harder.i'm so depressed."
4501,Gabrielle,"because she'll tell carlos, and he'll divorce me!"
8600,Gabrielle,haha--ew
8601,Gabrielle,i'll explain it to him later.
6552,Gabrielle,"oh. well, why don't you try it out?"
6556,Gabrielle,it could happen.
6563,Gabrielle,"well, he seemed to like me in the mattress department, so here's hoping i like him the mattress department. what? friends say these things."
4516,Gabrielle,huh?
8613,Gabrielle,"i feel bad i ducked out so fast the other day. and i've been thinking about you a lot, and i just-- i really wanna help."
8614,Gabrielle,now--i just wanna make sure that you're not gonna--you know--
4517,Gabrielle,"carlos, wait!"
6566,Gabrielle,no.
6567,Gabrielle,it's okay. do you want some coffee?
4522,Gabrielle,here. three weeks in advance.
4524,Gabrielle,huh? that's my car! oh my god!
8623,Gabrielle,"well, if your idea of a good time is sitting on rusty lawn chairs in the driveway eating lard in the shape of chicken, then yeah! it's gonna be a blast."
6576,Gabrielle,"what is with you?! an hour ago, you we really into me, and now you can't get out fast enough."
4529,Gabrielle,"no, no, no. no! some of this stuff is mine. when i modeled. before i even met carlos! see this, costa boda, bought it when i landed my first cover. this, i spent eight hours on a rock in a bikini for that painting!"
8626,Gabrielle,"oh, no, sweetie. we have to go. they're family."
8627,Gabrielle,"as in ""moo goo gai pan"" chinese?"
8629,Gabrielle,"well, then you have no choice. bite the bullet and be bitch."
4533,Gabrielle,sooner is better than later!
8633,Gabrielle,"because all she ever does is put me down. if you'd pay attention, you'd see what i'm talking about."
6586,Gabrielle,zach? you're-- in your underwear.
4544,Gabrielle,"i'm running out of money. in a couple of weeks, i'm gonna be screwed."
4545,Gabrielle,don't you have a toilet to scrub?
4546,Gabrielle,"i'm just so angry with carlos. what was he thinking, exporting goods made from slave labor? why couldn't he have embezzled like other white collar criminals?"
4547,Gabrielle,but they won't release him on bail until they get the passport.
6594,Gabrielle,"i sort of threw myself a little birthday party.so if you don't mind,i'd like to get back to my dry heaving."
8647,Gabrielle,she's two blocks away. she'll be here any second.
8649,Gabrielle,"well, i didn't say i wasn't sedated."
6601,Gabrielle,"oh, you're--here."
4555,Gabrielle,"it, uh, it has an excellently crafted interior, peaceful quiet tuning, and ultrasonic rear parking assist. observe the remote activation feature."
6605,Gabrielle,but i am guilty. i don't remember how we ended up in bed together. maybe i led him on. i gotta be sensitive here. could you threaten him for me?
4558,Gabrielle,"just doing a little shopping, trying to get my mind off things."
6611,Gabrielle,what?
8664,Gabrielle,"uh-huh, and how long do you think that will last?"
8666,Gabrielle,"and if you don't mind, will you make sure juanita and celia do their chores, too?"
4570,Gabrielle,tell me what?
4571,Gabrielle,"uh, no! no, he neglected to tell me that."
8669,Gabrielle,"well, how did you get everything down so quickly?"
8672,Gabrielle,did she?
6625,Gabrielle,"well, hang in there as long as you can, 'cause i still need you."
6627,Gabrielle,"well, your driver's an idiot!"
8680,Gabrielle,she turned me in.
4585,Gabrielle,the man of the house?
8683,Gabrielle,"if you say, a grandchild, so help me, god!"
6640,Gabrielle,there was no accident. i know you told your chauffeur to ram my car.
4595,Gabrielle,i've gotta go.
8693,Gabrielle,"ah, get the camera, get the camera!"
4597,Gabrielle,i'm gonna go get the mail.
6647,Gabrielle,i can't believe you bought another bustier.
6648,Gabrielle,"in a slump, huh? how long's it been?"
4601,Gabrielle,"oh, okay."
4602,Gabrielle,"well, why, uh, why would he do that?"
6653,Gabrielle,"oh, stop it. you cannot be that hard up."
6654,Gabrielle,what the hell is this?
4608,Gabrielle,"uh, yeah, i'm, i'm sorry i haven't returned any of your calls."
6659,Gabrielle,not much longer. this is our last date.
4613,Gabrielle,"john, what opportunity is more important than college?"
4614,Gabrielle,"hi, what are you doing here?"
6661,Gabrielle,boring.
4616,Gabrielle,john caught me off guard. obviously i'm going to give back the ring.
6666,Gabrielle,look at this! there's lacroix and ungaro and vintage gaultier.
6668,Gabrielle,"oh, my god! she wears my size! it's amazing. nobody wears my size."
6669,Gabrielle,"and normally that would creep me out, except it means that i can borrow this one-of-a-kind undari for our date!"
6670,Gabrielle,so?
6675,Gabrielle,i feel ten pounds lighter. thank you.
6678,Gabrielle,hey.
6681,Gabrielle,"wow, good eye."
4634,Gabrielle,what did you say?
4635,Gabrielle,are you gonna clean that spot?
4636,Gabrielle,the one i told you to clean.
6682,Gabrielle,"so you're--well, first, let me just say you have amazing taste. if we had met in any other context, we would so get along."
4639,Gabrielle,fine. please.
6690,Gabrielle,why don't you just tell tom to pick another color?
4643,Gabrielle,mm.
4644,Gabrielle,"very impressive. so, where does the photographer want me for the shoot?"
6692,Gabrielle,guess so.
4647,Gabrielle,i am not a mattress sales person.
4648,Gabrielle,"honestly, yes. i am a model."
6696,Gabrielle,what happened? did you have some little mistress on the side?
6710,Gabrielle,not a peep. twenty-four hours.
6711,Gabrielle,i don't care! he can find two lousy minutes for me.
6715,Gabrielle,we had sex yesterday in his limo.
4669,Gabrielle,"because my husband is home quite a lot these days. if any bush needs trimming, he takes care of it."
6721,Gabrielle,thank you. you can go now. i don't want to take any more time out of your busy schedule.
4678,Gabrielle,what is that?
4685,Gabrielle,do you know how easy it would be for me to call my husband and tell him what you just tried to do?
4686,Gabrielle,"hello, justin."
6733,Gabrielle,exactly. going down. . .
6734,Gabrielle,i know. that's what makes it so exciting--the risk.
6735,Gabrielle,"it's an elevator, silly. it has an emergency stop button. i don't."
4691,Gabrielle,"oh, i can, and i will, you little worthless piece of crap."
4695,Gabrielle,"so, have you been acting on these feelings?"
4696,Gabrielle,wow.
4697,Gabrielle,"yeah, but why me? you're a good looking kid. why don't you test drive someone your own age?"
6745,Gabrielle,"look, victor--getting divorced really kicked my ass. i'm sorry. just--next time i get married, i've gotta be sure."
4699,Gabrielle,we're all in denial about something. but you're finally facing the truth and i think that's sort of brave.
6747,Gabrielle,hi! can i help you?
6751,Gabrielle,you! blackmailer!
4705,Gabrielle,"honey, i know. i love this place, too. it's just, i think it's time for us to face the music."
4710,Gabrielle,what's that?
4716,Gabrielle,and how much is this gonna cost?
6767,Gabrielle,standing by my man.
4721,Gabrielle,hope he's more innocent than you are.
6770,Gabrielle,"in fact, i was so overcome, that when we were trapped in the elevator, i seized the moment to express my joy."
4724,Gabrielle,i'm all in.
6772,Gabrielle,the only reason he didn't tell you was because he was protecting me.
4727,Gabrielle,i hate susan's. she has all these weird scented candles. her house reeks of apricot. hose.
4728,Gabrielle,"no, you don't understand. i don't want to go to anybody's house anymore. i'm tired of knocking on doors and making up excuses as to why we haven't fixed our plumbing."
4731,Gabrielle,"oh, i'm materialistic? when the johnson's bought their new 7-series, you were the one who went right in and traded in his car for something better."
4733,Gabrielle,ta-da!
6786,Gabrielle,"well, who is it?"
4740,Gabrielle,"well, uh, there's a simple explanation for that. i, um--"
4742,Gabrielle,i don't know. probably for the same reason you didn't tell me rex was one of maisy's clients.
6791,Gabrielle,why should we be embarrassed? we're not the ones who kept a corpse-icle in the basement.
6794,Gabrielle,would you guys excuse me?
4749,Gabrielle,who? who blinked?
4752,Gabrielle,but i thought you said they offered a plea bargain.
4755,Gabrielle,that was before i knew we could trade a couple months in prison to keep it!
6805,Gabrielle,so here's what's gonna happen-- we're not talking to edie anymore.
6807,Gabrielle,"i can't believe you're not furious at this. before she sank her fangs into carlos, she was dating your ex-husband and mike."
6809,Gabrielle,"don't even get me started about what i've done for you, okay? i'm still boycotting madame kim's day spa because of your botched bikini wax."
6811,Gabrielle,"no, no! not cold, frozen! i want icicles hanging from that bi*ch's ears!"
4766,Gabrielle,"hi, i'm gabrielle solis. you're nurse heissel?"
4769,Gabrielle,"yes, did she die quietly in her sleep?"
6821,Gabrielle,"stop it! carlos, put me down! how dare you maul me like that!"
6823,Gabrielle,i'll tell you what's ridiculous. you not having the guts to tell me you were dating edie.
4779,Gabrielle,a crypt? you bought your mother a crypt?
4781,Gabrielle,"go to hell, carlos!"
6833,Gabrielle,"oh, vern, i can't wait for you to meet him. he's everything i've ever wanted in a man--sensitive and kind--"
4786,Gabrielle,at least she's gonna have a roof over her head.
6834,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. that's the best part. he lets me be me. all right, i gotta get going."
4789,Gabrielle,you are so brave.
4790,Gabrielle,"well, that's a ridiculous thing to say. i'm not going anywhere."
6839,Gabrielle,thank you. your husband runs a hell of a campaign.
4795,Gabrielle,okay.
6848,Gabrielle,really? 'cause i just did.
4802,Gabrielle,"that's what i thought. the bastards. so, what if we won the lottery after carlos went to jail? could the government touch the money then? hypothetically. i see. and we could keep the house."
6853,Gabrielle,"i can do whatever i want! in fact, my first official act of business as mayoress of fairview--is to declare today free parking day!"
4806,Gabrielle,"most men would leave over something like that, and you're still here. i'm grateful. i know the sacrifice you're making."
6858,Gabrielle,"hi, honey. you look handsome in a tux."
4812,Gabrielle,"wait, just let me explain."
6860,Gabrielle,um--doesn't ring a bell.
4814,Gabrielle,if you didn't take the plea deal the government would have seized the settlement.
6863,Gabrielle,"constantly? aside from today, give me one example."
4816,Gabrielle,you had laotian convicts sewing casual wear for 2 cents an hour. don't you think you deserve a time out?
6864,Gabrielle,"i was just joking around, being me. i thought you liked that."
6865,Gabrielle,okay. i'm sorry i disappointed you. it won't happen again. i better get dressed. i don't want to be late to the victory party.
6872,Gabrielle,"i love that you're so into this wedding. most men would be like, ""yeah, yeah, tell me where the church is,"" but you're as obsessed as me. you're like a hot groom and a gay best friend all rolled into one."
4825,Gabrielle,"oh, but i'm not. i have flaws."
6873,Gabrielle,"oh, susan! julie told me about ian. i am so sorry. you must be devastated."
4828,Gabrielle,you have some nerve talking about trust when you have a secret bank account in the cayman islands.
4830,Gabrielle,"no, but i could. hey, isn't that why the prosecution didn't have a case against you? they couldn't find the profits you made. so if i were you, carlos, i wouldn't mention the words divorce, trust or post- nup ever again. you don't wanna piss me off."
4831,Gabrielle,"i know baby, it hurts to lose."
6879,Gabrielle,uh--my wedding?
4833,Gabrielle,"yeah, i'll do it."
6884,Gabrielle,i'm kind of in the middle of something.
6885,Gabrielle,only because i admire your taste. it's not theft. it's an homage.
4839,Gabrielle,"well, that was risky, i mean the feds are watching you right now."
4840,Gabrielle,"oh, no. stop, carlos, stop it. put me down. put me down. let me go. argh! stop, you're hurting me. carlos!"
6890,Gabrielle,"oh, i see what you're getting at. and you know what? you are right. you have been my de facto wedding planner, and you deserve to get paid. all right, what's the going rate? seven thousand? eight thousand?"
6892,Gabrielle,"well, you can't have it. and if you ask me, i am doing you a really big favor."
6893,Gabrielle,you are rushing into this marriage thing way too fast. why don't you give it some time and see if you and me work as a couple?
4848,Gabrielle,"tonight just, whatever you do-don't call me beautiful."
4851,Gabrielle,what do you think you are doing?
4860,Gabrielle,"one more thing. if you ever hurt me again, i will kill you."
4865,Gabrielle,dammit john! what is our new rule?
6913,Gabrielle,see--susan was really upset--
4869,Gabrielle,what's this?
4871,Gabrielle,you mow lawns!
4872,Gabrielle,i can't.
6919,Gabrielle,so what do you think?
6921,Gabrielle,"i do, and i know you've worked really hard to make our wedding perfect."
4876,Gabrielle,of course you may. if you will just give me a moment.
4880,Gabrielle,i bought shoes!
6928,Gabrielle,mike said no?
6929,Gabrielle,"no. no, it's okay. victor was kind of on the fence about it, too."
4887,Gabrielle,"hi, honey, look at my new shoes."
6935,Gabrielle,"god, i should have my head examined for even agreeing to this. who the hell cares about swiss jewelry anyway?"
6938,Gabrielle,i just paid a makeup artist five hundred bucks to do my face. do you really think i wanna march down the aisle looking like i just ate a popsicle?
6939,Gabrielle,"god, it is ten after, and bree is never late! where can she be? all right, that's it. after i finish ""tszujing"" my hair, tell the preacher it's showtime. i can't believe my wedding's already ruined, and it hasn't even started."
4892,Gabrielle,you know i forgot how generous men could be. i also forgot i have options. a whole bunch of them.
6940,Gabrielle,is that bree? she better not have come empty-handed!
6942,Gabrielle,chicken or fish?
4899,Gabrielle,i'm throwing my husband a going-away party.
6949,Gabrielle,reception starts at four.
6954,Gabrielle,"god, no. it's a complete snore. pasting a smile on my face while you say the same speech for the fiftieth time?"
4907,Gabrielle,i'm on the pill for god's sakes.
4909,Gabrielle,"well, not this one. 'cos i vomited in this one."
4910,Gabrielle,excuse me. this home pregnancy test-is it a good one?
4911,Gabrielle,"okay, do you have a rest room?"
6968,Gabrielle,"god, milton, the newspaper's not even here yet."
4922,Gabrielle,thanks.
4924,Gabrielle,yeah.
6972,Gabrielle,"so what are you saying, i should marry victor because you're a withholding father?"
6974,Gabrielle,he did?
6976,Gabrielle,so how do i look?
4931,Gabrielle,you can still see the glue marks!
6981,Gabrielle,"no, i'm still looking, but i'll let you know."
4939,Gabrielle,"yeah, but i wanted to talk to you in person. i have some potentially upsetting news."
6988,Gabrielle,i just got married.there are 200 people out there waiting for me to lead a conga line.
6991,Gabrielle,nope.
4944,Gabrielle,forget about it.
4945,Gabrielle,"yeah, that would have been helpful."
6992,Gabrielle,come on!
6995,Gabrielle,"finally!carlos,where the hell are you?"
4952,Gabrielle,john!
7001,Gabrielle,what's going on here?
4954,Gabrielle,don't get out.
7002,Gabrielle,i remember telling you i wasn't ready to sell the house yet.
7005,Gabrielle,"yeah,it's a great house."
7009,Gabrielle,do you think this is them?
4964,Gabrielle,"john! john, you,you can't."
4965,Gabrielle,oh my god!
7021,Gabrielle,"oh,far be it for me to speak ill of the future mrs.carlos solis."
4976,Gabrielle,excuse me?
7024,Gabrielle,"me,too."
7026,Gabrielle,"well,it's hard when you're so busy.maybe we should go away and just take a couple weeks a month.let's rediscover what it was that made us fall in love to begin with."
7031,Gabrielle,what the hell's the matter with you?
7032,Gabrielle,one second!
7034,Gabrielle,sorry. haven't seen him.
7035,Gabrielle,"uh, that's impossible, because he's there! there he is!"
4988,Gabrielle,away.
7037,Gabrielle,so?
4992,Gabrielle,is john here?
5000,Gabrielle,they're charging you with a hate crime?
7051,Gabrielle,"well, it just seemed like people had it pretty well covered."
5005,Gabrielle,then we won't comfort.
7055,Gabrielle,"oh, sorry. i stopped off to get you some magazines."
7056,Gabrielle,why don't i go check if there are some other ones?
7064,Gabrielle,you promise? 'cause if i did--then--god! i'm such a mess.
5019,Gabrielle,aaah. carlos!
7070,Gabrielle,don't answer it! it's susan. she's hosting another game night.
7072,Gabrielle,"susan, good news. we can come to the party after all. hey, you know who else you should invite?"
5025,Gabrielle,you brought luggage?
7073,Gabrielle,you leaving already?
5028,Gabrielle,"well, up until the point that you told my husband we were having an affair, i was quite fond of you. since then, not a fan!"
7076,Gabrielle,"okay, but if you did have a choice, would it be a hard one? i mean, it's not like you're in love with edie, is it?"
5031,Gabrielle,"so you're just not gonna talk to me, is that it? fine. i don't need to talk. okay. yes, i had a little affair. it wasn't the best thing to do, and i'm not proud of it. but it's not the worst thing that could have happened. nobody died. oh, don't be such a martyr, carlos. okay, it takes two people. how many times did you go off on your little business trips and leave me alone? see, so technically, you cheated, too. it's just your mistress was your work."
7080,Gabrielle,"yeah, you're lucky."
7082,Gabrielle,excuse me.
5036,Gabrielle,mm-hmm.
5037,Gabrielle,okay. we're in slightly different situations. but do you wanna get a cup of coffee and talk about it?
5038,Gabrielle,yeah. us girls have to stick together. we shouldn't let a stupid piece of paper ruin our life.
5039,Gabrielle,here it is in black and white. it's your kid. what? why aren't you smiling?
7086,Gabrielle,"oh, you gotta be kidding me!"
7092,Gabrielle,"oh, okay. i will pick adam."
5046,Gabrielle,"this is ridiculous, you know that?"
7094,Gabrielle,why?
7098,Gabrielle,that's not fair. she's like the charades ninja.
7100,Gabrielle,a blister. sounds like blister.
5054,Gabrielle,"sure, baby."
5055,Gabrielle,"carlos, what is this big emergency? i had to cancel my hair appointment with eduardo today. baby, what is it?"
7104,Gabrielle,okay.
5060,Gabrielle,seven thousand dollars?!
5062,Gabrielle,"oh, right. sorry."
7111,Gabrielle,"yeah, she asked about her father and then you smacked her. why'd you do that?"
5068,Gabrielle,"hi, are you rita?"
7116,Gabrielle,"victor, really, i don't think it's a big deal."
7117,Gabrielle,"when you saw me flirting, you smashed a glass. when victor heard i had an affair, he started crunching poll numbers. i need a man who cares enough to explode when he thinks he's gonna lose me. i don't just love you. i love the way you love me."
5072,Gabrielle,"um, hello! is there a problem?"
5079,Gabrielle,"not that it's any of my business, but it's your body. i wouldn't change anything unless i really wanted to."
7128,Gabrielle,"i'm saying men are visual. hell, i have a whole closet full of costumes. you need to give tom something to look at, something spicy, like--"
5082,Gabrielle,"carlos, what happened?"
7130,Gabrielle,what are you doing here?
5084,Gabrielle,"well, it's not my fault. she didn't want the money."
5085,Gabrielle,because it's for a boob job.
7136,Gabrielle,"okay, just don't panic, okay? we're gonna get the salve or ointment or whatever it is you put down there, and we're gonna be fine."
5091,Gabrielle,"me either, carlos. and if you expect me to go back and sweet talk her into getting the operation, i can't show up empty-handed."
7140,Gabrielle,"it's a blend of 36 essential oils, anise root and fennel. do you like it?"
5095,Gabrielle,ralph.
5099,Gabrielle,"oh, we're not doing this again."
5100,Gabrielle,"yeah, and husbands remember anniversaries, so i guess we're even."
5104,Gabrielle,"a woman does need to be loved, and since you didn't give it to me, i had to find it elsewhere."
5109,Gabrielle,uh-huh. brand-new. limited edition. a little anniversary present from my husband.
5114,Gabrielle,joan? you're calling her joan?
5117,Gabrielle,"how many times did you say it? how many times did you whisper in my ear, ""you're the only woman i'll ever love?"""
5118,Gabrielle,so were you lying to me? were you just trying to get me into bed?
7165,Gabrielle,"wow, look at you. congratulations."
5124,Gabrielle,"that's okay, sweetie. i'm good."
5127,Gabrielle,really?
5132,Gabrielle,"okay, look, all we need is twenty minutes."
5133,Gabrielle,you can't tell me no.you work for me. you will make it happen!
7191,Gabrielle,i shopped because i was bored and lonely--same reason i had an affair.
7197,Gabrielle,how long are we talking about?
5151,Gabrielle,"reservation! you're eating alone, remember? and i have a feeling it's not the first time!"
5152,Gabrielle,"you have some nerve, leaving that message on my machine."
5153,Gabrielle,i will tell you what is inappropriate. you making sweeping assumptions about the state of my marriage.
7199,Gabrielle,"yeah. i do. you're such a good guy, carlos. i really hate that about you."
7201,Gabrielle,"victor, it's me. i got your message. i've gotta be honest, i'm very annoyed that you're not coming home today like you promised. i told you i have something very important to tell you, and i wanted to do it in person, but now you're gonna be home for another week, and i can't wait. victor, i'm leaving you. i-- can't believe i'm ending my marriage on a hotel voice mail. this is very tacky. you're forcing me to be tacky, victor. i am not a tacky person. i am very, very classy. oh! hang on one second."
7205,Gabrielle,"well, if he really wanted me to stay, he would've come here himself, instead of siccing daddy on me."
5158,Gabrielle,i'd say i'm pregnant!
5162,Gabrielle,thank god you were in flats.
7211,Gabrielle,"and you're going to make sure he goes straight to the top, aren't you?"
7216,Gabrielle,"carlos, you're not working right now, and you know we'll never be happy if we're broke. we need this."
7218,Gabrielle,"how much is ""a little""?"
7220,Gabrielle,"mm. oh, wait, wait, wait. if this is tanaka money, then you had it when we were married?"
5174,Gabrielle,i wonder where david is. he should have been here by now.
5175,Gabrielle,he's quite the shark. you're gonna love him. he hasn't lost a case in six years. he argued in front of the state supreme court and he made our conjugal visit happen pretty damn fast.
7222,Gabrielle,"carlos, we were married. i was entitled to half of everything you embezzled."
7224,Gabrielle,"if i can't trust you, i don't think i can be with you."
5190,Gabrielle,what are you doing here?
5196,Gabrielle,you're a lawyer. you lie to juries all the time. can't you just make something up?
5198,Gabrielle,are you gonna help me or not?
7247,Gabrielle,what? who's gonna bring us umbrella drinks and salute us when we walk by?
7248,Gabrielle,so you're gonna drive this thing by yourself?
5201,Gabrielle,"oh for pete's sake, carlos. at least listen to the man."
7249,Gabrielle,"oh, that's right--those two boring hours i'll never get back."
5203,Gabrielle,"honey. i am so sorry. honestly, that guy's insane!"
5206,Gabrielle,where are we going?
5207,Gabrielle,are you sure?
7265,Gabrielle,"no, he's mad, but he wasn't dead."
5219,Gabrielle,"why don't you ask mike? he overheard everything, right?"
5221,Gabrielle,"what do you mean, i'm your first visitor? you've been here two days."
7269,Gabrielle,here. sit him here.
5223,Gabrielle,"dear david, who knew you could actually bleed? sincerely, your stunned co-workers."
5225,Gabrielle,"well, i'm not gonna let you starve to death. besides, you're gonna need your strength to get my husband out of jail."
7277,Gabrielle,we looked for six hours. he's gone.
7280,Gabrielle,"no one but you knows i was with victor. i'll say he went out alone. i told him i was leaving him, and he was depressed, suicidal even."
5237,Gabrielle,you think david and i planned this so we could sleep together?
5241,Gabrielle,"not an option. i'm catholic, hence the guilt."
7290,Gabrielle,i guess two days ago. why? what's wrong?
5244,Gabrielle,then it's nothing.
7292,Gabrielle,"oh, my god. i hope this isn't--last time i saw him, i told him i was leaving him."
5247,Gabrielle,"no. you just agreed to an affair. a cheap, illicit affair with the woman you love? carlos would never share me. he's looking at eight years in prison because the mere thought of it sent him into a violent rage. that is love. this is, this is just lust, mixed with posttraumatic stress. i will see you in court tomorrow at ten a.m. and don't be late, or else i'll have you disbarred for sexual harassment."
7308,Gabrielle,"oh, okay. so ask away."
7312,Gabrielle,huh?
7317,Gabrielle,"don't strain yourself, victor. there's plenty of time to talk later. what's important now is that you rest. just stay quiet and rest--quietly."
7318,Gabrielle,"really? i mean, what?"
7322,Gabrielle,but you're okay now. that's the important thing.
7328,Gabrielle,"you would think so, but no such luck. that vindictive have told victor everything."
5283,Gabrielle,"yeah, but that's the thing. they haven't changed. that's who they've always been. i've changed, and i honestly don't know how."
5285,Gabrielle,"all right, but hurry up, because i've been having to pee since hors d'oeuvres. are you free to go shopping tomorrow? i figured it's probably time i bought some clothes that actually fit."
7334,Gabrielle,they said victor's getting out of the hospital--tomorrow.
5287,Gabrielle,wait.
7336,Gabrielle,that's what i'm doing.
5289,Gabrielle,"hi, guys."
7337,Gabrielle,"carlos, if you are taking me somewhere where i don't need a boa, then i don't want to go. fine. you could be a little bit more sensitive. i had to say good-bye to my friends today."
7339,Gabrielle,"who cares?! thanks to her, i'm giving up my home, my friends, half my wardrobe. so do me a favor and never mention her name again unless it's followed by the phrase, ""that conniving skank."" ya think you can do that?"
7345,Gabrielle,it's worthless to you!
5301,Gabrielle,"oh, well, it was a little soon for that, don't you think? i mean, how can you name something the size of a walnut?"
5306,Gabrielle,"of course, i'm sad. it's a sad situation. now, let go of me."
7357,Gabrielle,"well, i thought just in case we-"
5312,Gabrielle,"inside what? you mean, you mean, in prison?"
5314,Gabrielle,"no! uh-uh! i can take care of myself, okay?"
5316,Gabrielle,"yes. yes, i do. i need my space. thank you."
7367,Gabrielle,go? you can't kick me out of my husband's funeral.
7374,Gabrielle,"no, no, no. he did. it's just--remember how windy it was that day?"
7376,Gabrielle,kinda.
5329,Gabrielle,"you know what? i am tired of you judging me. what is it gonna take to get rid of you, hmm? what's your last name?"
5330,Gabrielle,ramos. here is one thousand dollars. i won't tell carlos you didn't stick around. it'll be our little secret.
7379,Gabrielle,"okay. all right, you look very tired, so i'm just gonna go."
5334,Gabrielle,you're not gonna kill me?
7384,Gabrielle,"that sucked, too. so what happened to al?"
7388,Gabrielle,"well, look at me, monopolizing the widow. you go mingle. i'm gonna get you a cracker."
5350,Gabrielle,"uh, yeah, this is her. did, did something happen with carlos?"
7398,Gabrielle,why?
7399,Gabrielle,"oh, that. yeah, i was a little blue, but the good news is, i've bounced back."
5359,Gabrielle,wait! i'm not done with you yet.
7412,Gabrielle,"okay, he's gone. what's up?"
5366,Gabrielle,of course it did. everyone needs a strong male role model.
5370,Gabrielle,really? when did they start doing that?
7420,Gabrielle,i don't believe you.
7425,Gabrielle,skip straight to dessert?
7426,Gabrielle,"i'd say i'm one step ahead of you. i have already slipped into my pink lace teddy, and i'm wearing those whorey pumps that you love."
5379,Gabrielle,"well, sure it can. that's just a lie we tell poor people to keep 'em from rioting."
5382,Gabrielle,what?
5391,Gabrielle,i'm sorry. guess i am bad.
7454,Gabrielle,"look at all these handicapped spots. i mean, what a waste. take that guy selling oranges, put him in a vest, stick him under an umbrella, and bam! you got valet parking. i don't know why poor people refuse to better themselves."
5408,Gabrielle,you! what the hell did you do with my husband?
5409,Gabrielle,tell me where he is!
7458,Gabrielle,i'm not. my husband is. he's blind.
7460,Gabrielle,"oh, don't play victim with me. i have to walk in heels all day long. you get to sit in a chair and roll."
5415,Gabrielle,"we are supposed to be working on our marriage, carlos, but we can't do that as long as our lady of perpetual stick-up-her-butt has you worrying about thirsty orphans."
5420,Gabrielle,"yeah, and you?"
5424,Gabrielle,"sister mary, what a lovely surprise."
7472,Gabrielle,i just have to drop off a gift to my manicurist. why don't you listen to the radio?
5436,Gabrielle,"really? oh, don't write that down. i wasn't being specific. he's allergic to fish eggs."
5439,Gabrielle,"oh, honey. i'm so sorry. oh, maybe that stupid nun is right. maybe i am trying to stop you from becoming a better person. it's just that i love you the way you are, greedy, selfish, and insensitive. i'm just scared if you're not those things anymore, you're gonna wake up one day and realize i still am, and then you won't want me."
5444,Gabrielle,18?
5448,Gabrielle,"oh, here,let me take that."
7496,Gabrielle,"i get that, but surely she's trained to do other stuff, you know, like find his keys or turn off the radio or lick up his spills."
5453,Gabrielle,"you know,we were just having fun,entertaining the crowd."
5456,Gabrielle,you see?
5457,Gabrielle,i'm not worked up.
7504,Gabrielle,"carlos, remember what my fingers look like? just picture the middle one all by itself. besides, you're the one who married me for my looks."
5459,Gabrielle,"oh, come here,you sweet little thing."
5460,Gabrielle,"oh, god, um, tom?"
7505,Gabrielle,"do you have any idea how selfish you sound right now? just because you're blind, the world should suffer?"
5462,Gabrielle,i'm honored.
7507,Gabrielle,why don't you get a job?
5465,Gabrielle,"well, i saw that tom was overwhelmed,so i thought i'd give him a hand."
5466,Gabrielle,is there a problem?
5470,Gabrielle,i can't believe you.i have done nothing to deserve this kind of mistrust.
7520,Gabrielle,"shame, isn't it? i mean, i personally adored the little angel, but she and carlos just did not get along."
7522,Gabrielle,"oh, well, actually, we found one."
7523,Gabrielle,"well, that's it. it's not a dog. we got him a seeing-- eye-- monkey. he's amazing. not only can he call 9-1-1, he can toast a bagel. bye."
7524,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos, i'm afraid i have some bad news."
5477,Gabrielle,i had my little indiscretion.so you go have you.get it out of your system.i know you want to.
5478,Gabrielle,sure you do.knock yourself out.call up an old college flame.rent a call girl.fly to africa and nail that little nun you've been drooling over.i don't care!
5479,Gabrielle,"no, i'm pragmatic.because once you finish your fling,we'll be equals again.and then you won't be able to judge me.and we can go back to being a boring, average married couple.oh, just do me a favor. don't bring back any diseases."
5481,Gabrielle,all done.
5482,Gabrielle,"yes, it is.we worked it out."
7531,Gabrielle,"yeah, still no sign of roxy. but don't worry. i'm on the case."
7534,Gabrielle,"thanks for the biscuits, edie."
7548,Gabrielle,"oh, right. i keep forgetting you're useless. i'm gonna see if ellie has one."
5502,Gabrielle,"well,um,thank you,ralph,for bringing this to my attention."
7550,Gabrielle,"hey, uh--oh, i'm sorry. i didn't know you were--entertaining. hi, i'm gaby solis."
7551,Gabrielle,"oh, you know what? it can wait. i'll see you in the morning."
5510,Gabrielle,"not necessarily.see,here's what i'm thinking--scott's a coward,so you could totally put the scare into him.all you gotta do is go and rough him up,and he'll take my pictures off the web site like that."
7559,Gabrielle,"exactly. you people are theatrical, and i need someone i can count on to give a decent performance."
7560,Gabrielle,"well, no offense. i just think bob has a better shot at pulling it off. he's a little more--"
5513,Gabrielle,"good morning,luis,ralph."
5514,Gabrielle,"good morning,honey."
7561,Gabrielle,"well, i really don't care who does it. just get it done. and--don't wear that."
5517,Gabrielle,"aw,you're so mean."
7566,Gabrielle,"ellie, what are you doing?"
7568,Gabrielle,here's the thing. i thought you were a hooker. so i had lee proposition you so i could catch you in the act. but guess what? you passed the test. everybody inside for margaritas.
7569,Gabrielle,"ellie, wait. i made a mistake. can we please talk about this?"
5522,Gabrielle,you promised!
7582,Gabrielle,"oh, hey, guys! you were up there a while. can i see it?"
7583,Gabrielle,"oh, on his-- got it. does it hurt?"
7585,Gabrielle,you're spoiling him.
5542,Gabrielle,"you are threatening me with an annulment?that conniving little bitch put you up to this, didn't she?didn't she?"
7590,Gabrielle,"okay, look, maybe i was wrong. maybe it was flour. maybe she's a pastry chef."
5544,Gabrielle,"oh, um, i'm looking for father crowley.do you know where he is?"
7593,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!"
5547,Gabrielle,because she's ruining my marriage.
5548,Gabrielle,"yes!at first it started with the love letters while he was in prison,and the next thing i know,they're spending day and night together--sneaking off to private bible study,and one-on-one spiritual consultation."
5553,Gabrielle,you're kidding me. why?
7602,Gabrielle,what's this?
5556,Gabrielle,i heard you were being transferred so i came to say good-bye.
5558,Gabrielle,"me? oh, i'm just a humble sinner.you're the one with all the power around here--all the-- annulment mojo."
7608,Gabrielle,"well, how long is that gonna take?"
5562,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!oh, my god! hold on!"
7617,Gabrielle,"okay, okay. we're going."
5570,Gabrielle,"no, carlos, i am sorry.i am not gonna be blackmailed into giving birth.you have to choose.and i wish you would do it so i can move on with my life."
7619,Gabrielle,hey! lunch is almost ready. i'm making your favorite. i take it you're still mad at me.
7622,Gabrielle,"of course i do. carlos solis is the love of my life. but sometimes you get bored, and a big, greasy, disgusting handyman really hits the spot."
7623,Gabrielle,he's so precious.
7630,Gabrielle,"yeah, the second that bitch gets home, i'm gonna let her have it. boy, you trust someone, and they just betray you. it sucks, you know?"
7634,Gabrielle,"about how you snitched on me to carlos? no, thanks. i'm all caught up on that."
5589,Gabrielle,you know what i mean?it's such a repressive regime.we forget how good we have it.
5590,Gabrielle,"don't you think xiao-mei would like it better here in america?i mean,where she could learn about freedom and democracy and stuff?"
7637,Gabrielle,"oh, ellie, i'm so sorry. i had no idea."
7640,Gabrielle,the cops are coming. go.
5595,Gabrielle,"oh, this isn't about me.this is about our great nation.and i have no intention of sexually satisfying a man who isn't willing to stand up for and help spread the ideals and values of the united states of america."
5598,Gabrielle,it's okay.glad you like it.you can brush my hair.
7647,Gabrielle,hello?
5600,Gabrielle,oh!
7651,Gabrielle,crap. ya had to play the daddy card.
5609,Gabrielle,"what?he was worth,like,$6 million."
5613,Gabrielle,whoa!
5614,Gabrielle,"okay,mom,put these away!"
5615,Gabrielle,"okay,you can think she's charming.but don't forget for one second that she is a monster."
7662,Gabrielle,"okay, we really need to get caller i.d."
7665,Gabrielle,"oh, honey, can you carry the house keys? they don't fit in my purse."
5619,Gabrielle,"fine.what about surrogacy?i mean,i know it's pricey,but at least the baby would look like us,and i wouldn't get stretch marks.it's a win-win."
7667,Gabrielle,wait! she's gonna steal our money!
5624,Gabrielle,"look,i don't care if she shot triplets out of her ass.it's not gonna happen.can you believe this?"
5625,Gabrielle,"carlos,you are not seriously considering this."
7672,Gabrielle,excuse me. susan!
7673,Gabrielle,what's going on?
7674,Gabrielle,she was always telling us how terrified she was.
7675,Gabrielle,"okay, my friends are gone. i'm ready to fix you dinner. what the hell are you doing?!"
7680,Gabrielle,she's only 4 1/2.
7684,Gabrielle,"""we""?"
5638,Gabrielle,"because if i did,then she, we--because--there was a chance she wouldn't have believed me,and--and that would've hurt a lot worse than anything he ever did to me."
7686,Gabrielle,thank you.
5642,Gabrielle,what was that for?
7695,Gabrielle,"i know, but so much? you could've gone back for a second piece."
5652,Gabrielle,so how does this work?do we flip through a catalog or something?
7700,Gabrielle,"well, come on, then!"
5656,Gabrielle,"oh,here's one we took on vacation."
7706,Gabrielle,"hey, i'm protecting her. she doesn't know the truth yet. women only have five seconds to be young and beautiful, and then it's gone. and then before you know it, we're old and fat and married and wondering where our beauty went."
7708,Gabrielle,"edie, this is not a ""we're sorry"" party. this is a ""we forgive you"" party."
7710,Gabrielle,i can see that. i can see a lot of things--things that can never be unseen.
5670,Gabrielle,"okay,first of all,it was statutory,and it happened so long ago."
7720,Gabrielle,what? she's disinviting me?
5674,Gabrielle,"look,carlos--it doesn't matter what we've done in our past.being a parent means rising to the occasion,and that's exactly what we're gonna do when we bring our baby home."
7726,Gabrielle,"bree! shouldn't you be in the kitchen? don't move, honey. the press is taking your photo."
5684,Gabrielle,"no, plain i can handle.carlos,since that woman has walked into our house,the clocks have stopped working."
5686,Gabrielle,"fine. just know that in a couple of days,when that thing is born,and you're gonna have to cuddle and snuggle up with something with that face on it, don't come crying to me."
5687,Gabrielle,sorry.
5688,Gabrielle,"these can't be our only choices, mr. beale.i mean, come on.each girl is uglier than the next."
7734,Gabrielle,right.
7735,Gabrielle,"that was the matre d', wasn't it?"
7741,Gabrielle,what? i was just trying to salvage what's left of our social life. now just let it go and start thinking about where we're gonna move.
7743,Gabrielle,"first our money, then my figure, now the last shreds of our social standing."
5698,Gabrielle,"yes, it's all natural,from her straight teeth to her ""c"" cup.and i know she's athletic because she's a pole dancer,so i really hope that my little girl inherits that as well.no, the athletic gene,not the pole dancing gene."
5701,Gabrielle,what is it?
5702,Gabrielle,why?
7750,Gabrielle,"god, isn't there any way we can keep it? i mean, this car's the last thing i have that tells the world, ""i'm better than you."""
7751,Gabrielle,here. take good care of her.
5706,Gabrielle,"because i've read the constitution,and it does not protect ugly people."
5707,Gabrielle,"no. no,no,no.i want that woman's baby,and i'm gonna get it."
7755,Gabrielle,"i don't know, andrew. i mean--we like it. we don't love it."
7756,Gabrielle,"yeah, about that price--you're gonna have to drop it. i mean, look at all these dents."
5712,Gabrielle,you like jewelry?
5713,Gabrielle,"well,here."
7763,Gabrielle,damn you.
5718,Gabrielle,i always hated math.
5723,Gabrielle,"well,why wouldn't she?it's exactly what she asked for,the most expensive one in the store.you know,i'm telling you,carlos.i'm getting really tired of kissing her ass."
7771,Gabrielle,"damn it, andrew. you tell bree to call me by the end of the day."
5728,Gabrielle,how much are you gonna give him?
7782,Gabrielle,"well, i'm sorry. i was too busy trying to explain to her why m.j. doesn't wear a dress like all the other little girls."
7785,Gabrielle,you attacked my child and then me. why should i even listen to you?
5740,Gabrielle,"well,i'm siding with bree."
5741,Gabrielle,because i remember being 17.and i would've done a hell of a lot more than punch myself in the eye to get a car.
5742,Gabrielle,what?
7790,Gabrielle,"well, if it's any consolation, carlos is a hands-on, full-time dad, and i still feel like i'm not getting the job done, like--i'm not preparing them enough."
5744,Gabrielle,"exactly. we're not ready!you know,this is a total inconvenience."
7797,Gabrielle,i want my 300 bucks.
5751,Gabrielle,he's gonna light himself on fire with coffee liqueur?
7802,Gabrielle,"luckily, i'm insured. oh, wait. our policy lapsed. hope you've got good coverage."
5763,Gabrielle,do you really wanna leave this beautiful little girl with that white trash freak show?
5767,Gabrielle,"oh,honey,please.do i look like a masochist?first thing tomorrow,i'm hiring a nanny and a night nurse."
5768,Gabrielle,"my husband,the comedian."
7816,Gabrielle,"aw. what's it like, carlos?"
7819,Gabrielle,"oh, my god, you were right. blind sex is incredible."
7820,Gabrielle,"no, i think we're done."
5773,Gabrielle,"and that's what put her in an early grave!well,that and the hit-and-run thing."
5774,Gabrielle,"no,i got up twice already.it's your turn."
7821,Gabrielle,honey! what are you doing home? i thought you were at bethany's.
7823,Gabrielle,we were wrestling. wrestling.
5777,Gabrielle,"fine,fine,fine!"
7828,Gabrielle,"carlos, if she was standing there any longer than five minutes, there was nothing natural about what she saw."
7837,Gabrielle,so--do you think there's any chance juanita could rejoin your playdate?
7839,Gabrielle,"oh, we totally agree. kids are forced to grow up way too fast these days."
5793,Gabrielle,"ooh,i'll have a drink.anything with an umbrella."
5798,Gabrielle,"lily?lily,mommy's coming!"
7846,Gabrielle,damn.
5803,Gabrielle,"exactly! like,""he wouldn't have been with me if he was gettin' it at home."""
7851,Gabrielle,this isn't a miracle. this is a disaster. my husband's blind. neither one of us have jobs. my husband's blind.
5809,Gabrielle,"well, it's a good thing he's here.we can take him to the lawyer's office,and you can sign over full custody to us. okay."
5812,Gabrielle,"what the hell are you doing here, frank?"
5815,Gabrielle,"okay, no, no!wait, what about a car?or college?tuition's a killer these days.i could help you out."
7864,Gabrielle,i got news for you. we just converted to judaism. problem solved. mazel tov!
7867,Gabrielle,i know. it's crazy. you had a vasectomy. it's impossible.
5820,Gabrielle,"so my point is,do the right thing,and no one gets hurt."
5823,Gabrielle,"oh, yes."
5824,Gabrielle,yes?
7873,Gabrielle,why the hell not?
7874,Gabrielle,"katherine, great dress. you're gonna turn some heads with that one. i hope you're enjoying this party, carlos, because you're not gonna live to see another one."
5827,Gabrielle,you?you don't even wanna be a mother!
7877,Gabrielle,"whoo-hoo! halle-damn-lujah, i got my period! oh, was she surprised?"
7879,Gabrielle,we can't handle another kid. we're living hand to mouth as it is.
7886,Gabrielle,"oh, that's carlos for you. mr. magic hands. he hits the ol' sweet spot every time."
5845,Gabrielle,"all right.look,my friends wanna take some of this to go,so pack it up,and we're a little low on coffee."
5846,Gabrielle,"uh,xiao-mei?we spoke to homeland security,and we have good news!"
7895,Gabrielle,"hey, clay. is mr. banks around?"
7902,Gabrielle,no! he's giving her orgasms?!
5859,Gabrielle,"are you kidding?no one cares about virginity in this country.it went out of style in the '50s,and trust me,honey,it ain't making a comeback.seriously,no one cares."
7908,Gabrielle,"i know what you've been up to, and shame on you."
5862,Gabrielle,"honey,why aren't you dressed yet?we have to be at the fertility clinic in 40 minutes!"
7911,Gabrielle,maybe a little too much.
5867,Gabrielle,yeah. i wouldn't just slam her for no reason.
5871,Gabrielle,"sweetie,i need some more cream."
5878,Gabrielle,oh!
5882,Gabrielle,why in the hell?
7947,Gabrielle,"virginia! what, uh, are you doing here?"
5900,Gabrielle,"oh, it's perfume,not toxic gas."
5902,Gabrielle,"from the second xiao-mei got pregnant,you have found a million and one ways to tell me that that baby is more important to you than me."
7950,Gabrielle,"uh, look, i'm sorry, but i don't want you driving off with my daughter."
5905,Gabrielle,i'm sorry?
5906,Gabrielle,"oh, okay, well, i'll just call the country club and cancel our lessons."
5911,Gabrielle,okay.
7960,Gabrielle,"family?! lady, you had carlos fired."
7964,Gabrielle,i don't care.
7969,Gabrielle,virginia. what are you doing here?
5922,Gabrielle,"oh! no, no. i was-- just changing out of my sweaty clothes.i didn't realize moving was such great cardio"
7972,Gabrielle,"well, i guess we're all going to the same place. i'll just see my friends there."
5929,Gabrielle,"i know.it's just you said, ""kill,"" not ""dead."" and i'd have to do be pretty angry to kill someone, so i guess my question is, do i have a reason to be angry at mr. solis?"
7980,Gabrielle,"sorry about the tip, but i just lost $50 million."
7983,Gabrielle,crap!
7985,Gabrielle,"eh, it was worth a shot."
5938,Gabrielle,"oh, no.no, i mean, i guess it was, well, weird when you started naming the american presidents in order."
5939,Gabrielle,"no, no, you were good.just, if it comes up in school, paul revere was never president."
5941,Gabrielle,"the only reason i did this was because i was angry at carlos.now, thanks to you, i'm not angry anymore."
7990,Gabrielle,oh!
7991,Gabrielle,oh.
5945,Gabrielle,completely.
7993,Gabrielle,"but i'm not most women. i was an international fashion model, and that's how carlos remembers me."
5948,Gabrielle,"so, wait, you're gonna get down on one knee, pop the question, and while you're down there, dig in his pocket?"
5950,Gabrielle,are you done with my husband?
8004,Gabrielle,you got a lot of nerve. part of the reason i'm on this diet is because carrying you 2 brats for 18 months made mommy fat! and you with the head-- you ruined me! so this is how it's gonna go down. you're going to eat this with mommy and you're gonna like it. got it? thank you.
5958,Gabrielle,not to sleep with a woman carrying on a child.
8010,Gabrielle,"also, the surgery is very expensive. we need time to figure out how we're gonna pay for it."
5964,Gabrielle,"would you rather go live with mr. solis in a dingy one bedroom apartment with no air conditioning and no cable?huh?no, i didn't think so."
8013,Gabrielle,"well, i have turned over a new leaf. i'm sorry about the timing, carlos, but it is what it is."
8015,Gabrielle,yeah. it's my hamstring. i've just been working out.
8016,Gabrielle,"no, no, you rest. you're gonna have surgery in a couple days."
5969,Gabrielle,"if you don't tell us, we're not coming."
5976,Gabrielle,hey!quick question.have you by any chance seen xiao mei?
8026,Gabrielle,"carlos, that's the doctor. i'm right here."
5979,Gabrielle,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!hey, what happened to that famous chinese hospitality?"
8031,Gabrielle,"uh, carlos, i think it's time to put your eyedrops in. why don't you go do that?"
5986,Gabrielle,i have had to wait hand and foot on your mistress.i mean imagine if the day after you found out about john rowland you had to make his lunch and rub his feet!
5989,Gabrielle,here you go.
8041,Gabrielle,"carlos, what's wrong?"
6000,Gabrielle,you know what the doctor said. you should see his cholesterol. this man bleeds bacon grease.
6003,Gabrielle,"well, why don't you try putting on a pair of pants? that should kill a couple of hours."
6004,Gabrielle,or the stairs. what do you want?
8057,Gabrielle,what? we can't afford this.
8062,Gabrielle,"yeah, pretty. what? you're gonna be late for work."
8064,Gabrielle,you quit?! why?
6020,Gabrielle,you want a clear signal? how's this?
6021,Gabrielle,"hi there. i just wanted to say you're doing a great job, tad. that's such a masculine name."
8068,Gabrielle,"oh, right! how are you?"
6025,Gabrielle,"yes, i've been watching you make your new friend and it's disgusting!"
8078,Gabrielle,"fantastic! well, you didn't sign a contract or anything, did you? 'cause maybe we can get them into a bidding war."
8086,Gabrielle,was it lou?
8089,Gabrielle,no. i think i should stay and clean this up. it's a--huge mess.
8090,Gabrielle,hahaha--
6045,Gabrielle,"carlos, i am so sorry about the--"
6047,Gabrielle,how could this have happened? what kind of half-ass fertility clinic are you running?
6048,Gabrielle,"excuse me, you screw up our lives and the best you can do is, 'that's the way the cookie crumbles?' and who is this guy? why is he writing down everything i say?"
6049,Gabrielle,you know what else would have been wise? sticking the right baby in the right belly!
6050,Gabrielle,well.
6051,Gabrielle,i feel so--
8095,Gabrielle,"wow. impressive. huh, carlos?"
8098,Gabrielle,"you hear that, carlos? five-star hotels."
8099,Gabrielle,"um, honey, bradley's right. you could take this job and do your charity work in your free time."
8101,Gabrielle,"hang on. before you do that, let me lay it out for you. either you let your family continue to sacrifice so you can feel good about yourself, or you grow up and make real money and look after us like we've been looking after you for the past five years."
8103,Gabrielle,"emphasis on the word ""laid."""
8107,Gabrielle,i can't believe you're leaving.
8110,Gabrielle,because daddy has a new job that's gonna make us lots of money.
6063,Gabrielle,i know.i wouldn't trade with you for anything.
6069,Gabrielle,"so i guess, uh, there's no chance of getting you over to the house to pick the dead leaves off my ficus."
6070,Gabrielle,"actually, we're getting a divorce."
6071,Gabrielle,really? then why are you smiling?
6072,Gabrielle,gabrielle. i think that's the first time you've ever called me that.
6073,Gabrielle,i intend to.
8118,Gabrielle,"i am gonna scrub that smug look right off your face. oh, my back!"
6075,Gabrielle,"ooh, i like rich john!"
8122,Gabrielle,"now that you've gone back to work, they won't listen to me. they know you're not in the next room, ready to drop the hammer. help me!"
6079,Gabrielle,how could you do this to me?i would never have let you seduce me if i knew you were getting married.
6080,Gabrielle,you knew about carlos! my cheating was upfront and honest.
8130,Gabrielle,yeah. just my kids. they really know how push my buttons.
8132,Gabrielle,yeah. it's very effective.
8134,Gabrielle,"it's out of my hands, girls. word got out that you were disobeying, and they sent reggie over."
8135,Gabrielle,"well, i know how much you love him, but--it was your daddy."
8137,Gabrielle,"hey, you're the one who told me to get creative."
6090,Gabrielle,"we got ties here, people! designer ties, two for a dollar! ooh, do you like those barbells? make me an offer. i'm feeling generous. here's the customer i've been waiting for."
6096,Gabrielle,"carlos, what are you doing here? i mean, besides lowering my property value."
6097,Gabrielle,oh?
8145,Gabrielle,carlos!
6100,Gabrielle,who is it? it is sharla banning?
8151,Gabrielle,you're right. it's not.
6105,Gabrielle,why?
8155,Gabrielle,"well, it was before my husband moved me here to east nowhere. seriously, i don't know how you girls do it."
8158,Gabrielle,"church. oh, you're serious."
6112,Gabrielle,"to answer your question, no, we are not getting back together."
8161,Gabrielle,okay. thank you.
6119,Gabrielle,"oh. it was a swat. ted, does this hurt?"
8167,Gabrielle,"well, thanks for the advice. you wanna add that your bill?"
6122,Gabrielle,"wow, you are crazy."
8174,Gabrielle,i'll go get it.
6128,Gabrielle,"god, carlos! strawberries and champagne? did you really think you're gonna seduce me?"
6133,Gabrielle,"she promised to stand by him, and once you make that commitment you have to see it through."
6138,Gabrielle,"well, i think it's more than that. i think you really hate me."
6139,Gabrielle,"oh, i think it is. you know, introducing your spouse to someone you're about to have sex with? there's only one reason to do that--pure hatred."
8188,Gabrielle,"oh, i don't get it! i'm only a few pounds away from my runway weight."
10241,Lynette,"no, it's not a deal.i need a solemn vow that you will never throw that in my face ever again.because if you do,you will unleash demons that you do not wanna meet."
10242,Lynette,and what i really need from you--is to be forgiven.
12290,Lynette,"he's gonna hang out and watch us, you know, be a family."
12291,Lynette,"so i like what you said about making the family stronger, but as i told you, kayla's the one you wanna focus on."
10249,Lynette,go.
12298,Lynette,"oh, go ahead. shoot."
10254,Lynette,"just for one second, okay?just for one second.hey,i never thought i'd have to ask you this,but are you about to eat a doughnut out of the toilet?"
12303,Lynette,"oh, god. is this gonna be one of those therapy things where she hits me with a foam bat?"
10257,Lynette,you are so not allowed to complain to me.
12309,Lynette,i can't believe she was blackmailing you.
12310,Lynette,yeah. this woman is outta control.
10263,Lynette,"no. no, you're not gonna make him pay.you are gonna stop this now."
12311,Lynette,no. what are we gonna do?
12312,Lynette,"she did, so you can kiss that little blackmail scheme good-bye."
10267,Lynette,"aw, what's wrong, ed?you afraid a phi kap's gonna get beaten by a girl?come on, big man--it's just a little bet."
10271,Lynette,you okay?
12321,Lynette,"well, we've done enough damage for one day. let's go home."
10276,Lynette,"oh,that's okay. um--would you excuse me just for a second? i have, uh, a thing."
10277,Lynette,thanks.follow me.you're part of the thing.
12325,Lynette,are you-- threatening me?
12327,Lynette,my gosh! that is so sweet. thank you so much.
10281,Lynette,just the twins and penny?
12329,Lynette,so--no kayla?
10284,Lynette,okay. sorry.
12332,Lynette,"well, kayla loves waffles, and since she and i have been having some problems lately, i wanted to do something nice for her. oh, you tell kayla her breakfast is ready."
10286,Lynette,"have they signed the contract?'cause if not,somebody should call bednark and tell them to adjust the language."
10291,Lynette,"honey,i was so worried about you."
10292,Lynette,thank you.thank you so much.
12346,Lynette,"i guess that's why they didn't name you ""einstein""."
10299,Lynette,come on out.
12347,Lynette,"yeah. which says ""kick my ass"" less--""may"" or ""nerd""?"
10303,Lynette,i'm sorry. i'm so sorry.
12351,Lynette,oh! tom.
10305,Lynette,yeah.it was cleared up.it was just a little confusion.
12354,Lynette,"no, you'll figure something out. i have to go back to my cell."
10311,Lynette,"hi.you,um,you recovered from all of yesterday's excitement?"
10312,Lynette,"yeah,although i-i still can't figure out how my boys managed to sneak past you."
10313,Lynette,"they're like lightning.it's just,penny--"
12362,Lynette,hey. you know what we haven't done in a really long time? made 250 mini pizzas in one afternoon.
10316,Lynette,"oh,gosh,you got drunk,and you passed out."
10317,Lynette,really?is that why you passed out on your front lawn yesterday morning?
10324,Lynette,"no,i'm pretty sure the lowell group used eskimos in a deodorant commercial they had last month. remember?"
12373,Lynette,it's your ice sculpture.
12374,Lynette,i don't care what you said. we have to fix this! or do you want to tell bree that you torpedoed her ceremony?
12378,Lynette,where the hell are you going with this?
12379,Lynette,could you give us a second?
12380,Lynette,answer him.
12381,Lynette,"good. good, then--get out there and get committed, you crazy kids."
12385,Lynette,"again? i am so sorry, officer. we have talked to porter till we're blue in the face. it's like he's determined to go back to juvenile hall."
12386,Lynette,preston?
10342,Lynette,stop right there.this is meat loaf. your presentation was business.
10343,Lynette,"okay.so if i apologize for upsetting you at work,can we get past it and enjoy our meal?"
12390,Lynette,unbelievable. you guys are grounded for two weeks.

12413,Lynette,have you been drinking?
12414,Lynette,"sorry to have barged in, and thanks for letting me get that off my chest."
12419,Lynette,"no! you don't want two cool kids pulling up to homecoming in a mom car, especially with that big dent they put in it last month."
12423,Lynette,"actually, it's 32."
10376,Lynette,i didn't know you had a child.
10378,Lynette,"how can they not?for working parents like you and me, it's a necessity.so is the pot getting sweeter?"
12426,Lynette,"i know you love them, but sometimes you find them so cool and entertaining, you forget to parent them."
10380,Lynette,"yeah?well, that's fantastic!"
10381,Lynette,i have absolutely no idea.let's go hammer out the details.
10382,Lynette,i love it. i just love it.let get a copy to ed.
10383,Lynette,"oh,shoot,i gotta take this one.i'm sorry. it's tom."
12429,Lynette,excuse me?
12431,Lynette,so i assume you know about what happened to jimmy conrado.
12435,Lynette,"hey, parker. can i ask you something, just between us? does porter hang out with jimmy conrado?"
10389,Lynette,"okay,so who's gonna tell her?"
10390,Lynette,"no! no,uh,please,don't make me do it.why don't you have jerry tell her?"
10393,Lynette,"oh,wow,he's such a big boy."
10394,Lynette,"hey,you know,breast-feeding on this schedule must be a real hassle.i remember i used to express my milk into a bottle.made my life so much easier."
12446,Lynette,"oh, really?"

10403,Lynette,"already?i mean,i'm sorry."
10404,Lynette,"oh,sweetie--i know that we wanna keep them young as long as we can,but kids grow up.they just do."
10407,Lynette,"oh,i don't wanna be mad anymore.and i'm so happy to hear all that,and i am so proud of you."
12469,Lynette,"i know. you get winded just climbing out of the tub. you're never gonna climb a mountain. you know what else you're never gonna do? learn german, make your own beer or--have 8 minute abs."
10427,Lynette,"um--actually,yeah.one of the perks.even so,it's a little out of the price range of a high school student."
12476,Lynette,"okay, i need to dial you in to some gigs you already have, which are running a restaurant, being a husband and a father. and i thought you were the one who said you wanted to spend more time with your family."
10430,Lynette,"my kids don't wander.they scurry,like rats."
12478,Lynette,those of us with hearing beg to differ.
12479,Lynette,"oh, come on, tom. this is not your--"
12481,Lynette,you could break your dad's guitar and--
12484,Lynette,"now i'm sure it was an accident, tom. please don't yell at her."
10438,Lynette,welcome to parenthood.come on.
10439,Lynette,there's a gift receipt taped to the bottom of the box.
12486,Lynette,hey.
12488,Lynette,you bought tom a new bass?
12490,Lynette,"well, sorry. but maybe you could go skateboarding with orson."
12491,Lynette,and what makes you think you know what my husband needs?
10446,Lynette,"oh,right.that happened with dinosaurs."
10451,Lynette,"well--actually,he's kinda right. he's got the concept down."
10452,Lynette,daddy will be home from his business trip in a few days.why don't you wait for him?
10453,Lynette,okay.
12503,Lynette,"well, maybe i'm the lucky one. this could be a perfect way for me to stick my toe back in the business. nothing big, maybe just pick up some freelance work."
10464,Lynette,"oh-- that was me.he was asking about the birds and the bees, and i fudged a few of the details."
12513,Lynette,"look, bree--i think i know a little more about marketing than you do. when i was in it, i owned this town. i had every big account. hell, i was even named businesswoman of the year."
10468,Lynette,"i talked to mrs. mccluskey,and for god's sakes,parker,you can't ask people things like that."
10471,Lynette,because it's not an appropriate subject.
10472,Lynette,because it's not.
10473,Lynette,"ugh!because it's dirty and wrong, and i'll wash your mouth out with soap! that's why."
10474,Lynette,well-- it turns out we really needed one.you can go and play.
12520,Lynette,your company? you have a company?
12524,Lynette,mm-hmm. oh.
10477,Lynette,that would explain all our working hours.
10478,Lynette,"hey, great.let's go before he changes his mind."
12527,Lynette,yeah.
12529,Lynette,you know what this tastes like? more.
12530,Lynette,stu? stu is doing bree's ad campaign? i rode in his hatchback once. it smelled like mu shu. i gotta warn her.
10488,Lynette,"well, we do the best we can given the circumstances."
12538,Lynette,"you know, when i had a high-powered career, and you were just a housewife, i never looked down on you."
12541,Lynette,"so--give me some guidance. do i grovel, send flowers, or--"
10494,Lynette,"hey, any luckwith that i.m.ing thing?"
10495,Lynette,"okay, that's good.then what?"
10496,Lynette,you blocked?
10501,Lynette,"no,ed,i'm not doing this for you!"
10509,Lynette,what?!
10510,Lynette,you can't make my husband your scapegoat.i won't let you.
10518,Lynette,"okay,well--remember i was helping ed spark up his love life?"
12566,Lynette,"what, do machine guns come out of the headlights?"
10520,Lynette,i know.
12567,Lynette,"where have you been? so help me, if mccluskey gets there before us, i will brain you."
10522,Lynette,"you're under contract.ed can't fire you unless he has just cause.so until this blows over,you have to be a model employee.show up on time,no more 3-martini lunches,and above all,have ready all your presentations."
10525,Lynette,what? yesterday you were up in arms.now you're ready to cave?
10530,Lynette,"okay,go get him."
12583,Lynette,i think--it's great.
10539,Lynette,"so,um--what happened?you said you were just gonna go in there and talk to him."
12591,Lynette,okay. drive safely.
10544,Lynette,"in all the years we have been married,i have never seen you lead with your fists."
10546,Lynette,we're aware of that.
12596,Lynette,no.
10550,Lynette,"no! except that i know you've been to atlantic city three times in the last month without telling me.ed found the receipts when he did the office audit.other than that,no, nothing's wrong."
12598,Lynette,yeah?
12600,Lynette,"oh, my god."
10554,Lynette,no! absolutely not.
10555,Lynette,"no! okay, a little bit.i'm sorry, i'm sorry.ed found receipts for flowers and theater tickets.i mean, by the way, did you--"
12606,Lynette,okay.
12609,Lynette,okay. hurry back.
10562,Lynette,hello?
10564,Lynette,yeah?you're quite a gambler.where's jerry?
12612,Lynette,"i always knew things could change between us, tom, but no matter what, the one thing i always thought i'd get is your respect."
10567,Lynette,"well, just, you know, say hello.it's been a long time."
12619,Lynette,who?
10574,Lynette,yeah?
10575,Lynette,"he's not coming, sweetheart.but you could show me."
10576,Lynette,--playing russian roulette with my ovaries and--
12632,Lynette,"i know everything, okay?"
10586,Lynette,"no, dad is not gonna be there, but he--he is gonna come and see you guys all the time.we are still gonna be a family.it's just-- we won't be living in the same place anymore.so--is there any questions you wanna ask me?"
12634,Lynette,"hey, breakfast's on the table. porter, this whole hating me thing that you've got going on right now--believe it or not, i get where you're coming from."
12635,Lynette,"but one day, you are gonna meet someone more--appropriate. someone who want the same things that you do out of life. then you are gonna know what real love is. and when you do, i hope you will finally see where i am coming from."
10589,Lynette,"well, we already swam.now it's time to pack.hey, hey, hey!what's going on?"
12642,Lynette,are you really pregnant?
10595,Lynette,i saw you with that woman.
10597,Lynette,then why are you going to atlantic city every other weekend to visit her?
12648,Lynette,"oh, my god! oh, my god!"
12651,Lynette,"yes, i did, porter. i had to talk to anne. i didn't know that her husband was there, and he overheard us and--the doctors say she's gonna be fine. porter, wh-- where are you going? damn it!"
12654,Lynette,thanks.
10610,Lynette,"neither are stretch marks, but what are you gonna do?"
12659,Lynette,"aah! porter, i told you to go home. what are you doing here?"
10613,Lynette,"you promised me we'd stop at four.remember?you wanted four kids, i wanted one, and somehow we compromised on four.can we please stop now?"
12662,Lynette,no.
10615,Lynette,okay.
12667,Lynette,"maybe he didn't. but ten minutes later, that nightclub was on fire."
10620,Lynette,"i must have been crazy, agreeing to this."
10621,Lynette,"i don't..well, here goes."
12669,Lynette,"yes, that time, the building was empty."
10623,Lynette,probably.
10624,Lynette,business?
12670,Lynette,i'm telling you i heard him threaten warren schilling. i don't know what happened next.
10626,Lynette,how could he abandon her if he didn't even know she existed?
12673,Lynette,i hear you're getting discharged today. are you going back home?
12674,Lynette,i'm sure you heard about the nightclub burning down.
10629,Lynette,"well, it's that or the kids' college fund.we'll write nora one big check, and in return, she'll sign away her claim for the back child support. if we're lucky, she'll take the bird in the hand."
10630,Lynette,"well, we need to show her we're serious. $30,000?"
12677,Lynette,"well, then you can face statutory rape charges without the money. your call."
12678,Lynette,i'll pick you up tonight. i'll give you a ride to the bus station. you can count it then.
10638,Lynette,really?
10639,Lynette,my sincerest apologies.
12689,Lynette,"oh, you are such a gentleman. sit your ass down."
10643,Lynette,"like, five minutes from here arden drive?"
12697,Lynette,"you are up for manslaughter, and you're worried about being embarrassed?"
12699,Lynette,why would you do that?
12700,Lynette,did anyone see you do this?
10653,Lynette,"how about, you're in the frame, bitch, move."
12703,Lynette,"if edie reports this gun missing, you don't have to be the sharpest cop on the force to figure out where to start looking, and that's the last thing we need right now."
12707,Lynette,"oh, thank god. how much?"
10661,Lynette,wow!
12718,Lynette,hey.
12723,Lynette,that's because he's preston.
12729,Lynette,"okay, look--you know how you're always saying i know what to do in a crisis?"
12734,Lynette,that's why we've been trying to get you to postpone the hearing date until we could find him.
10689,Lynette,"i know you are tom, and i know love her. why else do you think i'm willing to put up with all this for six months?why do you think i'm willing to say to my college roommates, yes, that's my husband's love child and her mother in our christmas picture.because i am your wife!you always come first with me.do i still come first with you?"
10690,Lynette,thank you for that.
10694,Lynette,"he says he innocent. she believes him. if we say we don't, she'll just end up hating us."
12743,Lynette,oh.
10696,Lynette,ah.
12745,Lynette,you know where he is!
12747,Lynette,fine. you know what you're going to do with it? you are going to call your brother and tell him to come home.
12750,Lynette,"i can handle warren schilling. but if porter doesn't show up for court, we're gonna lose our restaurant!"
12753,Lynette,"you see that bar? warren schilling goes there every night. all right, come on! tonight, when he leaves--i'm gonna do what i have to, to make sure my family is safe. so--i need you to get out now. you can't be in the car when this happens."
12754,Lynette,"like i said, it's in my dna that could be him. get out. get out! get out!"
10711,Lynette,i did. we need to find her another boyfriend and weddings are crawling with single men.
10713,Lynette,"oh, there are other urologists in the world. go back to that other guy."
12761,Lynette,"and if porter doesn't show up for court, we're gonna lose our restaurant!"
10715,Lynette,"get a grip? i am hanging on for dear life, here. you are the one that brought this little problem into our family and the only thing i should be hearing from you is 'how can i help?' i am also putting steve hansen at her table so you might want to start shopping around for a new golf buddy."
10716,Lynette,get a grip.
12762,Lynette,what?
12767,Lynette,what are you talking about?
10720,Lynette,"hey, look at you. miss popular. so, you having a good time over there?"
10722,Lynette,um. how about steve? you know what? i hear his family has money.
10723,Lynette,"hey, carlos. you should come over to our table. that's where all the hotties are."
12770,Lynette,"tom, i know where porter is. he's hiding at my mother's."
12771,Lynette,i'll take care of it. thank you.
12772,Lynette,call bob. tell him we can make the hearing tomorrow.
12774,Lynette,"parker, i'm gonna be back in an hour. mr. fisherman, thank you so much."
10732,Lynette,"no, seriously, gaby, i am so tired of pretending to smile."
12781,Lynette,of course i did.
10734,Lynette,"no, no, you'll be fine."
10741,Lynette,"no, no, no, no!"
8694,Lynette,"hey, it's lynette. i know you're down about this mike thing, but you got to come to poker. it'll be worth it. i got dirt on maisy gibbons."
10742,Lynette,no!
12789,Lynette,"no, i didn't. from the moment glen died, you were out of control. it's true you lost all that money in vegas. you started drinking again. and how many times did i go to your condo, only to find you asleep on the sofa with a cigarette in your mouth? no, i won't apologize for bringing you here. i did it because i love you."
12790,Lynette,it's not a very pleasant experience.
8698,Lynette,"no, you are going to behave today. i am not going to be humiliated in front of the entire neighborhood. and, just so you know how serious i am--"
10752,Lynette,"ah, how far is the impound lot because, you know, i would just drive you over there--"
8710,Lynette,i said you could go by the pool. do you have your swimsuits on??
10759,Lynette,"no, well, it wasn't funny. if you wanna kill yourself, fine, but don't take me with you."
10760,Lynette,"that is not what i'm saying. but if you did, i'd find a way to carry on."
12808,Lynette,"i wish i could say the same for my uterus. oh, yeah. i ruined the brunch."
8714,Lynette,"get out. or i will get in this pool and just grab you, get out! get over here. get over here. get back or i'll kill you."
8715,Lynette,"that's right, get over here. go, go, go, ugh. move it. out. get out."
12810,Lynette,"hey, sweetie. what's up?"
8717,Lynette,"tom, this is my 5th message and you still haven't called me back. well, you must be having a lot of fun on your business trip. i can only imagine. well, guess what, the kids and i wanna have some fun too, so unless you call me back by noon, we are getting on a plane and joining you."
12819,Lynette,"well, i was hoping you could cut back on your hours at work."
10775,Lynette,why would he be afraid?
10776,Lynette,how's your back?
8729,Lynette,yeah! it's been a little rough!
8730,Lynette,"oh my god, oh my, oh!"
12829,Lynette,"i'm sorry. is there any way we could finish this conversation tomorrow? l-l-later in the day works better for me, too. well, thank you very much. bye."
8734,Lynette,"oh wait, i gotta tell you, i was having trouble with swelling, so the doctor took me off the pill, so you're just gonna have to put on a condom."
12830,Lynette,i got the job.
12832,Lynette,"oh, mr. swenson, i can't tell you how excited i am. maybe you could schedule a staff meeting so i could hit the ground running on monday. no, no. no, it can't be friday, because, remember, we agreed that we would start next week? so again, thank you so much for this opportunity."
10786,Lynette,"well, daddy should have checked with mommy, so she could have a chance to tell him why he's wrong. hey, you're playing."
10790,Lynette,hey.
12839,Lynette,who knew he had so many friends?
8745,Lynette,"that would be fun. paul, we have proof your wife killed herself over some deep dark secret. another ??"
12841,Lynette,a witness? what are they talking about?
12845,Lynette,"sadly, we can no longer afford tom's midlife crisis. okay, here's the deal. we're-- sort of broke."
12846,Lynette,between porter's legal fees and that ghost town that we call a restaurant--
10802,Lynette,the kid's got an arm like a 13-year-old.
8755,Lynette,i accept your apology.
10804,Lynette,"hey, give the kid what he wants."
12854,Lynette,and so do you. and i'm gonna feel real crappy when you unwrap your lavender bath beads.
8759,Lynette,"yeah, the boys were acting up in the car, i couldn't get them to sit down."
8765,Lynette,"boys, i am not gonna tell you again, sit. i mean it, i am serious. you guys are gonna be in so much trouble if you don't sit back in those seats."
12861,Lynette,tom and i are so grateful for your investment that we want to do something special for you.
12862,Lynette,"we'd like to shut scavo's down for the night and throw a party in your honor. just family and friends. we'd toast your success and have a night of fun, just like old times. what do you say?"
12865,Lynette,i don't know what to say.
8770,Lynette,"i know, i was just trying to scare them into behaving. did you see where they went?"
10818,Lynette,yeah.
8772,Lynette,"i-i-i didn't abandon them, i came back!"
8773,Lynette,"well, my kids aren't normal, and now i don't have time for this, lady, so. boys! get out here."
10819,Lynette,"well, excuse me for not wanting my son to be a quitter."
8775,Lynette,"well, bring 'em, we're leaving."
10824,Lynette,huh?
10825,Lynette,this is all my fault. why punish parker?
10826,Lynette,"just one more game.he'll suck, the other kids will taunt him, and he'll wanna quit again.see, everybody wins."
8779,Lynette,"boys, you're gonna need to put on your-"
12868,Lynette,so?
8781,Lynette,just give me a second-5 minutes.
10834,Lynette,you get to chase your dream while i get to spend the rest of my life in advertising.
8787,Lynette,"i'm not being flip, i'm just pointing out a reality."
10835,Lynette,"maybe i'd like to write a book or, you know, start my own magazine. and then i think, no, i can't. i have a family to support, and i am okay with that--"
12882,Lynette,"whoa. talk about luck. when i offered to throw you this little thank-you party, i never imagined that it would turn into an opportunity for me to learn from the great bree hodge."
8790,Lynette,"yeah, it'll be fun. bree's cooking, everyone's coming."
10838,Lynette,how the hell did he do that?
10839,Lynette,"oh, he's never gonna quit now!"
10841,Lynette,"whatever you wanna do,i'm in your corner."
10842,Lynette,"wow, you're pretty good at that."
12883,Lynette,"no, you're the one who's never gonna let me forget it."
8798,Lynette,yeah.
12896,Lynette,"it's not a slump. in this economy, people aren't eating out as much. between that and porter's legal bills and paying bree back, we are about a week away from going bankrupt."
10851,Lynette,hmm.
8805,Lynette,"the boys will be hungry at 5:30, so put the fish sticks in the toaster oven at 5 o' clock-"
10855,Lynette,"i know, but i said that i would support him and help him follow his dream."
12903,Lynette,not yet.
12907,Lynette,but having the kids work there?
8813,Lynette,"no, we got perp-walked down main street usa."
10867,Lynette,"no. no, no, no, i am totally on board."
8820,Lynette,are we happy?
10870,Lynette,"well, think about it. you're gonna do all these fun parties. people will start talking-- ""hey, this is great food. this guy should open a restaurant."" ""yeah, yeah, i'd eat there,"" and then wham! five short years later, you have a built-in customer base."
8823,Lynette,you look-ridiculous in that thing.
8824,Lynette,maybe.
10873,Lynette,i'm trying to.i am trying to. but are you aware that 90% of restaurants tank in their first year?
10874,Lynette,"tom, i--"
10875,Lynette,okay.
10876,Lynette,"oh, dear god."
12918,Lynette,"oh, thanks. you didn't give them enough change."
12920,Lynette,what's going on?
12922,Lynette,"finally. oh, great. they're kids. 1 ate of spaghetti and 15 baskets of free bread."
10883,Lynette,"okay.okay, here's what we're going to do. you said there were multiple offers, so we can sublease. now let's get the hell out of here."
12931,Lynette,fine. congratulations. you just stole a pizza oven.
10885,Lynette,fine.
8841,Lynette,"thank you. that's the nicest way you could have said that. you know, the truth is, when they're not making me want to pull my hair out they're really, really sweet. i'm afraid that if i change the bad stuff, i'm going to change the good stuff."
12938,Lynette,you--ah. hey. i think you better stop with the bargain hunting unless you want your face to match the oven and the dishwasher.
8843,Lynette,"yeah, i know."
10892,Lynette,i suckered mccluskey into taking the kids for a while so i could kick back and catch up with my old friend margarita. you care to join us?
8847,Lynette,troubled?
12944,Lynette,"oh, my god. that would be great. and if he gets the job, you can actually cash the check."
10898,Lynette,i'll take a wild guess. the man never opened a pizza place.
10899,Lynette,bite on this.
8853,Lynette,we'll talk about that later. right now i need you to take some medicine.
12952,Lynette,susan!
12953,Lynette,"mwah. ohh. you couldn't shave? come on, tom. you need to look nice. bree's going to a lot of trouble for this dinner."
8858,Lynette,"here, you."
8859,Lynette,"guys, this isn't-"
10906,Lynette,"go, ida!"
10910,Lynette,"yeah, well, any wife can support a husband who never takes risks, and i don't want that kind of husband, and i'll be damned if i'm gonna be that kind of wife. so you open your pizza place, and we will find a way to make it work."
12959,Lynette,"well, tom was just running a very successful restaurant, and he just sold it at a handsome profit. so he's waiting for the right opportunity. you might have to do a little selling here, bruce."
10913,Lynette,i'm sorry. i didn't quite catch that. why don't you just come on over here and say that to me again?
8867,Lynette,we need you to recommend porter and preston. we can't even get an interview.
10915,Lynette,"everything's all right, so you can just go back into your room and play."
8870,Lynette,"yes, but by the time they realise their mistake we'll be in."
10918,Lynette,"and you, i'm gonna see you on saturday, right? don't forget your swimsuit."
12966,Lynette,i know. so what kind of starting salary are we talking about?
10921,Lynette,okay. see you later.
12969,Lynette,"well, you're not acting like you want it very much, mister--""uh, i don't know. are there any more potatoes?"""
8875,Lynette,yes. completely identical. you can't tell them apart. they're like bookends.
12971,Lynette,your job? the one you're magically gonna get by sulking and acting like a brat? you had a shot. you blew it.
8878,Lynette,"sorry, tom, mr lenz was trying to say something. mr lenz?"
8879,Lynette,thank you so much.
8880,Lynette,what is a must-meet list?
10927,Lynette,"whoa, what fresh hell is this?"
10933,Lynette,you bet i would. kayla will be much better off without crazy in her life.
10935,Lynette,"i don't, but i didn't want the first four, and they're starting to grow on me."
10936,Lynette,i'll look as soon as i get back from the store.
8892,Lynette,"well,did you bat your eyes? you know, it doesn't work if you don't bat your eyes."
12988,Lynette,"well, that doesn't make any difference. right, lee?"
12990,Lynette,congratulations. you're now dating a lesbian.
8896,Lynette,there has been flirting.
8897,Lynette,"but to be fair, that is part of your charm."
10944,Lynette,"sweetie, it's mommy. i need to talk to daddy."
8899,Lynette,apparently we're in competition with one other family. a generous donation will ensure our kids beat them out.
8900,Lynette,fifteen thousand.
10946,Lynette,"put daddy on, and i'll buy you a real robot."
12998,Lynette,enough with the shrugging. come on.
8904,Lynette,they won't make it to their later years if i have to spend all day with them.
8905,Lynette,why don't we just put them back in me and cook them until they're civilised?
8906,Lynette,"boys,could you stop?"
8907,Lynette,"oh,thank you."
8908,Lynette,"yeah. it gave me some good ideas. well, one, anyway."
10954,Lynette,you are gonna get through this just fine. there is a parking lot full of ambulances out there. you gotta let us take her out of here!
13000,Lynette,"okay, that's it. four shrug. i'm out. thanks for your help."
13008,Lynette,"nobody cares how old you are, tom."
13009,Lynette,hey.
13011,Lynette,oh. that job. i don't know what to say.
10969,Lynette,"hey.hey!oh, my gosh! you didn't have to do this!hi!"
10970,Lynette,"yeah, um, listen, about that--the kids don't know what happened."
8924,Lynette,"sure, they get to play oak trees. i'm the one who has to deal with all the drama behind the scenes."
13022,Lynette,"oh, that is so thoughtful of you. you're such a good friend."
10975,Lynette,"well, let's see how well you do on a morphine drip."
10983,Lynette,yeah.
10992,Lynette,"okay, listen, kids. i am sorry. we shouldn't have lied, but sometimes parents wanna protect the kids from scary things."
10994,Lynette,"no, no, afraid not."
10996,Lynette,she won't.
10997,Lynette,"well, because she's--"
13044,Lynette,"okay, yes, carlos and i spoke briefly, but i thought he blew me off."
10999,Lynette,"okay, i should be back at around six o'clock. they can have one snack. try and push apples, but if they threaten violence, i have an emergency candy bar under the sink."
8953,Lynette,how do you cram it all in?
8956,Lynette,i stopped after page 50.
8957,Lynette,did he say anything about his mother's suicide?
13052,Lynette,and say what?
8959,Lynette,so somebody found out mary alice's secret--
11008,Lynette,"hey, art."
8961,Lynette,great! you wanna run it by me?
11009,Lynette,"good, uh, listen, as if saving my life wasn't enough, i have a little favor to ask."
13055,Lynette,mm. i'll take her. kinda looks like cat litter.
8965,Lynette,tom
11015,Lynette,"it's okay.you can trust him,really.art is the one who saved me at the supermarket.he's sort of a superhero."
13064,Lynette,why? chemo's not until 5.
8971,Lynette,"actually, i'm getting ready for a dinner party tomorrow night. six people."
8972,Lynette,"big fun. say, you wouldn't have any of your kids add medication that you could spare just to get me over the hump?"
11019,Lynette,"hey, don't touch anything. i'm just gonna write a note, and then we'll go."
11021,Lynette,"parker, come on, we're gonna get out of here."
13072,Lynette,and what do you want from me?
11027,Lynette,"okay, he wasn't there. he doesn't know. look, he had a wall full of pictures of half-naked boys in swimsuits."
13077,Lynette,how do you think?
8987,Lynette,"no, really, hear me out. put a big spotless scrub ad between a woman and her cashmere sweater, and i guarantee you'll get her attention."
11035,Lynette,what are the blake kids doing all the way over here? pam needs to keep a closer eye on them.
13084,Lynette,you bet.
8991,Lynette,"well, maybe you need better ideas. i'm sorry-i'm sorry, i didn't mean that."
11039,Lynette,oh! good.
13088,Lynette,strong.
11044,Lynette,"well, i don't."
11045,Lynette,"great, great."
8998,Lynette,"nothing, i'm tired."
8999,Lynette,"i'm fine, really--what's going on outside?"
9000,Lynette,how am i supposed to pull off a formal dinner with no warning?
11049,Lynette,"i'm sorry, guys, i just--i guess i was really tired. where's your brother?"
13095,Lynette,"wait. there wouldn't happen to be actual gardeners in this club, would they?"
13096,Lynette,that'd be great.
11052,Lynette,hello? open up! open the door!
13097,Lynette,"yeah, 'cause he hasn't suffered enough."
13103,Lynette,but i am exhausted.
9010,Lynette,"oh, yeah. sorry."
11061,Lynette,that proves nothing. he knew i was on to him. he had to dump it someplace.
11062,Lynette,what if parker had been in there?
13111,Lynette,hours? it was two minutes. it's not like i'm lighting candles and putting on barry white.
13112,Lynette,fine. i should've just had sex. i'd be asleep by now.
11067,Lynette,he's a bachelor who lives with his invalid sister.
13115,Lynette,"no, i'm fine. i-i want to go."
9022,Lynette,"you're never going to be a sailor, what do you care? okay everybody, let's just take a break!"
11070,Lynette,"hey, rita, i gotta go."
11072,Lynette,i'm not sad. he shouldn't be around kids. i saw those pictures.
9025,Lynette,"boys, would you please, please, stop it. really, really, mommy's got a headache. okay? just, uh--"
13118,Lynette,uh-huh. which means you saw me--
9030,Lynette,"no, i'm not. i can't do it. i'm so tired of feeling like a failure. it's so humiliating."
9031,Lynette,that's what's so humiliating. other moms don't need help. other moms make it look so easy. all i do is complain.
13129,Lynette,tom?
11082,Lynette,"oh, i'm not taking sides."
13133,Lynette,"yeah. but just to be on the safe side, if i fall in my tub again, let me die there."
9039,Lynette,then what?
13136,Lynette,tom and i are reading this book that suggests couples make a pact to have sex every night for a month.
13137,Lynette,"we've been having some problems, so the theory is it creates intimacy and brings you closer."
11098,Lynette,"oh! of course! i feel just terrible. i mean, if you knew, if you could just know how sorry i am."
11101,Lynette,where are you going?
11103,Lynette,"well, the police did arrest mike. i mean, i know you think he's innocent, but surely you can understand why bree's feelings have changed."
11106,Lynette,"well, nicer than that, or she's gonna get all your toys, too."
13155,Lynette,so--carlos--where were we?
11108,Lynette,"hi, kayla! we missed you! we're so glad you're here. okay, boys."
13156,Lynette,what are you doing?
13159,Lynette,mm.
11115,Lynette,okay.
11119,Lynette,"oh, sweetie, we don't watch tv during dinner."
9072,Lynette,"i will give you a 20% bump on what she is paying you, plus overtime."
9078,Lynette,you better finish those brussel sprouts. and don't think i can't see them hidden under your macaroni.
13176,Lynette,"i thought you wanted to do this, to take a break and stay home."
11130,Lynette,"well, i didn't know what else to do. i'm trying to win over a little girl who clearly doesn't want a new mother."
13182,Lynette,and what'd you say?
9088,Lynette,"it's just, i don't know this woman, i mean, not really. so she has a degree in sociology. well, big deal, who doesn't? my boys are a lot to handle. what if she's not up to it?"
13189,Lynette,really?
11145,Lynette,okay. you go--
11146,Lynette,"oh, dear god."
9099,Lynette,"yeah, well, i'm just warming up. then bruno, the big bad turtle took harvey up on a cliff and threw him over, and he proclaimed,"" ""we'll see if you can fly, fly or die, fly or die!"
11148,Lynette,you have good timing. i just got all the kids to sleep.
13196,Lynette,"uh, we live in a community property state, so half that face is mine."
9103,Lynette,they're with the new nanny.
9106,Lynette,oh! sorry.
11154,Lynette,"yes. i love the font, the color, everything. i am so jazzed to see the restaurant."
9108,Lynette,huh.
11160,Lynette,why not?
9114,Lynette,you sly dog.
9115,Lynette,"bye, guys!"
9116,Lynette,"i don't know how she did it, but edie managed to make this all about her."
13213,Lynette,why are you being so stubborn?
13215,Lynette,"tom, if you're unsatisfied with your looks, someday you're gonna be unsatisfied with mine."
11168,Lynette,oh-- my-- god.
11169,Lynette,"andrew, hi! i thought you weren't starting until the opening."
13218,Lynette,"you're gonna get a job, and it'll be because they're impressed by your experience, not your wrinkle-free face."
9125,Lynette,tom--come on.
11173,Lynette,touch.
11174,Lynette,"i think it's fantastic. it's really coming together. ooh, i love the bar."
11175,Lynette,what?
9129,Lynette,oh.
11178,Lynette,"well,then why isn't he dealing with it instead of shopping for napkins?we could lose our shirts in this dump!"
13222,Lynette,"oh? well, good luck paying for it, because if you so much as apply for a passport, we're cuttin' you off."
13226,Lynette,"i know you're discouraged, but-- letting our son make a huge mistake is not gonna help anything."
9133,Lynette,"so, claire, when did this incident occur?"
13230,Lynette,"hey, hey, how was the campus tour?"
11184,Lynette,"please, i've been at this for hours. just hear me out."
13234,Lynette,"good. good. i knew if you saw the campus, you'd have a change of heart."
11187,Lynette,did you live in las vegas?
13236,Lynette,wh-what's that now?
11189,Lynette,"no, thanks. two's my limit."
11190,Lynette,"look, i understand your concerns about the license. your neighbors had them, too. but they signed the waiver once i explained to them that this is a family restaurant. no late nights, no loud music."
9143,Lynette,"aww--you kiss as though that would end this conversation, and it so won't."
11192,Lynette,"harry,my husband quit his job to start this restaurant,and if we can't sell liquor,we can't make a profit."
9150,Lynette,parker's getting sniffily.
13246,Lynette,coming. i'm coming.
9153,Lynette,"here, blow. good, all right. come on, it's going to be fun. follow me."
13251,Lynette,"i love you, too, baby. here you go."
13254,Lynette,"hey, babe. how'd the test go?"
9160,Lynette,"you see this gum? if you promise to be quiet while i am downstairs playing cards, it's all yours. deal?"
11209,Lynette,"and tonight i'm gonna slap on some sex perfume and you're gonna get naked, and then we're gonna see who the man is."
11211,Lynette,"oh, deciding what to wear on my first day back to work. do i look fat in this?"
13259,Lynette,what's going on?
13260,Lynette,really? you passed the test?
11215,Lynette,"oh. well, that's good to know. when you think about it, me going back to work is not that big a deal. we're only losing a little time together in the afternoon."
9168,Lynette,that's so sweet.
11216,Lynette,"oh,honey--jeez.do you really mean that,or are you manipulating mommy into feeling incredibly guilty?"
11220,Lynette,"well, you know, hire someone else."
9173,Lynette,"and i'm also cranky. you know how you get when you haven't taken a nap? well, mommies are the same way. we need our down time, and if we don't get it -"
9174,Lynette,"- sorry, we end saying and doing things which we don't normally do."
11222,Lynette,"well, whatever it is gonna take."
13272,Lynette,how long have you been sniffing those markers? of course with a baby.
9182,Lynette,oh.
11231,Lynette,"cereal? i didn't have any--oh, i know what that is. i get nauseous from the pain, so that's just a little residual vomit."
13284,Lynette,"all right, hold your water."
13285,Lynette,i'm not the one who forgot my mitt.
13290,Lynette,oh really? more steak?
13296,Lynette,"honey, i'm hating you a little right now."
11249,Lynette,it's cornmeal.that's the secret.
11250,Lynette,hi--ed.
9203,Lynette,don't take it personally. he's scared to climb down.
9205,Lynette,are you okay?
9206,Lynette,sexism.
11256,Lynette,here's my application.
11257,Lynette,he did. i told him i wasn't interested.
13306,Lynette,for someone with your coloring.
9211,Lynette,"uh, it's nice to meet you."
11261,Lynette,dinner is in an hour. you know the rules. and so do you.
11262,Lynette,"you fell for the face. what are you, a rookie?"
13311,Lynette,i hardly think the kids are going to suffer without a clump of fur on their heads.
9226,Lynette,"i just, i expected a bigger reaction. i've been sitting here with knots in my stomach."
11274,Lynette,"no, i fired him, and you are gonna stay fired."
11275,Lynette,"well, i'm sorry, but you totally blindsided me out there."
11279,Lynette,"well, kinda."
11285,Lynette,"yes, sir. okay, that's enough."
11286,Lynette,this could be the best thing that's ever happened to our family.
9240,Lynette,i love you!
9242,Lynette,"really? i love it. well, this is the nicest present you boys had ever given me, and you know what? i'm gonna put it out on the front porch so the whole neighborhood can enjoy it"
11290,Lynette,"if they're salty, we'll sell more beer. see? you're a genius."
9244,Lynette,"no, no, no. my sons made that for me for valentine's day."
9255,Lynette,"well, too bad for you. okay, start with a big em, little c. good."
9256,Lynette,hey.
9257,Lynette,"hey, what do you think you are doing? get out of here."
11305,Lynette,i switched the seven and the one.
11306,Lynette,now this place opens in five hours. how long will it take to fix this?
11308,Lynette,"okay, that brings us to 22. javi, rico, we got chairs to find. move it."
11311,Lynette,"okay, little mix-up with the new chairs."
11313,Lynette,i'm happy for you.
9269,Lynette,"no. i can deal with the humiliation of going around the neighborhood returning everything the boys stole, but please don't make me apologize to that woman."
9273,Lynette,you know whoever came up with the motto love thy neighbor clearly lived nowhere near karen mccluskey.
9274,Lynette,"really, i, i recall no such motto."
11322,Lynette,"honestly, i just don't feel up to going out this year."
9278,Lynette,um--
11329,Lynette,"well, you didn't have to plan anything, but you did, even though we had an agreement. you like ties? you're getting a tie."
9282,Lynette,i don't know.
9283,Lynette,i don't know.
11335,Lynette,who could that be? here.
11339,Lynette,"oh, don't you dare."
9292,Lynette,i'm not saying to beg. you just have to step up from time to time. you have to see your opportunity and take it. nobody respects a shrinking violet.
9294,Lynette,hey! don't look so glum. you're gonna get a hit.
9297,Lynette,"oh, my god."
9298,Lynette,"hi. so, what's the word on tim?"
11346,Lynette,thanks. are you sure it's the right--
11347,Lynette,"listen--i was thinking, wouldn't it be better if the staff wore a uniform, and you and i wore regular clothes? that way it's like, ""hi. welcome to scavo's. we're the scavos."""
11349,Lynette,since always. you know my closet. surely you've noticed i don't own anything orange.
9302,Lynette,you're going after tim doogan's promotion?
11352,Lynette,as well he should be.
11353,Lynette,"hey, guys."
11355,Lynette,"good point, good point. but right now we're talking about these ugly-ass uniforms."
9312,Lynette,"yep, it's all about the window."
11362,Lynette,except we're never home. we live here. our marriage happens here.
11371,Lynette,"well, once he decides to stop hiding, i can ask him. you know what? i'm tired of waiting. i'm gonna go down there and i'm gonna talk to him. see you guys later."
9324,Lynette,"look, you're gonna make vice president one of these days."
9327,Lynette,"hey, guys. what's going on?"
9332,Lynette,hey. see you later.
9333,Lynette,"aah, aah, aah."
11382,Lynette,"hey, andrew. ah, thanks. he's gonna be okay. no. no, absolutely not. we will open tonight as usual. hey, it's gonna be fine, andrew. i will take care of it. it's my job now. okay. see you soon. bye."
11384,Lynette,"i have to get to the restaurant early. is there any you could come over and get the kids off to school? yeah, they are ready to go. so what do you say? oh, great! thanks. i owe you big-time. okay, bye."
11385,Lynette,"all right, i am heading out of here. wish me luck."
9340,Lynette,"because she saw porter scratching his head at school. they all did, and now word's getting around."
9341,Lynette,"well, it is for the rich bee-eye-tee-see-atch's--"
11389,Lynette,"oh, for god sake, tom! i'm gonna be late for this interview. i really should go."
11392,Lynette,mrs. mccluskey. perfect timing.
11395,Lynette,"at some point, tom's gonna ask you to look for this. you will not find it."
9349,Lynette,the stakes were raised.
11399,Lynette,"well, that's what we pay you, and you seem happy enough."
9355,Lynette,huh?
9357,Lynette,"she's devastated about the breakup, and she hasn't left the house in days."
11410,Lynette,"yeah, his name is rick coletti, and he was a sous-chef at cucina."
11413,Lynette,clean for almost a year.
9366,Lynette,really?
9367,Lynette,"i guess. still, i can't help but feel a little guilty. after all, my kids started an entire lice outbreak."
9372,Lynette,"no, i don't. you're going to have to give me a name."
11430,Lynette,"i have been doing everything i can to keep our heads above water. i can't do you, too."
9387,Lynette,"too little, too late."
11438,Lynette,could you excuse me a second? i'm sorry. i'm sorry. what's up?
11439,Lynette,oh? what's wrong with it?
11440,Lynette,"all right, all right. i will put you order in. but the kitchen's a little backed up."
11443,Lynette,he has a history--using cocaine.
9396,Lynette,so what did mike say when he gave you the letter?
11446,Lynette,of course! absolutely!
9399,Lynette,didn't you once say you never mix business with pleasure?
9400,Lynette,"why wait, why don't we just rip it up now."
11447,Lynette,"please, please, tell me we can still make pizza."
11449,Lynette,"oh, my god! you are a lifesaver!"
11450,Lynette,for pasta? are you crazy?
11454,Lynette,and we're offering that for twelve dollars.
11458,Lynette,"no, no, the profit margin."
11459,Lynette,"and we charge twenty dollars! four people who would've shared a fifteen dollar pizza are now spending eighty bucks. okay, kids, dig in!"
11462,Lynette,"it's delicious, huh?"
11463,Lynette,yeah? rick learned how to make this in italy. go ahead. try it. i wanna see what you think.
9419,Lynette,what's your problem?
9423,Lynette,great.
11476,Lynette,what's this?
9429,Lynette,why?
11484,Lynette,"what? yeah, sometimes. why?"
11486,Lynette,sure.
11489,Lynette,okay. i'm off.
9444,Lynette,you did. why do i do it? this compulsion to stick my nose where it doesn't belong. i mean--
11492,Lynette,thank you. so have you told bree about your engagement?
9446,Lynette,"oh, please."
11495,Lynette,"i'm not, but susan's written a poem."
9448,Lynette,you know what i admire you for? you find a way to compliment me when you could say 'i told you so.'
9449,Lynette,"you just signed 'i told you so', didn't you?"
11498,Lynette,i've knocked twice. she's not answering.
9454,Lynette,"oh for god's sake bree, i'm wearing panty-hose."
11506,Lynette,aren't you sweet? what's that noise in the background? are the boys still up?
11507,Lynette,"well, of course they don't. they're kids. you're the dad. make 'em."
9464,Lynette,"so help me, if you don't back me up on this i will lose it."
11517,Lynette,of course we're with you. we will give edie the cold shoulder.
11521,Lynette,"well, i'm really busy at the restaurant. believe me, i come home to daddy just as soon as i can."
9477,Lynette,"hey. look, i just wanted to apologise."
9478,Lynette,thank you. it looks like tom's got the mob under control. do you want to have some coffee? sit around? bitch about our kids?
11526,Lynette,"oh, really? my ringer must've been off."
11528,Lynette,cater?
11532,Lynette,and--and--and you want me to go with you?
9488,Lynette,"yeah, i'll come with you. here i am."
9491,Lynette,"huh, well, i'm glad to hear you're alright."
11539,Lynette,"hey, you want some pizza?"
11540,Lynette,there you go.
9495,Lynette,"ok, tom, i will swing by the dry cleaners after i hit the market. um, i don't know, porter has a dentist appointment at 4 o' clock, so the, um, car might have to wait until tomorrow."
11550,Lynette,don't turn around. m.
9504,Lynette,"well, isn't she home? she usually doesn't go anywhere."
11554,Lynette,"oh, come on, gaby, be fair. you put us in a really awkward position."
9510,Lynette,"hello? it's lynette? hello? mrs mcclusky? mrs mcclusky, are you alright?"
9516,Lynette,first thing tomorrow i'll take you to the pharmacy and you can get you new bottles.
9519,Lynette,and you know what. i am going to take this.
11568,Lynette,but--i'm sorry. you could still go.
11569,Lynette,thanks. thank you.
11578,Lynette,"but--but the doctor said your recovery would take months, and it's only been six weeks."
11579,Lynette,i don't mind.
11581,Lynette,rick? why would we want to let him go?
9536,Lynette,"no, i wanted to see you."
11586,Lynette,okay.
9540,Lynette,"edie, hi."
11589,Lynette,so this little ear-shaped pasta is called--
11591,Lynette,thank you. this is nice.
9544,Lynette,"and i know tom loves me, but i don't trust this woman. i think there's an agenda there. i don't know, maybe i'm being paranoid."
11592,Lynette,"no, i mean--everything--the food, the wine--you. i swear, there are times this is all that gets me through my day, knowing at the end of it, i get to steal this little half-hour where i'm not a mom or a wife or a--pizza slave. i'm just a--tired lady with a nice man who cooks for her."
9546,Lynette,i'm listening.
9547,Lynette,i thought you said you didn't have any female friends?
11595,Lynette,"no, he won't. he takes a pain pill at ten. he's probably already asleep. jeez. how are we gonna make it through the night in here?"
11596,Lynette,yeah. that helps.
11600,Lynette,tom! in here!
9564,Lynette,i trust you.
11613,Lynette,did he what?
9567,Lynette,please do.
11615,Lynette,stop! don't say it! you cannot say these things.
11617,Lynette,and i have nothing to offer! i am taken! god!
11623,Lynette,"ooh, sorry. by the way, we are gonna need to find a new chef. rick gave notice."
9576,Lynette,"yeah, he's just getting his briefcase."
11625,Lynette,you sure you're ready?
11630,Lynette,"well, when two people have known each other as long as mommy and daddy have, they don't have to always talk. in fact, a sign of a good relationship is being comfortable in silence."
9583,Lynette,"oh. oh, it's probably baby drool."
11633,Lynette,"there's nothing to talk about, okay? just leave me alone."
11635,Lynette,yeah?
11636,Lynette,you won the beer pong championship?
9589,Lynette,"okay, off!"
9590,Lynette,"oh , ha ha ha. not funny, tom."
11639,Lynette,"oh, sure, now and then."
9593,Lynette,i was thinking that our marriage was in trouble and one of us should do something to fix it.
11643,Lynette,"oh, dear god you didn't."
9598,Lynette,"no, there's nothing to fix. we've changed. that's all i'm saying."
9604,Lynette,alright?i'm coming in.
11654,Lynette,and what would that have to do with me?
9608,Lynette,"no, i'm not turning off the lights."
9610,Lynette,hey.
11658,Lynette,yeah. let's get this off.
9612,Lynette,what?
11662,Lynette,nothing was going on! he never touched me!
11663,Lynette,you didn't make him quit! i fired him!
9616,Lynette,"actually, it's fruit juice sweetened. can i cut you? a piece?"
11665,Lynette,thank you.
9624,Lynette,"well, as happy as i am to see you, i actually have an agenda. i ran into someone last week who said you guys were looking to hire. is that true?"
11676,Lynette,"not yet, sweetheart. you go back to sleep now."
9630,Lynette,"yes, a very pretty shark."
11680,Lynette,"oh, good."
9635,Lynette,"yep, that'll do it."
9638,Lynette,tom?
9640,Lynette,"well, it's the middle of the day, and shouldn't you be at work?"
9646,Lynette,"so, did you have a fun day?"
11697,Lynette,"you said not to worry about money, that you'd find it somewhere."
9651,Lynette,"oh, well, yeah. i think it would be good for you to take some time off."
9652,Lynette,huh?
9654,Lynette,"well, yes, yes, it is hard, but i, i love it, too, and i've been doing it for six years, and i haven't complained the entire time."
11702,Lynette,if you would just try to understand--
9666,Lynette,thank you. here.
9669,Lynette,"she said she was gonna call. she's got a lot of things to do, planning for the funeral, that sort of thing."
11718,Lynette,no i don't.
11721,Lynette,you're leaving tomorrow. i don't want your money. i don't want you imy house.
9674,Lynette,"yeah, of course, they won't get in the way of the job because my husband's staying home with them from now on."
9676,Lynette,"are you kidding? this office is paradise. grown-ups talking about grown-up things. no screaming, no vomiting, no boogers under the table. you're gonna have to drag me outta here kicking and screaming - weekends, holidays, whenever."
11726,Lynette,"oh,sweetie."
9687,Lynette,"oh, for god sakes!"
9694,Lynette,"""i have. but when i moved over to cenn and simmons-"
9695,Lynette,"um, i got to do a broader range of campaigns."
11747,Lynette,bravo!i'm sorry.i'll get you a new purse.
11749,Lynette,"oh,sorry."
9703,Lynette,"here's how i see it. you guys run a really good shop, but if you want your agency to go to the next level, you have to focus on two things. first, you've gotta win some awards. do some p.s.a.s, pro bono stuff, whatever it takes, because whether they admit it or not, clients care about what's in your trophy case. two, your web site. it's the first thing a client's gonna look at, and it's hard to navigate. there's no site map. it just wasn't built for people who grew up without computers. there. and third, i don't have a third. yeah, so that's it."
11752,Lynette,i'm in charge of decorations?
9705,Lynette,"well, all right!"
9711,Lynette,wow. it's really pilin' up.
9712,Lynette,really?
9714,Lynette,and why have i never seen the sparkling part?
11762,Lynette,you with us?
9716,Lynette,i think i'm asking you to clean the house.
11763,Lynette,i have cancer.
9718,Lynette,"please, don't take this the wrong way. i think you are doing a terrific job, but let's be clear. when you came home, it was to clutter. i mean, come on, this is more than that."
11766,Lynette,"well, let's not compose my eulogy just yet. i'm still troupin'. take a card."
9723,Lynette,and you didn't change them?
11772,Lynette,"you are supposed to be distracting me, not depressing the hell out of me."
9726,Lynette,why are you yelling at me?
11774,Lynette,just go. i'll cab it.
11777,Lynette,thank you.
9732,Lynette,"all right, fine! fine! fine! fine! ah!"
11783,Lynette,"hey, gaby."
11786,Lynette,"yeah, but between us, you're the one i really want there. out of everyone, you're the most fun, and i need that now."
11792,Lynette,"i'm fine. so tell me something. when you go to a ribbon cutting, do you get to keep those gigantic novelty scissors?"
9747,Lynette,i'm home.
11797,Lynette,thanks for that encouraging story.
9750,Lynette,yep.
11799,Lynette,you're not gonna lose me.
11803,Lynette,"that's sweet, and totally accurate. but i'm really whipped from the chemo, so--oh, there's my other line. can you ask me next time, okay, hon? okay, bye."
11805,Lynette,wait--is katherine going to susan's charade night?
11811,Lynette,"i appreciate the effort, but i told you, i can't keep anything down, and f.y.i. mac and cheese is halfway to vomit. you might as well have given me a plate of creamed corn."
9765,Lynette,"hey, nina."
11813,Lynette,you're suggesting pot?
11814,Lynette,yeah.
9770,Lynette,okay. good point. and i'm sorry about your hair. i can see why you're upset.
9771,Lynette,"not now, stu. hang on a sec."
9776,Lynette,"honey, i'm gonna be right back."
11824,Lynette,yeah. i guess that anti-nausea medicine finally kicked in.
11827,Lynette,who do you think you're talking to?
11828,Lynette,okay.
11829,Lynette,"i know. just, this is a really hard one."
11834,Lynette,it's like chocolate love.
11839,Lynette,"that's not the point. and what were you thinking, using my son as a drug mule?"
11841,Lynette,"parents who weren't stoned. my whole childhood passed in a blur because you were medicating yourself--pot when you were sick, booze when you weren't. i am not going to do that. i won't miss a second of my kids' lives, not if i can avoid it."
9794,Lynette,when did this start?
9795,Lynette,and you don't find it odd that parker's new nanny made her appearance right at the time i went back to work?
11845,Lynette,you remembered.
9798,Lynette,"hey buddy, wake up sleepyhead. parker. hi, hi pal. what do you say you and me go get some donuts, okay, before mommy has to go to work. yeah?"
11849,Lynette,"okay, so here are your options. ""a,"" we could go romantic, play soft music, light some candles, or ""b,"" go straight to the--"
11851,Lynette,hey! hey. screw it.
9804,Lynette,here we go.
11853,Lynette,"no, i'm good. hey, babe, what's going on? you still with me?"
11854,Lynette,what?
9809,Lynette,what?
11858,Lynette,a week? all right. you'll hurt if you can?
11859,Lynette,i'm upset 'cause that salesgirl just walked away with my sex life.
11863,Lynette,what are you saying?
11871,Lynette,"i do, and i'm up for that."
9824,Lynette,maybe i can change my work schedule. try to get some flex time.
11882,Lynette,well-- i know that.
9836,Lynette,"or, uh, maybe she's not. she could have left. you know. maybe she had some other little boy that she needed to help."
9840,Lynette,"until there's a body, there's no evidence of a crime."
11889,Lynette,"hey, guys, i got your snack. what you playing?"
11892,Lynette,"well, that's a good rule. although it wasn't bad news. it was actually--"
9850,Lynette,"well, i'm not. so, uh, what about that guy over there? he's been checking you out since we walked in."
11898,Lynette,you're comparing katherine to a nazi?
9852,Lynette,"oh, for god's sakes."
9853,Lynette,"hey, stretch. see my friend over there? she thinks you're cute."
9854,Lynette,why don't you buy her a drink?
11899,Lynette,"after you get rid of this fountain, that's it, right?"
9860,Lynette,hey.
9863,Lynette,"oh, is she now?"
11915,Lynette,"see, that's awkward for me. this is about personal freedom. you know? i'm running as a libertarian."
9871,Lynette,thank you.
11919,Lynette,"katherine, what are you up to?"
9878,Lynette,"chuck, i'm gonna stop you right there."
11926,Lynette,"it's up to you, hon."
9880,Lynette,"chuck, get your hand off my thigh. no! not up my thigh. off my thigh! come on, what's the matter with you! i'm not available. and i'm not that easy!"
9882,Lynette,it's crazy here tonight. don't you want to dance?
9883,Lynette,"woo! i love this song. here, hold my purse."
11932,Lynette,"oh, jeez. get over here."
11933,Lynette,"oh, look, it's our new queen-- katherine of arrogant. hey, where's the wrecking ball?"
9887,Lynette,i'll just wear a different suit then.
11937,Lynette,is that a hole?
11942,Lynette,great. here. grab this.
11943,Lynette,you know that possum that's been ruining our garden?
9903,Lynette,thank you.
11951,Lynette,i want a gun.
11952,Lynette,that was the old lynette. the new lynette kills the possums and let's god sort 'em out.
11953,Lynette,wusses!
11955,Lynette,great.
9912,Lynette,"you can't explain obsession, tom. it just is."
11964,Lynette,no.
11965,Lynette,no. this is about the baby.
9918,Lynette,i'm so sorry. did my sons beat you up?
11974,Lynette,it's not just that. it's the smoking and the swearing and the teaching the kids how to make a whiskey sour.
11982,Lynette,what? what? we're having lunch.
9937,Lynette,"norma, wait! we're still on for next week! norma! the water park! right?"
9940,Lynette,okay.
11992,Lynette,"lucy, every fight we have ever had has ended with my foot on your neck. i guarantee that this one's gonna end the same way, too."
11993,Lynette,"guys, i can't be any clearer on this. i am not taking her back."
9953,Lynette,huh?
12004,Lynette,going?
9963,Lynette,i'm home. could you come here a sec?
12014,Lynette,glen? i don't believe it.
9967,Lynette,"yeah, well, that was a different time. you have to be more vigilant. there was a break-in on this street."
12020,Lynette,"oh, my god."
9973,Lynette,oh.
9974,Lynette,can i ask a question?
12021,Lynette,"oh, well, good. at least she's not living like a hobo. oh, my god. i'm so glad to see you again."
12029,Lynette,"okay, enough with the drama. i want you to come home with me."
9982,Lynette,"yeah, i applaud that, but what i need is for you to help me to prove a point to my husband."
12030,Lynette,"i am sorry about that, mom. we were just venting. people who love you need to do that."
9992,Lynette,"what, um, don't you get?"
12041,Lynette,then why not come back?
9994,Lynette,you're being rude and it's totally out of line. you know how hard we all worked on this.
12043,Lynette,i'm sorry. you want this around?
10001,Lynette,"yeah, no, i didn't think so. ante up."
10004,Lynette,"hey, stu."
10009,Lynette,"no more belittling, berating, rude sarcasm."
10014,Lynette,i'm lynette scavo. i work here. who are you?
12063,Lynette,yeah. he'd be very safe. we could put him in a closet.
12066,Lynette,"no, that's ridiculous. karen, come on."
10019,Lynette,you threatening me?
10023,Lynette,"see, i don't think that's why you got fired."
12075,Lynette,"hey, hold it! hold it! you can't go out there!"
10029,Lynette,"well, i'm not gonna lie to you. there is a possibility she'd get a slap on the wrist. so, you'll think about talking to ed?"
12077,Lynette,karen! you gotta get inside now!
12079,Lynette,"oh! hurry!oh! go! no! come on! come on! come on, come on! get in!"
12080,Lynette,"come on! hurry up! go! get in, get in! get in! uhh! hang on! hang onto this!"
12081,Lynette,"oh, my god."
12084,Lynette,why is it taking so long? they should be going faster.
12088,Lynette,hi!
12089,Lynette,"oh, my god!"
12093,Lynette,what's all this baseball stuff? there's a mitt and a jersey. was this her husband's?
10048,Lynette,"oh, hi. excuse me. hi. i'm lynette. you must be fran."
12099,Lynette,what do you mean?
10052,Lynette,"really? yeah. look, i'm gonna level with you. parcher and murphy can't have a day care center unless we have at least sixteen kids and without little mindy, we only have fifteen."
12100,Lynette,but that's not where they found her.
12103,Lynette,"um, well, there's a great diner right near granville field."
12106,Lynette,it doesn't matter. she was an amazing woman. you should respect her wishes.
12108,Lynette,"look, you're taking her pearls. the least you can do is honor her wishes."
10064,Lynette,there's science to back that up.
10068,Lynette,oh.
10069,Lynette,"oh, i was planning to."
10070,Lynette,"i am not on your side, ed."
12117,Lynette,"oh, my goodness."
10072,Lynette,"pat, can you see here i'm holding a baby hostage? i will call back!"
12122,Lynette,i'm just glad we gave ida what she wanted.
10080,Lynette,"so, uh, gaby--you know that thing you and tom did tonight?the-- the kiss?"
12130,Lynette,okay.
10086,Lynette,i just said it bugged me.why is that a problem?
12139,Lynette,right.
10093,Lynette,gaby had an affair?
12142,Lynette,"hi. i'm lynette scavo. i'm a friend of bree hodge. and your sermon was lovely, especially the part about the trees."
10096,Lynette,"bree, come on, just tell me."
12144,Lynette,"the reason i ask is, there are wars all over the world, and it seems like every month, some dumb-ass walks into a school and starts shooting children. so i'm thinking, god's love? not so sure."
10099,Lynette,does gaby know that you know?
10101,Lynette,"hey, i'm right by the supermarket.you want me to pick up anything?"
12149,Lynette,"yeah, and i hope the reverend's ready, cause i got about a zillion questions for him."
10103,Lynette,"yeah, they were out."
10104,Lynette,"yeah. hey, gaby.a surprise seeing you here."
12155,Lynette,what are you doing here?
12156,Lynette,weren't you the one who said i should explore other churches?
10110,Lynette,"come on, gaby.it's a small town. people talk."
10115,Lynette,are you drunk?
12164,Lynette,"because i have had a rough few months. okay? but i know you've had rough times, too, and i always assumed that your faith had helped you get through them. i envied you that, to be honest."
12166,Lynette,"well, that's not a good answer. i have been through cancer and a tornado, and i don't know why i survived, and so many other people didn't. i don't understand, and i need to."
10121,Lynette,hey.um--i hope it's okay.carlos let me in.
12171,Lynette,"well, maybe a little."
10128,Lynette,it kinda does.i wanna get it clear for our friendship.
12176,Lynette,"oh, my god. rick."
10133,Lynette,"well, sure, no problem."
12183,Lynette,you were supposed to be home at 8:00 to help me wrangle the kids for bath time. it's--it's almost 11:00.
10140,Lynette,mm-hmm?
12189,Lynette,"oh, i've been unwashed for years."
12190,Lynette,"gaby, people don't come here for the amenities. they come because toilet paper's 3 cents a ton."
10143,Lynette,what's that about?
10148,Lynette,what? why? i called.the machine kept picking up.
10152,Lynette,"well,tom,somebody's gotta take care of our kids."
10153,Lynette,and since you're immune--
12201,Lynette,"no, overreacting would be if i threw a brick through you. what were you thinking? help me understand."
10156,Lynette,okay.
12207,Lynette,"hi, andrew. guess what? your mom just won the founder's award."
12208,Lynette,what? what? is everyone okay?
12209,Lynette,"oh, my god! that's horrible! how did it start?"
10165,Lynette,so you're saying that if i died--you would want a second wife and a family?
10166,Lynette,i can't believe you've actually thought about this!
12216,Lynette,"yeah. i was thinkin', if anyone asks about that fire at rick's, it'd be good if you had someone to account for where you were."
10170,Lynette,"i don't want you to have options,tom.if i die,i wanna hear your life would be over.i want you to spend the rest of your life screaming,""it should've been me on that plane!"""
10171,Lynette,i'm assuming there was a crash.it could've been something else.
12219,Lynette,"no, no. of course not. it's just, if the police came here to ask us about the brick, they're probably gonna ask us about the fire, so you might wanna be ready."
10173,Lynette,"okay,well,that's easy to say,but i need you to show me."
12221,Lynette,"hey, andrew. what do you need?"
12223,Lynette,yeah.
10184,Lynette,are you saying you're unhappy?
10185,Lynette,"well, what are we gonna do about that?"
12232,Lynette,didn't i? 'cause it kinda seemed like they had you against the ropes in there.
12233,Lynette,"sure, i do. it must've been some other random maniac with a grudge against rick who burned down his restaurant."
10188,Lynette,"here we are at ""t"" minus 9 hours and 11 minutes from the biggest pitch in our company's history,and i have nothing even vaguely presentable."
12239,Lynette,"come here. come on. okay. mommy and daddy are sort of-- fighting, but we're working through it."
10199,Lynette,"uh, well,the pitch was running long,so we cut a few things."
10200,Lynette,"well, to be fair--"
10202,Lynette,hi!
10203,Lynette,hi.
12252,Lynette,boys? who are you talking about?
12257,Lynette,kayla--why would you even joke about something like that?
12261,Lynette,"mm, no. i think it goes a little further than that. i think we have a seriously troubled young girl. she needs--professional help."
10216,Lynette,thank you. bye.
10219,Lynette,just-- uh--could you excuse me for just a minute?
12267,Lynette,"well, actually, this is a different kind of doctor. you know, the kind you can talk to?"
12268,Lynette,"well, i thought you might like to have a safe place where you could share your feelings. you know? with your mom's death and moving in with us, you've been through a lot."
12274,Lynette,"actually, i think we're okay. we--resolved our problems just sitting in your waiting room. boy, you're good. 'kay. so we're gonna go."
12276,Lynette,"tom, it is one thing not to want to admit something's wrong with your kid. it's another to just bury your head in the sand."
10235,Lynette,"no, no, no, no,we never hire in the room."
10238,Lynette,oh.
12287,Lynette,did you have anything to do with the fire at rick's restaurant?
18432,Susan,"come on,come on,come on."
16386,Susan,emasculated? who said emasculated? and why are you not kissing me now?
18434,Susan,"well, all of the food is very expensive."
14341,Susan,"oh, for pete's sake."
16392,Susan,move away from that topic.
16393,Susan,"oh, come on."
16394,Susan,it's true. she has a little room with magazines and an aquarium.
16396,Susan,"i just bought it. but if you don't like it, feel free to rip it off me."
14349,Susan,"oh uh, that's okay. i just didn't expect to see anyone up at a quarter of one."
14352,Susan,what are you doing? i have a teenage daughter in the house! you cannot just bring strange men you meet in bars back here in the middle of the night!
14353,Susan,"look, i know you're trying to get over morty, but this is not the way to do it.so can you please just go out there and tell him to go home?"
16402,Susan,what happened?
14359,Susan,"mom, i'm sorry. i'm just not in the mood to hang out these days."
14360,Susan,"of course you can, just call them up and tell them not to come over."
14362,Susan,yeah.
16410,Susan,"yeah, well, you know, you try to think of a more appropriate ""thank you for saving my life"" gift."
14364,Susan,no.
16419,Susan,"well, at least it'll keep me from stabbing myself while i look."
16421,Susan,"sure, but we can't keep leaning on him for everything.""mike, we're drowning. save us."" ""mike, it's dark. give us a flashlight."" let's go ask gaby."
16425,Susan,"don't walk in the kitchen. anyway, where is your sense of romance? it's a blackout. you have a defenseless lady. getting any ideas?"
16428,Susan,"look, ian is going to come invite you to dinner friday, and you are not--i repeat--not going to accept."
14384,Susan,zach! what do you think you are?argh! argh!
14387,Susan,"well, you just threw rocks in her mother's face. how's that for a start?"
16438,Susan,"oh, so you're not seeing anyone?"
16444,Susan,"well, i'm not available, so if you feel like kissing someone tonight, point those lips at maggie."
14397,Susan,you didn't have to do that.
14398,Susan,"yeah, well, that's not going to happen."
14399,Susan,"aside from you nearly blinding me. several weeks ago you freaked out in my house: you screamed, you threw furniture around."
16446,Susan,he was totally innocent.
14401,Susan,"zach, julie does not think of you as her boyfriend. in fact i don't think she wants anything to do with you."
16450,Susan,thanks a lot. now maggie thinks you're charles manson.
16457,Susan,i don't know.
14411,Susan,alright then.
16459,Susan,it's not just a cake. it's a major decision!
16460,Susan,"how would that look? ""oh, hey, everybody! here's my wedding cake. oh, and what's that over there? it's my other wedding cake. i have to pick, and i will! so just stop pressuring me, okay? i'm sorry. i think i was just having a little sugar rush."
16465,Susan,and if he won?
16466,Susan,get out!
16467,Susan,"you, too. i've had it with both of you. you're tugging at me like i'm some kind of wishbone."
14420,Susan,gabby!
14431,Susan,what?
14434,Susan,really???!!!!
14435,Susan,us too. the house will seem just empty without you
14437,Susan,"bye, morty."
14439,Susan,did she tell you that he served time in prison for manslaughter?
16488,Susan,"oh, gaby, that's not fair. nobody really liked patty to begin with."
14442,Susan,what? what were you thinking?
14446,Susan,it was all true. everything he said. how could i have been so wrong?
14450,Susan,go.
16499,Susan,work is great. you could just sign that paper and tell the judge i'm fine.
14455,Susan,"okay, give me the good news."
14457,Susan,"oh, forget it. just let me look at it myself."
16505,Susan,"okay, fine, i loved him. i still love him, and i love ian. so i am totally, hopelessly in love with two men."
14459,Susan,i know her.
16506,Susan,"no, this is horrible! this wasn't supposed to happen! i only let myself fall for ian 'cause i thought mike was lost to me. and then bang! suddenly he wants me back, and now i have this choice that i can't possibly make."
14461,Susan,"oh, oh, you don't understand. i can't just drive away."
16507,Susan,"it's devastating! if i go with mike, ian's heart will be broken, and ian does not deserve that. but how can i reject mike after all he's been through?"
16509,Susan,lynette! what are you doing here?
14465,Susan,"it's not my fault, you don't have love in your heart."
16516,Susan,"uh, what are we doing here?"
14470,Susan,what?
16520,Susan,who was?
16525,Susan,deal.
14478,Susan,i knew you'd be happy for us. so what's going on?
16529,Susan,to england? what's wrong?
14483,Susan,"well, i can't have doughnuts and juice. it's unnatural."
16531,Susan,"well, ian, i made my choice."
14487,Susan,we need to talk.
14496,Susan,"no, no, i got it. um, i got it. so, if you've got a plumbing emergency, shouldn't you get going?"
14497,Susan,"well, i'll just get back to work."
14500,Susan,"i don't have time to explain adult relationships to you. oh, duck down."
16550,Susan,"uh, can i get a map to the hot springs? i'm gonna hike up there."
14505,Susan,"oh my god, wow, um, okay oh, wow um, bye."
14508,Susan,"yeah, part of it. why?"
16561,Susan,"little help. so anyway, the whole situation with mike--it just seemed hopeless and that's when i decided to take a chance with ian."
16562,Susan,"yeah. what was i supposed to do, wait forever for mike?"
14516,Susan,"mike, hi, sweetie. i hope the job's going well. um, so i hope you're not mad, but i found mrs. huber's journal in your truck, and, well, i couldn't exactly not read it, so i did, and, um, i know all about the blackmail, so call me. we'll talk. love you. bye."
14518,Susan,"i thought the whole point of having a cell phone was so someone could reach you when they needed to talk. how can we move forward as a couple if you won't communicate with me? mike, i need you to call me back! i mean it! love you. bye."
14523,Susan,"yes. let's call it stressed out. uh, so how did you get martha huber's journal?"
16571,Susan,what is it?
16575,Susan,"oh. hey--mike. um, listen, i know your cell phone's off, but i--i wanted you to know that i followed you up to the hot springs, and--now i'm lost. you know, in the off chance that i get devoured by a mountain lion, i--i just wanted you to know that, um--i love you. i've always loved you. and i don't want any more drama. and if you take me back, i promise there won't be. unless i get eaten by a mountain lion, and, you know, that'll be dramatic, but it won't be my fault. anyway, um--i hope it's not too late, but if it is, i just--i just want you to know that i am so, so--"
14528,Susan,"oh, thanks. i'll go do that now."
16576,Susan,sorry.
16579,Susan,"if by okay, you mean uneventful, then yes."
14532,Susan,"now, you be a good boy, bongo, or you're gonna go to bed hungry."
14534,Susan,"edie, what a pleasant surprise."
16585,Susan,"yes, i did, because i am a thoughtful person. and whenever we do get married, that is something you are gonna have to work on."
14540,Susan,what'd she say?
14544,Susan,exactly. because she raised you right. look you have been through a lot. you've lost your mom. you're still carrying around the guilt over what happened to your baby sister.
14550,Susan,i look like hell. i need a hairbrush.
14551,Susan,"uh, and i turned around, and there was zach young - and that's zach with an ""h"" - pointing a gun at me."
14552,Susan,ouch.
16599,Susan,"oh, you could change your plans."
16603,Susan,"gaby, did you really think i would want to spend what would've been my wedding day watching someone else get married?"
16607,Susan,"okay, well, i just wanted to say that i'm sorry for getting so snippy yesterday, that when i canceled my wedding, you had every right to--"
14560,Susan,okay.
14565,Susan,is that?
14568,Susan,"just work it into the conversation. you know, put the word out there."
14572,Susan,fine. is mike here?
14580,Susan,who cares?
14584,Susan,zach said you kidnapped his father so you could kill him.
14586,Susan,so paul killed her?
14589,Susan,he had a gun in my face for six hours. i know what he looks like.
14590,Susan,can you give us a minute?
14595,Susan,"so it occurred to me that i was really rude at the morgue. when you told me about zach, i was so busy freaking out, i never actually congratulated you."
14599,Susan,"and out of all the mixed-up teenagers in the world, zach is just the one kid that i can't be around. i can't have julie around him. so, um, what i'm trying to say is--"
14603,Susan,"no, not really. i mean, what do we actually know about our neighbors? i mean, we can tell if they keep their lawns nice or they take their trash cans in, but when they do those things, we stop asking questions 'cause if people are good neighbors--"
16655,Susan,yeah.
14611,Susan,you are forbidden from ever seeing her again. do you hear me? forbidden!
14615,Susan,"oh, now is not a good time, danny."
14616,Susan,"i'll take care of it, i promise."
16663,Susan,"oh, wow!"
16669,Susan,"okay, i know that you think i'm being silly, but all of our friends went to bree's wedding, and now they're going to gaby's. two months from now, do we really want them thinking our wasn't as nice?"
16674,Susan,"okay, well, that's crazy. you can't work round the clock. it's not healthy."
14629,Susan,"oh, it's fine. they're in the garage."
16679,Susan,"no, i wanna start out happy. but clearly, you're upset, and i don't know why."
16682,Susan,"really? is everything okay, sweetie? 'cause you haven't quite seemed yourself the last couple weeks."""
14635,Susan,"uh, well, i, i don't, i don't think there's anything wrong with us seeing a movie once in awhile."
14637,Susan,shopping. that's casual. that's fun.
14647,Susan,what?
14650,Susan,circumstances beyond your control. i get it. so if you'll excuse me.
14653,Susan,"edie, what are you doing?"
14654,Susan,we're in the middle of the street. would you get out of here?
14656,Susan,"well, yes, we are. i'm gonna go."
16705,Susan,"oh,my god.katherine.katherine!"
14662,Susan,"it was an accident, karl. edie knows it was an accident, right?"
16711,Susan,sure.i'm just here for a checkup.
16712,Susan,yes.yesterday.susan mayer.your new neighbor.
14670,Susan,"i wanna be happy first! mike and i were supposed to move in together, you know? this was supposed to be my time."
14671,Susan,i don't know. it's really complicated. so you never answered my question. are you in love with her?
16719,Susan,"yeah.you know,one month off,two months on.that happens,right?"
16723,Susan,"i don't need any test!i am not old enough for menopause.now i don't know what kind of nonsense they taught you at.harvard medical school,class of '97?oh,my god!i am old!just give me the damn test."
16725,Susan,"yeah,get used to it."
16727,Susan,"i know.and you thought you married a vibrant woman in her prime,and instead,you got a wife who's.dry and dusty."
14683,Susan,"it was the early eighties. well, i'm not gonna argue with you. you want to do the show with edie, and i think that's super. so she's really good, huh?"
14685,Susan,"oh, my daughter is singing a song at church and i want to accompany her on the piano and i haven't played in years. oh, you were just so amazing at rex's funeral the other day, i was wondering--"
14689,Susan,"really? oh, i thought it made it sound more professional."
14690,Susan,"boy, your son really likes to play his hip-hop music loud."
16739,Susan,i'm in.
16743,Susan,really? that's fantastic!
16746,Susan,he said i'm pregnant.
16755,Susan,"uh, that sounds great."
16758,Susan,"hey, katherine. what's going on?"
16760,Susan,katherine? are you okay? you seem a little jumpy.
16762,Susan,"no problem. hey, you know, i was meaning to ask you, how did that job in chicago work out?"
14715,Susan,"you come within 10 feet of her,i will have you arrested.now get out."
14720,Susan,"no, no, it's not. we're just gonna pretend like it was when we first started dating. we'll just see each other occasionally. you know, until we get this zach thing resolved. you know, we'll just be easy about it. no commitments. except, of course, neither of us is allowed to date anybody else."
16769,Susan,mike. i'm going with mike.
16777,Susan,count me in.
16778,Susan,what are friends for?
14731,Susan,i'm just happy to be spending the day with you.
16781,Susan,"okay, look, i've been thinking about things, and--just forget what i said earlier."
14734,Susan,oh. do you mind keeping those and pass them out when people get their ice cream?
14736,Susan,oh. zach. zach!
14739,Susan,i got you some ice cream.
14745,Susan,"okay, please, please don't run."
16796,Susan,"well, i don't think that you can have sexy date night without whipped cream."
16797,Susan,"no, no, you've, uh, worked all day. you stay here. i'll go to the store."
14751,Susan,"zach, you know what i think? i think you should come back with me."
14754,Susan,what?
14755,Susan,"yeah, well, julie's a really special girl."
16802,Susan,if that's your lame attempt to keep me from calling your parents--it worked. well played. excuse me.
14758,Susan,you should find your father first. let me help.
14760,Susan,i can't believe i let you talk me into this. i am so behind in my work. but i'm glad i came. this is fun.
14762,Susan,you're leaving muir and hunt? you helped build that place.
16815,Susan,please tell me this isn't gonna be one of those things where you leave me and i go screaming down the street.
14768,Susan,really? 'cause it sorta sounds like embezzlement.
14775,Susan,i told you. lonnie wants me to sign with his new agency.
16830,Susan,"honey, you know, i'm still in my first trimester. um, don't you think it's a little early to be making cribs?"
16834,Susan,"yeah, i don't know. it's getting a little weird. you know, adam is my neighbor."
14790,Susan,where's jeannie?
16841,Susan,"oh, bless you."
14795,Susan,i'm sorry. i just can't trust you anymore.
16843,Susan,"a friend of mine recommended this place. it's not exactly what i expected. must be one heck of a doctor, though, huh?"
16844,Susan,"gaby! sorry i'm late. oh, my god! you made it. that is such a beautiful dress. we're gonna have so much fun. you--come with me."
14798,Susan,no!
14799,Susan,what are you doing? are you trying to take me down with you?
14800,Susan,you should have just come clean.
16845,Susan,"and the whole time, i just kept thinking, this is bree's doctor. bree recommended him. he must be the best. so i didn't worry when it was between a needle exchange. and the area's only transvestite bookstore. and i ignored that my shoes stuck to the floor. and there was a cigarette machine in the waiting room. but when i saw the ant traps on his speculum tray, i thought that you and i should have a talk."
16846,Susan,that is not the point! why would you send me to somebody who is obviously not your doctor?
16851,Susan,i pick lynette. where's lynette?
16858,Susan,"okay, 22 seconds. lynette, you're up."
16862,Susan,what do you think you're doing? you can't leave yet.
14815,Susan,how much money do you think you need to get to utah?
16863,Susan,"no, we'll talk now. you still owe me an explanation for that scuzzy gyno you sent me to."
14818,Susan,mom!
14819,Susan,you can?
16866,Susan,"like what? i mean, come on. just tell me. we share everything."
14824,Susan,"right, right, i'm sorry."
16873,Susan,"look at us. pregnant gals, eating cake and bi*chin'. it's kinda nice, huh?"
16875,Susan,"i got it, i got it. oh, one more. here you go."
16878,Susan,"uh, i-i just wanted to say hi. you know, i saw the movers taking in some of your furniture, and i just have to say you and your wife have gorgeous taste."
14832,Susan,"oh, thank god, they're here."
16884,Susan,"come on, bree. you have to let us do this."
14837,Susan,we need to talk.
14845,Susan,come in!
14848,Susan,"no. no, i didn't. sorry i can't help you out."
16898,Susan,"oh, come on, uncle frank.what's the point of having a gay uncle if you're not gonna help me make friends with these guys? oh. uh, mom said that the whole family knew. um, okay. gotta go. love you."
16899,Susan,what's going on?
16904,Susan,"i'm not, i'm not. now get some mud. i wanna dirty him up so he looks like he's been through hell. okay, in you go."
16909,Susan,"oh, please. what are neighbors for? raphael?! here, puppy!"
14862,Susan,"i screwed up, okay? i want to fix it! please let me fix it! tell me how to fix it! mike, i love you!"
14865,Susan,"no, no, no."
14867,Susan,"oh, gabby, i didn't know you got a sonogram. let me see. oh!"
14868,Susan,thanks.
14871,Susan,"over the past couple of days, i gave myself a long hard look in the mirror and i did not like what i saw."
14877,Susan,"oh. well, i mean when two people split up, normally they don't give things back like valentine's day cards. if, if, you can throw it away. just please don't give it back to me, it's tacky."
16928,Susan,and they taught us that art is subjective.
16931,Susan,"yeah, they can get like that. so do you think that you can just turn it off for a second?"
16934,Susan,like what?
14887,Susan,"karl, did you cheat again?"
16936,Susan,"ida, again, the issue is not bob and lee being gay. it's the fountain."
14889,Susan,you finally saw her without her makeup?
18427,Susan,"mike, i didn't do it to hurt you. you've gotta believe me. i--"
14897,Susan,i'm gonna be honest.
16945,Susan,"yeah, i'm sorry. you know, tired people aren't witty."
14899,Susan,hit me.
16948,Susan,i'm sorry.
14903,Susan,"oh, that's just you rebounding from edie."
16951,Susan,lynette!
14905,Susan,oh. julie! i thought you were going straight to school.
16953,Susan,"okay, if anybody needs me, i'll be at the hardware store buying chains."
16956,Susan,i was surprised that my doctor suggested genetic counseling. i didn't have to do that with my last baby.
16961,Susan,"it wasn't an impression. you said those words--""my father's dead."""
14914,Susan,why do you think we got so good all of a sudden?
16964,Susan,did you really think i was gonna let you crawl in bed next to me without an explanation for your bizarre behavior?
16966,Susan,"oh, my god. he's in jail for murder?"
14919,Susan,"karl, i want to move on. i don't want to go backwards. i'm sorry, but thank you for the explosion. i really needed it."
16970,Susan,thank you.
14923,Susan,"no, edie. i mean, this is so unexpected on so many levels. i don't know what to say."
14926,Susan,"believe me, i don't feel superior."
14936,Susan,why?
14937,Susan,are you sure? that's what my mom said.
16989,Susan,i should go.
16990,Susan,what did you do?
14944,Susan,"well, i'm sorry to upset you, mom, i just, don't you think that's weird?"
16992,Susan,"well, he's just a little piece of heaven."
14946,Susan,there what is?
16993,Susan,did you hear something?
16997,Susan,"there's no way out of it, mike. just do what you need and downstairs. this is what we do in the suburbs."
14950,Susan,mom! mom.
14957,Susan,are you saying that i'm the result of my mother having a one-night stand?
14958,Susan,"of course i am. i'm not gonna pretend like i'm not still a little freaked out. i am. but i did a lot of thinking about it this morning, and i, i think i understand. you wanted to protect me, and you thought i needed a hero. i had one. you."
14964,Susan,all this time my father has been right across town running the feed store?
14966,Susan,what do you mean?
14967,Susan,"oh, i'm not. julie, the man abandoned me before i was born. i don't have a desire to have a relationship with him."
17014,Susan,he said there were no more pills. i was looking him in the eye.
14969,Susan,oh?
14971,Susan,i have a dad! he's great! he gave me a hat!
14973,Susan,"well, actually, there's a 'help wanted' sign in the window so i was thinking about getting a job there. and, you know, he would get to know me and i'm sure he would like me and i would like him, and then one day he would say, 'you're like the daughter i never had' and i'd say, 'well, actually, now that you've mentioned it.'"
17021,Susan,"god, the only advantage he needs is to have a healthy dad who's not doing this."
17024,Susan,thank you.
17026,Susan,can we talk? this will just take a second. did you kiss that boy?
14979,Susan,"oh, no. i was just looking at the color of your eyes."
17027,Susan,"oh, well, you're gonna thank me. do you know that he has his tongue pierced?"
14981,Susan,what? who's carol?
17032,Susan,trust me. your finger is not where he'd put it.
17035,Susan,orgo?
14988,Susan,hello!
14993,Susan,"it's, it's susan. my name is susan. and, no, that's not good enough."
17042,Susan,"yeah, good-looking and smart. only problem is, where is she gonna find someone else like that?"
17047,Susan,"yeah, he said that you owed him money for some--plumbing job that he helped you on."
17055,Susan,"julie, it's not like it was heroin or crack. it was just pain pills for his shoulder, but we had a talk, and he has totally stopped taking them."
15008,Susan,you came!
15009,Susan,"well, sure."
15011,Susan,so are you coming in?
15012,Susan,that was my first halloween. i was two. what do you think i am?
17061,Susan,victor knows?
15014,Susan,"no, addison, i'm a chicken. see? those are feathers hanging around."
17065,Susan,"hey, actually, um, since you're here, i was thinking that maybe it would be a good idea to tell orson about mike's, you know--drug problem."
15019,Susan,uh-huh. what's up?
15020,Susan,yeah.
15021,Susan,solicitation? you were arrested for solicitation?
15032,Susan,"well, now you're gonna have to tell her the truth."
17082,Susan,let go of me! aah! oh!
17088,Susan,these people are bleeding. i can absolutely wait.
17090,Susan,the doctor said the baby's fine.
15043,Susan,thirty-eight.
17093,Susan,"it's gonna be okay. i talked to the doctor, and, um, they have a rehab facility they work with."
17095,Susan,"oh, my god. are you kidding me?"
15048,Susan,good for you. bye.
17098,Susan,"you will go to rehab, or so help me, i will leave you."
17100,Susan,"okay, lynette, listen to me. they are all going to be fine. i know it."
15055,Susan,"hey, what happened to the applewhites?i thought you were gonna invite them."
17105,Susan,and i will help her.
17106,Susan,"come on, tom."
15059,Susan,what kiss?
17107,Susan,"please, this is what best friends do--right before their friendship ends."
17111,Susan,sounds good to me!
15069,Susan,zach.
15072,Susan,"well,what do you think?"
17121,Susan,"that is not enough time. she just started stenciling the kitchen, and i didn't want to tell you this, but there is talk of an herb garden. i've gotta stop her."
15075,Susan,hi.
15080,Susan,go!
17129,Susan,"well, i guess i'll just bring this pie up to julie."
17131,Susan,"well, yeah, sure, someday, but right now i just love having you take care of me. all the cooking and the cleaning and the alphabetizing--it's helping me feel like i'm not just about to fall apart."
17134,Susan,you can stay as long as you want.
15087,Susan,i'm fine.
15088,Susan,"so i swerved to avoid hitting his car,and i hit this parked car instead,and that's when the trunk popped open,and when we got out, we found this dead body and--"
17150,Susan,"oh, please. after what you've been through, no one is judging. come on in. i'll put on some coffee. oh, um, this is my cousin tim. tim, this is the neighbors."
15106,Susan,"thank you so much,dr. ron."
15109,Susan,"well,the paper said the police are withholding the details."
17157,Susan,"well, it doesn't have to be toilets. i mean, it could be sinks, bathtubs."
17160,Susan,what was that? is someone there?
17166,Susan,what the hell is going on here?
17168,Susan,"you, on the other hand"
17174,Susan,hey.
15127,Susan,i got high marks in math and science.
15128,Susan,so is dr. ron gonna be here for this?
17175,Susan,"okay, so i have to ask. this thing that happened with you and katherine 12 years ago--was it an ongoing affair?"
15130,Susan,"oh,uh,i-i,uh--then why did you put out a gown?"
15136,Susan,symptoms?
17188,Susan,all right. we don't need to talk about it. just promise me it won't happen again.
15142,Susan,you like me?
15145,Susan,oh.maybe we could go out sometime?
17197,Susan,"orson, you're staying at my house! there you go."
15150,Susan,thank you.i had a fabulous time.
17198,Susan,"you know, it's none of my business, but seeing as i have seen you naked twice in the last week, i think i can ask, is something bothering you?"
17199,Susan,"clearly. you know, when you were out on the lawn, you said something about mike."
15153,Susan,"oh, that's a good idea.i forgot.i have a bottle of wine.it's already chilled right in the refrigerator,and that'll just really relax me."
15154,Susan,"uh, yeah, yeah,thursday's great."
17202,Susan,you can't. your house isn't finished yet.
17204,Susan,"okay, but in the meantime, um, i do have a teenage daughter, so if you could--"
15159,Susan,okay.
17209,Susan,i can't help it. my hormones are in overdrive. didn't you get that way when you were pregnant?
17214,Susan,since when?
17215,Susan,"you could say ""au gratin"" when you were 3?"
17221,Susan,"no, i get it. really, i knew this day was coming. i just didn't know it would be a day when i was so horny."
15175,Susan,what?i didn't even serve dessert yet.you said you understood!
17223,Susan,"well, you can tell me anything. that's what we talked about in all those sessions with the doctor."
17229,Susan,i can't come out my front door every day and see that man. we have to move.
15182,Susan,really?
15188,Susan,"she makes it sound like we're angry, and we're not angry."
17239,Susan,yeah.
15192,Susan,"edie, can you--"
15196,Susan,"i don't need a loan.i need coverage.i mean, what if there are complications?i don't have a safety net.oh, my god, please!"
17246,Susan,the only work i've had done was getting 185 pounds of ugly fat sucked out of my house.
17249,Susan,"karl? is he here? oh, what a freakish--"
15202,Susan,hi!
17250,Susan,"cause i knew you'd make us switch to another class. last time i was here, karl kept throwing his perfect life in my face, and i just wanted to come back here and--"
15206,Susan,hi.
17259,Susan,"oh, enough with the ""hence."" i'm just saying that some things are private, and i think that you can be honest without being inappropriate."
15212,Susan,"uh, likewise."
17260,Susan,and karl made his happy monkey face. did you notice that?
15217,Susan,"oh, yeah.no, i'm sorry.l-- that was really-- it."
15218,Susan,hi.
17265,Susan,"uh, yeah. that guy was the worst."
15220,Susan,"oh, hi.it's nice to meet you."
15224,Susan,oh! uh--
15225,Susan,"well, it is.l-i could die."
17274,Susan,"the one she won't be helping me with--please tell me it's ""whore."""
15227,Susan,"oh, oh! no, no,stop right there.okay, i would love to see you two crazy kids get hitched in holland more than anyone,with the tulips and the clogs,in front of a windmill,the whole shebang.but unless i get this surgery,my spleen is going to slam straight into my heart and explode.so, you know, seeing as i am just a nice person and i always support gay rights,let's just do this.and then i'll have a husband and insurance.nobody gets hurt."
15229,Susan,i didn't get married.
17282,Susan,i have a job.
17283,Susan,children's books pay.
15240,Susan,yep.
17290,Susan,"it's not like all the other times, edie. we're done."
15244,Susan,"yeah,okay.well,i'll just grab something out of my jewelry box."
15248,Susan,the night you abandoned me.
17300,Susan,"no, no, no, you should take a cab home and start packing. this one feels like a crier."
15253,Susan,it's okay. she knows that you make house calls.
15257,Susan,"your mother is a rotten,sneaky person."
15259,Susan,"oh,yeah."
17307,Susan,i didn't say it was a good plan. do you see the effect she has on me? i just thank god i wasn't drinking coffee. i could've hurt myself.
17316,Susan,maybe. who cares! let her have it.
17327,Susan,"oh. well, yeah, um, i mean, ""conner"" we just picked it after the senior. this would mean something."
15281,Susan,have you seen bree since?
15282,Susan,"hey,bree.how you doing today?"
15286,Susan,and i'm really hoping you're a lefty.
15289,Susan,"what ""little thing""?"
15290,Susan,"oh,my god,they're beautiful."
17341,Susan,"delfino, maynard."
15294,Susan,oh. um--okay.there's more on the back.
17344,Susan,"you gotta help me out here. i'm just trying to protect my child. i don't want him to go through life saddled with the name ""maynard."""
17349,Susan,what are those?
15302,Susan,"okay,you know,you can leave now."
15303,Susan,out!it's not funny.
15304,Susan,"oh,sure.oh,that's a little tight.does it have to be that tight?"
15305,Susan,"oh.okay. ow,ow. that's actually starting to be painful."
17350,Susan,get them out of here now.
15311,Susan,"ow,nurse hisel!ugh! nurse--oh!"
17360,Susan,"random chitchat, nothing specific."
15313,Susan,"yes. okay.i am married,but it's only because my insurance ran out.my ex-husband has a really good coverage plan,so he said that he would remarry me so i could get my operation.only i didn't wanna tell dr. ron 'cause i didn't want him to be an accomplice to fraud."
15314,Susan,"yeah. it--yes,i am."
17362,Susan,"oh, my god. oh, my god! i'm so proud of you! okay, i am going to need a bumper sticker right away so i can start annoying all the other parents!"
17363,Susan,tuesday? what are you talking about?
17372,Susan,"hey, katherine, are you all right?"
15329,Susan,okay.bye.
15330,Susan,super-duper.how you feeling?
15331,Susan,"aw,thank you.i love mike."
17378,Susan,"yes, in the fall. and i needed those extra three months to get ready. i--i still have not figured out how i'm gonna get by without you."
15334,Susan,"aw, thank you."
17382,Susan,thanks. now i want you to have that phone on you at all times--because i'm still not sure how to work the dishwasher.
17383,Susan,"my god! bree,are you all right?"
15337,Susan,why do you ask?
17387,Susan,honey? i'm home. did you miss me?
15343,Susan,only in the legal sense.and i just didn't tell you because i wanted to protect you.
15348,Susan,"um, we'll just be a second.just wheel me.be right back."
17396,Susan,i'm back. you want something cold?
15356,Susan,"yeah,well,believe me,behind all the laughs,there's still plenty of bitterness and resentment."
17407,Susan,not here. go home. i'll call you.
15360,Susan,yeah.
17411,Susan,"no, of course not. my friends would love you."
17412,Susan,"the problem is, if you meet my friends, then we're in a relationship, and i can't be in a relationship right now."
17413,Susan,"well, maybe i don't deserve to be happy. a few years ago--there was this car accident--a bad one."
13318,Susan,"no, i said, really? and what do most women lead, lives of noisy fulfillment?"
13320,Susan,"i don't know. i'm sorry you guys, i just-- i just don't know how i'm going to survive this."
15369,Susan,i take it you met mike.
13323,Susan,"gabby, the woman killed herself. something must've been going on."
17419,Susan,i meant a mechanic--not you.
15374,Susan,"okay,mike,just--it's okay.just go home."
17423,Susan,hey. did you pack your dinosaur book so you can read it with your daddy?
13328,Susan,yeah i'm very big with the under 5 set. what do you do?
13330,Susan,i can't believe you went over there.
17426,Susan,"well, i've sort of start seeing someone. so i might do something with him."
15380,Susan,"well,he wasn't!and nowmy boyfriend is gone.thank you very much."
17427,Susan,fine.
17433,Susan,"oh, i don't know that that's necessary."
15386,Susan,oh?i need to take this.
17434,Susan,"oh, well, first off, um, m.j. was at a sleep over last night. and, in fact, jackson and he haven't even met, so, uh, there's really no need for you to be hanging--or checking."
17435,Susan,"hey, hold on. you don't get to just decide these things by yourself."
13341,Susan,oh god.
17437,Susan,i'll explain over breakfast. did you get the paper?
15391,Susan,try the cheese.that's the best part.
15392,Susan,yeah-- congratulations.what happened to waiting six months?
13347,Susan,and you're a plumber. right?
15396,Susan,"oh,wait! why don't you let me walk with you?"
13353,Susan,"uh, oh god. that's him. how am i gonna stuff up the sink--"
15403,Susan,"oh,cool. but that's not the surprise."
17451,Susan,yeah. mmm. you've never done that before. wait. you've never done that before. why are you doing that now?
13357,Susan,oh.
15406,Susan,edie is gonna marry you tomorrow.
13361,Susan,edie? hello..?
15410,Susan,you're gonna make me take the hit?
13365,Susan,i'm fine. i'm fine. i just feel really bad for edie.
17461,Susan,where is he?
15416,Susan,hi. what's going on?
13371,Susan,what does this mean?
13372,Susan,"oh mary alice, what did you do?"
15419,Susan,"at this point,i'd like to point out that,uh,it was karl who proposed."
15421,Susan,"no. no,of course not.and anything i can do to help--uh,you know,i would--i could help with the engagement party.how's that?"
13375,Susan,i think we should give it to paul.
17467,Susan,"well, i was pretty ticked off that you told jackson about the ear thing."
17470,Susan,i'm just not comfortable with you and jackson getting that close.
17471,Susan,it's just--i don't want him to see me through your eyes.
15427,Susan,what's this?
15428,Susan,"yeah?okay,then,repeat after me.""our marriage is fake,""and i'm going to marry the woman i really love--edie britt."""
17472,Susan,"well, those last few months we were together, i--the things i said to you, the way i acted--i mean, i'm not proud of the person i became."
15430,Susan,why are you hanging on to that?
13383,Susan,"hm. uh, well it's gotta be here somewhere. just keep looking."
17475,Susan,what are you doing here?
13385,Susan,"i didn't realize anyone was gonna be out here, i just sorta rolled outta bed."
15434,Susan,karl!
15435,Susan,whoa!
17489,Susan,that's not just any girl. you saw her. she could take down a small deer.
13394,Susan,"bye, bongo."
17490,Susan,"that is sexi. if feminism means anything, it's that it's okay for a big, mean girl to get her butt kicked. you, teach him one of those brazilian kung fu cha-cha things."
15445,Susan,"oh,no!no,don't you dare!"
13398,Susan,"oh yeah, i love my steak."
15447,Susan,so how you holding up?you must be exhausted.
13400,Susan,"oh, it's sort of a new tradition."
15448,Susan,"well,you guys are busy.we should go."
15450,Susan,what?
17498,Susan,you know what? maybe you could teach your daughter how to use her words and not her fists.
15453,Susan,you're gonna make me go by myself?
13406,Susan,i thought that was a look she was going for.
17501,Susan,"juanita solis, don't you move! you are in big trouble!"
17503,Susan,so your solution was to push him down? do you think that's nice? how would you feel if someone did that to you?
15457,Susan,thank you so much for helping me out.
17507,Susan,i barely tapped her. she was milking it.
13413,Susan,sorry if i upset you.
17512,Susan,i brought booze.
15467,Susan,"that's why you brought me down here?karl,you made it sound like it was an emergency."
17516,Susan,"well, we split up, so it's at least half my fault any way you slice it."
13421,Susan,"oh. okay. sure is beautiful, isn't it?"
15472,Susan,"okay,you want the truth?i don't knowhow i feel about you,but i keep looking at you,trying to see if you've changed,if you've grown up.you know what i see?i see the same weak coward that walked out on me three years ago."
17521,Susan,this is nice. we should rumble all the time.
13426,Susan,"uh, yes, yes he was."
17522,Susan,to gabrielle solis--another good mom.
17525,Susan,"well, did you tell me to take off the lens cap? next time, be more specific."
13430,Susan,"ooh, we just got off on the wrong foot, we're really best buddies now. oh, what a good boy! bongo, are you okay?"
15479,Susan,"now i wish i hadn't torched our wedding photos.who would've thought, after everything that's happened,that we would've ended up back here again?"
15480,Susan,yeah.
15481,Susan,about us?i feel good.i feel happy.
13436,Susan,"oh, that's great."
13437,Susan,"uh, i'm gonna say no."
17533,Susan,mike! what's going on?
15488,Susan,"get out of my house,you miserable son of a bitch!"
17538,Susan,hello?
17539,Susan,great. he's so excited to learn. are you sure he's ready to go without training wheels?
17543,Susan,yeah. you know what i learned? mike is on his way over here to teach his son how to ride the bike he bought--something he was looking forward to until you ruined it.
15499,Susan,"yes, like you wouldn't believe."
17547,Susan,"come on, m.j. your daddy's waiting."
15504,Susan,"which--obviously i don't know,because how would i know?"
15505,Susan,"she's a slutty, slutty whore.absolutely."
15506,Susan,"and this one,i ran out and got the day i found out karl was doing it with his secretary.i think you'll find this particularly helpful.it's got a chapter called,""revenge: you're only hurting yourself."""
15507,Susan,"oh.well, um, why don't we get you out of here?let's go see a feel-good movie."
17552,Susan,what are you doing? we talked about this. you're supposed to be new at it.
17554,Susan,boy--he was just telling me how glad he is to have his dad here.
17555,Susan,"oh, that's just silly."
17556,Susan,"whoops-a-daisy! oh, it's a good thing your dad's here to teach you how to do it right."
17560,Susan,"remember, it's the pavement you're mad at."
15513,Susan,oh.
15514,Susan,yeah.
13467,Susan,"no, but god, you should've seen the look on his face."
17566,Susan,i've never seen bree so happy. she's glowing.
15522,Susan,"okay,stop that."
13476,Susan,an apology. for the way you ended our marriage. you never took any responsibility for your behaviour.
17572,Susan,"it's a little weird. i--i but, you know, m.j. will be thrilled, and--yeah, i'm fine with it."
13479,Susan,"yeah, well, my heart wants to hurt you, but i can control myself."
13480,Susan,you know what? i don't need an apology. i don't need anything from you.
15529,Susan,"okay,um--first of all,it was not the best sex i ever had.i just said that to make him feel better.obviously,you were the best sex i ever had."
15531,Susan,"no,no,no!no,karl lied to me.he told me that he and edie had split up before--"
13484,Susan,it's a date.
13485,Susan,"yeah, it's-it's casual."
13486,Susan,thanks for helping me break in. do you think it's gonna be hard to replace that screen?
15532,Susan,mike--
17584,Susan,"oh, please. telling me i smell good? i'm not even wearing deodorant."
13489,Susan,"hey, are you okay?"
17585,Susan,"semantics. and then the not so subtle sit-on-the-bed maneuver? you know, why not just ask for a massage?"
13492,Susan,today. right before the party.
13493,Susan,what? when was this?
17588,Susan,you know what? we need a minute.
17590,Susan,"once we sign these papers, there's no going back."
17591,Susan,i know. i'm thinking--that maybe that was a mistake.
17593,Susan,"oh, come on! we were mike and susan, remember? you only get one of those in a lifetime. we could make things right again."
17594,Susan,uh-- it--it looks good.
17595,Susan,thanks. do you like scotch?
13500,Susan,just a sec.
15550,Susan,gus!
15551,Susan,uh.
13504,Susan,thank you.
17599,Susan,"i don't want a relationship either. all i want from you is exactly what we just did. except next time, it's susan."
17604,Susan,what's wrong with the way things are? why change everything now?
17605,Susan,"hi, guys. welcome to the party."
15558,Susan,"all right,you go ahead and be coy. fine.i'll be the one to break the ice.i've never stopped caring about you."
13511,Susan,you've got to be kidding me! she washed her car yesterday.
15561,Susan,my whole house is-- on fire!
17609,Susan,it means that someone forgot that we had an agreement to keep things casual.
15566,Susan,"no. no, it isn't.so when am i gonna get the check?'cause i have a lot of rebuilding to do.i need to get started."
15567,Susan,arson?
15568,Susan,who would wanna burn down my house?
13521,Susan,"well, i guess i've done my good deed for the day."
15571,Susan,"this is a little awkward,and i apologize in advance for how this is gonna sound,but um--by any chance,did-- you burn down my house?"
15572,Susan,what?
13525,Susan,"oh, wow. why?"
15573,Susan,edie!why would you do that?!
15577,Susan,"a tad?edie, i have no roof!you can't just go around burning down people's homes."
15578,Susan,"that's it.i'm going to the police,and i'm telling them what you did."
13531,Susan,"um, sure. as a friend."
17628,Susan,"you met the guy in night, then you're in a shower. i'm just doing the math."
13534,Susan,"mrs huber, with all due respect, you're crazy."
15583,Susan,mm.
13537,Susan,mrs huber .
17636,Susan,"wow--we really messed this up, didn't we?"
17638,Susan,hello?
15592,Susan,hey.cleaning up after the big party?
13545,Susan,ring it up.
13546,Susan,"we talked to paul, told him we need to show him something."
13550,Susan,"paul, are you going to be alright?"
15598,Susan,why not?
17647,Susan,mm.
15603,Susan,"okay, wait.could you just swallow?'cause i couldn't really--what you were saying--"
15604,Susan,"well, see, you were chewing,and so i didn't really hear what you said.could you just say it again?"
17651,Susan,i want us to spend this time really getting to know each other.
17654,Susan,"although some days it's ""larva"" or ""chunks."""
13561,Susan,"there she goes. okay, move."
17657,Susan,seriously?
17658,Susan,wow. so now you're painting--my bathroom?
13564,Susan,oh my! whoops!
15612,Susan,"okay, first, let me say,i'm really sorry about the yellow jackets.and-- also, no matter how mad i am about what you did,i don't want to see you go to prison.so i came with a solution.why don't you just come forward and tell the police that you saw some vagrant lurking by my garage with a can of gasoline?and if you do that,then i'll destroy the tape.and then the insurance company will pay the claim.nobody gets hurt.does that sound good?"
17661,Susan,"and so there i was in ninth grade, and my boobs had not made an appearance. i was desperate."
13568,Susan,"no! no, no, no. julie's got it."
13570,Susan,"no. no, no, not at all."
17669,Susan,right! what time is it?
15622,Susan,you know what would be nice?why don't you just stop over for coffee sometime?
13576,Susan,edie wait! um-mike and i were gonna go see the movies on wednesday-and i just thought it would be fun if you joined us.
17675,Susan,"hi. i am declaring this our official fourth date, okay? the rules have been followed, and you may begin disrobing--now."
17680,Susan,that's me.
13585,Susan,he actually said mary alice was crazy?
15633,Susan,"oh, she is and we're gonna be so happy here. look at your new home."
17683,Susan,really?
17684,Susan,oh. come on. i think you know the answer to that.
17692,Susan,before that.
17694,Susan,that's the one. so you've been married three times?
13599,Susan,i thought we were too. but he's been giving a lot of mixed signals.
15647,Susan,so i can't believe you caught me spraying for ants. i must look like a wreck.
13601,Susan,it's a shame. they used to be such a happy family.
17697,Susan,it counts.
13604,Susan,"whoops,sorry."
17700,Susan,"well, that's true."
13606,Susan,yeah.sort of.
15654,Susan,"it's temporary, and if you don't mind, i'm having coffee."
13611,Susan,"okay, fine i'll go out with you."
13616,Susan,so you member that cop from the neighbourhood watch meeting ? he agreed to run a fingerprint check on the screwdriver i found at mrs fome's house.
13618,Susan,and i sort of said yes. i was sort of curious what you thought about that.
13619,Susan,"no.no. i just uh, was wondering your opinion."
17714,Susan,i'm--just movin' to the music.
15670,Susan,you bought me a ring?
15671,Susan,"uh, mike, about that ring--"
17720,Susan,"hey, i believe in marriage."
13627,Susan,"aw,maybe it's my fault. maybe i just imagined an entire relationship with this man that didn't exist."
15677,Susan,"oh, oh, you know, you should, um, call my friend orson.he's a dentist.i'm sure he'll see you right away."
17726,Susan,jackson--he's still in there. he's in the bathroom.
15680,Susan,"he's karl.he's playing me. but that house is gonna be a great place for my daughter to live.and when he makes his move, he's gonna realize that i was really playing him.so-- about that ring--"
13635,Susan,"how tragic! by which i mean, yay?"
17732,Susan,"uh, he's fine, just getting some stitches. oh. how's--wait, who are you here to see?"
17733,Susan,"oh. crap! i didn't get anyone gifts. but i did give blood, so i'll just remind everybody that i did that."
13639,Susan,"hey,i thought this went to the lab."
17735,Susan,"oh, fine. he just needs some stitches. ooh, those cookies look delicious. where'd you get them?"
17740,Susan,when i'm done. don't change the subject. are you seeing someone?
17742,Susan,why not?
13647,Susan,right!okay. thank you.
15698,Susan,so you got the results of his latest mri yet?
17749,Susan,gaby thinks that carlos isn't gonna find her attractive after he gets his sight back.
13656,Susan,i'm not mad at you. i mean i'm not just mad at you-i'm mostly mad at myself.
15711,Susan,let me see.oh.
17761,Susan,"yes, i am. you're perfectly right."
13668,Susan,"great. speaking of zach, i haven't seen him around lately."
17767,Susan,why didn't you tell me?
15720,Susan,"all right.well, i am really hungry."
15722,Susan,"hi.um.so i need to ask you something. ian, you know, from across the hall.you met him.anyway, he sort of asked me out on a date.i know you're thrown, i was thrown too.but he's really nice and i could sort of use someone to talk to, who also talks back.the thing is i'm sort of lonely.the past six months have been really hard on me.so what i need is, i need to know if it okay with you if i go out with him.because if it's not, i won't.in fact i'd like nothing better than for you to just wake up right now and tell me not to go out with him.just wake up and tell me!wake up! please!"
13675,Susan,"oh, forget about it, it's not that important, but since i'm here, do you still have that old hatchback sitting in your garage? can i borrow it tomorrow?"
15725,Susan,bree?
13679,Susan,"it's going, finally. we have our first official date next week. i think he's taking me to see a play or something."
13680,Susan,"oh, that's right, the twins-stage debut!"
17775,Susan,he's dating a friend of mine.
13685,Susan,i checked upon this silvercrest place. it's a treatment center for troubled kids. who's gonna notice one more? i create the distraction. you blend in and find zach.
17782,Susan,you're home kind of early. is everything okay?
13687,Susan,"okay, fine, if you don't want to help me, i'm not going to force you."
13688,Susan,"because mary alice was a wonderful person, and now all anybody thinks about her is that she went off the deep end and did this terrible selfish thing, and i think there is more to it than that. she was my friend, julie, and i owe it to her to find out the truth."
15735,Susan,these dresses are hideous.
15738,Susan,oh my god!
15739,Susan,"oh, well, it's been a long time since i've been in a mood to, thank you."
15740,Susan,did i squeeze too hard?
17788,Susan,"i mean, i could see her on the cover of ""menopause monthly."""
13694,Susan,"honey, it's up to his father."
13695,Susan,i don't think that's a good idea either.
15742,Susan,susan mayer.
17793,Susan,who did you sell the ball to?
15746,Susan,"oh, good. um, i'm, um, well, then let's get technical."
15747,Susan,"uh, well, i, it just, wow. i hear my phone vibrating. i'm sorry, duty calls."
13700,Susan,i figure dana has something to do with what mary alice was trying to hide.
17796,Susan,"hey, katherine. what a cute top."
17797,Susan,"by the way, uh, i don't think you're gonna have any problem. i had a little talk with m.j."
15753,Susan,"well, if we can't be friends than i guess we'll be nothing."
13706,Susan,"hey, edie!"
13707,Susan,"oh this?"" ""well, i have a date. right now. with mike. we kissed. fyi."
15756,Susan,"well, what makes you so sure? do you have any proof?"
13709,Susan,susan.
17801,Susan,"what do you mean, the way i act?"
15760,Susan,so when i left the bank i called the detective that worked the case and he said that the only reason orson was never charged was because they never found a body.
15762,Susan,"well, you know what we have to do."
17811,Susan,i didn't even think he'd remembered it.
13722,Susan,so friends can do that.
17819,Susan,thank you. can i go clubbing with you tonight?
13724,Susan,i don't know why i let you talk me into coming here. there is obviously nothing going on between them.
17821,Susan,"yes, that's fine. gays love me."
15775,Susan,i can't 'cause i have bridesmaid stuff.
13732,Susan,"what? no, no, i just came here, you know, with edie. we, just, love to ride that bull."
13733,Susan,"yeah, yeah, it's a real rush."
15783,Susan,yeah.and i think i have yours.
15785,Susan,me too.
13738,Susan,"everybody's looking at me, aren't they?"
15786,Susan,great piano. do you play?
13740,Susan,"absolutely. oh. ow! ow, ow."
15788,Susan,"so-- brandy, a roaring fire, what could be more romantic?"
13742,Susan,"me, too."
17838,Susan,"just a friend. oh, gaby, do you think i did this subconsciously just to sabotage my relationship with jackson?"
17840,Susan,my mechanic? are you crazy?
15793,Susan,"oh, yeah. but, i mean, you kissed other girls before that, right?"
17842,Susan,"yes. uh, we had a very nice, uneventful evening. why? what did he say? 'cause he was pretty drunk, so he was--probably making stuff up."
17843,Susan,never mind her. she was just leaving.
17845,Susan,lee wouldn't do that. he loves you.
17846,Susan,"lee, um--well, there's just no graceful way to ask this, so--i'm just gonna say it straight out. when you spent the night, did we get it on?"
15799,Susan,"it's not that it's rude. it's just immaterial. i mean, it's just a number. it doesn't mean anything."
17847,Susan,oh! so--nothing happened between us?
15805,Susan,"what is this, the gallup poll?!"
13758,Susan,"hey, bongo, come here. you want a treat? hey, mike, where do you keep the dog biscuits?"
13760,Susan,nothing. it's not important.
13761,Susan,i could let him in.
13762,Susan,"no, it's fine, just give me the key. i'll be around all day."
17856,Susan,but you are fun to dance with.
13764,Susan,"well, what? realistically, i've known this guy a few weeks. i mean, he could be a hit man for the mob!"
17857,Susan,so he was married before. you don't kick a man out for that.
17859,Susan,"jackson got a teaching job at the college in riverton, and--i'm going with him."
17862,Susan,edie? edie! do you not hear me?
13768,Susan,i don't know.
15817,Susan,what could be more romantic?
15818,Susan,are you sure it's okay if we stay another day?
17868,Susan,no. help! get me out of here!
15821,Susan,"okay, here's one--julie needs to spend more time bonding with her father."
13775,Susan,"bongo? oh, oh! don't do that! bongo!"
17873,Susan,of course i have.
17874,Susan,i don't know. i'm not sure. what are you doing?
13779,Susan,mike? i'm upstairs. sorta.
13782,Susan,"thank you, oh, you have no idea what that was like--"
15830,Susan,"well, okay. you gotta promise me we'll actually leave the hotel room."
17882,Susan,my grades sucked?
15839,Susan,mike is awake! he's lying there and he's wondering where i am.
15843,Susan,"how could you possibly know what i was feeling? for six months, i have prayed every day for that man to wake up, and you made me give up on him."
13799,Susan,"that's just not true. when, when julie was a baby, i, i was out of my mind almost every day."
15848,Susan,"oh, god! it's so wonderful to hear your voice again."
17900,Susan,"good-bye, edie."
17902,Susan,"jackson, hi. do you have a sec?"
15855,Susan,okay.
13808,Susan,"julie, what's going on?"
13809,Susan,"no, it's just when i was your age, my pen pal lived on a farm in ohio, not in a mental institution. you know, that letter is one notch above prison mail."
15857,Susan,"well, you know, let me set the scene. um, we were at this funky little fish joint that you'd been dying to take me to--cappy's. do you remember cappy's? okay, well, we were there, and, uh, we were just wolfing down the most delicious trout ever--"
17903,Susan,"uh, no, nothing's wrong. just--we need to talk about this move."
17905,Susan,i wonder how many people are gonna show up. mrs. mccluskey was saying he didn't have much family.
15861,Susan,"oh, mike. come on, you're not even trying to remember! it was fun! oh, i know. okay, sing with me. car wash, talkin' about the car wash. whoo, car wash, yeah."
17910,Susan,we're getting a wreath for eli's funeral. are you in?
17913,Susan,all right.
17917,Susan,"oh, thanks, but don't be. just hurry. karl said he was coming by to get some of his stuff, and i want this place to be a fortress by then."
13824,Susan,sorry i'm late.
17920,Susan,brandy's not a redhead. she's blonde.
15876,Susan,"julie, there you are. i think i found a way to get through to mike."
15877,Susan,shh! i thought you could use some fresh air.
13830,Susan,"oh! ow! for god's sake, helen, this is for charity!"
15878,Susan,"oh, this is hank, and he has very kindly offered to take us on a little field trip today for bucks an hour."
13833,Susan,"okay, you want me to talk? you're going to find helen rowland, and you're going to tell her the truth, before everyone in this neighborhood thinks that i'm the one sleeping with an underage boy."
17931,Susan,what?
15886,Susan,"i'm good. finally, a smile."
17935,Susan,great. i will go to the store right now and get some wine so we can toast your retirement.
17936,Susan,okay. what kind do you like-- red or white?
13842,Susan,"if we hear anything, i will let you know right away. i understand how worried you must be."
13847,Susan,"oh great, our romantic weekend is off."
13850,Susan,"okay. i know this sounds weird, but i just need to have my things around me."
17953,Susan,"yeah, well, if we were still married, you'd--probably would've waited until i finished my sentence."
15907,Susan,whatcha doing?
17955,Susan,"uh, what am i looking at exactly?"
15909,Susan,"oh, you know, what the hell? she's sixteen.if she hasn't figured out how to feed herself by now, i've failed."
17956,Susan,"oh, those. oh, they're stunning."
13868,Susan,"listen, if paul sees zach and freaks out--"
15917,Susan,"but, you know, with ian, everything was always easy. you know, that's the kind of guy i could see myself living into my nineties with."
15918,Susan,i'm ida greenberg!
13871,Susan,here's the candles i borrowed. thanks.
17964,Susan,mike said he can't afford to pay for m.j.'s private school. now i know why. he wants to see his girlfriend wearing pearls when she flashes him.
15921,Susan,"oh, i don't think that's a good idea, 'cause i, i didn't really bring my a game. is it hot?"
17966,Susan,"well, he did."
17967,Susan,"damn right, ""oh"".what happened to ""i'm broke and can't afford to send m.j. to private school""?"
13876,Susan,"yeah, but--"
13877,Susan,i was in bad shape back then.
17969,Susan,what?
13879,Susan,thanks for your help with zach before.
13880,Susan,yeah.
17971,Susan,"okay, okay. point made. move along."
17973,Susan,"okay, maybe i jumped to conclusions, but this school is important for m.j.. i feel really bad that we're falling short."
13883,Susan,"and i still kinda do it. i just want somebody to talk to about all my adult stuff, and she's right there, and she just acts so mature, i forget she's thirteen."
17978,Susan,i'll take it.
13885,Susan,what if i want to talk about the big crush i have on the plumber that lives across the street?
17979,Susan,congratulations on getting me out of your office.
17984,Susan,"you're a plumber. ms. nelson is not expecting you on time. in fact, if you show up before dinner, she'll turn cartwheels. i'm a teacher. it's different."
15937,Susan,edie's nephew? since when are you friends with him?
13890,Susan,has anybody talked to bree? how's rex doing?
17987,Susan,"oh, i know, honey. but mommy has a job now. come on. we talked about this. you understand, right? don't be sad. i am gonna pick you both up at 6:00."
13895,Susan,for you? of course it is.
13897,Susan,"well, please. just come on in. uh, mike, i don't think you've officially met my ex, karl mayer."
13898,Susan,"yeah, he is. so what do you want me to sign? oh, i see."
17994,Susan,"really? i thought we were using katherine for all sorts of things--sending messages, raising our kid."
13901,Susan,give my best to brandi.
17998,Susan,"no, she's a peach, but she's not the one that dragged me to court to hammer out some custody agreement. now if you'd like, we can go back, and the judge can explain to you the difference between you and your girlfriend."
13903,Susan,"no, no really, i'm, i'm sorry you had to go through that. i am."
13905,Susan,"uh, try ripping up old photos. it helps."
15954,Susan,"hello, carolyn."
18002,Susan,"no, thank you. let's go."
13909,Susan,"okay, now i'm good."
13913,Susan,"you're not mad, are you?"
18010,Susan,"hey, sweetie. how was your sandwich? m.j.?"
13916,Susan,big insight. the postman knows that.
18012,Susan,"m.j., go wait outside on the porch. i need to talk to katherine. you can take the sandwich."
13919,Susan,"okay, the analysis part of this evening is now over."
13921,Susan,"actually, you're coming to the party tomorrow. and that's the end of it."
18017,Susan,"well, that's the way it's gonna be, whether you like it or not."
18023,Susan,why would we do that?
18024,Susan,"well, yes, i was upset at first. but, you know, mike was gonna be with someone eventually, and i consider myself lucky that it was someone, who, after all is said and done, has always been my true friend."
15977,Susan,they don't?
13931,Susan,i don't think so.
18028,Susan,"that ""football guy"" is peyton manning. you would do well to learn that name. oh. wow."
13934,Susan,"new york, new york."
13936,Susan,i think i'll take my chances--sort of like you did--on those high notes.
13938,Susan,"thanks for your concern, karl, i'm fine."
13941,Susan,"you're an ass, you know that?"
13942,Susan,top of the heap--
13943,Susan,"karl, don't you turn away from me. look at me! you know, what else were you doing during our marriage? how many other women were you sticking it to? as god as my witness, it will snow on the hills of hell, before i ever feel sorry for you again!"
18038,Susan,"all right, you guys think what you want. i'm gonna choose to believe her."
13945,Susan,"oh, well, in that case, come on in. i'm not doing anything."
15994,Susan,"oh, my god. you don't--"
13947,Susan,what?
18039,Susan,"uh, look at what i found-- my beach painting."
18041,Susan,i don't know. she seemed to love the painting--until i told her that i painted it.
13950,Susan,news flash! i hated all of that!
18043,Susan,i didn't. i didn't.
18047,Susan,no.
18053,Susan,"no, we've already covered you."
16006,Susan,i don't know! it's complicated.
13959,Susan,yes!
18055,Susan,"well, we don't know that for sure. i could have misplaced it."
13961,Susan,"well, i just called to say hi, and i love you!"
16009,Susan,"exactly. thank you. wait, no, that does not apply to you."
13963,Susan,i absolutely did not do that thing you accused me of.
16013,Susan,sixteen years of being perfect. you were due.
18061,Susan,"oh, right. that's not till later this year."
13967,Susan,you did? what'd you talk about?
16018,Susan,"oh, thank god! we were all so worried we were losing you. okay, now i'm hugging you. oh, it's amazing. your life is such an adventure. can't wait to see what you do next."
16019,Susan,i'm just saying that we never spend the night at your house.
18066,Susan,"oh, well, you know, i just think that school is such a formal environment, and i thought it would be nice if we could let loose and drink a little wine, get to know each other. oh, my gosh."
13973,Susan,"that's smart, that, that's good."
18068,Susan,"oh, please. i didn't even get a chance to change. my ex was late picking up m.j., which is insane, 'cause he lives right across the street."
16023,Susan,who are you?
16027,Susan,"well, of course."
16028,Susan,is the coast clear? i don't wanna flash the help again.
18076,Susan,"okay, i'm probably just blowing this out of proportion. i mean, she never even said anything about being gay."
13982,Susan,"okay, here's the deal, edie. i, i -"
16030,Susan,"so you're that close, and you never told him about me?"
16032,Susan,"oh, no, don't do that. that'll just make it worse. i get it. he loved jane. he doesn't know me. you know, i'll just have to charm him, warm him up a little."
13985,Susan,my junior year. how'd you know?
16033,Susan,"great. nine o'clock in the morning, and i have to put on a slinky, black cocktail dress. hey, here's an idea. you keep some things in a drawer at my house. would it be okay if i had one here?"
16034,Susan,"your shower has six power nozzles. with or without you, i'll be back."
16035,Susan,i don't need much. one of those will do.
13990,Susan,"you know, for what it's worth, i would have talked to you in high school."
13992,Susan,"so, what are you waiting for?"
18089,Susan,"okay, class, let's see how our animals of africa drawings are going. oh, emma, this is beautiful. emma drew a gazelle. isn't she pretty? zachary, is that a rhinoceros? he looks so big and strong. i love rhinos."
16044,Susan,did you consider removing the body?
18092,Susan,no. and--as on the softball team.
13999,Susan,"oh, please don't do this."
16048,Susan,i am ian's girlfriend.
16049,Susan,"okay, you are not allowed to call me that."
14002,Susan,"edie, please talk to me."
16050,Susan,"i'm so sorry. i'm, i shouldn't have done that. but, rupert, you have to admit, it's just a drawer."
14004,Susan,"well, whatever you want to do, edie, just know that i'm sorry."
16051,Susan,"okay, you know, that is for ian to decide."
16053,Susan,jane has some beautiful things.
18099,Susan,"well, here's how. um, i--i've spent my whole life putting myself out there, and, um, i'm still--today, alone."
18100,Susan,"well, okay, it's not, because i'm alone but i'm not lonely 'cause i have friends. love doesn't happen for everyone. you know what? i don't even know if it's gonna happen for me anymore. but my friends are there for me no matter what, and that helps. so at the very least, you know, let me be there for you--as a friend."
14010,Susan,"oh, you don't have to. well, this is good. thank you. i guess i should go take a shower and wash mrs. huber off of me."
16059,Susan,"no, not just yet."
16060,Susan,"ian, you don't have to do that."
18108,Susan,"listen, it's bad enough that i've got one ex-husband running around the halls. i don't need the faculty and the parents knowing that i have two. so not a word about us having been married. no more wisecracks. no susie q's. i am miss susan, art teacher."
16062,Susan,your parents? really?
18109,Susan,"karl, i'm serious. don't mess with me. i have a yardstick, and i'm not afraid to use it."
18113,Susan,"no, honey, it's inappropriate, especially when the assignment was to make a picture that makes you happy."
14019,Susan,"oh, no he's not."
18122,Susan,"amy, that is very sweet. i love the colors you used. oh, danielle, that is just beautiful. evan, that is very pretty. you did the assignment just like i asked. good job!"
16077,Susan,"his wife goes missing, then his mistress turns up dead. what is there to think about?"
14031,Susan,"well, not too much. julie, you know you can tell me anything, right?"
18127,Susan,so she just left?
16081,Susan,what?!
16082,Susan,is edie getting you a good lawyer?
18128,Susan,why?
14037,Susan,paul.
18135,Susan,"the woman is dead, people. let's honor her memory."
16089,Susan,"there's an explanation for this, and we're gonna figure it out. don't worry about a thing."
16090,Susan,come in.
18137,Susan,"no, it's okay. it landed on the detergent box."
18142,Susan,how about coffee? i just put on a pot.
18144,Susan,wait. stop. could we just rest for a second?
16097,Susan,"you are the only one allowed to ravish me these days, so stop worrying."
14052,Susan,what's that?
16101,Susan,what are you saying? you think mike is guilty?
16102,Susan,her teeth were pulled. you don't think that's worth telling the cops she was messing around with a dentist?
14055,Susan,really.
18149,Susan,yeah?
16105,Susan,"i don't know. a blackmail letter, a necklace made of teeth?"
18151,Susan,ed is married.
16107,Susan,fine. i'll cook myself.
16108,Susan,"and if you take orson back, you do the same."
14062,Susan,i wish i could. i still feel like something's not right.
16112,Susan,"uh, bree and i sort of had a fight. look, i'm awfully sorry that i'm late. i had an emergency."
18160,Susan,"oh, i get it. so you feel i judged you, and for revenge, you're trying to make me insecure about my marriage."
16114,Susan,"no, i found evidence. look. orson was committed to a mental institution for over a year. i mean, doesn't that suggest- he's some sort of--"
14067,Susan,so we still on for tomorrow night?
16118,Susan,why?
16119,Susan,"as jealous ultimatums go, that's very flattering, but, i don't think that's necessary. mike and i are done."
18166,Susan,"three weeks later, i found brandi's bra in karl's glove compartment, and, well, you know the rest."
16123,Susan,bree let orson move back in.
18171,Susan,"bree, how did you know where she lived?"
18173,Susan,you really think she spent a lot of time thinking about her death?
18174,Susan,"what do you mean, you two were the hottest chic?"
14079,Susan,"oh yeah, this dress is just riding up as it is. if i walk any faster it'll be happy valentine's day for everyone."
16128,Susan,i'm out of lipstick. can i borrow yours?
18182,Susan,just one word. this is hard.
14092,Susan,"ah, please. i'm just glad you're okay. so, you shot yourself?"
18191,Susan,in the kitchen.
18193,Susan,sometimes it's the stove's fault.
16147,Susan,"bree, i am so relieved."
18195,Susan,at you? why?
18197,Susan,i know what you meant. i'll stop by tomorrow and see him.
18198,Susan,"you know, this whole thing with edie--i mean, seeing her lying in the street that night--oh, it just brought up all those awful memories from our accident."
14104,Susan,"he was embarrassed. he said it was an accident. oh, don't look at me like that. accidents happen."
16163,Susan,"okay, bree, i know you're angry, but for the sake of our friendship--"
14116,Susan,yeah.
16164,Susan,"ian, please, i just lost one of my best friends. i can't lose you, too."
16165,Susan,but you had to know that i would go one more time to just explain everything.
18212,Susan,"i'll call in sick, take the day off."
18217,Susan,"oh, okay. uh, what did i do?"
16170,Susan,"well, i'm saying it now.i love you. do you have a problem with that? no, ma'am."
16171,Susan,you--you--you can't kiss me now. i'm yelling at you.
18219,Susan,"uh, what? you don't want the license?"
18220,Susan,"oh! you think that i'm dangerous. no, i totally have an explanation for those."
18222,Susan,okay.
14127,Susan,sure. when?
14128,Susan,okay.
16175,Susan,"oh! i found it. austin, i would like to talk to my daughter privately."
18223,Susan,"oh, yes, sir!"
18227,Susan,"oh, dave--that does not make it your fault."
18228,Susan,"you can't think that way. i mean, what happened is bad enough. y-- you can't blame yourself for it, too. if you do that, you will destroy everything you have left that's good. trust me. i know."
14134,Susan,"um, am i supposed to talk into the camera?"
18232,Susan,"karl, what are you doing here?"
16185,Susan,"you can't say ""ooh-kay"" like that, either. julie's not like other girls. she's a straight-""a"" student."
16188,Susan,"uh, it's small. it's got a plaid cover. oh, and when you find it, you have to read it because i promised her that i would always respect her privacy. now help me flip this mattress."
18237,Susan,"the wife hired the sleaziest, most unethical divorce lawyer in town."
14143,Susan,"no, he didn't. he was with me and mike wouldn't kill anybody. i'm sure of that."
16191,Susan,to watch movies.
16193,Susan,"is this dr. marvin tashman? hi. my name is susan mayer. um, my daughter julie came in to see you--yes, about birth control. so i'm just curious--where do you get off prescribing that without my consent?! what?! no, i most certainly was not there. what do i look like? i don't have blonde hair."
16194,Susan,"wait, did my blonde hair have dark roots?"
18240,Susan,"oh, not with karl. by the time he's done finding loopholes and hiding assets, there's nothing left to split."
18243,Susan,is it working?
18245,Susan,"jackson, hey. you're back."
18246,Susan,why didn't you call?
18253,Susan,"i've only been working there two months, but i love it. and the kids are so cute. and i get to see m.j. during the day, which is nice. uh, you know, uh, for a guy that just had to see me so bad, you--you seem awfully far away."
16208,Susan,pleading guilty? what kind of a strategy is that?
18257,Susan,"oh, i'm sorry. just, um, all these months, i've been telling myself that i didn't really care about you, which was easy to do because you left so suddenly. but i am so lonely. and as much as i tell myself that i like being the strong, single woman on her own, the truth is, i think about you all the time. and i wanted to call you, but i thought you'd gotten over me. and to hear that you still love me--that is just something that i really needed to hear right now. and i want you to know--oh, god. i want you to know i love you, too. jackson--i love you. jackson?"
14162,Susan,there's your father. go have fun.
16210,Susan,"with a better lawyer,he could be out in zero.we need to find a lawyer who believes that he's innocent."
14164,Susan,who is it?
16211,Susan,my feelings for him? are we gonna do this again?
16212,Susan,i have told you i love you a thousand times. where is all this jealousy coming from?
14167,Susan,"i decided that my life is way too complicated, and so i'm simplifying. i am getting rid of the clutter."
16213,Susan,"what? no, ian, we have to talk about this."
16214,Susan,is it gaby's birthday?
18259,Susan,i heard.
16221,Susan,he's matured-- to the tune of a billion dollars. please do this--for mike.
14174,Susan,wow.
16223,Susan,thank you! this is a noble thing you're doing.
18269,Susan,"yeah. i'll do it. but that's it. no love, no sex, just--marriage."
14178,Susan,"i hate 'em all. look at them just leering at us. they're so damn cocky, like they know they have the upper hand."
18275,Susan,"uh, no. not like that. no, i was thinking that after our quickie courthouse ceremony, you could buy me a cake. i love wedding cake. it's the one part of marriage that never lets you down."
14182,Susan,"i'm telling you, he's hiding something. he clams up every time we try to ask him about mary alice. and then when we found out about dana--"
14183,Susan,paul and mary alice had a baby that died.
16231,Susan,what?
16232,Susan,jane cheated on ian? when was this?
18288,Susan,right! score for you!
16241,Susan,"actually, yeah, there is."
16242,Susan,i can't see you anymore. i want you to understand it doesn't have anything to do with you. it's just--
18290,Susan,"i was too proud to admit it. i'm not too proud to take it. i need that money, jackson."
18291,Susan,"""chip in""? it's is not a birthday cake for shirley in accounting. it's mortgage and food and insurance. i'm sorry, but i can't marry you."
18292,Susan,"it's canada, not iran. it's like america with free health insurance. okay, i know this is important to you, but i depend on that check every month."
18295,Susan,"hey, katherine, is mike here?"
16248,Susan,"okay, yes, it'll be weird. but it's not about me. this is about jane and ian. what if i wore this one?"
16249,Susan,"i have got to get more depressing clothes. okay, i just need to keep a low profile through the memorial, 'cause once i get through this, ian can officially introduce me as his girlfriend, and we'll finally be a normal, non-adulterous couple. what does this one say to you?"
16253,Susan,"okay, that's enough."
18301,Susan,that would be great. just tell him i need an answer quickly 'cause the wedding is monday.
18302,Susan,thanks.
18303,Susan,good news. looks like we're getting fake married after all.
14210,Susan,"every time we went out for pizza, you could have said, ""oh, and by the way, i once killed a man."" or when you said, ""hey, let's go jogging,"" you could have said, ""well, by the way, i once killed a man."" every time we went to the movies and the hero shot the bad guy, you could have turned to me and said, ""oh, and by the way, i did that once."" you didn't."
14213,Susan,"it doesn't matter, because i will never believe anything you say,ever again."
16261,Susan,i'm the bimbo. he's my meat. all righty. i just wanted to clear that up. and now i'm going to go find myself a seat with a--better view.
16262,Susan,"oh, dear god."
14216,Susan,that it explains everything.
18314,Susan,"--mike told 'em that he was driving, but it wasn't true."
14220,Susan,"no, no, i won't. i don't trust mike anymore. and without trust--no, no. i'm just gonna go in and rip it up and throw it in the trash."
16269,Susan,"well, well, uh, before you say another word--take a look around."
16273,Susan,you doing okay?
18324,Susan,"jackson, i have been so worried. where--where are you?"
18326,Susan,"well--i'll miss you, too. i mean, you came in my life when i was going through a really hard time, and you were amazing. i mean, you are amazing."
18328,Susan,mike? you think mike did this?
18331,Susan,why is that? when did being practical and realistic become synonymous with bitchiness?
16286,Susan,"yeah. except for orson, who fell off a roof. you know anything about that?"
18335,Susan,"oh, no need, i will wait."
14240,Susan,"edie! edie, why can't i go out with him?"
14241,Susan,"come on, that's a really 3rd-grade thing to say."
18338,Susan,i don't know. jealousy? jackson thinks mike is still hung up on me.
14243,Susan,edie.
16294,Susan,"oh! oh! oh, okay, nobody move. i got it."
14248,Susan,"well, neither is she. and if she's not into him, why can't i not be into him."
16297,Susan,what's the rush? am i pregnant?
16298,Susan,are you sure? 'cause you seem a little anxious.
14251,Susan,would you like a glass of water and maybe an excuse to come in and talk to me?
16300,Susan,was that the ring that you bought for--
18350,Susan,"i know. but still--i mean, it happened so fast. i just--i wanna make sure that you know what you're doing."
14256,Susan,"i mean, one minute we're making out in his truck and the next thing i know, we're at the hospital and the doctor's digging a bullet out of him. it's just that when i started dating mike, he seemed like such a normal guy, you know?"
14257,Susan,"i mean obviously i am not going to read the letter. at some point you just gotta let it go, right?"
14258,Susan,i don't mean to be babbling. it's just really complicated and there is so much about mike you don't even know.
18352,Susan,just answer the question.
18356,Susan,well--i realized that i never properly congratulated you on getting married.
14261,Susan,edie!
16310,Susan,"oh, thanks. i needed to hear to that."
14263,Susan,"you know, this is between you and edie. i just got sucked into the drama."
16312,Susan,here they come.
18360,Susan,"hey, dave. glad i caught you. is your friend's boat still available this weekend?"
16314,Susan,anyone hungry?
14269,Susan,now that is just perfect. stay put.
18366,Susan,you do?
16320,Susan,"no, karl's alive and kicking, sadly."
18368,Susan,"oh, it's your daddy. hey, mike."
16322,Susan,just adultery?
16324,Susan,your father's been up there for twenty minutes. are you sure he's okay?
18372,Susan,"oh, my god."
14278,Susan,and then the police showed me his mug shots.
16327,Susan,let me get you a towel.
18374,Susan,right. so how long do you think you'll be delayed?
18375,Susan,"well, i hope you get there soon."
16332,Susan,you mean a prenup?
16333,Susan,"well, who's getting divorced? i'm in this for keeps."
18387,Susan,i'm fine.
16342,Susan,i should go 'cause ian's parents are here.
16343,Susan,"oh, please. it's not that bad. i once worked at this fish-and-chip place. i had to wear an eye patch and a stuffed parrot on my shoulder. ""would you like to hear arrr specials?"""
16344,Susan,how do you think tom's gonna feel about that?
14297,Susan,i mean-he shouldn't have done that.
16349,Susan,thank you. i don't want your family's stuff. what am i gonna do with half a castle?
16352,Susan,"ian, do you really want to start our life together making me feel like--i'm on probation?"
18400,Susan,what?
14306,Susan,"okay, can we focus? what i want to know is have you thought about what's going to happy if you don't go back to morty?"
18404,Susan,dave! dave!
18406,Susan,"oh, god! are you okay?"
14314,Susan,it's not that i'm not excited?
14315,Susan,that's not true.
18416,Susan,"listen, i know being dramatic is the birthright of every teenager, but come on--"
18419,Susan,is that blood?
18420,Susan,what are you smiling about?
18426,Susan,edie!
14331,Susan,"i am - i mean, i was. it didn't work out."
14332,Susan,"if she moves in she will burn up all my oxygen and i need it. please can't you give her another chance? you guys are really good together, you know, when-when-when there's no violence."
16383,Susan,you?
