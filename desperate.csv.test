14336,Susan,"i just keep thinking it's coming, millie, and i can't stop it."
16384,Susan,"okay, that's a good point."
16385,Susan,"but we were in a bit of a jam there, and--i don't think you should be embarrassed for needing a little help."
16386,Susan,emasculated? who said emasculated? and why are you not kissing me now?
18436,Susan,"actually tom could you just hang on a second. uh, i also would like to say a few words. to bree and orson, ah yes, what could be better than a second love, and this time you enter it a little older, a little wiser, but also, and this is key, uh, with a bit of caution. because, while love can be spontaneous and wonderful, it can also be selfish and sometimes the best thing you can do is just to walk away. uh, not you two. you two crazy kids are great. congrats, yeah."
14342,Susan,mom. mom.
16391,Susan,and why don't you put your water on that lower shelf?
16392,Susan,move away from that topic.
14345,Susan,do you need a reason beyond the fact he's the ice cream man?
16393,Susan,"oh, come on."
14347,Susan,mom!
16394,Susan,it's true. she has a little room with magazines and an aquarium.
14352,Susan,what are you doing? i have a teenage daughter in the house! you cannot just bring strange men you meet in bars back here in the middle of the night!
16409,Susan,this is from me and ian.
14363,Susan,"yeah, it can be rewarding."
14364,Susan,no.
16413,Susan,"yeah, it's just, um--you know, ian and i had a had a little--thing."
14367,Susan,"mom! hold it! you are not getting in a car with those two, you hardly know them."
14373,Susan,"let's go back inside?! lamont, give it up, you're not getting any!"
14374,Susan,will you stop acting like tonight was all about helping me? you wanted to go out and have fun and lamont needed a date.
14375,Susan,yes! it is!
16422,Susan,dinner?
16424,Susan,"well, let's not bother him tonight. you know, i don't really even need a flashlight. my eyes have totally adjusted to the dark."
14381,Susan,i am so sorry. how did i forget you?
16429,Susan,"he wants to thank you for saving us, and he wants to show that he's not jealous of you. how's that for irony?"
16430,Susan,i was in shock.
16431,Susan,because we had just had a fight--about you.
16441,Susan,"oh, uh--he's just a neighbor."
14395,Susan,"mike, i know why i was planning to stay away from him, but why do you want me to stay away from him?"
14398,Susan,"yeah, well, that's not going to happen."
16448,Susan,sorry.
14403,Susan,believe whatever you want.
16453,Susan,you know what i would have said. it doesn't matter now.
16456,Susan,wow. it's kinda hard to decide.
14411,Susan,alright then.
16459,Susan,it's not just a cake. it's a major decision!
16461,Susan,no. it's nothing.
14417,Susan,all i'm saying is that maybe this is a blessing in disguise.
16466,Susan,get out!
16468,Susan,"no, i am beyond upset. you two want a decision? well, here's what i decide. there will be no kissing, and there will be no wedding, and there will be no damn cake!"
14421,Susan,"oh my god! oh my god, that's my house!"
14422,Susan,yes! that's my house!
16470,Susan,"get out. there will be no kissing,and there will be no wedding."
16472,Susan,for ten years? it's crazy. has anybody talked to her?
14425,Susan,"don't worry, we will be."
14426,Susan,window.
16477,Susan,who is it this time?
16478,Susan,no.
14434,Susan,really???!!!!
16482,Susan,"yes. i don't need a man. i don't even need sex. i went without it the first sixteen years--twenty-two years of my life, and i can go a few more."
14437,Susan,"bye, morty."
16486,Susan,and support you means--acting like we're in junior high?
16492,Susan,i'm taking my damn space!
16496,Susan,"oh, all right, take his side!"
16502,Susan,i told you--hurt and betrayed.
14455,Susan,"okay, give me the good news."
14459,Susan,i know her.
14460,Susan,"oh, hi. i'm looking for kendra taylor-"
14467,Susan,"and despite the evidence, despite all that's been laid out in front of me, i can't help feeling that there's more to the story. does that sound stupid?"
16517,Susan,you are so dead.
16519,Susan,"oh, come on!"
16524,Susan,"i'm sorry, mike."
16526,Susan,"oh, i'm gonna lock up down here. why don't you go upstairs and warm up the bed?"
16527,Susan,i know.
14480,Susan,i cannot believe you are still coming onto him.
16531,Susan,"well, ian, i made my choice."
14486,Susan,"and on a completely unrelated topic, mike and i are moving in together. see ya."
14487,Susan,we need to talk.
16534,Susan,"hi, ida.what's up?"
14491,Susan,"bonjour. oh, hi, i didn't know that the cooking lesson was gonna be a group activity. well, the more the merrier, right? as long as nobody makes fun of my lousy crepes. how come i'm the only one wearing the apron?"
16547,Susan,"yes. if i don't find mike before he's off that mountain, i may never see him again."
14500,Susan,"i don't have time to explain adult relationships to you. oh, duck down."
14501,Susan,he's six cars up. we have to stay this far back or he'll see us.
16550,Susan,"uh, can i get a map to the hot springs? i'm gonna hike up there."
14503,Susan,"i don't know, but i'm gonna find out. wait here and lock the doors."
16554,Susan,why would i need a tent?
14509,Susan,"gabby, the woman killed herself.something must have been going on."
14511,Susan,hello?
16559,Susan,"i mean, the doctor said that mike might never come out of the coma. and then when he did, he didn't even remember me."
16561,Susan,"little help. so anyway, the whole situation with mike--it just seemed hopeless and that's when i decided to take a chance with ian."
16562,Susan,"yeah. what was i supposed to do, wait forever for mike?"
14520,Susan,can you hang on? i got another call. hello?
16568,Susan,"well. i'm going to apologize, and then i'm gonna tell him that i made a huge mistake--"
16570,Susan,"okay, i know it's dark, but i can see you."
16577,Susan,mike. i twisted my ankle.
14530,Susan,he's a good person.
16579,Susan,"if by okay, you mean uneventful, then yes."
14532,Susan,"now, you be a good boy, bongo, or you're gonna go to bed hungry."
16581,Susan,"yes. it's also the anniversary of the day we were supposed to get engaged. a year ago tonight, you were on your way to ask me to marry you when you got hit by that stupid car."
14534,Susan,"edie, what a pleasant surprise."
16583,Susan,i thought you were gonna propose tonight.
14545,Susan,"honey, i know about dana."
14547,Susan,no!
14554,Susan,"uh, hello! uh, he was waiting there for you to come home so he could kill you."
14555,Susan,"okay, that's because i was wrestling it away from zach so that he wouldn't shoot you."
16602,Susan,you're getting married on my wedding day?
14561,Susan,i thought they were gonna operate. what happened?
14562,Susan,"oh, my god. so when can we see bree?"
16613,Susan,"oh, my god. did you steal my whole wedding?"
14567,Susan,"yeah. he's determined to see that kid behind bars. so tomorrow at school, i want you to let everybody know that we got this new, expensive security system."
16616,Susan,i don't want to be paid. i want my wedding back.
14569,Susan,emphasize the motion detectors.
14571,Susan,my fault?
16619,Susan,"i cannot believe that you just said that. okay, you know what? i came over here to give you my response card. but here. this is my response."
16620,Susan,"oh? no.no, this is a big dramatic gesture."
14580,Susan,who cares?
14586,Susan,so paul killed her?
16634,Susan,it's one of those hard jelly ones. do you think that's an omen?
14588,Susan,that's not zach.
16635,Susan,right. yeah.
14592,Susan,how long have you known?
16641,Susan,"i mean, i've never seen gaby so torn up with guilt."
16643,Susan,"hey, how about a double wedding?"
14598,Susan,"so naturally you'll be wanting to have a relationship with him, and that, that takes time, a lot of time."
16654,Susan,"oh, good! i mean, not that they said no, just--'cause i really wanted to do it."
14611,Susan,you are forbidden from ever seeing her again. do you hear me? forbidden!
16662,Susan,yeah. i'm calling her cell. it's ringing.
16664,Susan,i'm thinking a chocolate fountain would be a cool centerpiece to a dessert buffet.
14618,Susan,"what do you mean, you know?"
16667,Susan,"mike, these are all fairly standard wedding features. now you name one thing that you think is going over-the-top."
14621,Susan,"oh, i've never applied that concept to your father's sex life and you know it."
14623,Susan,what?
16674,Susan,"okay, well, that's crazy. you can't work round the clock. it's not healthy."
16676,Susan,is this about the wedding?
14630,Susan,so how have you been doing?
14631,Susan,"sure, what is it?"
16682,Susan,"really? is everything okay, sweetie? 'cause you haven't quite seemed yourself the last couple weeks."""
14640,Susan,"yes, hi. i was just wondering, are you having some remodeling done on your house or something?"
16688,Susan,just hurry up and get dressed. we only have forty-five minutes.
14642,Susan,"really? well, it sounds like it's coming from your house. you know, it's like a clanging, clanging."
14645,Susan,"hi, matthew."
16694,Susan,carlos.how is she?
16695,Susan,i can't believe this is happening.it's like mary alice all over again.
16696,Susan,happy one-month anniversary.
14653,Susan,"edie, what are you doing?"
16701,Susan,so our life together is exactly how you pictured it?you've gotten everything you wanted?
16709,Susan,so you're back.how fun.i should have a brunch so that everyone can get to know you.
14663,Susan,"oh, my god. i'm so sorry. i sent roses. did she get the roses?"
14666,Susan,"no! no! it's just, we were married. and, and she's trying to make this tawdry little affair you guys have going on par with that and it's just, i got mad."
14667,Susan,just give me a moment. i'm asking god to kill me.
16714,Susan,"listen,um.maybe this isn't-"
14675,Susan,"well, i have a court order. it's out of my hands."
16724,Susan,"oh,so you just shun them and throw them away."
16732,Susan,"listen,my last egg could be on its way down the chute at this very moment.if you wanna have kids,you might wanna jump on it right now."
14686,Susan,"oh. oh, okay."
16736,Susan,well. we just all love ya.
16737,Susan,"damn it,lynette. what did we say after mary alice.after edie? why didn't they tell us?"
16741,Susan,"no problem.um,what's up?"
16742,Susan,"adam,i have no idea what you're talking about."
16744,Susan,more?
14702,Susan,i did not kick edie out. julie made that call.
16754,Susan,i'm not sure. but there was something odd about the way they left.
16755,Susan,"uh, that sounds great."
16758,Susan,"hey, katherine. what's going on?"
16759,Susan,"oh, whoa. no, hang on. let me just run and get julie so she can say good-bye to dylan."
16762,Susan,"no problem. hey, you know, i was meaning to ask you, how did that job in chicago work out?"
14716,Susan,"zach is your son,isn't he?"
14717,Susan,"what, that's it?"
14720,Susan,"no, no, it's not. we're just gonna pretend like it was when we first started dating. we'll just see each other occasionally. you know, until we get this zach thing resolved. you know, we'll just be easy about it. no commitments. except, of course, neither of us is allowed to date anybody else."
14723,Susan,"zach's your son, and, and i have julie and you're totally accepted her. i mean, granted, she's been the model child, so far, but she's almost fifteen. she's gonna turn on me any minute. you better be there to help me when it gets ugly."
14726,Susan,i can be naked in twenty seconds! that includes travel time.
14728,Susan,you know?
16777,Susan,count me in.
16778,Susan,what are friends for?
14734,Susan,oh. do you mind keeping those and pass them out when people get their ice cream?
14735,Susan,what?
14738,Susan,"damn it, zach. it's enough already."
16790,Susan,"well, i'd better warn you. i may have to work the shoulders. ba-boom, ba-boom, mmm."
14743,Susan,"what do you think, bree?"
16792,Susan,"uh, yeah, well, you know, sometimes you gotta hang tough."
16793,Susan,mm-hmm?
16794,Susan,what?
16796,Susan,"well, i don't think that you can have sexy date night without whipped cream."
16799,Susan,"yeah, it's fine. would somebody just tell me where i can find--"
14756,Susan,do you know what i think? i think you were right. i think you should try to find your father first.
16804,Susan,"well, of course you don't think it is, because you're knocking back a big cup of-- orange soda."
16805,Susan,"well, believe it. we're going. you, too, dylan. come on."
16806,Susan,"yeah, well, boomer likes it."
16809,Susan,do you think this is easy for me? trying to keep peace between a new husband and a teenage daughter? you're always putting me in the middle.
14764,Susan,i'll just call the agency and let them know i'm going with you.
16812,Susan,hey. look who i picked up coming out of the movies-- a p.g. movie. is this the perfect teenager or what?
14767,Susan,you had to move money? what does that mean?
14768,Susan,really? 'cause it sorta sounds like embezzlement.
16817,Susan,thanks.
14771,Susan,"well, i don't hate you. i couldn't hate you. you're my lonnie."
14773,Susan,you must be so relieved.
14775,Susan,i told you. lonnie wants me to sign with his new agency.
16827,Susan,so you were paid a very nice compliment today.
16830,Susan,"honey, you know, i'm still in my first trimester. um, don't you think it's a little early to be making cribs?"
16831,Susan,great.
14784,Susan,will you stop judging and help me?
16832,Susan,"mm. um, bree's home. i'll be right back."
16835,Susan,"well, that's because i don't blush when orson says, ""open wide""."
16836,Susan,"oh, well, we could schedule our appointments together and carpool. you know--pregnant gals on the road."
14789,Susan,"well, i just came over to give you the contract. your door was open."
16840,Susan,i'm so excited. pregnant gals sharing a doctor!
16842,Susan,right.
14799,Susan,what are you doing? are you trying to take me down with you?
14801,Susan,i do.
14807,Susan,not like that!
14808,Susan,no! there has not been and there never will be.
14810,Susan,bree! where have you been? we were starting to get worried.
14811,Susan,why?
14815,Susan,how much money do you think you need to get to utah?
16863,Susan,"no, we'll talk now. you still owe me an explanation for that scuzzy gyno you sent me to."
16378,Susan,"and our cheese! ian, can you believe it? mike saved our cheese!"
16869,Susan,"oh, are you kidding? it's the first baby i've had in 17 years. you know, i could not possibly be more freaked out. this morning, i caught mike building a crib."
14824,Susan,"right, right, i'm sorry."
16872,Susan,if we are lucky
16873,Susan,"look at us. pregnant gals, eating cake and bi*chin'. it's kinda nice, huh?"
16875,Susan,"i got it, i got it. oh, one more. here you go."
16877,Susan,"oh, we haven't gotten a chance to meet. i'm susan. i live next door. oh! jeez."
14832,Susan,"oh, thank god, they're here."
16880,Susan,"oh, you're partners. what kind of business? you know, whatever it is, just don't let the neighborhood association hear that you work out of your house. they're so not cool."
16885,Susan,"well, i don't see the problem with it--hint, hint."
14839,Susan,"yes, definitely. i mean, i can understand why you wouldn't want the cops to know that you kidnapped paul. i mean, that definitely looks bad."
14841,Susan,"well, okay--"
14842,Susan,"but why don't you want 'em to know about martha huber's journal? i mean, she says right in there that she was blackmailing paul's wife."
16889,Susan,"well, maybe."
16890,Susan,"that's fine, and once they like me, they can keep to themselves all they damn well please."
14845,Susan,come in!
16894,Susan,i'm not seeing any nuts.
16900,Susan,"bup, bup, bup! wait a second."
14856,Susan,what?
16905,Susan,andrew told us that you only said no--'cause you didn't want to impose.
16906,Susan,lee? is something wrong?
14859,Susan,"i, i should have told you right away. i, i know that. but you know now, so can we please talk about it?"
16907,Susan,"oh. well, would you like me to help you look for him?"
14862,Susan,"i screwed up, okay? i want to fix it! please let me fix it! tell me how to fix it! mike, i love you!"
14863,Susan,"please, no, please, please. no, mike! mike!"
16915,Susan,how's bob's suit?
16918,Susan,that's crazy.
14873,Susan,i'm fine. you got any pie?
14874,Susan,i can wait.
16926,Susan,"okay, before we become an ugly mob, why doesn't one of us go talk to the guys?but not me. they hate me."
14879,Susan,"look, are you sure this is what you want to do? i mean, i understand that you don't want our relationship to continue, you have made that clear. but i sort of thought down the long corridors of time, maybe you and i could be friends, and if you keep acting like this--"
14883,Susan,"oh. well, come on in."
14884,Susan,"oh, that's okay. julie's staying at a friend's tonight. you can sleep in her room."
16935,Susan,i have a lovely voice.
16945,Susan,"yeah, i'm sorry. you know, tired people aren't witty."
14899,Susan,hit me.
14900,Susan,what was it?
16949,Susan,"hey, lynette."
14904,Susan,karl. it'd be so weird.
16952,Susan,"exactly, and friends don't put friends in this kind of position. i love you, but you can't ask me to put your kids ahead of my husband."
16959,Susan,"what do you mean, ""it's fine now""? he's dead."
14912,Susan,we should not have done what we did.
16963,Susan,"yeah. but apparently, his dad can rise from the dead. so let's hope the baby gets that gene."
16966,Susan,"oh, my god. he's in jail for murder?"
16968,Susan,"well, i've got to meet him."
16971,Susan,"uh, no. thank you, nick."
14927,Susan,you're right. he made his choice.
14936,Susan,why?
14939,Susan,yeah?
16990,Susan,what did you do?
14945,Susan,"well, there's no record of anyone with my dad's name in the armed services."
14950,Susan,mom! mom.
14951,Susan,"morty? morty, have you seen my mom?"
16999,Susan,"oh, honey. you'd be surprised how fast the best schools fill up. and only the best for our kid, right?"
14954,Susan,"morty, can, can we just move this along?"
17003,Susan,maybe dylan should ask her mom.
14956,Susan,"well, why would my mother tell me that?"
14969,Susan,oh?
17020,Susan,"mike, we don't need any of that stuff."
14974,Susan,why?
14975,Susan,thank you.
17022,Susan,i wanna believe you. it's just--
17024,Susan,thank you.
17028,Susan,i checked out his web page.
14984,Susan,"back in the sixties, you had a brief relationship with a young girl, sophie bremmer. she got pregnant and had a baby and that baby was me,which makes you my father. hi."
17033,Susan,"no, he's at work."
14986,Susan,mr. prudy!
17034,Susan,"well, i don't know when he's gonna be home, but you could come back later tonight."
14988,Susan,hello!
14989,Susan,i just wanted to see if you were okay.
17040,Susan,"oh, sure. i have to check on the laundry."
17044,Susan,"oh, please, call me ""mom"". uh, because--that's what all the kids call me."
17045,Susan,"oh, mike, you're home. i was dreaming we were ponies."
15001,Susan,i'm not giving up.
15007,Susan,how do you think he's gonna react?
17058,Susan,yeah.
15012,Susan,that was my first halloween. i was two. what do you think i am?
15013,Susan,"oh, come on, just guess. you can tell."
15014,Susan,"no, addison, i'm a chicken. see? those are feathers hanging around."
15017,Susan,"well, i, i just want to share more than our dna i, i wanted to have a relationship with you. none of this means anything to you?"
15020,Susan,yeah.
15023,Susan,"addison, you just got caught paying for sex. now is not the time to wrap yourself in the flag."
15025,Susan,can't you just go home and have sex with your wife like a normal person?
15026,Susan,"oh, my god. stop. right now. i'm gonna go pay this thing."
17073,Susan,"by giving pills to an addict? does that sound helpful to you, mrs. kowalsky?"
17079,Susan,and you're kind of yelling at me-also a problem.
15034,Susan,"hello, edie. do you have something you'd like to say?"
15036,Susan,oh! i guess not.
17088,Susan,these people are bleeding. i can absolutely wait.
17089,Susan,"mike, stop!"
15045,Susan,"well, let me see. painting in the rain or letting the whole world think i'm a whore? i don't know. what do you think?"
15046,Susan,yep.
15048,Susan,good for you. bye.
17096,Susan,no.
15051,Susan,really?
17101,Susan,"yes, yes, i do. i do. so i want you to go over to those paramedics, and i want you to let them look at these cuts. because you don't want to be all bloody when they pull your kids out of there, do you?"
17102,Susan,what?
15055,Susan,"hey, what happened to the applewhites?i thought you were gonna invite them."
17110,Susan,imposing. who's imposing? you can stay as long as you want. i'm sorry. the words came out of my mouth before i knew what i was saying.
17116,Susan,this has just replaced your birth as the best day of my life.
15073,Susan,"yeah, i can't believe i'm about to say this,but i feel sorry for him.it's like he's so fragile."
17122,Susan,"i don't know, but i've had a taste of ironed pillowcases, and i am not going back."
15078,Susan,"no, and we're not planning on telling him."
15083,Susan,you okay?
15084,Susan,"we don't hate you, zach.you had an incredibly hard year.and you shouldn't have done what you did,but we just wanna help you move on."
17133,Susan,"can i have milk, too?"
15090,Susan,i don't know. i saw his face when he looked in the trunk.and he looked just as shocked as i was.
17145,Susan,done catching up. all about accounting now.
15098,Susan,it was an accident.
17147,Susan,these receipts are self-explanatory. i'd even know why i'm here.
15101,Susan,this is the worst date i have ever been on in my life.
17149,Susan,is this about the other day?
15107,Susan,"great,she caught me staring."
15108,Susan,i just know those two have something to do with that dead body.
17159,Susan,"hey, uh, tim, i've got mike here. do you want to talk to him?"
15115,Susan,"oh,he could be cuter--but i don't know how."
17167,Susan,"no, katherine, i know what you've been going through emotionally, so you don't have to apologize. and by the way, your boob is out."
15120,Susan,"you mean,i'm not gonna see dr. ron?"
17169,Susan,"i don't understand you. is this something you do? you worm your way into a neighborhood with the promise of free tax preparation, and then you jump on the nearest middle-aged divorce?"
15123,Susan,i should switch to juice.i know the best juice place.you would love it.do you drink juice?
15124,Susan,"oh,oh,not that often.i probably just need a good massage."
15126,Susan,"oh,oh,no,i don't think that's necessary."
15127,Susan,i got high marks in math and science.
15128,Susan,so is dr. ron gonna be here for this?
15130,Susan,"oh,uh,i-i,uh--then why did you put out a gown?"
15132,Susan,"hey,dr. ron?i just have a feeling that everything's gonna turn out fine.and when it does--i'd like to buy you dinner to celebrate my health.you know,i was thinking maybe italian?oh,what the heck,maybe we can call it a date.if you like.dr. ron?"
17183,Susan,it would?
15137,Susan,"oh,no,no,no,no."
17185,Susan,"then you came down here and you couldn't remember what it was. that happens to me all the time. well, the baby is insisting that i eat the last piece of"
17186,Susan,"pajamas--that's something you could do. okay, you're right. you're a guest in my housea completely naked guest in my house. i should leave."
15140,Susan,"i know. i know.i feel really awful.i am just not the best at meeting men.and i thought you were cute,and i sort of thought that maybe you thought i was cute,and you're a doctor,and that's so sexy."
15141,Susan,really?you were up all night?
17187,Susan,oh. good morning. love what you're wearing.
17188,Susan,all right. we don't need to talk about it. just promise me it won't happen again.
17190,Susan,you most certainly were.
17191,Susan,"it wasn't a claim. he was sitting right here without a stitch of clothing on, and i couldn't have cake."
15151,Susan,"oh, um, well, uh,julie's staying at her father's house,and, um, i'm all alone here."
15153,Susan,"oh, that's a good idea.i forgot.i have a bottle of wine.it's already chilled right in the refrigerator,and that'll just really relax me."
17201,Susan,"well, maybe it's because you just saw him. he must be on your mind."
17202,Susan,you can't. your house isn't finished yet.
15156,Susan,"you know,we've been on three dates,and you just keep acting like a perfect gentleman,and, uh-- it's getting a little old."
17208,Susan,i know. i just--i can't stop now. i broke the seal.
15161,Susan,"oh, well, okay.i mean,i guess-- i guess you guys probably have all sorts of new, exciting techniques where you don't even cut open the body."
17210,Susan,really? not even when you heard an acoustic guitar?
17211,Susan,"oh, i just can't control myself like that."
15171,Susan,i would like to.but i gotta be honest--the fact that you can't even cut that steak isn't helping.
15174,Susan,thank you.
15175,Susan,what?i didn't even serve dessert yet.you said you understood!
17225,Susan,"do you hear me, orson?!"
17229,Susan,i can't come out my front door every day and see that man. we have to move.
15182,Susan,really?
17231,Susan,"how can you do that? he put you in a coma. i sat there day after day, wondering if you were gonna live. as far as i'm concerned, orson can go to hell."
17233,Susan,mike says i need to forgive orson--
17234,Susan,"and he's right. i have to find a way to make peace with all of this. but you need to understand, it's gonna be one of the hardest things i've ever done. and like most things in my life, i probably won't do it with much elegance or grace. so if i don't come over to your house for coffee--if i don't smile when the two of you walk by, just please know that i still love you. and for forgiving orson--just be patient. i'll get there."
15187,Susan,"yeah, that."
17237,Susan,"oh, no, that's okay. i'll be fine."
17238,Susan,quit eyeing it. i ain't sharing.
15191,Susan,"bree, we know that you have a good reason for wanting betty to hang out with us.we just-- wondered if you could clue us in a little."
15193,Susan,"hi. i need an operation on my spleen,and i just found out i don't have medical insurance.is there anyone i can sue?"
17241,Susan,"he got his skank pregnant, and you didn't tell me?"
17243,Susan,"hello, karl."
17247,Susan,"oh, no, no, no, th-those are not the legs of a law professor."
17252,Susan,i'm not asking you to lie. i'm just saying spin. why won't you spin?
15206,Susan,hi.
17255,Susan,just bananas.
17261,Susan,he's not feeling well. i see marisa isn't here either.
15214,Susan,"no! no. ha!no, to-- to a gay guy.how did you know about the doctor?"
17263,Susan,"just drop the act. you are so loving this. you ended up with the miss america with a law degree, and i ended up with the pillhead plumber. bravo. damn it! why won't this unroll?"
17268,Susan,it's nice to meet you.
15221,Susan,cancer?
17273,Susan,"um, well--i guess mike didn't tell you that i'm, uh, really not a cook."
17279,Susan,don't even know what they are.
17282,Susan,i have a job.
17283,Susan,children's books pay.
17286,Susan,"bree, are you okay?"
17287,Susan,"oh, my god."
15240,Susan,yep.
17291,Susan,"we're not inviting you to poker. we're not talking to you. we're not even gonna wave when you jog by. from now on, you are invisible."
17294,Susan,nice? she's driving me crazy. you have got to stop complaining about me to her.
17296,Susan,"well, the next time she tries to help, she's gonna get an old-fashioned in her face, so you better step up and start defending me."
15251,Susan,mostly.
15252,Susan,hi!happy valentine's day.
17301,Susan,aah! aah! come on. aah! aah! aah!
15256,Susan,yeah.wednesdays are becoming very popular with brides.it's like the new saturday.
17311,Susan,"he sure does, but i want mine first."
17313,Susan,aah!
17315,Susan,"no, i'm not trying to-- aah!"
15273,Susan,"i don't know.you know,i'll just--i'll sell the car."
15277,Susan,nothing. i just--i didn't know that you loved her like that.
17326,Susan,"oh, i'm so sorry. i know how much you loved him."
15281,Susan,have you seen bree since?
17332,Susan,you sure? it's worth a phone call.
15288,Susan,then i'm on board.
15297,Susan,"okay,that part sounds better when you don't read it out loud.and what are you doing reading it anyway?"
15302,Susan,"okay,you know,you can leave now."
17351,Susan,because my husband is terrified of balloons. he was once molested by a clown.
15304,Susan,"oh,sure.oh,that's a little tight.does it have to be that tight?"
15306,Susan,ow! ow!
17356,Susan,"i'm sorry. i--i just want our kid to have a great name. i don't think ""maynard"" is great."
15311,Susan,"ow,nurse hisel!ugh! nurse--oh!"
17360,Susan,"random chitchat, nothing specific."
17364,Susan,"next week? w-well, that is a big--no."
17365,Susan,"yes--to be chosen, and you have been chosen. so congratulations, and you're staying home."
15322,Susan,and he keeps telling me how special i am and how much i mean to him--how he wants to hold my beating heart in his hand.
15327,Susan,"aw,that's so sweet.you came all the way down here just for me."
15331,Susan,"aw,thank you.i love mike."
17379,Susan,seriously--i just lean on you in ways you don't even know.
15333,Susan,"mmm,mike,mike,mike--"
17380,Susan,"well--i spend more time with me than you do, and i'm a mess."
15335,Susan,i love mike
17383,Susan,"my god! bree,are you all right?"
17387,Susan,honey? i'm home. did you miss me?
15340,Susan,"yes, everyone does know a mike.actually, you're right. i did know a mike in college.we did this play together, ""pippin."" it wasn't very good.anyways, i never thought of him,so you shouldn't be accusing me.i was probably just hallucinating."
17391,Susan,"i don't know. come on, zippy, zippy."
17392,Susan,"well, good, then you shouldn't have any problem finding a place to sleep."
15348,Susan,"um, we'll just be a second.just wheel me.be right back."
17396,Susan,i'm back. you want something cold?
17398,Susan,i think i'll have it done right now.
17403,Susan,"okay, new rule. from now on, sex only happens in the bedroom, door closed, between the hours of 7:00 and 10:00 p.m."
17407,Susan,not here. go home. i'll call you.
15360,Susan,yeah.
15361,Susan,where's he going?
17408,Susan,i don't know. later. just go.
17411,Susan,"no, of course not. my friends would love you."
15364,Susan,"what were you thinking?oh,oh!"
13318,Susan,"no, i said, really? and what do most women lead, lives of noisy fulfillment?"
15367,Susan,oh!
17415,Susan,"yeah, i guess i could handle that."
17420,Susan,"and we killed them, mike!"
15373,Susan,i'm fine!
15375,Susan,okay.
17426,Susan,"well, i've sort of start seeing someone. so i might do something with him."
17432,Susan,"oh, clearly this is not how i would've wanted the two of you to meet. he's--he's really a nice guy."
13337,Susan,how would you feel about me using your child support payments for plastic surgery?
15385,Susan,i can't tell you.
13341,Susan,oh god.
13342,Susan,hi.
13344,Susan,"well, i., i just was wondering, if, um, if there was any chance that, um, you would uh-- i just-- wanted to ask if--"
17442,Susan,"no, you're not. you like football-- american football. specifically the colts."
17443,Susan,"and here are some other things you can talk about--cars, barbecue, fishing."
15401,Susan,"hey,edie.what's all this stuff for?"
15402,Susan,a surprise?
15403,Susan,"oh,cool. but that's not the surprise."
17451,Susan,yeah. mmm. you've never done that before. wait. you've never done that before. why are you doing that now?
17453,Susan,"mike told you about the ear thing, didn't he?"
15408,Susan,"i know. i told her that.i said,""he always,always hates surprises."""
13363,Susan,oh-- oh! oh!
13365,Susan,i'm fine. i'm fine. i just feel really bad for edie.
15415,Susan,oh! get out! get--
15416,Susan,hi. what's going on?
17463,Susan,really? whose is this?
15421,Susan,"no. no,of course not.and anything i can do to help--uh,you know,i would--i could help with the engagement party.how's that?"
15422,Susan,a what now?
15425,Susan,"oh.well,why is your father keeping this?"
15428,Susan,"yeah?okay,then,repeat after me.""our marriage is fake,""and i'm going to marry the woman i really love--edie britt."""
15429,Susan,"no,no,no,no! it's not about what i want you to say.you have to want to say that you want to marry edie."
17477,Susan,get out.
15433,Susan,"oh,karl!oh! will you--are you crazy?!"
17481,Susan,okay. we'll give him a call.
17486,Susan,hey! you leave him alone. oh! honey! is that who's been picking on you? juanita solis?
13393,Susan,i'll be there.
13397,Susan,hey you. what're we having?
13398,Susan,"oh yeah, i love my steak."
13399,Susan,edie.
15445,Susan,"oh,no!no,don't you dare!"
13401,Susan,"edie, would you like to join us for dinner?"
15447,Susan,so how you holding up?you must be exhausted.
13403,Susan,yeah.
15448,Susan,"well,you guys are busy.we should go."
15449,Susan,"okay,let's go. i don't wanna be late for the movie.oh,those are pretty.who sent those?"
15450,Susan,what?
13407,Susan,zach? is your dad home? i need to talk to him.
15451,Susan,"no,his feelings.he's the one with the feelings,not me."
15452,Susan,"okay,don't ""uh-huh"" me. you're not old enough to do that."
15455,Susan,"mike,hi! what a surprise."
15458,Susan,"well,i definitely pickedthe right person to sit next to.actually,is this seat taken?"
17503,Susan,so your solution was to push him down? do you think that's nice? how would you feel if someone did that to you?
13413,Susan,sorry if i upset you.
17506,Susan,"okay, first off, it wasn't as bad as it looked."
15463,Susan,"did i call edie a slut?well,that's overstating it.edie's not a slut.she's just-- popular with indiscriminate men.anyway-- yes,those are the relevant players."
17509,Susan,this conversation is over. tell bob and lee that i'll pay for the dent in their lawn. you did not!
15467,Susan,"that's why you brought me down here?karl,you made it sound like it was an emergency."
17515,Susan,"yeah, sure, on alternate weekends. that's fine--until-- m.j. needs his daddy, and his daddy's not there."
17518,Susan,"well, i don't see any kid of yours being a victim. you're the strongest person i know."
13423,Susan,oh.
17522,Susan,to gabrielle solis--another good mom.
13427,Susan,"no, julie, she wasn't married to xavier. that was just one of her special friends. i think we should change the subject, you know, unless you wanna keep talking about it."
13428,Susan,"so, you know what? i am gonna go get dessert."
15478,Susan,karl--you look pretty beat up.why--why don't you--why don't you come in and--we'll crack open a bottle of wine.come on.
17527,Susan,"which is a good thing, 'cause there's a shark attacking the house."
15481,Susan,about us?i feel good.i feel happy.
17529,Susan,"to susan, the sweetest, most--"
13435,Susan,"oh no, it's okay."
13436,Susan,"oh, that's great."
13440,Susan,"no, it doesn't. not at all."
15489,Susan,"no,just get out!get out!"
17538,Susan,hello?
15493,Susan,don't bother!i won't pick up.
13446,Susan,really?
13449,Susan,how could we have all forgotten about this?
17548,Susan,"oh, honey. you know how you like to push the button when we go on the elevator, and if somebody else pushes it first, it makes you sad?"
15501,Susan,she's sleeping.
13454,Susan,i have an idea.
15503,Susan,"well, every situation is different,and it's hard to judge until we know all the details."
15504,Susan,"which--obviously i don't know,because how would i know?"
17551,Susan,"no. he was absolutely waiting for you, you know, i think i'm gonna go check his helmet."
15506,Susan,"and this one,i ran out and got the day i found out karl was doing it with his secretary.i think you'll find this particularly helpful.it's got a chapter called,""revenge: you're only hurting yourself."""
17558,Susan,"oh, will you stop? the doctor said it was just a sprain."
15516,Susan,she just--spit in your wings.
15517,Susan,uh-- sure.
13470,Susan,"you know, i've lived with this bitterness so long, i think i'd be lonely without it."
13471,Susan,"hey karl, it's me. i was hoping you'll be there. um, listen, we need to talk. so, maybe when you drop julie off tomorrow, we could have a moment. it's important. give my best to-brandy. call me."
15520,Susan,thank you.thank you for having my back.
15521,Susan,so do i have to worry about you attacking any more waitresses?
13475,Susan,"oh. um, okay. here's the thing, karl. i was thinking about what happened in the driveway yesterday. and i just don't wanna, i don't wanna live like this. i don't wanna be that kind of person. and i just thought, if the two of us had a nice calm-i need an apology, karl."
15523,Susan,where'd all this food come from?
15524,Susan,hi. i got your message.what's up?
17572,Susan,"it's a little weird. i--i but, you know, m.j. will be thrilled, and--yeah, i'm fine with it."
15527,Susan,me and karl?why would you think that?
13482,Susan,locked myself out. naked.
15535,Susan,"okay,let's try this another way.you are about to unleash a nuclear explosion.lives are going to be ruined."
17584,Susan,"oh, please. telling me i smell good? i'm not even wearing deodorant."
17585,Susan,"semantics. and then the not so subtle sit-on-the-bed maneuver? you know, why not just ask for a massage?"
15543,Susan,hey there.you look thirsty.
13497,Susan,what do you mean?
13498,Susan,"listen, mike, i-about the whole seeing me naked thing. i don't know, i just, i wanna thank you for being such a-perfect gentleman."
13499,Susan,oh. goodnight.
15547,Susan,"are you sure?uh,i mean,you have such a long route,and that ice tea's gonna go right through ya.it's better here than mrs. mccluskey's hydrangeas."
17596,Susan,h-honest? okay.
13502,Susan,"i'll be quick. brandy, i'm sorry for the way i treated you. it was uncalled for, and childish, and it won't happen again. i have built up a lot of anger towards you, both of you, and i realise now that i just can't carry that around anymore. so, apology or no apology, i'm moving on."
15551,Susan,uh.
13506,Susan,i think we should show paul the note.
15554,Susan,"hi. i made you a thank-you pie,and by ""made,""i mean ""bought."""
15556,Susan,"well,you keep telling yourself that.i know why you really paid that guy off.you still care about me."
17604,Susan,what's wrong with the way things are? why change everything now?
17606,Susan,"well, you really went all out."
17608,Susan,do i you think she'll be surprised?
17610,Susan,"no, it wouldn't."
13517,Susan,hi.
15567,Susan,arson?
17617,Susan,"no, it wouldn't."
17620,Susan,"not so much. frank, how can i call him? he's the one that ended it with me."
13527,Susan,what's so funny?
15576,Susan,"this is not what we should focus on right now.the point is, you maliciously set fire to my house."
17625,Susan,good. so who the hell are you?
15578,Susan,"that's it.i'm going to the police,and i'm telling them what you did."
13532,Susan,no. thank you.
17628,Susan,"you met the guy in night, then you're in a shower. i'm just doing the math."
15582,Susan,i need edie to spill her guts.what do you know about wearing a wire?
17631,Susan,i wanted to talk about our future.
17632,Susan,"well, i was starting to change my mind, and then i show up and find 5 feet of lip gloss in the shower. i brought hot wings. you're not getting any."
15586,Susan,"yeah. i'm sort of up against the wall.the insurance company needs proof fast,and things are sort of weird at bree's.i don't wanna over stay my welcome."
15587,Susan,i'm sorry. did you just invite me to move in with you?
17634,Susan,i don't?
13544,Susan,"what exactly is it you want from me, mrs huber?"
17642,Susan,ugh!
13547,Susan,"so paul, we noticed that you're selling the house."
13549,Susan,"you can see from the postmark, mary alice probably got it the day she died."
15598,Susan,why not?
17647,Susan,mm.
17650,Susan,"well, it means--no sex until at least date four."
13555,Susan,"julie, i don't think they'll throw me in jail. i mean, it was an accident."
13556,Susan,"ok, let's run through it one more time."
15604,Susan,"well, see, you were chewing,and so i didn't really hear what you said.could you just say it again?"
15605,Susan,"so, uh, y-you then a-admit burning down my house on purpose?"
15606,Susan,huh?
17656,Susan,i sort of guessed that when you painted my house.
13561,Susan,"there she goes. okay, move."
13562,Susan,"oh, i am so glad to be playing frisbee again. here you go, coming atcha."
15611,Susan,hi.
17662,Susan,"and so that's when i got caught stuffing at the pep rally. and six months later--kaboom. i was voted prom queen. nice work, girls. stop that right now."
15619,Susan,"oh, yeah, that. um--look, i really appreciate the offer,but i think i'm gonna have to pass."
15621,Susan,"i know, but i can figure this out on my own.at least i'm gonna try.you know, i'm stronger than people give me credit for.i really am."
13575,Susan,no! it's not like that.
15624,Susan,"i think i'm gonna have to pass.you know, i'm stronger than people give me credit for."
15626,Susan,"oh, oh."
17674,Susan,jackson?
17676,Susan,"okay, i just ran into your house half-naked. the only thing you should be doing is me. what is on your face? is that paint? are you painting again?"
17678,Susan,"so you've broken through your creative logjam? congratulations! ooh, why not celebrate by ripping off my clothes with your teeth?"
13583,Susan,"i will keep my lawn looking nice. and i will make sure that my music isn't playing too loud and if i get some of your mail. heck, i'll run it right over, because that's what good neighbours do. but from now on, when i run into you on the street and i say ""good morning, mrs huber"" or ""how are you, mrs huber"" just know that inside i am quietly but decidedly hating your guts."
17680,Susan,that's me.
13585,Susan,he actually said mary alice was crazy?
17684,Susan,oh. come on. i think you know the answer to that.
17689,Susan,"you know, when your 24-year-old daughter calls you and tells you she's bringing home a boy from college, you sort of expect it to be, well, a boy."
15643,Susan,"hey, what's going on?"
13596,Susan,thank you! so do you think it should be dusted for prints?
13597,Susan,great.
15645,Susan,wow.
15647,Susan,so i can't believe you caught me spraying for ants. i must look like a wreck.
17695,Susan,i don't believe so. although i may have blacked out after she told me you were 40. so how does a man your age get married and divorced three times?
17700,Susan,"well, that's true."
15654,Susan,"it's temporary, and if you don't mind, i'm having coffee."
15656,Susan,"well, actually, i think that twins are genetically determined by the mother."
13610,Susan,blame myself???
15659,Susan,"julie, what are you doing?i'm trying to sleep."
15661,Susan,"no, no, no, no.no, turn my house around."
15662,Susan,you bought us a house?
17709,Susan,tonight?! isn't that lovely?
17714,Susan,i'm--just movin' to the music.
15667,Susan,"oh, hi.um, we're just moving."
17721,Susan,"oh, julie, you're way too young to be this cynical."
17722,Susan,"well, putting a wall around your heart doesn't protect you. it just keeps people out. i learned that the hard way. now with jackson--i remember that i like feeling hopeful. i like believing in ""happily ever after."" i really wish that you felt that way, too."
15676,Susan,oh. are you all right?
17725,Susan,jackson. jackson.
15681,Susan,"mike, my heart is in the exact right place."
17730,Susan,someone's coming!
15683,Susan,mike still hasn't seen the invitation.
17731,Susan,hi!
13638,Susan,but what if i like him?
17734,Susan,how you feeling? i just gave blood.
15688,Susan,"karl, we are not getting back together.not ever. you need to just stop and realize that it's over.i'm gonna marry mike.so i need you to sign these because i have to be divorced first."
13641,Susan,so why couldn't you just tell me that?
17737,Susan,"well, i did just give blood. oh!"
17738,Susan,"mm, i hate macadamia nuts. you think they're white chocolate chips until it's too late. stupid hawaii. who made 'em?"
13647,Susan,right!okay. thank you.
15696,Susan,"hey, it's just me again. um-- when you got the invitation, i thought that you gave me the thumbs up, but i guess if that was actually-- some other type of finger gesture, uh-- well, i apologize for leaving you all these messages and wasting your time."
13649,Susan,"oh,yeah, sure, go ahead. do what you've got to do."
17744,Susan,you're dating a friend of mine?
13651,Susan,"thank you,no, i'm on a break. hurry please!"
13654,Susan,no.the cop lied to me.
13655,Susan,i don't want to talk about it.
13656,Susan,i'm not mad at you. i mean i'm not just mad at you-i'm mostly mad at myself.
13657,Susan,i'm mad that i like you so much without knowing anything about you.
17752,Susan,"of course, even though i still think you're beautiful just the way you are."
15707,Susan,"ha, still i--"
15708,Susan,"well, in that case, thank you for my cheap knock-off.oh, my god, i'm late."
15709,Susan,so you were very mysterious on the phone.why did you want to have lunch?
17758,Susan,"well, it doesn't matter. she's my friend. she should've come to me and discussed it first."
17759,Susan,"all things we can discuss when i knock her teeth out with a pool cue. you know, it's sad when you can't trust a friend. or maybe the lesson here is that she wasn't really a friend to begin with then."
17761,Susan,"yes, i am. you're perfectly right."
15714,Susan,"um, you mean like outside the hospital?"
13667,Susan,"that makes sense. still, i just want to make sure you didn't want to keep it, for zach, something to remember his mother by."
15715,Susan,a date?ahhhh.
13669,Susan,"oh, which ones?"
13671,Susan,"no, but i can tell you this much. he's not staying with relatives."
17767,Susan,why didn't you tell me?
13674,Susan,i need those back.
15725,Susan,bree?
15729,Susan,"well, ah, i'm not sure that i've ever seen this shade of green before."
17778,Susan,"sweetie, good news. katherine's gonna go to the zoo with you."
17779,Susan,"well, she and your daddy are friends, and the more, the merrier."
13684,Susan,oh!
15734,Susan,well. um. honestly--
13690,Susan,i sure am.
13691,Susan,i don't get it. i've gone through all your yearbooks and you and zach never went to school with anybody named dana.
17790,Susan,yeah. i got it.
15744,Susan,what an excellent question.
15745,Susan,"and this is the, uh, spinal cord. and it, of course, attaches to the brain."
13699,Susan,"there wasn't enough time. he did say one thing that was kind of mysterious. he said something happened to someone named dana, and that he could never ever talk about it."""
13704,Susan,are you finished?
15752,Susan,it's all right. 'cause i feel guilty too. that's why we should just stop this right now because it's all way too complicated and i think we'd both be happier if we just went back to being friends.
15753,Susan,"well, if we can't be friends than i guess we'll be nothing."
13707,Susan,"oh this?"" ""well, i have a date. right now. with mike. we kissed. fyi."
15755,Susan,"well, i was at my friend bree's engagement party the other night. you know when you came in and you did that whole 'orson killed his wife' thing. i was just wondering if you could elaborate."
17801,Susan,"what do you mean, the way i act?"
17802,Susan,"okay. it-it's a little uncomfortable, is whole situation. i mean, if m.j.'s picking up on it, how am i supposed to fix that?"
17805,Susan,you're welcome.
17807,Susan,so how is katherine's foot?
15763,Susan,"bree, we have to talk."
15767,Susan,"well, it's nice to see you two getting along again."
13720,Susan,i beg your pardon?
15768,Susan,really? does that mean you're gonna be getting back together?
15769,Susan,"wow, is that shrimp?"
13723,Susan,where did you say they were going tonight?
13724,Susan,i don't know why i let you talk me into coming here. there is obviously nothing going on between them.
15771,Susan,what are you doing here?
17819,Susan,thank you. can i go clubbing with you tonight?
13727,Susan,"good night, edie."
13728,Susan,and why would you root for me?
17822,Susan,"you, bob, andrew."
17828,Susan,i thought you had a housekeeper.
15781,Susan,"oh.a guest room.well, that's handy."
17829,Susan,"i just--jackson called earlier, and, um--you know, he went to riverton to visit his old art professor, and she offered him a job."
15784,Susan,hide pathetically in your room?
15786,Susan,great piano. do you play?
15787,Susan,right.
17836,Susan,oh! jazz!
13741,Susan,we've been introduced.
15794,Susan,are you saying that jane is the only woman you ever--
13750,Susan,"knock, knock!"
15799,Susan,"it's not that it's rude. it's just immaterial. i mean, it's just a number. it doesn't mean anything."
17848,Susan,"oh, thank god. you know, when i woke up next to you yesterday, i just didn't know what to think."
15802,Susan,nine lovers is not a lot! nine lovers does not make me a slut!
17850,Susan,yeah. now i can move in with jackson with a clear conscience.bgood. good.
17853,Susan,mike and i will never get back together. i know that now. and i really need to move on with my life.
15809,Susan,don't push it.
13762,Susan,"no, it's fine, just give me the key. i'll be around all day."
15810,Susan,"oh, no, i don't mean to break the flow, but i just, um--look, i know that i'm only your second lover ever, and that, i, i know that means a lot, and i just don't want it to mean--too much."
13764,Susan,"well, what? realistically, i've known this guy a few weeks. i mean, he could be a hit man for the mob!"
17859,Susan,"jackson got a teaching job at the college in riverton, and--i'm going with him."
13766,Susan,"yeah, and he retired. i try not to take that personally."
15814,Susan,get out!
15817,Susan,what could be more romantic?
15823,Susan,what? what were you gonna say?
13776,Susan,what is wrong with you? lassie would have had a fire truck here by now! stupid dog.
15824,Susan,shh. do you mind? you're kind of drowning out the bells.
17874,Susan,i don't know. i'm not sure. what are you doing?
15829,Susan,"oh, ian, i just took a week off. i couldn't possibly justify taking another."
15830,Susan,"well, okay. you gotta promise me we'll actually leave the hotel room."
13786,Susan,"well, so, in your mind, is the date off?"
15834,Susan,"mike woke up. um, julie, when, when did he--julie? julie! oh, damn it! oh, my god. oh! oh, my god! um, uh, i, i, i have to go. um, i gotta get out of here."
13788,Susan,"well, i wouldn't know because you never let me in. you know, there's this whole part of your life that you keep completely walled off."
17888,Susan,it's the way you are with men-- they're like tissues. you use one and then toss it away and then you're on to the next one. at least i'm looking for something real.
17895,Susan,"aw, come on, edie. i said i was sorry."
13801,Susan,"it helps, huh?"
17897,Susan,"oh, thank god! we've been locked in here all night."
15854,Susan,"oh. okay. right, you, you, um, you sleep. i'll come back tomorrow."
13807,Susan,later? what's wrong with now?
15856,Susan,"so the doctor said i should use as many things as i can to jog your memory. and not just pictures.he said i could use tastes and smells and sounds, so tonight is sounds of the seventies."
15857,Susan,"well, you know, let me set the scene. um, we were at this funky little fish joint that you'd been dying to take me to--cappy's. do you remember cappy's? okay, well, we were there, and, uh, we were just wolfing down the most delicious trout ever--"
17902,Susan,"jackson, hi. do you have a sec?"
13811,Susan,"oh, that's okay. i've got it."
15859,Susan,"at the car wash, whoa, whoa--"
13813,Susan,sure. do you want to tell me why you had your foot in john rowland's crotch yesterday?
17910,Susan,we're getting a wreath for eli's funeral. are you in?
15865,Susan,"oh, i'm just going to see mike delfino."
15869,Susan,you!
15870,Susan,i've been wondering why mike's been so cold to me. now it all makes sense.
17917,Susan,"oh, thanks, but don't be. just hurry. karl said he was coming by to get some of his stuff, and i want this place to be a fortress by then."
17919,Susan,what do you mean?
13826,Susan,"oh no, isn't helen rowland going last?"
15877,Susan,shh! i thought you could use some fresh air.
17926,Susan,thanks.
15881,Susan,punch it!
13840,Susan,"julie, in the letters, did zach say anything about running away?"
17939,Susan,"thank you for agreeing to see us, mr. hobson. running a school like oakridge mustn't leave you with much--free time."
17940,Susan,so i heard through the grapevine that there might be an opening for another student?
15894,Susan,"damn straight! you lie, you cheat, you scheme! you ruin people's relationships! i mean, how do you sleep at night?"
17942,Susan,"well, you wouldn't have to worry about that with m.j.. he's so well-behaved."
15902,Susan,"oh, uh, they're moving along. it's a process."
13857,Susan,my oven's out.
15905,Susan,you have--
15906,Susan,mike? it's me. are you decent?
15909,Susan,"oh, you know, what the hell? she's sixteen.if she hasn't figured out how to feed herself by now, i've failed."
17957,Susan,what? mike bought those? he bought her pearls?
17959,Susan,i'm going crazy 'cause i think i left my front door unlocked. could you run and check? i'll stay on the line.
15912,Susan,it was spur-of-the-moment.
13866,Susan,"julie, what else can i do? he can't stay here!"
13867,Susan,"he's right. sorry, guys!"
15916,Susan,i had passion with mike. and drama. lots of drama. love isn't supposed to be that hard.
13869,Susan,thank you.
13870,Susan,"young lady, we need to talk about what you did."
15918,Susan,i'm ida greenberg!
17966,Susan,"well, he did."
13873,Susan,"yeah, well, someone had to be responsible, and like it or not, i've got a birth certificate that says i'm your mother."
15922,Susan,"nothing. i just had a few drinks with my girlfriends, and thank god, because it gave me the courage to come over here and tell you really in my heart."
17968,Susan,"but you can't go around blowing your kid's money on jewelry for your girlfriend. what did these cost you? $4,000, $5,000?"
13876,Susan,"yeah, but--"
13877,Susan,i was in bad shape back then.
15924,Susan,"oh, i'm so sorry that you had to see that."
13879,Susan,thanks for your help with zach before.
17972,Susan,i didn't know they were fake.
13884,Susan,"well, i can't talk to you about everything."
17982,Susan,he's sick. i'm late. thanks for helping.
15936,Susan,what is this?
15937,Susan,edie's nephew? since when are you friends with him?
15938,Susan,did you have any?
15939,Susan,"oh,i cannot believe your timing.i'm about to fly off to paris,and you're inviting boys over for oktoberfest."
15940,Susan,"the last time i checked, i was the parent."
17985,Susan,well--listen to me. the whole reason i went back to work is so we could both afford to give m.j. the things we felt he needed. now i'm doing my part. it's time you do yours.
17990,Susan,that's cute. where's mike?
15943,Susan,"nope, we're fine. besides, i can't leave until julie gets back with my toothpaste."
15944,Susan,really?
15947,Susan,"no, no, i am not gonna spend your money."
13901,Susan,give my best to brandi.
15949,Susan,"hello? yes, this is her mother. what?"
17999,Susan,"no, sweetie. we are just trying to figure out what is best for you. aren't we?"
15952,Susan,"listen, i have somebody in the car who's late for a plane. can you give me two minutes?"
15954,Susan,"hello, carolyn."
13911,Susan,"oh! well, that's great!"
15960,Susan,what?
13913,Susan,"you're not mad, are you?"
13915,Susan,"no. no, no, no. you obviously think you have some insight into my soul, so please, go ahead, dazzle me."
15964,Susan,"excuse me, my name is susan mayer."
18013,Susan,you think i don't feed my kid?
15967,Susan,"attention! attention, carolyn bigsby!"
15969,Susan,"let julie go and take me instead. repeat, take me. i will be a model hostage. if we have a deal, signal by sending julie to the--"
13922,Susan,what?
15970,Susan,"no, take your hands off me! carolyn, carolyn! call my cell! it's 572--"
18023,Susan,why would we do that?
13929,Susan,"uh, edie, it's not his birthday."
15979,Susan,"yeah, it's been a week. i'm getting on her nerves."
13932,Susan,you want to hear me sing?
15983,Susan,"oh, let it go. we came home because i was worried about you, and with good reason. you, put on your shirt and get out."
15984,Susan,who cares? go!
18034,Susan,"okay, you know what? let me show you something i think might change your mind. so katherine has a picture that i painted for mike hanging over her mantelpiece."
13941,Susan,"you're an ass, you know that?"
18038,Susan,"all right, you guys think what you want. i'm gonna choose to believe her."
13944,Susan,"what is it? i'm really, really busy."
15993,Susan,"are you crazy?! if we don't do something, those two could end up having sex!"
15995,Susan,how can you be so calm about this?
18044,Susan,"hey, katherine."
15998,Susan,"ah, cutting to the chase. i like it. i have a confession to make. this whole dating drama has been keeping me up at night, and i hate being the bi*chy, naggy mom. when it comes to parenting, i am much more comfortable playing the good cop. do you see where i'm going with this, kids?"
18047,Susan,no.
16003,Susan,how did that come up?
18051,Susan,"yep. i'm complicated like that. aren't you glad you divorced me? if you two want a painting so bad, paint your own."
13957,Susan,"well, actually, i do, yeah. excuse me!"
16005,Susan,that is the subject!
16007,Susan,it's not what you think.
18054,Susan,"i'm missing my small candy dish. i had it last night when you guys were over for dinner, because i remember orson admiring it."
18058,Susan,"jessie, you said that i could plan the lesson today, and i think this is valuable. i'm just trying to be creative."
18059,Susan,"an evaluation? well, that is when someone judges your work and gives you a grade on it. but don't worry. i'm not doing that today."
16012,Susan,"no, i'm good. thanks."
18060,Susan,who?
13966,Susan,"well, if anyone can go the distance, he can. i should know."
18064,Susan,i'm so glad you could make it. i know i sprung this on you at the last minute.
16018,Susan,"oh, thank god! we were all so worried we were losing you. okay, now i'm hugging you. oh, it's amazing. your life is such an adventure. can't wait to see what you do next."
18066,Susan,"oh, well, you know, i just think that school is such a formal environment, and i thought it would be nice if we could let loose and drink a little wine, get to know each other. oh, my gosh."
18067,Susan,look at you. you're like that schoolmarm in the movies who lets down her hair and va-va-va-voom.
13981,Susan,"well, you get to build your dream house, for free. i mean, in a weird way, your house burning down was really a good thing."
18078,Susan,i don't know.
16031,Susan,"well, that explains why he was a little cold to me this morning."
13985,Susan,my junior year. how'd you know?
16035,Susan,i don't need much. one of those will do.
13989,Susan,"okay. look, uh, i, i just haven't always treated you well, and i want to make amends."
16038,Susan,"hi, rupert! i went to the mall and bought a change of clothes for the weekend, and while i was there, i got something for you. i thought you could wear it on your day off. do you like it?"
18085,Susan,"oh, well, that kiss was all you."
13992,Susan,"so, what are you waiting for?"
13994,Susan,are you okay?
16043,Susan,"no, i just, um--well, all i really needed was just a little-- little drawer, and, uh--this is just so far away and what is that smell?"
18090,Susan,excuse me?
13997,Susan,"well, it's, it's really no, no big deal."
18091,Susan,"though i would definitely appreciate the--beauty of the gazelle, uh, if i was going to take a trip to africa--"
16047,Susan,"fine. fine, fine, fine, fine."
16049,Susan,"okay, you are not allowed to call me that."
18097,Susan,"look, i need this job. but even if i didn't, i would still like you as a person."
18102,Susan,"hey, karl."
18104,Susan,"wow, and i was worried that we'd be out of each other's lives forever. mm, lucky, lucky."
14010,Susan,"oh, you don't have to. well, this is good. thank you. i guess i should go take a shower and wash mrs. huber off of me."
18107,Susan,"evan, why don't you head into the classroom? i need to talk to your daddy, and i may need to use some grown-up words."
14016,Susan,she's only fourteen!
18121,Susan,would this seem any less shocking if i told you we were once married for 12 years?
16074,Susan,thank you. you are a lifesaver.
16075,Susan,oh?
14032,Susan,"so if you had a problem, or some sort of secret was weighing on you--"
14035,Susan,"well, the other day he could have cared less about julie and zach dating, and now, all of a sudden, he shows up at the dance?"
14036,Susan,maybe.
16083,Susan,what? why?
16085,Susan,oh.
14039,Susan,i'd love to.
16087,Susan,what?
18135,Susan,"the woman is dead, people. let's honor her memory."
14046,Susan,"oh, of course. i assumed as much."
14047,Susan,"no, of course he didn't. so, what happened exactly?"
16095,Susan,"i mean, of course he's totally innocent. i'm just trying to help him find a lawyer."
16096,Susan,"yeah. edie dumped him. okay, i know how this looks but i just feel bad. he's just a friend now."
16099,Susan,so did you tell the police that you think orson killed monique?
14052,Susan,what's that?
18147,Susan,"oh, hi, helen. ed. i would have introduced you, but once helen starts talking, she doesn't shut up."
18148,Susan,"oh, you met ed?"
14055,Susan,really.
16104,Susan,"if you're so sure that orson is innocent, why don't we go through his things? where's his desk?"
18153,Susan,i can't forget something like this. helen is my very good friend.
14059,Susan,zach was telling julie about what happened to dana.
18156,Susan,i don't think so.
14075,Susan,what if he doesn't?
18172,Susan,good. we got some ground to make up. i was hoping we would be able to get there before dark.
14077,Susan,"oh, um, so can i come over? i, i really need to talk to you about something."
16125,Susan,"well, mine haven't, and i know something that bree probably doesn't. when orson was seventeen, he spent time in a mental institution."
18177,Susan,"god, she is so good at that."
14084,Susan,"here's the thing, i don't think i'm ready to have another baby. i think we need to have a serious conversation."
16133,Susan,"yeah, and he is fantastic. you cannot believe the scum he has gotten off. not that you're scum. but, you know, if you were, you'd be sitting pretty."
16134,Susan,"oh, well, you know, we'll figure that out later."
16135,Susan,"um, yeah, about that--it's ian. he's not crazy about me spending time with my ex."
16136,Susan,"i remember, and i guess that's enough for him. i'm sorry."
14089,Susan,i don't believe this. you're leaving without even trying to talk me into having your baby? i mean how do you know i wouldn't cave. i always cave.
16138,Susan,"detective ridley, my name is susan mayer, and i'm calling to ""drop a dime"" on someone. that's the expression, right?"
16143,Susan,bree? uh--hi. can you hold on a second?
16144,Susan,it's orson's wife. she can't know i called you.
18192,Susan,"i was cooking, all right?"
18195,Susan,at you? why?
14101,Susan,you shot yourself?
14103,Susan,is that blood?
16151,Susan,hi. i brought you a bundt cake. don't worry.i didn't make it.
14105,Susan,"now, did he? we don't know that for sure. all we know is that lynette's kids turned up with it."
16153,Susan,so alma's alive. big deal. we still don't know what went down between orson and monique.
18202,Susan,"uh, wait. could you maybe have one right now so that i know that you actually ate something?"
18203,Susan,"dave, i know that you're going through hell, but edie was my friend, so please, let me help you. just a little."
14109,Susan,"don't be silly. why would i do that? no, i've just been really busy grocery shopping."
18204,Susan,you sure you don't want one? it's really good.
14111,Susan,can you hold these a sec?
16160,Susan,ian. wait!
18207,Susan,"okay, well--at least you're making plans for the future."
18209,Susan,how about a pot of coffee? or i could just--straighten up in here?
18212,Susan,"i'll call in sick, take the day off."
16166,Susan,"well, that's just crazy! why are you acting like a crazy person?"
14119,Susan,"oh. oh, my god, yes. yes, yes, i was with mike that night."
18216,Susan,"yes, officer?"
14122,Susan,how did you know?
16170,Susan,"well, i'm saying it now.i love you. do you have a problem with that? no, ma'am."
18218,Susan,right. i know that. i just was worried about a friend so i forgot. i'm sorry.
14125,Susan,"no, not really, no. so guess what? i'm your alibi. i told the police that we were together the night that mrs. huber was killed and that i could never forget that night."
14127,Susan,sure. when?
18223,Susan,"oh, yes, sir!"
18225,Susan,i'm sorry. it's just-- the things you said--i'm worried about you.
14131,Susan,"uh, let me get my purse."
14133,Susan,i'm sure i won't be late. bye.
16181,Susan,"oh, thank god. if you're not having sex, why were you talking about condoms?"
14136,Susan,no.
16184,Susan,"don't say ""uh-huh"" like that.julie wouldn't lie to me.if she says she's not having sex,then she's not having sex."
14138,Susan,"he dropped his gun, cleaning it."
18235,Susan,"that's what we said, but it wasn't true. he took the blame for me."
18237,Susan,"the wife hired the sleaziest, most unethical divorce lawyer in town."
16190,Susan,"no, you cannot borrow it."
14146,Susan,"how could you? god, 'susan, do you trust me?' yes, of course i do. oh, i'm such an idiot, and you're such a liar. oh, and apparently a killer, and a drug dealer. that's just quite a personal ad you've got going there."
16195,Susan,you got my daughter the pill?!
16196,Susan,don't you walk away from me!
14151,Susan,"oh, julie, zach, this is ridiculous. you can't hold your breath forever."
14152,Susan,"oh, you might as well just stay under there and never come up for air because when you do, i'm gonna choke the living daylights out of you."
14153,Susan,"oh, um, is my daughter under there?"
16199,Susan,"oh, you know what? it wasn't till your rotten nephew came to town that julie was a perfect kid, and now she's lying and scheming and having casual sex! she's just a boob job away from being you!"
14155,Susan,"oh, i, okay, i'm, i'm sorry. uh, i'll just, i'm just gonna leave those right there."
16201,Susan,"well, of course i freaked out. i'm a parent. you know, we hope that our children will wait to have sex till after we're dead."
16202,Susan,"okay, that's the other thing. that cannot happen anymore. you and i have always had an amazing relationship. let's not mess it up now."
14158,Susan,hi.
18249,Susan,i'm taking her to the doctor so he can perform a little procedure.
18252,Susan,i'll see you tomorrow.
18257,Susan,"oh, i'm sorry. just, um, all these months, i've been telling myself that i didn't really care about you, which was easy to do because you left so suddenly. but i am so lonely. and as much as i tell myself that i like being the strong, single woman on her own, the truth is, i think about you all the time. and i wanted to call you, but i thought you'd gotten over me. and to hear that you still love me--that is just something that i really needed to hear right now. and i want you to know--oh, god. i want you to know i love you, too. jackson--i love you. jackson?"
16211,Susan,my feelings for him? are we gonna do this again?
14164,Susan,who is it?
14165,Susan,"oh, edie, not now. i'm kind of busy."
18263,Susan,maximum allowance exceeded.
18265,Susan,"oh, i'm not mad at you. you know, i'm just disappointed in myself. i was a little lonely and a little afraid and--i just did what i always do--let some silly romantic fantasy take over."
18266,Susan,"i don't. this isn't about you. not really. and besides, you moved on."
16219,Susan,"oh, come on. mike needs a great lawyer. zach can afford a great lawyer."
16220,Susan,it's one little date.
18268,Susan,i'll help you.
18269,Susan,"yeah. i'll do it. but that's it. no love, no sex, just--marriage."
14175,Susan,why do you even care?
14176,Susan,okay. all right. give me a minute. i'll go change my clothes.
18271,Susan,"oh, my god. we're not gonna be able to make it this weekend. i'm kind of--getting married."
18272,Susan,we're not gonna be able to make it this weekend. i'm kind of getting married.
16232,Susan,jane cheated on ian? when was this?
14185,Susan,"paul. you know, he said it was an accident,but i'm telling you, i think that's why mary alice was being blackmailed."
14186,Susan,yeah. the girls and i found a threatening note in her stuff.
18281,Susan,not that lonely.
18285,Susan,"well, uh, we wanted you two to be the first to know, and we should probably get going. got a few more neighbors to shock."
16239,Susan,hey. you're back.
18288,Susan,right! score for you!
18289,Susan,"uh, can i talk to you for a sec?"
16242,Susan,i can't see you anymore. i want you to understand it doesn't have anything to do with you. it's just--
16243,Susan,it's not--
18292,Susan,"it's canada, not iran. it's like america with free health insurance. okay, i know this is important to you, but i depend on that check every month."
14198,Susan,angela -- that's what mary alice used to call herself.
18297,Susan,"uh, well--okay, you know what? mike's probably gonna tell you anyway, so just don't tell anyone else, okay?"
18298,Susan,it depends. jackson and i are only getting married because he needs his green card.
14205,Susan,we're broken up. i thought i made that pretty clear.
14207,Susan,the police showed me your rap sheet. you killed a man.
16256,Susan,"i'm sorry for eavesdropping, but don't you think your conversation is a little inappropriate? i mean, we're here to grieve, not cruise."
18311,Susan,we're getting married.
14216,Susan,that it explains everything.
14217,Susan,i haven't read it.
18315,Susan,"hey, dave. i was gonna call you."
18317,Susan,"i wish i could, but i can't. i'm worried about jackson."
18318,Susan,"dave, i haven't heard jackson since he was taken away and i just wanna be here in case he calls."
18319,Susan,i'd just feel more comfortable if i'm close by.
14225,Susan,"thanks, i will."
18322,Susan,he'll be fine.
16275,Susan,hey.
18323,Susan,hello?
14229,Susan,aren't you dating edie?
18325,Susan,so they're sending you back? when?
14233,Susan,i do. i really do.
18329,Susan,"yeah, but, no, this doesn't make any sense because mike knew that it wasn't for real."
16283,Susan,it's true. he's gonna be a free man. isn't that great?
18332,Susan,"i think that bree is right--that the more tom sees you digging in your heels, the more he's gonna wanna do it."
14238,Susan,"no. no, i wanted to check with you first."
16291,Susan,"ian, oh, you can't be serious. oh, oh, that's just--too much. it's huge."
14244,Susan,he just wants to buy me a burrito.
14245,Susan,"okay, i won't go out with him. i mean obviously you have feeling for him."
18339,Susan,mm. shower's off. i guess we'll know in a few seconds.
18344,Susan,"um, yeah. i--katherine already told me about your big news."
14249,Susan,hey!
18347,Susan,"ooh. hey. um, can i talk to you a sec?"
16300,Susan,was that the ring that you bought for--
18348,Susan,"um, no, thanks. so, look, uh.. i'm sorry if i was a little under-enthusiastic the other day about you and katherine getting married."
18352,Susan,just answer the question.
14258,Susan,i don't mean to be babbling. it's just really complicated and there is so much about mike you don't even know.
14259,Susan,you tracked us down?
14264,Susan,what does that mean?
16313,Susan,"it's so great to finally meet both of you. oh, this is for you."
14266,Susan,"well, no, he didn't."
14267,Susan,"okay, mr. let's-just-have-fun-cause-i'm-the-charming-casual-contractor-man. you chased me, so own it, my friend!"
14268,Susan,i was meaning to. i guess i do invite the drama in. just a little.
14269,Susan,now that is just perfect. stay put.
14270,Susan,hey mom.
18365,Susan,"oh, the joys of being a parent."
18366,Susan,you do?
16321,Susan,no. of course not.
16323,Susan,"yeah, well, with karl, i was more, ""divorce the ass and seize the assets."" so you better watch out. betrayal makes me vengeful."
14283,Susan,"yeah, you know, it's the third time around for both of you, and you're really clicking. it gives me hope."
18382,Susan,"okay. here, m.j."
16335,Susan,"trust him, he's not."
14288,Susan,why would he shove you?
17494,Susan,thank you.
18387,Susan,i'm fine.
14293,Susan,"well, that's because you tell people that."
17495,Susan,hear what?
18391,Susan,what are you gonna do to us?
16346,Susan,we got it. just go.
16347,Susan,what's that?
14300,Susan,"wow, i'm just dragging today, shall we put on another pot of coffee?"
14302,Susan,lynette!
17497,Susan,"gaby, juanita's fat for your age."
14305,Susan,"oh oh oh. you don't have to gasp, my mother exaggerates."
14309,Susan,are you alright?
14310,Susan,"oh, i'm so sorry. here lean your head back."
18405,Susan,mike! mike! mike! stop! no! m.j.! m.j.!
14313,Susan,"no, it's just a nose bleed, she's fine."
16362,Susan,that was the first night that we spent together.
14315,Susan,that's not true.
18410,Susan,what do you think?
16366,Susan,oh. okay.
16367,Susan,to london? permanently?
16368,Susan,"yeah, it's sudden. my whole life is here. i mean, my friends. you know, julie is still in school--"
16369,Susan,"oh, my god. are you okay?"
16370,Susan,i can feel the car sinking. we're gonna have to get to shore.
18421,Susan,"if he's not gone in five minutes, then i'm going to go out there and tell him how old you really are."
14330,Susan,"morty, i'd like to have a relationship again. and at my age, with a kid, if she moves in to my house, even for a couple of years, i'm doomed."
14331,Susan,"i am - i mean, i was. it didn't work out."
0,Bree,"there we go. feel better? lynette, you were saying?"
2,Bree,"it was no trouble at all. now the basket with the red ribbon is just for you and zachary. it's got rolls, muffins, breakfast type things."
2050,Bree,looking for you. how did you get that bruise?
2051,Bree,"andrew, please!"
7,Bree,"so susan, is he going to stop seeing that woman?"
2055,Bree,"andrew. andrew! andrew, please! andrew!"
2057,Bree,"yeah, it's nice to know that i can raise some things correctly."
10,Bree,"danielle, there is nothing abnormal about basil puree."
13,Bree,excuse me?
15,Bree,are you doing drugs?
2063,Bree,"oh, i'm not talking about a lie--just a polite fiction to explain to everybody where you've been. i mean, we can't possibly tell them that you've been living on skid row, sleeping in a cardboard box."
4113,Bree,george!
19,Bree,andrew. this is family time. i think we should all--
20,Bree,"i know that you think i'm angry about coming here, but i'm not. i mean, the kids wanted a change of pace, something fun. i get it. probably will want something healthier tomorrow night though, i'm thinking about chicken?"
22,Bree,"okay, well, i got you the honey mustard dressing; the ranch looked just a little bit suspect."
2071,Bree,"orson, i saw the two of you whispering right after dr. keck ran off. what happened?"
4119,Bree,"well, who says he has to know how i spend my free time?"
4121,Bree,no.
2078,Bree,"howard keck? oh, that's ridiculous. he's got a wife and a daughter. he plays on tom scavo's bowling team."
31,Bree,we all do.
4127,Bree,proceed.
2084,Bree,she told me she got it from wearing someone else's bathing suit.
37,Bree,"it's the age-old question, isn't it? how much do we really wanna know about our neighbours?"
2087,Bree,"hello, vera. i made you some of those, uh, shortbread biscuits that you like so much."
42,Bree,you promised.
2092,Bree,"i'm sorry. i just felt that if it were me, i"
45,Bree,"and so, there's just the four of us. my oldest son andrew is 16, danielle is 15, and?"
48,Bree,what? i-i'm sorry.
2099,Bree,i just--i've tried so hard to set a good example. i've done the best i could to teach you kids right from wrong. why isn't it taking?
56,Bree,"oh, who cares what he thinks? i took psychology in college, we learned all about freud. a miserable human being."
57,Bree,"well, think about it. he grew up in the late 1800's, there were no appliances back then. his mother had to do everything by hand, just backbreaking work from sunup to sundown. not to mention the countless other sacrifices she probably had to make to take care of her family. and what does he do? he grows up and becomes famous, peddling a theory that the problems of most adults can be traced back to something awful their mother has done. there you go."
2110,Bree,"oh, and, gus, the carpet is beautiful."
65,Bree,"please hurry, if the kids see you sleeping down here, they're gonna start asking questions."
2118,Bree,"andrew, please don't interrupt me while i'm speaking.true, i never bought her eldest daughter a gift, but you know my policy: no husband, no baby gift. now what is it, dear?"
71,Bree,i think it's a great idea.
79,Bree,"well, given that we're hosting it, i say so. by the way, you won't be drinking at this party."
80,Bree,"because when you drink, you get chatty. no one needs to know that we're seeing dr. goldfine."
84,Bree,"private sessions? i don't understand, why do we need private sessions?"
2135,Bree,so--what do we owe you for all this progress?
2137,Bree,"oh, mr. faladi, i'm not here to threaten you. i've come to give you my blessing."
95,Bree,"hey, where've you been?"
2143,Bree,"oh, and one more thing--"
2144,Bree,danielle is applying to colleges. i do hope she can count on you for a glowing recommendation.
4090,Bree,i told him i don't love him. he said he doesn't care. he wants us to work on our marriage.
102,Bree,"there. obviously, if you've forgotten anything, you can, um, come right back and get it."
2152,Bree,"well, i can appreciate how difficult that must have been for you. apology accepted."
2155,Bree,two lemonades for the victors.
108,Bree,"well, why can't you?"
2156,Bree,"hello, tish."
2158,Bree,"rebecca, i just spoke to her. and call me paranoid, but amy griswold did the same thing to me on the golf course last week. what is going on?"
112,Bree,"well, it's now or never. i saw what he's asking for the place it's going to sell really quickly."
2160,Bree,carolyn knows tish?
2163,Bree,"hello.i'd like to make a reservation for this evening under the names hodge and bigsby, and, um, we'll be needing a table in the center of the room."
2165,Bree,"oh! do you two know each other? well, that saves me an introduction.uh, tish, you know, i was wondering if you need any help with the christmas gala. last year, i was on the decorating committee--"
120,Bree,"well, i want to talk to you."
121,Bree,where were you last night?
2168,Bree,"oh, i'd love to."
123,Bree,"andrew, don't change the subject."
2170,Bree,no. why?
2172,Bree,this is not possible.
126,Bree,if the school and the paediatrician both think that the twins could stand to be medicated-then what's the problem?
127,Bree,"lynette, you are a great mother. but let's face it, your kids are a challenge."
2177,Bree,#name?
2178,Bree,should we go introduce ourselves?
133,Bree,where's your cell phone?
2184,Bree,carolyn.
138,Bree,"you think that's bad? tomorrow morning i'm cleaning it! oh, by the way keith, i didn't get the chance to tell you, that was a lovely solo last week in church."
139,Bree,i hope it wasn't anything i said.
140,Bree,"so andrew, shall we?"
2188,Bree,"i used to think that, too. then i met you. good day."
142,Bree,"i'm staying for the show. i'm dying to see what all the fuss is about. excuse me, waitress, i'll have a glass of your house chardonnay."
143,Bree,"i'm curious, andrew, as you fantasise about this woman, do you ever stop and think how she came to be on this runway?"
2191,Bree,okay. does the name monique mean anything to you?
2192,Bree,"coffee's almost ready, and if you'd prefer to watch the coverage on channel 9, it's on in the den. orson, greta needs a coaster."
146,Bree,"and-now she treats herself the way that other mean treat her. like an object, a piece of meat."
2193,Bree,"oh, it's just awful. deviled egg?"
2194,Bree,"andrew, honey, would you please get the phone?"
151,Bree,"andrew, i know you blame me for what's happening with your father, but it's not entirely my fault and i need you to understand that."
2200,Bree,you can peel a clove of garlic.
155,Bree,"but, wait, what about the tape? she did say that her name was angela."
2204,Bree,i'm starting my cards early this year. it puts me in the mood to spread holiday cheer.
157,Bree,are you okay?
158,Bree,"oh,please! i would have hosted it myself, only the kids are going away to the mountains tomorrow and there's camping equipment everywhere."
161,Bree,so you want me to lie?
166,Bree,almost. thanks again for driving them to the bus.
2214,Bree,hi.
168,Bree,"well,that doesn't make it any less frightening. i mean, he could have been a sexual predator."
169,Bree,"oh,rex! that's not the point."
2216,Bree,"oh, i'm--i'm so sorry. the nurse pointed me over here. i'm looking for gloria hodge."
171,Bree,"rex, the truth is, with the kids gone i'll be all by myself in this house for the first time in seventeen years."
2217,Bree,"well, i must say, i'm surprised at how lucid you are. orson led me to believe--"
2220,Bree,and--
174,Bree,"honey, the marriage counselling might not work out, you need to get used to bad cooking."
2221,Bree,and how do you disappoint him?
2223,Bree,"well, i have a better idea. why don't you tell him yourself?"
2224,Bree,and i can't believe you told me that she was senile! you lied to me.
179,Bree,"wow,this place is just immaculate."
181,Bree,oh.
2229,Bree,"orson, why does she have to have an ulterior motive?"
188,Bree,i've never told anyone that story before.
191,Bree,you do?
2241,Bree,of course.
2242,Bree,"mother hodge, your food will get cold!"
2244,Bree,"well, your doctor has you on a low fat, low sodium diet. eight meals this week, eight times i've told you the same thing. so, who would like to say grace?"
197,Bree,"oh, i tried. but he was so nervous he actually started shaking and then he just left."
201,Bree,"hello,zachery. are you free for dinner tonight?"
2249,Bree,"right, from here i can see a bail bondsman and an adult bookshop."
205,Bree,"oh, hi,rex. how are you? is something wrong?"
2256,Bree,are you insane? she obviously can't be on her own.
2258,Bree,and i will not hear another word on the subject.
2265,Bree,i'll deal with you later.
2279,Bree,decided?
2280,Bree,i don't think that's any of your concern.
236,Bree,you're dining alone?
2284,Bree,"oh, no, no, these things practically build themselves."
2287,Bree,i can't. not yet. i need some time to think.
241,Bree,is that how you see me? as some sort of prude who just lays there like a cold fish? i love sex.
2289,Bree,what in the world?
2291,Bree,"orson, it's me again. please call. we need to talk."""
252,Bree,because i think it is better to fix what you already have.
253,Bree,"you humiliated me, rex. for no good reason."
259,Bree,"why not? we haven't had sex for months, rex. most normal, red-blooded men would be climbing the walls by now."
2309,Bree,so you stayed in a loveless marriage because of your mother?
2315,Bree,"oh, thank god!"
271,Bree,"and so does andrew! blaming his actions on our problems--"" ""--does not help him."
272,Bree,"mrs. stark, you handle this however you see fit."
2319,Bree,"yes, i know--with monique polier."
2321,Bree,"um, actually,we have a guest."
277,Bree,"is, is that what you would prefer, danielle? to live with your father."
281,Bree,"oh, is she now! and when you were planning on telling me?"
283,Bree,"a car? a modeling academy? you should have discussed these gifts with me first. i'm sorry kids, but we cannot accept them."
284,Bree,i said no.
2336,Bree,"well, when you're wrong, you're wrong."
289,Bree,"oh, i'm throwing you out. i've separated all your things into two sides. one side is yours, danielle, and the other one is andrews."
2337,Bree,"now that we're all assembled, i'd like to introduce the guest of honor. i hope you'll all be as delighted to meet her as i was. you can come in now."
2341,Bree,detective ridley. can i help you?
2342,Bree,"oh, well, i'm afraid he's not here, but i will be happy to tell him that you came by."
2346,Bree,i told you that in confidence.
299,Bree,our son could spent the rest of his life in jail. i won't allow that.
2351,Bree,"oh, make no mistake, our friendship is over."
306,Bree,because i have faith in the poor.
2355,Bree,what?
311,Bree,"we still have so much to teach them. for starters, we need to get across to andrew the enormity of what he's done."
320,Bree,we should probably be going.
2370,Bree,this isn't a social call. we need to talk.
2372,Bree,you're my husband's ex-wife. you disappeared so people would think he killed you.does my discomfort really need any further explanation?
325,Bree,"of course not. it's just that the accident probably stirred up a lot of emotions, and it would be normal for you to be feeling confused or depressed or ashamed--"
2374,Bree,that's not true.
2377,Bree,"uh, yes, i need to speak to my husband. yes, there is. could you please ask him to come home as early as possible tonight? thank you."
330,Bree,"andrew, you almost killed another human being."
333,Bree,she'll be fine. what do you think's happening with lynette?
334,Bree,lynette? honey?
2381,Bree,i don't care!i am not sleeping in a bed that had your dead mistress' teeth in it!let's just take them to the police.
2385,Bree,i wouldn't worry about orson's soul. he won't be sleeping with alma.
2393,Bree,he's not sleeping. he's out cold.
346,Bree,"well, if it insures he grows up with some trace of humanity, then that's a risk i'm willing to take!"
2396,Bree,were you expecting this?
352,Bree,why?
356,Bree,why are you smiling?
2405,Bree,"okay, this is no joke. she raped you, and your mother helped. look, after we get dressed, we're going to the police."
2413,Bree,"no, you're not."
2415,Bree,"make no mistake,our friendship is over."
371,Bree,rex!
374,Bree,"oh, susan, you look so gorgeous."" ""doesn't she, edie?"
375,Bree,"gabrielle, you have to change the lineup. susan has to go last. nothing is going to top this."
376,Bree,"hi, danielle, how was school?"
382,Bree,hello.
383,Bree,i could ask you the same question.
2431,Bree,gloria? what are you doing here?
2432,Bree,i'm so sleepy.
2433,Bree,andrew? danielle?
387,Bree,"oh, okay. i tell you what then. why don't you just call up your mystery woman and invite her over. i'll pull out the sofa bed and you can take her right there. andrew! danielle! daddy's gonna fornicate for us!"
2441,Bree,yes.
2442,Bree,"oh, darling, i don't deserve you."
2445,Bree,"well, hello there, julie."
399,Bree,"sure! why don't you, uh, come by tomorrow?"
400,Bree,"hello. this is she. yes, he's my husband."
401,Bree,"um, excuse me, i'm here to see rex van de kamp. apparently, he had a heart attack. i'm not sure when -"
402,Bree,could i at least poke my head in? i'm his wife.
403,Bree,yes. why?
2452,Bree,"oh, not until the early fall, but enough about me. this is your day--you and victor--who, by the way, i have not met yet."
2453,Bree,"it is so good to be back. i can't believe how much is happening. i mean, you and gaby getting married, and i'm having a baby. what's going on with you, lynette?"
407,Bree,"needs. like, sexual needs?"
2466,Bree,"oh,for heaven's sakes.orson,could you come help me,please?i'll remember this the next time you want money for leather pants."
2468,Bree,"look,this family's reputation is already hanging by a thread.i mean,first people thought that your stepfather was a wife killer,then your sister takes up with her history teacher,and now we're supposed to parade a little bastard up and down the street.we might as well sit on the porch and play banjos."
421,Bree,that's - between your father and me.
2471,Bree,yet another illustration of the fundamental selfishness of suicide.
2472,Bree,that is so kind of you.
2475,Bree,excuse me?
2476,Bree,"oh,well,i'm--i'm sorry about your vegetables,but that pine shields my view of the purcells' backyard,and if you had ever seen mr.purcell sunbathe,well,you'd know exactly what that tree means to me."
2478,Bree,"well,hello,mrs.mckeever."
433,Bree,you always say the nicest things.
2483,Bree,why must old ladies always do that?
2484,Bree,surely not over food.
2486,Bree,"you're missing the point! it's a convent,not the four seasons.you have mustard on your chin."
2488,Bree,"oh! no,no,i'm fine!i'm fine!"
2492,Bree,ohh.
2494,Bree,he's such a scamp.
2495,Bree,we are not throwing in the towel over a minor mishap.
2498,Bree,"you think danielle could raise this child?orson,you've seen her in action.she's--she's shallow,and she's--she's selfish!she would ruin this child's life!"
2500,Bree,"well,would that be so horrible?"
454,Bree,"thank you, george. that was a lovely evening."
2508,Bree,"yeah, let's do it. um, gaby, why don't you bring your vegetable lasagna? susan, you do beverages, and, uh, katherine, why don't you bring a simple green salad?"
461,Bree,yes.
2512,Bree,"well, thank you. i don't think i did anything differently."
465,Bree,"because i don't commit adultery like your father."" ""that's right. your father had an affair. i found out about it, and i'm just trying to move on with my life."
466,Bree,i'm packing up your father's things for when he eventually moves out.
470,Bree,"that's sweet, but i'm taking care of him because it's the right thing to do."
471,Bree,"andrew, you will not speak that way about your father in front of me."
2519,Bree,"oh, it gets worse. her pie was better than mine."
474,Bree,"you are? oh, that's wonderful."
480,Bree,i'd love to.
481,Bree,pick me up at one and we'll do something fun.
2528,Bree,"well, as long as we're swapping pie recipes, i would love the one for your fabulous lemon meringue."
2529,Bree,excuse me?
2539,Bree,"yes, and it has nothing to do with pie."
497,Bree,"oh, yeah. you always remember your first time. god, i hope i brought enough bullets."
2548,Bree,"god,it's getting harder and harder to keep her at arm's length. i never knew she was such a hugger."
501,Bree,"two, high hand grasp. three, hard grip. four, front sight. five, release the safety, and then squeeze the trigger slowly."
2556,Bree,"no. you know, i usually just call him ""doctor""."
510,Bree,i was just caught off guard.
2558,Bree,ah-choo!
513,Bree,oh george! what - what a surprise!
2561,Bree,you're 8 1/2 months pregnant! what in heaven's name were you doing roller-blading?
516,Bree,"well, i mean, wouldn't you keep hoping that in time i would feel the same way about you as you feel about me?"
518,Bree,i don't think you're pathetic. it's just that--i can't.
521,Bree,"oh my god! george, here."
2570,Bree,"oh, good! katherine, i was hoping we'd get a chance to chat. open this now."
2573,Bree,some wine?
2574,Bree,"edie, is that an engagement ring?"
2582,Bree,gaby!
2583,Bree,"orson, honey, where have you been?"
2584,Bree,"oh, my god."
2587,Bree,"i said i was sorry. for god sakes, susan, not everything is about you."
2589,Bree,it'll just take a few seconds. these damn cords--
544,Bree,"no, george, it's not okay. it was insensitive. i know how you feel about me, and i--"
548,Bree,"you are such a special man, george williams. and you deserve such a special woman."
549,Bree,"oh, he's chaperoning. he called a couple of hours ago and volunteered."
551,Bree,maybe he's just trying to be supportive.
553,Bree,"well, it must've been some sort of accident. i mean little boys don't just kill their baby sisters."
2601,Bree,it really is.
558,Bree,"yes. you know that's one of the things i hated most about our separation. not being able to throw dinner parties. there's just something so civilized and elegant about them, don't you think?"
559,Bree,let's just say that i put them in an imaginary box and don't plan on looking at them for a while.
2607,Bree,"well, i'm not giving it to her. can you think of a worse present for a pregnant girl?"
2610,Bree,"well, it's better than you breaking your neck on it."
2611,Bree,not without a helmet.
565,Bree,"oh, okay, um, maybe it's better that i don't know."
570,Bree,"yes. and i suppose we'll make love tomorrow night, too."
2620,Bree,it seems to me that you should go to the doctor again.
577,Bree,huh?
2628,Bree,i'm going to mingle.
581,Bree,it's a perversion.
2631,Bree,you hated your mother.
586,Bree,good night.
588,Bree,okay. so what's our control word?
2638,Bree,"we're saying that the baby is mine and orson's, and if you hover around like a grandmother, people will be suspicious."
2640,Bree,you think i don't know i'm a failure as a parent? that's why this child means so much to me. it's my second chance.
595,Bree,"you promised the cheating had stopped, rex. you promised."
599,Bree,andrew is still a child.
600,Bree,"honey, you have to talk to him."
2648,Bree,why would you say that?
2652,Bree,"what do you mean, she's gone? and you believed her? you idiot! i should sue your irresponsible ass off for this. yeah, well, good day to you, too, reverend mother!"
2653,Bree,"those stupid nuns at the convent let danielle's grandmother kidnap her. she claimed i'd given her permission for a weekend visit. phyllis! it's me. you can screen your calls all you want to, but trust me, old woman, you are in a world of trouble. i know where you live, and i am coming for you."
2656,Bree,what?
2661,Bree,what's so funny?
618,Bree,"danielle, you are president of the abstinence club."
2672,Bree,"oh, look, they have water aerobics. you should sign up."
626,Bree,oh.
2676,Bree,that's a nice picture of rex.
2677,Bree,"i know you're lonely, phyllis, but i can't give up this child just to make you feel better."
630,Bree,really?
2681,Bree,hello.
637,Bree,are you having an affair with my husband?
638,Bree,"ida! ida greenberg,that is not your paper!"
2686,Bree,"oh, we've been invited to bob and lee 's for halloween."
641,Bree,i can see that tisha is making the rounds. she must have some juicy new anecdote.
2689,Bree,sure! how familiar are you with pop icons from the '70s?
643,Bree,no.
645,Bree,"well, you heard your funny story, rex. why aren't you laughing?"
650,Bree,"i heard that there is a, um, little black book with the names of your clients in it."
654,Bree,i don't think it's asking that much. all you need to do is remove one little name.
2706,Bree,"that's not what i meant, and you know it, and as for your little imitation of me, i don't sound anything like that."
660,Bree,"serena, hi. how are you?"
2709,Bree,what's wrong?
664,Bree,"no, i think they're laughing at you. i think they feel sorry for me, which is just as mortifying."
665,Bree,"oh. we're gonna act like nothing is happening, and then, when we finish eating, we're going to walk out of here with all the dignity that we can muster."
2714,Bree,you're a dentist! what if there are complications?
673,Bree,"well, you keep coming up with excuses to use everyone's bathroom, and then two days ago, mr. cowley looked into your back yard and saw you and carlos doing your laundry in the jacuzzi."
674,Bree,"are you and carlos having some sort of money trouble? gabby, it's okay if you are."
2721,Bree,"uh, yeah, and he promised that no one would ever know what happened here tonight."
2729,Bree,"oh, she adores him. she just felt terrible that she had to leave for school so soon."
682,Bree,"andrew, you almost killed another human being!"
686,Bree,they've been in the drawer for a few months. i had a feeling we might be needing them.
687,Bree,we have to admit that we need help. if we can't get through to andrew then we have to find someone who can.
2736,Bree,that's why the procedure should be done on babies. they won't remember. now can we please just drop this?
2737,Bree,"so, susan , you mentioned something about bringing dessert. what is it?"
2743,Bree,what do you mean you can't help me?
2744,Bree,please feel free to show her this letter and assure her of its wide distribution to hospitals and physicians across this and two neighboring states.
698,Bree,"now, not five hours from now."
2748,Bree,they're-- unsightly. i do not want our son to be teased--for being different. do you?
2751,Bree,let me show you something. you see this breadmaker? this is where i hid a bottle of chardonnay after i told everyone i'd stopped drinking.
704,Bree,"i don't know. i mean, maybe it's part of the ritual."
707,Bree,"sweetheart, it's been clear to us for sometime now that you've been unhappy. all this acting out--"
2756,Bree,"i know it might seem tacky piggybacking on deborah's bris, but-- we could do it in the den very quietly."
2758,Bree,i should only have a nickel for every time i've heard that.
2759,Bree,"i would love that, but my husband orson --big, stubborn, goy. he says we should do nothing and let the child decide when he's grown. we don't pick our parents-- we should pick our religion?"
2761,Bree,i swear to you before god that this child will be as devout a jew as i am.
2763,Bree,it's just a little unsightly foreskin. he'll never miss it.
2768,Bree,"i know how much you love benjamin. i guess--i guess i just have to remember that it's love that makes us a family and not blood. your son would like you to hold him. by the way, his hebrew name is simcha. i'll explain later."
721,Bree,"well, i don't understand why."
2770,Bree,"no, he'll be sleeping with us."
725,Bree,i don't feel guilty.
728,Bree,if it were any other day.
2777,Bree,"oh, hello, dear. andrew, get orson's plate from the oven."
730,Bree,"porter, honey, those cookies are hot. just wait a few minutes and i'll give you one when they're cool, okay."
735,Bree,"don't be common, young man. now come on, if you play around with those cookies one more time i'll have to spank you."
745,Bree,i never said i was perfect.
2800,Bree,"hey, andrew. what are you doing?"
753,Bree,"yes, is it our turn?"
2810,Bree,"well, i know that."
2824,Bree,did i do something wrong?
2825,Bree,"katherine, are you all right? i- i couldn't help noticing-"
781,Bree,"well, at least i'm trying to be proactive."
2835,Bree,"okay. this has been-- lovely. we really should, um, do it again sometime."
2837,Bree,"sylvia, where are you going? sylvia, you need to come out of there."
790,Bree,because if you don't change who you are then you won't go to heaven.
2840,Bree,"she's over there, first door on the left, and please hurry."
2843,Bree,just come out! i'll get rid of her!
797,Bree,"well, why don't we just go by ourselves then?"
2853,Bree,i can only imagine. i had to listen to her babble for an hour.
2862,Bree,"oh, and, uh, listen. bob and lee introduced us to this wonderful contractor, so we won't be imposing for long."
815,Bree,it doesn't matter.
816,Bree,he said you're still in love with me.
2865,Bree,what?
821,Bree,"well, you have to bring ginger, because if rex sees the two of you together, then he'll relax."
827,Bree,"hi. you left the party so quickly i didn't have the chance to apologise to you for what rex did. oh, george, i'm so sorry he humiliated you in front of all those people. i don't know what got into him."
2875,Bree,"dinner will be ready shortly. oh, and, julie, i fixed the hem on that blue skirt of yours. it's on your bed."
2881,Bree,andrew is also an out-and-proud homosexual.
835,Bree,"i've had one better, in italy."
2887,Bree,and windows. and i am not pimping you out. i'm simply asking you to show some kindness to a lonely man who happens to be an excellent roofer.
843,Bree,"oh, it'll just take a second. i need to um, to get a recipe."
2901,Bree,why? i-i thought you'd want your house back.
2902,Bree,"oh, sweetie, you're okay."
2908,Bree,"i understand, but whatever you do, don't keep your feelings bottled up. you've got to let'em out."
861,Bree,"well, let's see i've beaten you to bridge, and mahjong and hearts. this is your last chance to redeem yourself."
863,Bree,"miss it, miss it, miss it."
2914,Bree,"oh, lynette. hi. you look pretty. what are you all dressed up for?"
868,Bree,"george, do you have an erection?"
870,Bree,i was teasing you.
871,Bree,you have got to get rid of it. there are children present.
874,Bree,"i kept this friendship going because i though rex's dislike of you was paranoid, but you had feelings for me all along. god, this is just such a betrayal."
2928,Bree,"well, typically, we sit there and let the preacher preach, and eventually, our questions are answered, and no one is humiliated."
2930,Bree,"well, then maybe you should explore other options. i mean, if you really enjoy talking ck to the pulpit, why don't you try that gospel church by the airport?"
2931,Bree,"or, uh, the unitarians. from what i hear, those folks are ""anything goes."""
2937,Bree,"you don't say that. i've--i've never heard you say that, not once."
890,Bree,why are you shopping here? you live on the other side of town.
891,Bree,"oh, well, that's very nice of you."
892,Bree,well?
2938,Bree,"thank you, reverend, and i'm--i'm sure the scavos will be here soon."
894,Bree,wait a minute. what in the world are you talking about?
2942,Bree,"oh, please. mowing your lawn in a notre dame sweatshirt doesn't make you catholic. you're presbyterian now. come on. let's go."
2943,Bree,"i meant sample, like a buffet. you take a little plate of everything, and then you sit down for the main course, which is across the street--at the presbyterian church."
900,Bree,i was thinking that the biggest mistake of my entire life was agreeing to marry you.
2949,Bree,"well, yes."
2951,Bree,lynette--
2958,Bree,"yes, i do. you were right. faith shouldn't be blind. you don't threaten it by asking questions. you make it stronger, and i lost sight of that."
2960,Bree,"how's catholicism going, by the way?"
917,Bree,"we were having a fight when he had the heart attack, and i'm just feeling really guilty, because i should have gotten him here sooner and -"
2966,Bree,that would be lovely.
921,Bree,"oh, i was just, um, thinking that i need to start, uh, spring cleaning."
923,Bree,how did you know that?
2971,Bree,you are such a scamp.
926,Bree,i know.
928,Bree,"it doesn't matter. from here on in, can we just say that we're even?"
937,Bree,hello?
939,Bree,"oh, i'm just waiting for, uh, rex's mother. she's gonna be here any second."
940,Bree,"oh, do one of you drink soy milk? i was cleaning out the fridge this morning, and rex is the only one who drinks it. i just bought it on friday. i'd hate to throw it away."
2989,Bree,is everyone having fun?
946,Bree,"phyllis, that's an orange tie."
947,Bree,"well, um, he's being buried in a blue suit."
2997,Bree,used to be. not anymore. things change.
3001,Bree,the photographer's asking if he can get shots of the two of us.
954,Bree,"oh. well, um, what kind of input?"
3004,Bree,so--i don't really know how to be friends with you.
3007,Bree,"oh, that's so sweet, but--our house is livable again - the downstairs anyway - and we have imposed long enough. besides, mike is coming home tonight, and you're gonna need the house to yourselves."
965,Bree,"no, i don't. if you heard the things that she said to me-"
966,Bree,she went out of her way to be cruel to me. i don't want her at the funeral.
3014,Bree,"no, thanks. we're almost done."
3017,Bree,"katherine, need i remind you we nearly came to blows over floral choices?"
970,Bree,"i left him an hour ago, and he was wearing ralph lauren."
972,Bree,do not close that coffin.
3022,Bree,that is a cherished recipe from my grandmother.
978,Bree,no. in theory.
3026,Bree,what are you talking about?
982,Bree,"i'm sorry. this is, uh, rex's mother, phyllis."
996,Bree,"this is my third phone call, mr. flannery. and if someone doesn't call me back soon, i'm going to be irritated."
3046,Bree,"hi, edie, thanks again for helping me out last night."
3047,Bree,"orson's car is still parked at my house. um, did he mention when he'd be coming back to pick it up?"
1000,Bree,"no, no, not at all."
1001,Bree,"um, i'm all right."
1002,Bree,do i?
3053,Bree,"come on, edie. think of our friendship."
1006,Bree,"so, uh, are we ready to order, or do you need a little more time?"
3054,Bree,"actually, karen, when i'm done here, i could go try to find toby for you."
3059,Bree,"ah, the key is to keep one car between yours and hers at all times. have fun."
3060,Bree,i saw you kissing my husband.
3068,Bree,"well, that sounds boring. i know. why don't you take him to edie's house, and he can watch you give her a dental exam with your tongue?"
1022,Bree,unless what?
3072,Bree,"strictly speaking, you're not even related to him. i mean, it was fine for you to masquerade as his father when we were together, but now that we're not--"
1028,Bree,am i a suspect?
1032,Bree,she blamed me for every problem that rex and i ever had.
3081,Bree,yeah.
1036,Bree,"you want a statement? fine, i'll give you a statement."
3084,Bree,thank you.
1038,Bree,get her out of here.
1039,Bree,"at the risk of ruining a lovely evening, i have some unpleasant news. the police dug up your father today."
3085,Bree,"i told them everything, edie, about orson, benjamin, everything."
3087,Bree,neither did i.
3090,Bree,"oh, please. i saw you at my nail salon."
1050,Bree,yes.
1052,Bree,"well, i'm not gonna respond to something that's none of your business."
1055,Bree,no.
1058,Bree,"well, for starters, you can help me prove to the police that we didn't conspire to kill my husband."
1059,Bree,"so because of the anomalies in rex's blood, the police started to wonder if i'd been poisoning rex."
1064,Bree,"um, um, during the test, they asked me some questions about you and, um, us and whether we had a relationship and i said yes, because it's true. and then they asked me something else, something i hadn't considered."
3114,Bree,"no, i told you. i was only trying to send a message to my ex."
3118,Bree,then let me send you a clear one. i am not attracted to you.
1071,Bree,i think the machine picked up on something that i wasn't aware of.
1074,Bree,andrew. what are you doing?
1075,Bree,of course. you remember mr. williams.
3125,Bree,"hi. i'm, uh, here to check on orson hodge. an ambulance brought him in less than an hour ago."
1080,Bree,andrew!
3129,Bree,"ladies, i don't know what you're talking about. katherine has all sorts of wonderful qualities."
3130,Bree,"well, i admit she plays her cards close to the vest, but some of you could benefit from that kind of quiet dignity, miss i-chew-gum- like-a-1930s-gun-moll."
1084,Bree,"all right then. george, we'll see you friday for dinner. i'll be serving fish."
3140,Bree,"why are you here? and don't say for the pizza, because i know you're lactose-intolerant."
1093,Bree,doesn't it require a large entrance fee? one that you can't afford by yourself?
1099,Bree,george.
3148,Bree,"andrew--look, i'm on my way back, but it's imperative that you--andrew?"
1103,Bree,i'm still recovering from mike is zach's real father.
3153,Bree,"well, i suppose i should say thank you."
1107,Bree,"no, it's not. all the things that andrew's been saying, the way he's been acting, it's all connected to his father's death and it's clear to me that i need to spend more time focusing on him and his needs."
1109,Bree,but i only sent him there because his behavior at the time was so completely out of bounds.
3158,Bree,well--so here we are.
1114,Bree,"thank you, george."
3167,Bree,"leave the galleys in my office and tell the woman from ""the times"" to call me back in the morning. i'm gonna have a nice bubble bath with my husband. coming, orson!"
3168,Bree,"oh, for god sakes. what's wrong now?"
3169,Bree,why am i surprised?
3171,Bree,mm. and i know this before i've tasted it?
1129,Bree,"you know, mostly i'm annoyed that the whole thing happened in the first place. i mean how in the world can anyone accuse me of murder?"
3183,Bree,you read it ready?
3186,Bree,"oh, don't be silly. i may have based a few on your recipes, but i always changed something."
3187,Bree,"well, yours calls for minced curly leaf parsley. mine calls for minced flat leaf."
3189,Bree,"really, katherine. just because i let you execute a few eye-catching garnishes that gratify your need to show off, doesn't mean that i can't do them just as well myself."
1145,Bree,"detective, i know exactly what my husband deserves. now would you be a dear?"
1152,Bree,"my husband, the man i spent my life with for eighteen years, died thinking that i murdered him!"
1153,Bree,"yes, the cardiologist shared this moronic theory with rex and rex believed him!"
1154,Bree,"yes, because he left a note. and it said, and i quote, ""bree, i understand and i forgive you."" i spent eighteen years of my life with this man. how could he not know me?"
3204,Bree,"please, danielle, we can have any arrangement you like. please, just don't take him! for god sakes, orson's gone. you kids are grown. benjamin's all i have!"
1162,Bree,that better?
1163,Bree,that was nice.
3210,Bree,"my company, which i formed when we were separated, is called mrs. van de kamp's catering. it's how i'm known."
3212,Bree,listen--van de kamp--hodge.
1166,Bree,i don't know. i felt something weird.
3217,Bree,you can't come. sorry. i just had to rip the band-aid off.
1170,Bree,"oh, ah, ah, it's starting to spread to my face."
3218,Bree,it's not personal. you know how carlos just started at the club?
3220,Bree,"oh, hon, i don't think that's gonna fly. he's already rubbed too many members."
3221,Bree,"no, i'm good. how do i look?"
3222,Bree,oh. i'm a little bit nervous. this is my first national interview. and i am a huge fan of your cookbooks.
1180,Bree,i don't believe him. he is so brazen.
1183,Bree,"paul, we've called the police."
3242,Bree,"well, i know nothing. just keep me out of it. what is carlos doing?"
1195,Bree,really? you mean that? you wouldn't mind?
3244,Bree,i would be happy to. i just want to make sure it's the kind you like.
3253,Bree,"i am so sorry. i-i lost all track of time, and linda had so many questions about the food. i'll make you that pot roast tomorrow, okay?"
3255,Bree,"orson, i've been cooking all day. i-- i'm so tired, i can barely stand up. you really want me to make you a pot roast now?"
1209,Bree,guilty?
1210,Bree,that chair looks so uncomfortable. why didn't you sleep next to me?
3258,Bree,i do not require lectures on tact.
3259,Bree,"i'm aware of what's at stake, orson."
3261,Bree,"lovely to meet you, leo."
1214,Bree,"george, wait. please don't go. stay here with me."
3262,Bree,"now we have you for the whole weekend, right?"
3266,Bree,"all right, orson. don't overexcite him on the upholstery. so, danielle, what would you like me to make as a side dish for your welcome home party? i can do anything so long as it complements beef tenderloin."
1226,Bree,"uh, i do, i really do."
1227,Bree,huh?
3276,Bree,"oh, just some old pictures. can you guess who that little girl is?"
3284,Bree,"well, what do you think?"
1240,Bree,"uh, no, i, i guess not."
3288,Bree,"no, um, you take benjy upstairs. i'll get it. orson, could you get the mop, please?"
1243,Bree,what happens in nine months?
1246,Bree,"george, i'm starting to think that we made a mistake rushing into this engagement."
3296,Bree,"orson, you weren't here. she came back. she was married to a lawyer. and don't forget, she is his mother! i tried to fight, but--"
1249,Bree,"well, he knows me, and certainly better than you do."
1250,Bree,"well, for starters, he knows the last thing i'd ever want to do is have more children."
3297,Bree,"i was on my knees. i was sobbing. she said ""no"" and then ripped him out of my arms. you have no right to say that to me."
1252,Bree,"it's not just that, george. dr. goldfine has other concerns about us being together, and i'm starting to think he's right."
3299,Bree,"no, uh, mr. van de kamp is deceased."
3301,Bree,here's my cookbook.
1267,Bree,positively glowing.
1268,Bree,"honey, it's open. come on in."
1269,Bree,how was your little reunion?
1275,Bree,huh?
3323,Bree,honey--i'm not angry. i'm hurt that you didn't feel like you could tell me.
1279,Bree,"okay, well, uh, i will call you tonight and we'll figure out a time later in the week."
3340,Bree,"um, i think ""understated"" was what they were going for."
3343,Bree,"oh, lynette, i appreciate everything you've done. but i've actually approved the old campaign, and i can't just tell them i've changed my mind."
1296,Bree,"well, i don't know what to say."
1297,Bree,"yes, it is. to have a complete stranger come into my home, drink my tea, and then try to turn me against one of the sweetest men i have ever known."
3344,Bree,no.
3345,Bree,"sorry, but i prefer their campaign."
3347,Bree,"oh. well, i'm familiar with that award. in fact, i'm this year's recipient."
3353,Bree,"hi, everybody! you having a good time?"
1308,Bree,"yeah, of course we are."
1312,Bree,"no. no. it's like i told you, the stone could just pop off at any second."
3362,Bree,"lynette, i am really not able to deal with that right now."
1315,Bree,"because i don't feel like it. and this is the last time we're gonna talk about this, okay?"
1321,Bree,"no. george, i don't want to."
3374,Bree,"orson, please. you're putting me in an impossible position."
3375,Bree,aren't you dapper?
1328,Bree,"ah, i'm not sure."
1335,Bree,so stalking me is plan b?
3383,Bree,"andrew, please."
1341,Bree,"dr. goldfine, do you ever really cure people, i mean, even though they're really crazy?"
1344,Bree,did you say a blue bike?
3395,Bree,and she'll be twice as mad at having been put in that position. i am not telling her tonight.
1348,Bree,"hello, detective barton. this is bree van de kamp. i need to talk to you about george williams."
3397,Bree,"look, if we can't agree on something this basic, maybe we shouldn't work together."
1351,Bree,george. george!
3403,Bree,i hope you didn't mean what you said earlier. you just don't understand what i owe to katherine.
1356,Bree,not until you admit what you've done.
3404,Bree,"you know that--brunch we had for you right before you left for prison? i was very tense, and i was very unhappy. so i had--a glass of champagne."
3406,Bree,i don't recall ever hearing that name before.
3408,Bree,"orson! you are amazing! one week on the job, and he's already bringing in huge accounts."
1364,Bree,"'""unsavory items'?well,what does that mean?''"
1370,Bree,"well, it turns out he wasn't so sweet after all. anyway, uh, there's a chance that some of this may wind up in the paper, so i wanted you to hear it from me first."
3420,Bree,have a seat.
3424,Bree,but this is orson's college roommate. and--he's quite the catch!
3427,Bree,"oh, that's nice. hey, was there a blue convertible parked in front of katherine's?"
1384,Bree,"so, are you saying if he were executed, that it would be easier for you to get past this?"
3432,Bree,is that bad?
1387,Bree,"he didn't die on his terms, andrew. he paid for what he did to your father."
1389,Bree,what kind of friend is he?
3439,Bree,that is not funny! i have to go warn katherine.
3440,Bree,"katherine, hi! is everything all right over there?"
3445,Bree,"well, if he tries, just promise you'll call."
1399,Bree,"i may not be able to control what you do outside of this home,but while you are under this roof,you will not mock my values.if you so much as smile at that boy,so help me, i will ship you off to camp hennessey and i will not pick you up again until you are 18.do i make myself clear?"
1401,Bree,"oh, i just wanted to pick up some fresh croissants for breakfast."
1407,Bree,i shouldn't have said anything.
1408,Bree,her gardener.
3456,Bree,you don't feel you've been underpaid?
3460,Bree,can you believe it? a thief and a pothead!
1415,Bree,"oh, you think i won't?"
1420,Bree,"here's a check for $100.that's enough for a retainer, right?"
1422,Bree,andrew?would you mind turning off your video game?my lawyer would like to have a little chat with you.
3474,Bree,how could this be happening?
1430,Bree,"well,once he stopped suspecting me of murdering rex he was delightful,but,um--i don't really know him."
1434,Bree,"oh,well,where does she live?"
1435,Bree,is it serious?
3484,Bree,"orson, we don't need to know."
1437,Bree,"oh,you mean your having suspected me of murdering my husband?detective,that is all water under the bridge now."
3485,Bree,"oh, my."
1440,Bree,"yeah,they're secretive and watchful.and there was a dead body found in front of their house."
3489,Bree,"what? well, who is it then?"
3490,Bree,katherine!
3493,Bree,"mike. yes, indeedy."
1447,Bree,i had two glasses of wine.
3495,Bree,i said..let's not dwell on it.
1450,Bree,what do you think you're doing?
3499,Bree,is that what i saw on the tape-- a relationship?
1456,Bree,i beg your pardon?
3507,Bree,"only that her name is sandra birch. we just spoke, and she seemed very nice."
3508,Bree,"""a deeper look suggests something darker, something more ominous, a woman whose perky surface conceals a deep, almost demonic thirst for power."
1463,Bree,"you know,thank you,but i think it's actually something more mechanical.my car has been making just a terrible noise."
1465,Bree,"thanks,betty,and,um--i'd appreciate it if you could keep this little incident to yourself."
3517,Bree,what kind of rumors?
3523,Bree,"i wrote a cookbook, sandra-- meatloaf, pot pies, peach cobbler. why are you trying to crucify me?"
3524,Bree,"but it isn't, sandra, because i don't think i'm great. i have fallen down more times than i can count, just like so many other housewives out there, we're all just barely holding on, and we all think that we're alone. so maybe you're right. maybe it isn't a cookbook. it's a lifeline from me to those other women, because i want them to know there's always a chance to get something right. even if it's just a casserole."
3525,Bree,"hello, dr. cominis. how's my husband doing?"
3527,Bree,"oh, that's all right. i can wait. mmm, he looks so peaceful."
3530,Bree,robustly.
1484,Bree,all i ever wanted was for you to be happy.
1485,Bree,"danielle,i don't feel much like cooking tonight.i'm thinking of ordering a pizza."
1487,Bree,"hi, betty."
3536,Bree,not exactly true. the doctor said there's a very simple procedure--
1490,Bree,"well, how about some old-fashioned chaperoning?that way they can, um,still see each other,and we won't have to be the villains."
1491,Bree,"now that you mention it,i guess i do.i have to go. i have some,um, muffins in the oven."
3541,Bree,"oh, orson, i can't help but take issue with your sarcastic tone."
1499,Bree,he's your son?
1502,Bree,hi. come on in.
1503,Bree,"um, about that-- um--"
1505,Bree,i'll raise you.
3554,Bree,fine. i just know i need my sleep tonight.
3560,Bree,i just don't understand why i feel so loopy.
3561,Bree,"of course i can. you are such a nervous nellie, rex."
3564,Bree,"well, my husband has agreed to the procedure you suggested."
3565,Bree,"yes, that's the one. so anytime you wanna get in there and start hacking away, he's ready for you. aren't you, love?"
1518,Bree,"if the applewhites go to the police and tell them that your brother ran over mrs. solis,he could go to prison.how can you not understand that?"
3566,Bree,"well, fridays are when orson plays golf. so friday's perfect. right, orson?"
3568,Bree,"are you married, dr. cominis?"
1524,Bree,hi.i'm bree.i live down the street.i'm a friend of your mother's.
3572,Bree,"oh, we feel the same way about you. you've been lovely."
1530,Bree,"caleb, have you been down here all these months?"
1531,Bree,did your mother make you wear those?
1535,Bree,"come on in, betty.get you a drink?"
3590,Bree,"bob hunter, lee mcdermott, i would like you to meet andrew's new life partner, dr. alex cominis."
1543,Bree,"oh,no,no,no,no.i'm okay."
3591,Bree,he's a plastic surgeon.
3593,Bree,you are so sweet.
1546,Bree,"i do not have a hangover,andrew,because i was not drunk."
1554,Bree,boys?boys?
1555,Bree,"okay,we're done playing hide-and-seek!boys?!"
3602,Bree,what?
1558,Bree,i have something to tell them.
1560,Bree,i most certainly was not.
3610,Bree,"you're going to marry him. i thought he wasn't being honest with you. i wanted to protect you, so i"
1564,Bree,penny?
1565,Bree,"you know,i think,um,i must have been cleaning the kitchen,and i-i just didn't hear them because of the noise from the dishwasher."
3614,Bree,"oh, my goodness. are you two--"
1567,Bree,"lynette,if i close my eyes even for a moment,it's because of these antihistamines i've been taking."
3618,Bree,thank you again for making the long drive down from oakdale. it's high time our families got together.
1574,Bree,"well,good. i mean,i just--i really wouldn't want you to get the wrong impression.well,i'm--i'm going to the mall.they're having a white sale today.i think i'm gonna get a new bath mat.oh,does anyone need one?"
3622,Bree,stop that! you can't call all the major holidays.
1577,Bree,"oh,i wasn't hiding anything.i was simply--enjoying the day.what you want?"
3626,Bree,"look, i know it's very difficult for two families to negotiate the holidays, but i feel strongly that this is not the best way to handle it, and i'm sure that the boys would agree with me."
3627,Bree,"oh, andrew thought it would be nice to have a formal dinner tomorrow night."
3631,Bree,"mmm. you're sweet. oh, all right. get the lace tablecloth. i will pretend to like this woman. just like i pretended to like nana."
1584,Bree,the answer is no.
1589,Bree,"for the record,i did not punch my son.i slapped him with an open palm."
1593,Bree,"well,that's the silliest thingi've ever heard of.how would he support himself?"
3641,Bree,"hmm. excuse--excuse me, melina. that's my chair."
1597,Bree,"oh,there's no pretending.i am going to my first a.a. meeting tomorrow.of course,i picked one in the worst part of town so i won't run into anybody i know,which,of course,means i will."
3646,Bree,you're gonna have kids?
1599,Bree,"oh,andrew,you don't think i love you enough to give up alcohol?"
3651,Bree,you know it.
3652,Bree,"well, maybe they were only together a short time, and she didn't mean anything to him."
1607,Bree,"oh! um, i couldn't possibly top that.thank you, though."
1610,Bree,"gosh, um--i'm not exactly sure."
1613,Bree,"it's true. i'm coming here because of my son.you see, he's--he's trying to take me to court to become an emancipated minor,and he's planning on lying to the judge and telling him that i am some sort of dreadful lush."
1614,Bree,exactly.
1615,Bree,"i know you think i'm kidding myself,but i'm not.i'm nothing like you people.i just don't have a compulsive personality."
3661,Bree,it's true. there's a reason the local car dealers send you a fruit basket every christmas. wow hush.
1617,Bree,"did he just call her ""baby""?"
3667,Bree,i don't think i do that.
1620,Bree,hello there!i thought you and your friend might like some snacks.
3672,Bree,bring it.
1633,Bree,"on second thought,i will have another glass of wine.you can leave the bottle."
1634,Bree,"hi,it's bree van de kamp.i didn't know who else to call,and,well,i'm in a bit of a situation."
3682,Bree,"oh, good. you're back. can we talk?"
3683,Bree,"fine. then as my employee, i authorize a 5-minute break so we can talk about my son's boyfriend and his absurd overreaction this afternoon."
3685,Bree,i tried. he won't listen to me.
3686,Bree,"this won't take long. i don't want to fight anymore. please, just take the house."
3689,Bree,we're ready! come on.
1642,Bree,"i'm curious,peter.what is the easiest way to overcome addiction?"
1643,Bree,i don't know.i guess i'm just impatient to get on with my life.
3698,Bree,"great. gaby, do you have your copy?"
1651,Bree,see?i think you can handle affection better than you give yourself credit for.
1652,Bree,what?
1653,Bree,really?peter! but--but--you forgot your shirt!
3699,Bree,you use my cookbook to balance your table?
1655,Bree,"uh,sure. help yourself.there's also frosted glasses in the freezer."
3703,Bree,such as?
1657,Bree,"thanks,but i'm not really out of the woods yet.i still have this whole court case hanging over my head."
3704,Bree,i have a job. i'm a homemaker.
1662,Bree,"of course not.i just want you to understand something.andrew is making accusations--false accusations,saying that i abused him,all because i wouldn't let him have his trust fund early so he could buy a car.i mean,can you blame me for wanting to know if i have your support?"
1667,Bree,"peter,all we did was kiss."
3716,Bree,"thanks, but i know exactly what i'm gonna make."
1671,Bree,"oh!well,good for you."
1679,Bree,"okay,peter,i just really--need us to be friends.when i'm with you,i'm not myself,which is a good thing."
3727,Bree,"and here i am, rubbing my fabulous new car in her face. i feel awful."
3731,Bree,"we just went to a second printing, and now they're talking a 3-book deal. so seriously, i am not gonna miss that money."
1684,Bree,what are you doing here?
3736,Bree,what?
3740,Bree,okay.
1693,Bree,"andrew,i forgive you."
3741,Bree,"oh, that sounds lovely."
3742,Bree,"oh, that sounds nice. can we walk and talk?"
1697,Bree,andrew falsely accused me of molestation--in a mall!
3746,Bree,"well, technically, i'm she, but yes."
1700,Bree,absolutely not.
1701,Bree,"do you really think that i am enjoying airing my dirty laundry in public?this whole situation is mortifying.but i can't back down because he is my son,and i need more time to get through to him."
3748,Bree,my food? what are you talking about?
1703,Bree,"oh,but not you.with you,i had to work for every kind word i ever got."
1706,Bree,do you really think that i am a failure as a parent?
1707,Bree,"justin,what happened?"
3756,Bree,we'll chat later. roll out some dough and show me where the basil is. we'll be serving three cheese pizza tonight.
3759,Bree,excuse me.
1713,Bree,"oh,honey,it's all right.i mean,with the new baby at home, i'm surprisedyou made it at all."
1716,Bree,"oh,by the way,while i was there, i saw your,uh,your housekeeper.xiao-mei?"
1720,Bree,"well,i have to admit,i was a bit upset at first.but then it hit me.you're his grandparents. you should bond,get to know the real andrew."
3770,Bree,my car!
1723,Bree,"oh,dad,andrew hates labels.i'm sure it's just a phase."
3772,Bree,"oh, lynette, don't be silly. it's just the bumper. you don't need to do that."
1729,Bree,"oh,i,um,had a chance to have a nice chat with justin the other day.he really seems very sweet.i've invited him over for dinner tonight. i hope you don't mind."
1734,Bree,"oh, your a.a. sponsor?"
3783,Bree,i'm not discussing andrew's salary with you. it's none of your business.
3790,Bree,of course it could just as easily be munchy cedarhurst.
1746,Bree,"not yet.you obviously have an encyclopedic grasp of everything deaved.but clearly, you don't have the slightest idea about the power of a loving relationship."
1747,Bree,"well,i think peter is a better man than you do,and i am not gonna let you keep us apart."
3799,Bree,"no, you were a dentist. now you're a caterer, and you're paid fairly based on your expertise and contribution."
1752,Bree,"well,cravings are cravings,and all you really need is a friend to call when you start having inappropriate thoughts,and i can be that friend."
3805,Bree,"my, what an interesting coat hanger. it's shaped like a sofa. please put it in the closet."
1758,Bree,"hi,i'm--i'm looking for,um, peter mcmillan."
3806,Bree,orson? why do you have a salt shaker from scavo's pizzeria?
3808,Bree,no.
1762,Bree,"peter?peter, it's bree.are you in there?"
1763,Bree,what are you doing here?
1764,Bree,you can't possibly be turned on by what's going on out there.
3812,Bree,i'm sorry you have to go through this. it must be so hard.
1767,Bree,peter--
1768,Bree,"rex said he'd always be faithful.george said he'd never hurt me.and as it turned out,they were both liars.so as long as you're honest with me,you'd be amazed at what i can put up with.now let's go home."
3824,Bree,bruce. hello. come on in. thank you so much for joining us tonight. may i take your coat?
1779,Bree,"gaby,you can't promise her that."
1780,Bree,"andrew,i am having peter over for dinner tomorrow night,and i was wondering if you would like to invite justin?"
3827,Bree,"lynette, tom, hi. i'd like you to meet my publisher, bruce."
1785,Bree,"peter,i don't think i'm being unreasonable here."
1794,Bree,"well,i guess that's important,so--"
1795,Bree,what a shame.i really wanted him to have a chance to get to know you guys.
3844,Bree,do you know how embarrassed i would have bee if bruce had seen you take it?
1797,Bree,"andrew?honey,what are you doing in my bed?"
3845,Bree,"so say something. stand up to him. but stealing? honestly, orson, why would you do something like that?"
3850,Bree,"yes, i, uh-- remember that."
3851,Bree,i'm sure it'll turn up somewhere. well--i'm off.
1804,Bree,i have to.i can't be around you anymore.i'm just not strong enough.
1806,Bree,"well,good for you."
3858,Bree,i'll take care of it.
1813,Bree,"oh, my god, danielle.i am so sorry."
3861,Bree,close enough.
3864,Bree,"why are you, uh, calling juanita?"
3872,Bree,what are you hiding behind your back?
1827,Bree,she said she doesn't want balloons.i'm fine.
1828,Bree,i'm fine. why?
3875,Bree,"you'll see when he leaves, and your lamp is missing."
1830,Bree,it just keeps coming out too thick.
3878,Bree,"i'm sorry, but this is unacceptable. do you at least know why he steals? if there were some sordid childhood trauma we could blame it on, it would really help me out with the neighbors."
3879,Bree,"really? and--and yet he keeps charging me. so, doctor, what's this ""revelation"" that you've been keeping from me for $200 an hour?"
3881,Bree,would you excuse us for moment? this just became a private conversation.
3882,Bree,you wanna help? why don't you go down to the pharmacy in the lobby and buy some aspirin? i'm gonna need it. i don't deserve this. i have been nothing but supportive of you since you got out of jail. i even gave you a job.
1836,Bree,"somebody ruined your cake,and i wanna know who could be that thoughtless."
3887,Bree,"oh, andrew. i didn't hear you come in."
3888,Bree,"thank you, dear."
3890,Bree,"oh, shoot. i left them upstairs."
3891,Bree,andrew.
1847,Bree,i take it you heard what happened.
3895,Bree,this is happening so fast.
3897,Bree,"just give me one year. that's not asking too much, is it?"
1854,Bree,"hello.my name is bree van de kamp,and i'd like to admit myself for psychiatric observation."
3906,Bree,"uh, gaby, before we learn what edie tastes like--"
3909,Bree,nice try.
1863,Bree,"well, is there anything you'd like to say to my son?"
3912,Bree,is that the visitors' room?
3913,Bree,"you don't happen to have a private room, do you?"
1866,Bree,what?
3915,Bree,"oh, not, uh, just yet. it's not a bad idea, having an upgrade available. i bet that's a perk people would be willing to pay for."
1868,Bree,oh. i'm so sorry.i didn't recognize you.
1869,Bree,"yes. uh, excruciatingly so."
3918,Bree,every week? what's her name?
3921,Bree,i wanted to see you.
1875,Bree,"you, too?"
1876,Bree,"you know that, um, that woman in the wheelchair?what's her story?"
3924,Bree,"what are you up to, edie?"
1880,Bree,i have aspirin at home that packs more of a punch.
3930,Bree,so--how are you doing?
1885,Bree,and how are you going to do that?
1886,Bree,i committed myself voluntarily.
1887,Bree,"i don't need that much help, because i am not like your other patients."
1891,Bree,you let go of me right now!
1892,Bree,"i am trying to leave, and these morons won't let me.do you know that you can be arrested for kidnapping,for detaining someone?!"
3945,Bree,do we really need to do this tonight? they're ashes. it's not like they're gonna go bad.
1899,Bree,"good, add that on."
3948,Bree,i don't know. a few words describing how we felt about her?
3949,Bree,perceptive.
3952,Bree,"honey, i don't mean to be negative. it's just--what's gonna happen? will you keep stealing and lying to me? i love you, but i just can't put up with that anymore."
1905,Bree,"exactly, and look how well you turned out."
1909,Bree,"one can only hope.of course, if a doctor gets here first and sees that someone forgot to release me, i'm sure they'd get in a lot of trouble."
1911,Bree,"oh! does anybody ever call you ""alfie""?"
3960,Bree,"well, i can understand why you're a bit cynical, but i'm giving him another chance. he's my husband, and i still love him."
1920,Bree,probably because i'm ashamed.
3970,Bree,"well, that's odd."
1924,Bree,"danielle, i don't know what you're planning, but i need to talk to you right now."
3975,Bree,"well, that'll teach you to go out walking in the middle of the night. you know, i still don't know why you were out so late."
1928,Bree,"no.i gave up on your brother, and i'm not gonna make that mistake with you."
3982,Bree,so i think i have to divorce him.
1935,Bree,"it's okay, baby."
3983,Bree,"my husband is a decent man, and i want to do right by him."
3985,Bree,wait. i'm not planning on giving him half. it's my business.
3991,Bree,oh. who--who's that?
1944,Bree,yes.
3995,Bree,we--we should go.
3999,Bree,"karl, if we move forward, i will insist you handle our divorce with dignity."
1955,Bree,"true, i have in the past, given myself away too freely.how charming of you to bring that up while i'm announcing my engagement.but i'd like to think that i've learned from my mistakes.so the dinner is at 8:00 and when we make the announcement, please, everyone look surprised."
1956,Bree,"wow, we certainly devoured that ice cream.can i get you anything else?"
1962,Bree,"okay, so we will see you saturday and please pretend to be surprised.bye."
1963,Bree,"i just can't help it.i like telling people.makes me feel, i don't know.makes me feel like i'm starting over.feels good."
1965,Bree,i've never heard that.
4014,Bree,"i used to think of myself as a good person. if i had a choice, i would always choose the high road. lately i've begun to realize that, um--i'm capable of doing whatever needs to be done."
1967,Bree,did you lose something?
4021,Bree,i was kidding!
1974,Bree,"and then it was like something inside ruptured.well, not so much a rupture as a spasm.waves of this hot, clutching.i think i might have had a small stroke!"
4023,Bree,"you are repugnant, and this conversation is over."
1976,Bree,"i was, ah, with my fiance.we were lying down, resting."
1986,Bree,please leave my house.
4034,Bree,"i do the bare minimum. no more, no less."
1988,Bree,so are you still married?
1990,Bree,"orson, my hand."
4038,Bree,"oh, thank you."
4040,Bree,"they're robbers, dear. not personal shoppers."
1996,Bree,"oh, that reminds me. and don't worry susan, i will think of a job for you."
4045,Bree,"oh, that's right."
2003,Bree,"men have lied to me before. believe me, it'ill never happen again."
2004,Bree,"clearly, i do."
2008,Bree,i can't talk to orson. it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding!
4066,Bree,"well, the key is to not let them know what you're doing. this requires observation, cunning and manipulation."
4067,Bree,so you wait for an opportunity that you can use to your advantage while at the same time appearing supportive.
2022,Bree,could you excuse me for a just a minute.
4071,Bree,"yes, but i'm tired of all the lying and the sneaking around, so i will inform him you can have whatever you like."
4072,Bree,"well, that part's non-negotiable."
2026,Bree,i hope to.
2028,Bree,"yes, mr. hodge."
2032,Bree,"orson, you can't imagine that we are still going!"
4082,Bree,"ah, but i never filed insurance crime."
2035,Bree,so you can't tell me anything about my son's whereabouts?
4084,Bree,you would actually send your wife to prison?
2041,Bree,i left him on the roadside with some money and his clothes.i didn't tell you because i was afraid of what you would think of me.
2042,Bree,"there won't be, not anymore."
12288,Lynette,i think we have a seriously troubled young girl.
10241,Lynette,"no, it's not a deal.i need a solemn vow that you will never throw that in my face ever again.because if you do,you will unleash demons that you do not wanna meet."
10242,Lynette,and what i really need from you--is to be forgiven.
10243,Lynette,this dinner is really good.
12289,Lynette,this is dr. dolan.
12291,Lynette,"so i like what you said about making the family stronger, but as i told you, kayla's the one you wanna focus on."
12301,Lynette,"do you have a diploma on your wall, tom? i don't think so. zip it."
10255,Lynette,i don't care!you're not gonna do this!
12303,Lynette,"oh, god. is this gonna be one of those therapy things where she hits me with a foam bat?"
12305,Lynette,ask me if i love tom right now. go ahead. i dare ya.
12307,Lynette,"hey, bree, perfect timing. we were just getting ready to deal the cards."
12308,Lynette,"okay, first of all, you're, like, the greatest mom ever to wanna protect danielle like that."
12313,Lynette,"we tried to be your friends, but you don't even understand what that word means, so now we're gonna be something you do understand."
10268,Lynette,"i am not fighting your fights.this is my fight.this is how guys do business, right?"
10274,Lynette,"uh,not that i know of. why?"
10275,Lynette,really?
10276,Lynette,"oh,that's okay. um--would you excuse me just for a second? i have, uh, a thing."
12322,Lynette,"honey, we're about to have dinner."
12323,Lynette,"all right. thank you. if you're hungry, i'll get you something healthy, and you can have it in the car."
10279,Lynette,"well,for starters,she's ancient!"
10280,Lynette,it was not that long ago that she keeled over in her front yard.a day with our kids will finish the job.
10288,Lynette,yes.
12339,Lynette,my neighbors? god! i could strangle that girl.
10295,Lynette,"well,uh,okay,i know how this looks,but i have to tell you,i left them with a very reliable baby-sitter."
12346,Lynette,"i guess that's why they didn't name you ""einstein""."
12347,Lynette,"yeah. which says ""kick my ass"" less--""may"" or ""nerd""?"
12348,Lynette,what's going on?
10302,Lynette,"all right,go back in."
12350,Lynette,burn mark? what burn mark?
12351,Lynette,oh! tom.
10306,Lynette,excuse me?
10308,Lynette,that's ridiculous.
10309,Lynette,i've known bree for years and years.there's no way she was drinking while baby-sitting my kids.so--just go spread your poison somewhere else. okay?
12356,Lynette,"no, you are trying to stay on the fence while i fight to stop kayla from destroying us. but look around you, tom. look where i am! you have got to do something now. fix this."
10312,Lynette,"yeah,although i-i still can't figure out how my boys managed to sneak past you."
12368,Lynette,"mm-hmm. uh, chicken marsala, and pasta for the vegetarians."
10321,Lynette,"so apparently bree had a few too many and passed out.next thing i know, i get a call at work--someone found my kids wandering the street."
12370,Lynette,"no, no, give me another chance. i will get it."
12373,Lynette,it's your ice sculpture.
12374,Lynette,i don't care what you said. we have to fix this! or do you want to tell bree that you torpedoed her ceremony?
12378,Lynette,where the hell are you going with this?
12379,Lynette,could you give us a second?
12382,Lynette,what the hell is going on?!
10335,Lynette,oh! uh-- i guess.
12384,Lynette,why is there a police car in our driveway?
12389,Lynette,"asked and answered. okay, that's it! everybody out. game's over. can i have your chair for a second? hey! look up here! mom's here. party's over. door's open. out you go. go on. shoo! you guys have pulled a lot of stupid stunts. but this? this? risking our liquor license, our livelihood?"
10346,Lynette,just eat it.
10347,Lynette,yeah.i wonder if there's any way that we can turn it around still.
12395,Lynette,"please don't take this the wrong way, but--we love you."
10349,Lynette,hi! what's up?
10350,Lynette,what?
12398,Lynette,you have to. i am tired of being the bad cop. you walk the beat for a while.
10352,Lynette,"are you serious?tom,i wasn't doing anything.i was just going for it.i was just lost in the moment.oh,come on!come on,this is silly.i don't wanna argue.i mean,unless it turns you on.does it? 'cause theni'm all about it,baby."
10357,Lynette,tom--
10361,Lynette,"aw,sweetie."
10364,Lynette,"oh,yes!of course you do.still,you gotta love the thunderbolt."
10366,Lynette,"nicholson will be coming in in about 15 minutes with a pitch,so let's grab everybody and make sure we're all on the same page."
10367,Lynette,what's going on?
10368,Lynette,"ah,yeah--"
12422,Lynette,whatcha doing?
12428,Lynette,thank you. but you didn't have to--
10381,Lynette,i have absolutely no idea.let's go hammer out the details.
12429,Lynette,excuse me?
12434,Lynette,no. not really.
10388,Lynette,"yeah,well,we'll just ask her to keep the blinds always drawn when she nurses."
10390,Lynette,"no! no,uh,please,don't make me do it.why don't you have jerry tell her?"
10400,Lynette,that's chocolate milk.i shouldn't be having it.have you ever had any?
12455,Lynette,shh! he'll hear you.
12456,Lynette,calm down. i'm gonna break it off in an e-mail.
12457,Lynette,"i know that you have only been the receiving end of break-up letters, but i've actually written a few, and i know how to let him down easy."
10410,Lynette,"i,i'll focus on your good qualities."
12458,Lynette,go away.
10412,Lynette,to soften me up for the deposition.
12465,Lynette,"hi, dave."
10420,Lynette,how can you be so sure?we have andrew saying that it's systematic physical abuse.and then we have bree saying it's andrew wanting to be emancipated so he can get at his trust fund so he can buy a car.how are we supposed to know the real truth?
10421,Lynette,"yeah,you think so?why don't you come over here for a second?i'd like to pick your brain.you're the demographic that my client is interested in,so you'd actually be doing me a favor if you drove it around for a couple hours,and tell me what you thought.do you mind?"
10423,Lynette,"uh,all the bells and whistles,but listen--i really wanted to tell you how sorry i am."
10424,Lynette,your lawyer came to see me.i'm going to be deposed.it's going to be hard for me--
10426,Lynette,"oh. sure.anyway,i just--i feel so guilty that this all went on in your house,right under our nose.so if there is anything i can do to help you--"
10427,Lynette,"um--actually,yeah.one of the perks.even so,it's a little out of the price range of a high school student."
10428,Lynette,hey.
10429,Lynette,okay.
10430,Lynette,"my kids don't wander.they scurry,like rats."
12476,Lynette,"okay, i need to dial you in to some gigs you already have, which are running a restaurant, being a husband and a father. and i thought you were the one who said you wanted to spend more time with your family."
12478,Lynette,those of us with hearing beg to differ.
10434,Lynette,i was helping bree with her recycling.
10440,Lynette,what is it?
12489,Lynette,we can't accept this.
10443,Lynette,what kind of cookie?
10446,Lynette,"oh,right.that happened with dinosaurs."
12494,Lynette,"so--now my marriage is in trouble, and you're gonna save it by giving tom a bass?"
10448,Lynette,of course.i will talk to him.i'll talk to him till i'm blue in the face.i promise.take care.
12500,Lynette,i'm sorry. what?
10453,Lynette,okay.
10454,Lynette,"and then the mommy and the daddy,because they love each other so much,they hug.real tight."
10455,Lynette,"oh,that's not important."
10457,Lynette,"oh,wait a couple months. she'll start sleeping through the night."
12506,Lynette,"well, who knew your marketing guys were such lame-os? what they came up with is so--tepid."
12509,Lynette,aw--okay. well--i've got a whole bunch of alternatives.
12512,Lynette,but mine is better.
12517,Lynette,stu!
12521,Lynette,huh.
10474,Lynette,well-- it turns out we really needed one.you can go and play.
10475,Lynette,but we're not presenting for another two weeks.why don't we start tomorrow?
10478,Lynette,"hey, great.let's go before he changes his mind."
10479,Lynette,you're kidding!
12527,Lynette,yeah.
10482,Lynette,karl broke up with edie.
12532,Lynette,whoop. still waiting.
12534,Lynette,"do a cross-promotion with some of the major food companies. knock off 20% on some of the items featured in your recipes, then they do the same towards the purchase of your cookbook."
10488,Lynette,"well, we do the best we can given the circumstances."
10491,Lynette,"okay, well,that wasn't my best work,but you can't deny results.i.m.ing works,and when i go home tonight,tom and i are going to--okay, well,i'm gonna be exhausted,so i'll probably just lay there.but trust ,tom is gonna go to town."
12539,Lynette,"fine. and don't worry. even though i'd like to, i'm not gonna make some big, ugly scene."
10493,Lynette,"god,i don't know.i'm gonna go check with ed."
10497,Lynette,"you're an award-winning copywriter, ed.you get paid to write."
10499,Lynette,"ugh.""i love the way that blouse clings to your body."""
12547,Lynette,fine. i'll get you a towel.
10501,Lynette,"no,ed,i'm not doing this for you!"
12548,Lynette,penny! let's go! time for bath!
12552,Lynette,oh. they're just being silly. they're always silly. that's why we won't be sad when they move out of the house. come on.
10505,Lynette,"oh, god!"
10506,Lynette,you're getting divorced?
10509,Lynette,what?!
12564,Lynette,what the hell is this?
10517,Lynette,"god,your mind goes to dark places."
12567,Lynette,"where have you been? so help me, if mccluskey gets there before us, i will brain you."
10521,Lynette,"look,i know it's ridiculous,but ed is not a rational person.fran has him whipped,and a whipped husband is someone we must take very seriously."
12569,Lynette,"oh, don't. i like my mind the way it is."
10526,Lynette,"no,no!we are not backing down.i'm gonna walk over to ed's office right now,and i'm gonna make very clear that if you're out the door,i'm right behind ya."
12574,Lynette,fine. i'll get you a towel.
12576,Lynette,"no, i get it. the sports car, the garage band--maybe what we need now, tom, is for you to get it."
12578,Lynette,"scavo's was the adventure. we changed our whole lives so you could live out your dream, and now you're bored. we can't keep doing this, tom. we can't keep throwing all the cards up in the air every time you get a little restless. let's call it a night. we have to work tomorrow. are you coming?"
12579,Lynette,"amy, don't worry about the lunch specials. i am only two blocks away. i'll take care of it once i--actually, you do them. i'm gonna be a while. tom? tom?"
10532,Lynette,"he's not answering his cell phone.but you don't have to worry,okay?you got what you wanted.he's out of the building."
10534,Lynette,"if this is where you want me to apologize for my husband,i'm not gonna do it.maybe he shouldn't have hit you,but you provoked him."
10535,Lynette,"no! i'm sorry,tom gets punished beuse you can't deal with your screwed-up marriage.it is pathetic,ed.if you had stood up to your wife in the first place,none of this--what?"
12587,Lynette,"ha ha ha, come on in."
12588,Lynette,"oh, right. and, kirby, tell your mom thanks. that place she found for tom is already paying off."
12589,Lynette,sh-she was there? why?
10545,Lynette,maybe you do.
10547,Lynette,atlantic city?
12599,Lynette,okay. bye.
10552,Lynette,"i'm thinking, yeah, ruin it."
12601,Lynette,you said you were rehearsing.
10554,Lynette,no! absolutely not.
12605,Lynette,"good. maybe when you come home, you could teach me how to play that video game."
10559,Lynette,"is this crazy?following tom across the country just to spy on him?if he knewi was doing this--god, i don't think i can go through with this."
12609,Lynette,okay. hurry back.
12612,Lynette,"i always knew things could change between us, tom, but no matter what, the one thing i always thought i'd get is your respect."
10569,Lynette,"whoa. that's weird kind of feedback.you know?physics can be spooky that way.listen, i gotta go.i gotta go.ed is talking to me,and, um,i'll call you back later?"
10572,Lynette,i can't. i can't.i'm sorry. i just can't.
12623,Lynette,i want you to call that woman and tell her you are never seeing her again.
12627,Lynette,"well, then you have put her in a very dangerous position, haven't you?"
12628,Lynette,i am not promising anything.
10589,Lynette,"well, we already swam.now it's time to pack.hey, hey, hey!what's going on?"
10590,Lynette,"okay! okay, okay, porter, just stop, all right? just come on inside, and we'll forget the whole thing."
12640,Lynette,"okay. well, your minute's up."
10593,Lynette,i've got nothing to say to you.i just called because i had to.
12641,Lynette,"no, i have to talk to someone else first. remember when you left that soda can on the coffee table, and it left a ring, and i yelled at you i take it all back."
12642,Lynette,are you really pregnant?
12643,Lynette,don't. don't try and justify this. this is sick. you are sick.
12649,Lynette,oh! she's asleep. she's fine.
12650,Lynette,i went over to talk to anne about recent developments.
12658,Lynette,what were you thinking? you could've gotten hurt in there!
10611,Lynette,isn't your aunt named penny?
10613,Lynette,"you promised me we'd stop at four.remember?you wanted four kids, i wanted one, and somehow we compromised on four.can we please stop now?"
12662,Lynette,no.
12664,Lynette,absolutely.
10618,Lynette,did it hurt for eight hours?
12667,Lynette,"maybe he didn't. but ten minutes later, that nightclub was on fire."
10623,Lynette,probably.
10636,Lynette,hi. did you get the check?
10637,Lynette,tom?!
12684,Lynette,"of course it wasn't. of course. then we're gonna be okay, as long as you keep telling the truth. everything's gonna be fine."
12686,Lynette,oh.
12690,Lynette,"look, this family has been through a lot lately, and your dad and i feel we'll be better parents if we know what's going on in your lives. so, parker, how's that science project you've been working on?"
10645,Lynette,"yeah, that would be a shame."
12696,Lynette,the d.a. says you were spotted coming out of the storage room right before the fire started. what gives?
12702,Lynette,"tom, if you're gonna freak out, can you do that in the other room? i'm kind of busy here."
12703,Lynette,"if edie reports this gun missing, you don't have to be the sharpest cop on the force to figure out where to start looking, and that's the last thing we need right now."
12706,Lynette,what's going on? is there news?
12712,Lynette,"i gave that money to anne schilling so she'd leave town, and tom has no idea."
10665,Lynette,and?
12713,Lynette,hey. whose lawyer are you anyway?
12715,Lynette,no. the house is mortgaged to the teeth.
10671,Lynette,"hey, nora."
12720,Lynette,"well, is it okay if i go up and get it?"
12721,Lynette,thanks.
12726,Lynette,"do you have any idea how bad this is? we had to post bail. if the judge finds out porter skipped town, we're gonna lose--a lot."
10679,Lynette,"okay, all right, everybody's in."
12728,Lynette,it's not just money.
10690,Lynette,thank you for that.
10693,Lynette,"well, we are happy to pitch in."
10695,Lynette,"whenever, just go. you and turk have a great time."
12744,Lynette,"porter, it's mom. where are you?! porter!"
12745,Lynette,you know where he is!
12747,Lynette,fine. you know what you're going to do with it? you are going to call your brother and tell him to come home.
10702,Lynette,"nora, what are you doing back? are you okay?"
10703,Lynette,what's wrong?
12750,Lynette,"i can handle warren schilling. but if porter doesn't show up for court, we're gonna lose our restaurant!"
12751,Lynette,"before i became a mother, i didn't know it was possible to love another human being so completely, and with that love comes this need to protect you. it wasn't a decision i made. it's--primal. it's just something in my dna whatever it is, it makes me not care about myself, and it reminds me that my reason for being on this planet is to look after you kids."
12752,Lynette,"yesterday, you said warren schilling will kill porter if he gets the chance. i will never let that happen."
10719,Lynette,you know what's really bad luck? marrying a wife killer.
12767,Lynette,what are you talking about?
12771,Lynette,i'll take care of it. thank you.
10725,Lynette,what are they doing?
12776,Lynette,do you know what's going on with porter? the fire? the arrest?
10734,Lynette,"no, no, you'll be fine."
12782,Lynette,she's so angry at me. she's never gonna tell us where he is.
10738,Lynette,gaby!
12790,Lynette,it's not a very pleasant experience.
12791,Lynette,"last time i came, you threw pudding at me."
8697,Lynette,"stop it, stop it, stop it. stop it."
8699,Lynette,santa's cell-phone number.
10750,Lynette,"hitch?you mean, like, we're going to be driving in the car together?"
12798,Lynette,oh. that's what it means.
12801,Lynette,that's so nice. we were just--
8707,Lynette,"ow! ease up, you little vampire."
8709,Lynette,what are you doing!? we are at a wake!
12805,Lynette,"yes, 'cause that's what women in their eighth month really crave--more stove time."
10764,Lynette,nora! you can't be serious!
10765,Lynette,"all right, now look, you've gone from crazy to stupid. this guy could be dangerous."
8720,Lynette,"natalie klein, i don't believe it!"
10772,Lynette,i'm sorry i said that about tom. he's doing his best to find a job.
12820,Lynette,you did not just say that.
10774,Lynette,he said that to you? he's never told me that.
8731,Lynette,"ooh, you gotta be kidding! i'm exhausted! i look terrible, i'm covered in peaches!"
8732,Lynette,"well, is it ok if i just lie here?"
10779,Lynette,you're a bright guy.isn't there anything else you might wanna do?
10780,Lynette,"okay, let's call that the backup plan. but, seriously, don't you have some road not taken, some dream you never got around to?"
10782,Lynette,"well, think about it, okay? cause whatever you wanna do, i'm in your corner."
12828,Lynette,we agreed i could go back to work after i gave birth.
12835,Lynette,"oh, my god. oh, my god. i was on the phone. i was talking to my new boss, and i--"
8740,Lynette,absolutely. she'll get through this. she'll find a way to survive.
10790,Lynette,hey.
8743,Lynette,what're you doing? that's private.
12841,Lynette,a witness? what are they talking about?
8746,Lynette,maybe it's just some sort of sick joke.
12846,Lynette,between porter's legal fees and that ghost town that we call a restaurant--
12847,Lynette,"when times get tough, people do without things like pizza and sports cars."
8753,Lynette,my babysitter joined the witness relocation program. i haven't slept through the night in 6 years.
8754,Lynette,"and for you to stand there, and judge me."
10804,Lynette,"hey, give the kid what he wants."
12853,Lynette,"because the people that you love may not be able to pay you back, and then you stop loving them."
10806,Lynette,"yeah, i heard your old man's out of work. that's gotta be tough."
10807,Lynette,"no! a kid's gotta have an allowance. how else you gonna buy the things you want, right? like that cotton candy. that's a little piece of heaven, huh? hey, i got an idea. maybe we could help each other out. my son's having a little trouble hitting the ball."
12855,Lynette,it would. but i can't. i wouldn't want it to affect our friendship.
8762,Lynette,"mrs. huber, i could never leave my kids by the side of the road."
13139,Lynette,jeez! two seconds!
8766,Lynette,"out. can't behave, you heard me, can't ride. you, out. move it."
10814,Lynette,what'd the coach say?
8768,Lynette,"boys? boys? boys?? if you're hiding, you've gotta stop now cause mommy doesn't think it's funny!"
8769,Lynette,"oh! excuse me, i'm sorry, i'm looking for my boys. three boys with red hair, have you seen 'em?"
12862,Lynette,"we'd like to shut scavo's down for the night and throw a party in your honor. just family and friends. we'd toast your success and have a night of fun, just like old times. what do you say?"
12868,Lynette,so?
8778,Lynette,"oh, crap."
8779,Lynette,"boys, you're gonna need to put on your-"
8780,Lynette,"if any of you acts up, i will call santa and tell him you want socks for christmas."
10828,Lynette,are you asking for a bribe?
12877,Lynette,"well, they probably would have loved my pizza, too, but we'll never know, because my partner threw it in the garbage. what a waste."
10831,Lynette,good.
10832,Lynette,no.
8786,Lynette,"we didn't exactly forget, it's just usually when the hostess dies, the party's off."
10836,Lynette,#name?
8789,Lynette,i'm still in.
10839,Lynette,"oh, he's never gonna quit now!"
10843,Lynette,hi. yes-- i am. what is all this?
10845,Lynette,"thanks. no, seriously, though."
12893,Lynette,what is this?
10847,Lynette,"okay, okay, i'm dying here. what's the dream?"
12895,Lynette,"okay--as much as i love tommy scavo's improve theater, we need to face some facts here."
8801,Lynette,"margarita, cigar, sombrero."
8804,Lynette,"throw a dinner party? i don't even have time to wash my face. no, you know what? i'm gonna go to this one. you can stay home and babysit the kids."
8805,Lynette,"the boys will be hungry at 5:30, so put the fish sticks in the toaster oven at 5 o' clock-"
8806,Lynette,"well, if the food's late, god help you."
12900,Lynette,"oh, boy. i think i know what this is about. listen, kids, things have been tough down at the restaurant, and i think your dad has finally decided to sell it."
8808,Lynette,"sweetie, you know our rule about eating cookies, right?"
8809,Lynette,"yeah, but tonight, anything goes. make sure you share with your brothers."
10856,Lynette,yeah--how's that divorce going?
8811,Lynette,i think i can top that. try getting thrown out of disneyland for lewd behaviour.
10863,Lynette,and make tom resent me for the rest of his life. i don't think so.
10864,Lynette,"that's great. hey, can we talk about this restaurant thing for a second?"
12911,Lynette,"you're putting us in the cheapest nursing home you can find. yeah, i got it."
12915,Lynette,"well, clearly, that's not true because you're not a baby. you're 15, remember?"
10868,Lynette,i'm thinking--catering company.
12917,Lynette,yeah?
8822,Lynette,by reliving your night out with the guys?
10872,Lynette,"because you'll fail! i'm sorry! god.i shouldn't have said that.but you're gambling with our life savings, and you have no experience."
10874,Lynette,"tom, i--"
12922,Lynette,"finally. oh, great. they're kids. 1 ate of spaghetti and 15 baskets of free bread."
8830,Lynette,why didn't she say anything?
8831,Lynette,"well, obviously they will be punished for this. severely."
8833,Lynette,what if we separate the twins? put them in different classes? they're much calmer when they're not bouncing off one another.
8836,Lynette,"hi, i got your message. what's going on?"
8837,Lynette,they refused? they're six years old.make them.
12933,Lynette,"yeah, well, putting an ""everything must go"" sign kind of eroded our bargaining position."
12935,Lynette,"look, i know this is a crappy day for you, but we need to start thinking about what our plans are going to be."
8841,Lynette,"thank you. that's the nicest way you could have said that. you know, the truth is, when they're not making me want to pull my hair out they're really, really sweet. i'm afraid that if i change the bad stuff, i'm going to change the good stuff."
8842,Lynette,"like this mug , i love this mug. if i medicate them, are they still going to make me a mug like this?"
12937,Lynette,sorry.
10894,Lynette,you were trying to figure out how to kill edie without doing time.
8850,Lynette,yeah.
12947,Lynette,"because i vividly remember yesterday, and i wasn't born during it."
10901,Lynette,"yeah, he's hot."
12949,Lynette,"bye-bye, high road."
8855,Lynette,"it's like a vitamin, and you'll take one everyday."
8856,Lynette,stay right there.
10904,Lynette,"look, susan, god called you a cab."
12952,Lynette,susan!
8860,Lynette,"not in so many words, but everything paul said certainly made it seem like she was schizophrenic."
8862,Lynette,boys! stop it! go to bed.
8863,Lynette,"well,at least go upstairs.."
10910,Lynette,"yeah, well, any wife can support a husband who never takes risks, and i don't want that kind of husband, and i'll be damned if i'm gonna be that kind of wife. so you open your pizza place, and we will find a way to make it work."
10911,Lynette,mmm. so what happened tonight?
8866,Lynette,"that's nice of you. and since we're talking about it, there's something else nice i'd like you to do. your kids both went to barcliff academy, didn't they?"
12959,Lynette,"well, tom was just running a very successful restaurant, and he just sold it at a handsome profit. so he's waiting for the right opportunity. you might have to do a little selling here, bruce."
8868,Lynette,"yes, you can tell them how beautifully behaved the boys are."
12962,Lynette,"you can have mine. stop saying, ""i don't know."""
10919,Lynette,you will never again see my husband.
12968,Lynette,i'm getting this job. that's what i'm doing.
12969,Lynette,"well, you're not acting like you want it very much, mister--""uh, i don't know. are there any more potatoes?"""
12970,Lynette,"okay, you lick. i'm going to paris."
10923,Lynette,i haven't had it for months. i don't know why it came back.
8877,Lynette,it's not really so much scary as highly developed.
8881,Lynette,ooo-observation?
8886,Lynette,c'on! i got you beat!
12982,Lynette,"i was talking about that job tonight and trying to convince bruce i was good, and i remembered something. i am good. and i would like another chance to prove it."
8889,Lynette,they're always a little shy at first.
10937,Lynette,"well, you're gonna love the neighborhood. are you all moved in?"
12986,Lynette,"coming. do me a favor. if you hear a gunshot, tell my four kids i love them."
8892,Lynette,"well,did you bat your eyes? you know, it doesn't work if you don't bat your eyes."
8893,Lynette,"oh,thanks."
12991,Lynette,"hey, gaby? i'll see ya. i wanted to ask you something. feel free to say no."
8897,Lynette,"but to be fair, that is part of your charm."
8902,Lynette,we're not moving.
10950,Lynette,i'm sorry. i'm sorry. we'll-- we'll be quiet.
10951,Lynette,"nora, shut up!"
8908,Lynette,"yeah. it gave me some good ideas. well, one, anyway."
10956,Lynette,"okay, i'm listening."
8912,Lynette,ah-ha!
10961,Lynette,"who cares?!who cares?we all have pain! everyone in here has pain, but we deal with it! we swallow it and get going with our lives! what we don't do is go around shooting strangers!"
8915,Lynette,"i'm sorry, i thought you were kidding."
8918,Lynette,"so then you are aware that the wolf is a bad guy. he eats little red's grandma. if you let him go, he's just going to chow down on another defenseless old lady."
10966,Lynette,why not?
13018,Lynette,"okay. okay. not to pry, but when you said carlos took you to st. barths--"
8924,Lynette,"sure, they get to play oak trees. i'm the one who has to deal with all the drama behind the scenes."
13021,Lynette,hey. what are you doing here?
8927,Lynette,"that would have never happened in boy scouts. when i worked, mostly with men, i preferred the way they fought. a guy takes his opponent on, face to face, and once he's won, he's top dog. it's primitive, but it's fair."
8928,Lynette,"it's science, gabrielle.sociologists have documented this stuff."
10976,Lynette,"fantastic! lead the way, i'm coming in."
8935,Lynette,i'll finish the costumes.
8937,Lynette,"oh jordana, you are really a lifesaver, thank you. here, these pieces need trim."
13039,Lynette,you busy?
13041,Lynette,i thought it would be a nice addition to your collection.
10995,Lynette,"hey, sweetheart, you okay?"
10997,Lynette,"well, because she's--"
10999,Lynette,"okay, i should be back at around six o'clock. they can have one snack. try and push apples, but if they threaten violence, i have an emergency candy bar under the sink."
11000,Lynette,"oh, jeez."
13047,Lynette,no. i got a hole puncher. sorry. that's the best i could do. come on.
8956,Lynette,i stopped after page 50.
8958,Lynette,that's the mystery part.
11006,Lynette,"hey, buddy, you've been reading comic books for a while. don't you wanna go and play?"
11009,Lynette,"good, uh, listen, as if saving my life wasn't enough, i have a little favor to ask."
13057,Lynette,"oh, please. we're talking about edie. a little more irreverence is what we need."
8963,Lynette,yeah?
11012,Lynette,"but my other son, parker. so. back to the favor."
11013,Lynette,"hey, parker. i want you to meet our new neighbor, art. he lives in the house across the street. his sister has the cool wheelchair with the joystick."
13058,Lynette,hey.
13061,Lynette,thanks. i can't get comfortable. could you fluff my pillows?
11016,Lynette,he really did. that's why you don't have to worry. that's protector man's job. your job is to run and play and have fun. okay?
13062,Lynette,"before you go, would you put my socks back on? my feet are cold again."
11018,Lynette,shh! that's a secret. hello? hello?
11020,Lynette,"parker? hey! come back here! honey? come on, we're leaving. parker. parker, come on, we're leaving. why didn't you come when i called?"
8976,Lynette,"it means come girl scout cookie time, don't bother bringing little tina, because we won't be home!"
11024,Lynette,"i am telling you, our neighbor is a pedophile, and i expect you to do something about it."
8982,Lynette,yep. he's a feisty one.
13079,Lynette,she called me a baby factory?
8986,Lynette,"oh, you know what would be even better? dry cleaning bags."
11035,Lynette,what are the blake kids doing all the way over here? pam needs to keep a closer eye on them.
8990,Lynette,i was just participating.
13086,Lynette,mm. here's a thought--we all say one word that sums up what we thought of her.
8992,Lynette,that is not fair!
13088,Lynette,strong.
11042,Lynette,i didn't notice.
8995,Lynette,"yeah, well."
13090,Lynette,"go ahead, susan. what are your four words for edie?"
13094,Lynette,you're in a garden club?
11048,Lynette,okay.
9005,Lynette,"it pisses me off. i've got four kids, you know. i was up all night reading statistics online. one out of every four traffic accidents happens on residential streets. i hope whoever hit juanita gets put away for life."
13101,Lynette,hmm. that's okay. i can see it from here. thrilling. mwah.
9007,Lynette,"i hope this works. my sleep cycle is totally out of whack. i'm up all night, i'm dozing off during the day."""
11056,Lynette,don't play dumb with me. i know exactly what is down here! where's the pinball? where's all the games?
13103,Lynette,but i am exhausted.
11058,Lynette,don't pretend you don't know. i'm calling the police. parker!
13106,Lynette,come on!
9014,Lynette,"knock it off, you little monsters."
11062,Lynette,what if parker had been in there?
11063,Lynette,please don't bring up the supermarket again.
11064,Lynette,you're right. i need to talk to someone.
13113,Lynette,"carlos, you're early!"
13114,Lynette,"oh, crap. i'll be right there! aah!"
9020,Lynette,the scout meeting is today?
9021,Lynette,"what? oh--right! okay, boys. this knot is called the bowline. it is a remarkably useful knot. now, pick up your ropes. okay. first we cross this end over here, and then we make a loop, and then another loop, and then you sort of pull it through, i'm guessing, and then, ready? yank it taut."
11070,Lynette,"hey, rita, i gotta go."
11071,Lynette,"sorry, i can't talk now. i have somewhere to go."
9024,Lynette,"no, tom, you can't do this to me. because, i need you at home. boys, stop it, i am on the phone. well, yeah, i realize it's not your fault that the meeting got postponed, but you promised you'd be back tonight. i, i, i gotta go. the kids are-- yeah, i know-- you're sorry, just, will you try to get back as soon as you can? okay, bye."
13115,Lynette,"no, i'm fine. i-i want to go."
11074,Lynette,"well, i am sorry that happened."
13123,Lynette,"hear, hear. to friendship. so i want to hear more about the garden club. tom says he's meeting all kinds of nice people."
13124,Lynette,mm.
13126,Lynette,you told her? i asked you not to.
9035,Lynette,"well, mrs. huber never showed up. why don't you wear this one?"
13132,Lynette,"it's my fault. i should have just told tom the truth, although it turned out to be kind of a wash with the whole patty rizzo thing."
9037,Lynette,sunscreen?
11087,Lynette,"well, that's what we think, but we don't exactly have proof."
9040,Lynette,"tom, our last version of normal had me popping pills. normal is a bad, bad plan."
13136,Lynette,tom and i are reading this book that suggests couples make a pact to have sex every night for a month.
13137,Lynette,"we've been having some problems, so the theory is it creates intimacy and brings you closer."
11091,Lynette,i know. but be fair. there is no way i could've anticipated this.
9044,Lynette,"yeah, that's why i was hoping to take advantage of your expertise."
9045,Lynette,all your rich friends have nannies. a-list nannies. i need to catch one--here you go--without their bosses.
11093,Lynette,okay.
9047,Lynette,"look, at my old job, we didn't wait for good people to come to us. we went out and raided other companies. i don't see why it should be different when you're hiring a nanny."
11094,Lynette,stop it! stop it! you can't do this to people! have you lost your minds?!
13138,Lynette,i've gotta say it is. you become more attuned to each other's needs and more sensitive to--
9050,Lynette,"you know, i couldn't help but notice how wonderful you are with those children."
11099,Lynette,what do you mean?
11100,Lynette,you can't stay here.
13140,Lynette,"no, we're in our third week. we got this down to a science. just deal me out a few hands."
13142,Lynette,"did you remember to get my, um--my special deodorant?"
13143,Lynette,"i'm totally slammed, which is why i'm calling. it looks like i'm gonna be here late tonight, and by ""late,"" i mean past midnight."
13147,Lynette,"well, then what are you doing--here? oh, no. are you crazy?"
13148,Lynette,"but i have so much to do, and i'm not gonna be done till 2:00 a.m. possibly 3:00. whoo!"
9058,Lynette,what?
13151,Lynette,hello?
11108,Lynette,"hi, kayla! we missed you! we're so glad you're here. okay, boys."
13152,Lynette,now? i'm kind of busy!
13153,Lynette,yes?
13156,Lynette,what are you doing?
11112,Lynette,"porter! i--you know what? i got you something, too."
13159,Lynette,mm.
13164,Lynette,is there a problem?
13165,Lynette,after?
11118,Lynette,"kayla, where you going?"
13168,Lynette,"oh, okay. i'm gonna let that one go, 'cause you're upset."
9073,Lynette,dishes?
11121,Lynette,well--just this once.
13172,Lynette,"see this? my third espresso. i'm wired. no way i'm falling asleep tonight. hey. how about we throw a pizza on the front lawn, and when the kids run out to get it, we lock the door and do it in every room in the house? tom, i'm sorry. i don't know what else to say. if you wanna stay mad, i guess you're gonna stay mad."
11125,Lynette,"whoa, whoa, whoa! sit your butts down!"
9078,Lynette,you better finish those brussel sprouts. and don't think i can't see them hidden under your macaroni.
13177,Lynette,so--what do you want to do? hmm? what are you passionate about?
11134,Lynette,"all right, let's hit it. now come on, kayla."
9087,Lynette,"i wonder what's going on over there. i mean, claire did okay with the kids yesterday, but that could have been beginner's luck. do you think i should call? i should call!"
11136,Lynette,"well, they, you know, wolfed it down like kids are supposed to. so-- hurry it up."
11137,Lynette,"kayla, i'm not fooling around. we--we're going."
13184,Lynette,i didn't keep it from you. it's just one of those tech things that you don't care about. it's for young people.
9091,Lynette,"well, i'm just curious. i mean, he moves out, he moves back in. is he back for good?"
13185,Lynette,i didn't say that. you're not gonna get a whole lot of sympathy from me. i just went through the same thing. remember?
13186,Lynette,"i think you mean ""ttering."" sorry. please, don't hit me."
13187,Lynette,"oh, for god sakes, knock it off! i am not gonna let you feel sorry for yourself. you are tom scavo, damn it!"
9095,Lynette,i gave her the afternoon off. who wants to turn pages?
11143,Lynette,so you have been in canada this entire time?
11144,Lynette,"well, you gotta hand it to her. just when you think bree's thrown every conceivable theme party she hosts a ""shame on you for thinking my husband killed someone"" dinner."
11145,Lynette,okay. you go--
11147,Lynette,"hey, stranger."
9105,Lynette,you had a nanny?
13202,Lynette,"oh, my husband wants to spend money we don't have on a face-lift he doesn't need, so--not great."
9107,Lynette,really.
11155,Lynette,ooh!
11156,Lynette,so-- any idea when that might be?
13203,Lynette,and? how's he look?
13208,Lynette,"well, like you said, it's your face. come on, i'm dying for you to meet bruce."
11163,Lynette,fine! good night.
13212,Lynette,that's my point. you don't know how these things will turn out.
13214,Lynette,because i don't want to have plastic surgery.
11167,Lynette,okay. good. i'll see ya.
11168,Lynette,oh-- my-- god.
11169,Lynette,"andrew, hi! i thought you weren't starting until the opening."
13218,Lynette,"you're gonna get a job, and it'll be because they're impressed by your experience, not your wrinkle-free face."
11173,Lynette,touch.
13221,Lynette,"well, it seems like, based on your last visa records you've already been on vacation."
11177,Lynette,this is a nightmare. how did this happen?
13225,Lynette,"hey, focus. our son is throwing his life away. we have got to keep him on track."
13227,Lynette,"i am just trying to help preston avoid the way marked ""unemployable loser."""
9132,Lynette,about what?
9135,Lynette,"it's a search and rescue, not recovery. we don't know if she's dead."
13231,Lynette,oh!
13233,Lynette,really?
11186,Lynette,thank you.
11190,Lynette,"look, i understand your concerns about the license. your neighbors had them, too. but they signed the waiver once i explained to them that this is a family restaurant. no late nights, no loud music."
13239,Lynette,which is?
13240,Lynette,chinese?
9146,Lynette,"oh, so you are attracted to her."
9148,Lynette,it's the basic flaw of your gender. i get it. just do me the honor of-
9149,Lynette,my husband won't admit that he has lust in his heart. can you give us a minute?
11198,Lynette,hey.
13244,Lynette,"please, sensei, instruct me in your ancient ways."
11200,Lynette,really? that's great!
9153,Lynette,"here, blow. good, all right. come on, it's going to be fun. follow me."
9156,Lynette,"uh, lauren? i'm a mother of four. today i had to get up at five, make lunches, make breakfast, drop the twins off at school, and get across town lugging a baby and a sick child. telling me to plan ahead is like telling me to sprout wings. and it's things like being told to plan ahead that make me so crazy, that yoga is the only thing that relaxes me, except i show up here, and i can't get in, and you tell me to plan ahead. it's a vicious cycle. see how that works?"
13252,Lynette,"who cares what time it is? we were celebrating a big change in your dad's life. hey, someone called."
13253,Lynette,"oh, jeezs."
13257,Lynette,marketplace?
9166,Lynette,yeah. tuesday's poker day.
11214,Lynette,come on. you and your brothers will be thrilled. don't you get tired of me yelling at you to clean up your room and finish your homework?
9168,Lynette,that's so sweet.
11219,Lynette,"tom, no. you can't. you can't. the pizzeria opens in a week, and that street fair is the best advertising we're gonna get."
13270,Lynette,i went to the doctor today.
11223,Lynette,"what?! no.uh-uh.look,i'm wearing makeup.i am holding a briefcase.what does this suggest to you?"
9176,Lynette,"oh. that's sweet of you, but it's not exactly true."
13277,Lynette,i'll do it.
11234,Lynette,"don't touch me, okay?"
11238,Lynette,see ya next week! thanks for understanding!
9197,Lynette,"i'm not gonna drop you. i might strangle you for climbing up here in the first place. but drop you, no. come on!"
9201,Lynette,"yeah, i'm gonna get right on that."
9204,Lynette,"uh, yeah, sure, knock yourself out! be careful."
9205,Lynette,are you okay?
13304,Lynette,"oh, yeah!"
11262,Lynette,"you fell for the face. what are you, a rookie?"
9218,Lynette,it's not complicated. it's completely irresponsible.
9219,Lynette,but your take on this is you're the victim?
11272,Lynette,hey! you hired him back? did he tell you he was stoned on the job?
11278,Lynette,"yeah. i just wish you'd told me before you rehired him. i mean, i am the manager."
11280,Lynette,you pulling rank on me?
9233,Lynette,"so here's the thing, i feel really awful about how i acted before."
9234,Lynette,"i overreacted, i know. i'm sorry."
11284,Lynette,whatever you say--boss.
9241,Lynette,where did you guys get this pot?
9242,Lynette,"really? i love it. well, this is the nicest present you boys had ever given me, and you know what? i'm gonna put it out on the front porch so the whole neighborhood can enjoy it"
11290,Lynette,"if they're salty, we'll sell more beer. see? you're a genius."
9244,Lynette,"no, no, no. my sons made that for me for valentine's day."
11292,Lynette,only two.and the mailman had the good taste never to bring that up again.come on.let's go get some sleep.
9247,Lynette,you're capable of doing all sorts of things.
11296,Lynette,"well, i'm so glad she has you to take care of her, and of course your mom comes first, andrew. and i wouldn't even ask except, you know, we're opening tonight--"
9252,Lynette,"for a first time offense, if you swear, cross your heart, that you will never, never steal again, and you write mrs. mccluskey a letter of apology, i will let it slide."
11300,Lynette,wait. where are my chairs? i didn't order these.
11304,Lynette,"animatronic rats. where do they find you people? okay, okay, here it is. see? i ordered fifty of item number seven three--"
9258,Lynette,what?
11309,Lynette,"oh, hey, hon."
9263,Lynette,nobody in my family knows or cares where your stupid clock is.
9264,Lynette,"no, don't you dare. we'll move it when you say please."
11314,Lynette,"now it's ""us""? because i thought i was the one who was trying to ruin everything."
9267,Lynette,what?
9276,Lynette,no. i'll just wait out here.
9285,Lynette,"well, i wouldn't put it past them."
11333,Lynette,"oh, i couldn't relax. i just kept replaying the fight i had with tom in my head."
9288,Lynette,how was your day?
11338,Lynette,hideously.
11341,Lynette,knock yourself out.
9295,Lynette,i forgot how much fun you are when you're bitter.
9296,Lynette,tom--
9297,Lynette,"oh, my god."
11343,Lynette,nine years--and i have loved every minute of it.
9299,Lynette,thank god.
11346,Lynette,thanks. are you sure it's the right--
9304,Lynette,oh my -- what? what? the whole west coast? i thought you were going after an in-house position.
11352,Lynette,as well he should be.
11357,Lynette,"really, kim? 'cause--i heard one of your customers say that when halloween comes around, we should stick a candle in your mouth. see? morale. you guys need to stand up for yourselves. it's your right-no, it's your obligation to go to management and demand new shirts. and if management doesn't like it, you tell him he can go screw-!"
11358,Lynette,"okay, okay. break's over, people. i'm gonna go find tom and talk. oh! good."
9311,Lynette,"oh, we went out for burgers and the boys knew you wouldn't be home till after, um, bedtime so we decided to pop in and visit the new vp"
11359,Lynette,"well, you gave me no choice."
11363,Lynette,"later i'll be asleep, and then i will be back here before you wake up. we gotta deal with this now."
9318,Lynette,"of course, i mean, i will miss him being gone all the time. he'll be bringing in more money, but he is gonna miss the birthdays, baseball games, first steps. that's the trade-off, right? i just hope one day tom doesn't look back and regret being gone so much. i better get out there before they break something."
11367,Lynette,"tom, it's me again. you should've been home thirty minutes ago. i know. you're still mad. i am, too, so why don't you come home and we can be mad together? see you soon."
11369,Lynette,this isn't about the shirt anymore. this is about us working together. every day it's a battle. it's hurting our marriage. you know what? i'll just tell tom i need to step back.
11370,Lynette,yeah. we could hire a manager or something.
9323,Lynette,"yeah, of course."
11372,Lynette,i'm an idiot. would you guys mind--
11373,Lynette,tom! come on! i know you're still here. you realize what time it is? i know! you're mad. but you just--you can't avoid me all night.
11385,Lynette,"all right, i am heading out of here. wish me luck."
9338,Lynette,"measles, huh?"
11387,Lynette,"yeah, i know, i know. bottom of the barrel, convicts and losers. you were clear about that last night."
11389,Lynette,"oh, for god sake, tom! i'm gonna be late for this interview. i really should go."
9346,Lynette,i don't get it. i don't get who would pay maisy for sex.
9347,Lynette,really.
11402,Lynette,"great. come on over. your application"""
11403,Lynette,no. it's great you can spell. you are now officially the front-runner.
11405,Lynette,not afraid to shamelessly ass kiss. you are doing very well.
11409,Lynette,hi! i'm home! and i've got good news. i found a new manager.
9362,Lynette,nurse abigail?
9363,Lynette,i just wanted to tell you that the boys are now lice-free.
9364,Lynette,"i just can't figure out how it happened. they get a bath every night. trust me, it's the ugliest 15 minutes of the day."
9365,Lynette,i keep thinking that maybe it was the petting zoo that i took them to last week. that llama was really iffy.
11415,Lynette,"i can't find somebody else. i've interviewed fifty guys and this junkie happens to be the best of the bunch. seriously, tom, i don't know how much longer i--"
11417,Lynette,"fine. i'll, uh, keep looking."
9370,Lynette,so which kid is it?
9375,Lynette,"for god's sakes, there's gonna be a magician. tammy brennan went all out."
9381,Lynette,"no, not -- not -- not quite yet. boys, keep bouncing. that's right. keep bouncing. oh, by the way, i spoke to nurse abigail. i know who patient zero is."
9382,Lynette,how could you do that?
9384,Lynette,"oh, please."
9386,Lynette,"i'm going to tell the truth to every mother out there, and then i'm gonna take back the bongos."
9392,Lynette,"oh hi. nice to meet you, lily."
9394,Lynette,i'd love to.
9395,Lynette,"even better, let's just keep it adults."
11442,Lynette,why would a four-star chef wanna slum at a pizza joint?
11446,Lynette,of course! absolutely!
9400,Lynette,"why wait, why don't we just rip it up now."
11448,Lynette,"oh, this is awful. on a good night, we barely break even. tonight is gonna kill the whole week."
9405,Lynette,"i don't think we should be talking about alisa with her, so--"
11461,Lynette,"um, tom. . ."
9414,Lynette,what a voice.
9420,Lynette,she's your wife. how can you talk about her like that?
11468,Lynette,i don't think so. i'm giving it a try.
9426,Lynette,"um, sure. here,boys. stay right there."
9427,Lynette,"so, how are you?"
9429,Lynette,why?
9433,Lynette,"yes, that's not exactly what i--"
9434,Lynette,i didn't mean that you--
11482,Lynette,don't you have any friends to hang out with?
11485,Lynette,"oh, well--thanks. this is delicious."
9442,Lynette,"tom, am i a bad person?"
9443,Lynette,i don't know. i guess i just have it in my head that only bad people break up marriages and offend the handicapped.
11493,Lynette,you're kidding.
9448,Lynette,you know what i admire you for? you find a way to compliment me when you could say 'i told you so.'
11496,Lynette,"she's reworked the lyrics to ""wind beneath my wings."""
9451,Lynette,hi. hi.
11500,Lynette,"oh, please, i don't want to think of how many times she brought them ice cream from that basement. i mean, jeez, if you want to keep your husband on ice, at least have a dedicated freezer."
9455,Lynette,"thank you, thank you. alright in you go."
11504,Lynette,i think it's a shame you didn't make any for yourself.
11505,Lynette,"hi, honey."
9461,Lynette,"yeah, you're right, bree, i've got a lot to learn about parenting. and i feel so blessed to be getting sage advice from such an impeccable mother like you. i mean your kids turned out perfect, as long as you don't count andrew. where is he again, hum? some kind of, uh, boot camp for juvenile delinquents."
9462,Lynette,the hell i'm not.
9463,Lynette,she spanked my son. i'm not apologising.
11512,Lynette,those are shameless rationalizations. keep them coming.
9466,Lynette,"yeah, you're damned right she did. she could've tried something else, like a time out or she could have simply threatened to spank him."
11514,Lynette,"what do you mean, we?"
11518,Lynette,hello?
11521,Lynette,"well, i'm really busy at the restaurant. believe me, i come home to daddy just as soon as i can."
11525,Lynette,"hey, hey!"
11528,Lynette,cater?
9484,Lynette,and you know-mrs mcclusky?
9485,Lynette,"mrs mcclusky, are you alright?"
11533,Lynette,"no, i love it. it's--it's just that's a little late for me, and--"
9500,Lynette,"mrs mcclusky, i won't have any time tomorrow."
9502,Lynette,"here, you should take this back. i don't have a place for it."
9506,Lynette,she never leaves her mail sitting out there. i mean how many times has she thrown ours away because we didn't pick it up the minute it came.
9507,Lynette,"i don't know, tom, i think something's happened to her."
9512,Lynette,have you been taking your arthritis medication?
11560,Lynette,"yeah. um, i told kim that we'd be out the rest of the evening and she's gonna lock up."
11562,Lynette,hey! hi! what are you doing here?
11565,Lynette,"oh, i missed you, too. hey, why don't you guys go grab that big table, and i will have rick whip something up for us?"
9523,Lynette,"oh, thank you. and you. you're here. in the office. tom's office."
9530,Lynette,tom!
9532,Lynette,"c'on, you can tell me. you still care about her, don't you, just a teeny tiny little bit?"
9533,Lynette,"well, you can't work with her."
11580,Lynette,"yeah, well, you know, it is, but i just don't want you to come back before you're ready. you might reinjure yourself."
9535,Lynette,"no. i'm serious. if she stays, i will haunt your office. i will bring you lunch everyday. i will bring the kids to visit. i will change diapers on your desk. every birthday cake in the break room, every retirement party, i will be there. watching her."
11584,Lynette,"well, don't think so much. just rest and get better. that's what you need to do."
9539,Lynette,watch your step. tom and i are a team. our marriage is rock solid. nothing you ever do will break us up.
11587,Lynette,the restaurant did close a half-hour ago.
11594,Lynette,"oh-- my--god! oh! oh, my god! they locked us in here! it's forty-two degrees! we're gonna freeze to death!"
11595,Lynette,"no, he won't. he takes a pain pill at ten. he's probably already asleep. jeez. how are we gonna make it through the night in here?"
9550,Lynette,i'm good. looks like we're got some company.
11603,Lynette,"no, no, i'm just cold."
11605,Lynette,"i was doing receipts, and rick surprised me with this great idea for the menu. it's called--what are they called?"
11609,Lynette,there. hey--i made you an espresso.
9564,Lynette,i trust you.
11613,Lynette,did he what?
11622,Lynette,it was kind of dead tonight. hi.
11627,Lynette,"i missed you, too."
11628,Lynette,you can't work here anymore.
9581,Lynette,hi.
9582,Lynette,what are you thinking?
11632,Lynette,"you wanna know what's bugging me? i'm trying to have a lovely breakfast with my family, and you're picking a fight."
11640,Lynette,tom--
11642,Lynette,i am not answering that. this is not a therapy session.
9597,Lynette,"i used to be the fantasy. there was a time when i didn't need a maid's outfit because i knew i was enough for you, even wearing a smelly t-shirt. and clearly, that's no longer the case."
11649,Lynette,"look, even if gaby is in the wrong here--and she--she is hugely, hideously wrong--do you really want to boycott her wedding?"
11650,Lynette,"i think her point--and again, i wish she'd express herself a little more tactfully-- was that marriage is unpredictable. we can't know what it'll be until we're in it."
11652,Lynette,it could ruin your friendship. are you willing to take that chance?
9605,Lynette,oh my god!
11657,Lynette,fine. let's have sex.
11658,Lynette,yeah. let's get this off.
11660,Lynette,sorry. i'll try to be gentler as i move down south.
11663,Lynette,you didn't make him quit! i fired him!
11664,Lynette,"the idiot told me he had feelings for me, which he never would've done if you hadn't pushed him, and now he's gone. it's all your fault."
9618,Lynette,"yeah, it's nice to see susan so happy again."
9620,Lynette,that's right. did they ever explain that?
11669,Lynette,i would never cheat on you. you know that.
9624,Lynette,"well, as happy as i am to see you, i actually have an agenda. i ran into someone last week who said you guys were looking to hire. is that true?"
9628,Lynette,"he's apples, i'm oranges, we excel in different areas. trust me, you should give tom a look."
9629,Lynette,"geez, nat, you make me feel like some kind of shark. ah, okay. you know, actually, if that's the kind of exec you're looking for--"
11681,Lynette,bree!
9637,Lynette,"just stay here with penny for a second, okay?"
11685,Lynette,"yep. dave lost his job at the plant, and he is now handing out flyers at a chicken restaurant, and--prepare to wince-- there is a chicken suit involved."
11689,Lynette,"well, in that spirit, as soon as i start chemo, i will be giving up shampoo."
11691,Lynette,"it's been five years, mom. they don't remember you."
9644,Lynette,you're just gonna stay here and play games all day?
9645,Lynette,tom.
11695,Lynette,"well, that's what you get when you mix chemo and vodka gimlets."
9648,Lynette,i don't know what to say.
11698,Lynette,"what, someone loaned us ten thousand dollars?"
11700,Lynette,"well, we're giving it back."
9654,Lynette,"well, yes, yes, it is hard, but i, i love it, too, and i've been doing it for six years, and i haven't complained the entire time."
9655,Lynette,we should talk about this seriously before we make any rash decisions.
11708,Lynette,"aw, i think it's so great, and we could not be happier for you. when's your due date?"
9662,Lynette,go on. off. good.
11711,Lynette,"well, i don't know how you did it. the kids are asleep, and the cough syrup hasn't been touched."
9669,Lynette,"she said she was gonna call. she's got a lot of things to do, planning for the funeral, that sort of thing."
11718,Lynette,no i don't.
9672,Lynette,i was a stay-at-home mom. i wish it had taken time off.
9674,Lynette,"yeah, of course, they won't get in the way of the job because my husband's staying home with them from now on."
9675,Lynette,"with all due respect, nina, won't be an issue. i can leave home at home."
9676,Lynette,"are you kidding? this office is paradise. grown-ups talking about grown-up things. no screaming, no vomiting, no boogers under the table. you're gonna have to drag me outta here kicking and screaming - weekends, holidays, whenever."
11723,Lynette,mom.
11725,Lynette,what the hell happened? how could she pull a stunt like this?
11733,Lynette,"look,i can deal with the chemo.i can deal with people telling me my hair has never looked better.but what i cannot deal with is the pity,so we are doing it my way."
9690,Lynette,"stu. you look like a bright, uh, responsible young man, and i bet you just love kids. am i right?"
11742,Lynette,"it's my life.some stupid disease is not gonna keep me from living it.besides,parker's expecting to see me."
9695,Lynette,"um, i got to do a broader range of campaigns."
11752,Lynette,i'm in charge of decorations?
11754,Lynette,"i'm sorry,sweetie.i'm just-- i'm just too tired right now."
11756,Lynette,i just didn't realize how tired i would be when i took this on.
11757,Lynette,"okay,i'm gonna be honest with you.i haven't been feeling that great lately."
11762,Lynette,you with us?
11763,Lynette,i have cancer.
11773,Lynette,i'll see you at home.
9726,Lynette,why are you yelling at me?
11775,Lynette,out!
11778,Lynette,i don't mind.
9734,Lynette,okay. welcome to the promised land. go on! there! good job!
9735,Lynette,hi. hi.
11782,Lynette,gaby?
9737,Lynette,"i saw you walk in, and i've been meaning to call since the service, but work's been so crazy so--how are you doing?"
11783,Lynette,"hey, gaby."
11786,Lynette,"yeah, but between us, you're the one i really want there. out of everyone, you're the most fun, and i need that now."
11788,Lynette,yeah--kinda. can i pencil you in?
9741,Lynette,"oh, i'm so sorry. is she gonna be okay?"
9742,Lynette,i forgot.
11791,Lynette,"no, no, i don't need magazines. i need company. sit down. you've been bouncing around since you got here. so--how do you like being the first lady of fairview?"
9744,Lynette,"hey, sweet pea. why? what's wrong?"
11792,Lynette,"i'm fine. so tell me something. when you go to a ribbon cutting, do you get to keep those gigantic novelty scissors?"
9753,Lynette,you killed it?
9754,Lynette,"hey. little guy. i just wanted to say i'm really sorry about what happened with the shovel. neither one of us saw that coming. i know it's not much consolation, but you really helped my marriage. that's a lot for a little rat to accomplish in one lifetime. well, it's getting late, so, hats off to ya!"
11805,Lynette,wait--is katherine going to susan's charade night?
9759,Lynette,"so on your first day of school, you and your dad can find your cubby and you can hang it up."
9762,Lynette,all right. i didn't know it was that important to you. i will talk to my boss and i will see what i can do.
11810,Lynette,"oh. no, thanks."
11811,Lynette,"i appreciate the effort, but i told you, i can't keep anything down, and f.y.i. mac and cheese is halfway to vomit. you might as well have given me a plate of creamed corn."
11812,Lynette,"yeah, i am taking it. it's just--not working."
9769,Lynette,"because we can't escape the fact that i have kids. i love my job, but to be fair, there's gotta be some balance."
9773,Lynette,"parker, honey, can you hear me? tom, why isn't he talking?"
11828,Lynette,okay.
9783,Lynette,"nina, nature is calling."
9784,Lynette,yes!
9785,Lynette,"bill on delivery, yes!"
9786,Lynette,"no, no, i'm just, i'm very excited. it's a really good plan. yeah."
11832,Lynette,yes! yes! yes!
11836,Lynette,"could you check on 'em for me, please?"
11838,Lynette,"what is wrong with you? i told you, i didn't want any pot."
11839,Lynette,"that's not the point. and what were you thinking, using my son as a drug mule?"
9792,Lynette,"i'm sorry, who?"
9797,Lynette,"i hope you're right. at the risk of sounding too sensitive,"" ""how come she gets a bigger portion?"
9798,Lynette,"hey buddy, wake up sleepyhead. parker. hi, hi pal. what do you say you and me go get some donuts, okay, before mommy has to go to work. yeah?"
9800,Lynette,"all right. ah. so, what do you think you are going to have, huh? jelly? cause i think i'm gonna have a bear claw."
11851,Lynette,hey! hey. screw it.
11853,Lynette,"no, i'm good. hey, babe, what's going on? you still with me?"
11858,Lynette,a week? all right. you'll hurt if you can?
11863,Lynette,what are you saying?
11868,Lynette,"you said ""no shower. but look around--men. so technically, it's a party, not a shower."
11872,Lynette,"oh, about brandy--bad news."
11873,Lynette,"well, penny wanted to play beauty school with the wig, and, well, let's just say she's got no future as a stylist."
11876,Lynette,i'm not. whatcha got back there?
9829,Lynette,shut up.
9834,Lynette,parker.
9836,Lynette,"or, uh, maybe she's not. she could have left. you know. maybe she had some other little boy that she needed to help."
9837,Lynette,"i don't know. it could be a little boy in, uh, england named spencer."
11889,Lynette,"hey, guys, i got your snack. what you playing?"
9843,Lynette,oh. don't you worry? i'm here.
9853,Lynette,"hey, stretch. see my friend over there? she thinks you're cute."
11904,Lynette,"no, actually, i'm nominating myself. i am now running for president--against you."
9861,Lynette,"you're welcome, but i really need to get home."
11911,Lynette,"hey. listen, i promised tom i wouldn't knock myself out campaigning for this homeowners thing, so i was hoping you could help me--you know, ring some bells, talk me up, that sort of thing?"
9864,Lynette,ah.
9870,Lynette,you're gonna take me off kamarov because i won't go drinking with you?
9881,Lynette,"well, i don't usually do this."
9882,Lynette,it's crazy here tonight. don't you want to dance?
9884,Lynette,"bree, wait, you're gonna have to explain. rex is dead. what could he have done to upset you?"
11932,Lynette,"oh, jeez. get over here."
11933,Lynette,"oh, look, it's our new queen-- katherine of arrogant. hey, where's the wrecking ball?"
9889,Lynette,"no, actually, i have quite a few others. uh, the blue one, and uh--"
11937,Lynette,is that a hole?
11942,Lynette,great. here. grab this.
11944,Lynette,don't give him a name. he's not gonna be around much longer.
11949,Lynette,"huh? oh, the pet scan. no, not till tomorrow. listen, i need your help. there's a possum in my garden."
9902,Lynette,"fine. i'll take them back. could you step out for a minute, please? i want to be alone with it for a little while."
11950,Lynette,"not as much as me. i put out poison, but it ate around it. i got one of those humane traps, but all i trapped was penny."
11951,Lynette,i want a gun.
11955,Lynette,great.
11956,Lynette,shh!
11962,Lynette,thank you.
11966,Lynette,"well, the results are back, and while you can never actually say you're cured--"
9921,Lynette,"no, not to worry. i got the feeling they were sort of enjoying themselves."
9922,Lynette,"well, they look fine to me."
11971,Lynette,"well, it got me thinking about how much you've had to put your life on hold these past few months."
9924,Lynette,"rest assured, we have not forgotten. see ya!"
11974,Lynette,it's not just that. it's the smoking and the swearing and the teaching the kids how to make a whiskey sour.
11976,Lynette,"you have money, right? i mean, you loaned us that $10,000."
11978,Lynette,what do you mean? i thought you were living with lucy.
9931,Lynette,"oh, uh--"
9935,Lynette,"actually, yes. we've agonized whether to tell you this, norma, but one of your private videos made its way into jimmy and pj's bag."
9936,Lynette,"oh, norma. norma, we just thought you needed to know what happened."
11985,Lynette,give me that.
9939,Lynette,"i need these play dates. tom, we need these play dates."
11989,Lynette,"i told you, if you're gonna have a tree house--you've gotta keep it clean."
9946,Lynette,"home, home movies. the fact is, we really don't care, and it's certainly no reason to keep our boys apart."
11994,Lynette,"i also had cancer for four months, and if i could've asked one of them to leave, i'm not sure which i would've picked."
9949,Lynette,"well, from a lay perspective, it looked very professional."
11997,Lynette,"well, we can't just throw her out on the street."
9953,Lynette,huh?
9954,Lynette,"well, that sounds expensive."
9956,Lynette,hi.
12006,Lynette,"yes, hi. i'm looking for my mom. she hangs out at your bar sometimes. stella wingfield? uh, older lady, big smoker, talks like a teamster. well, that's your fault for letting her run a tab. look, if you see her, could you tell her to call lynette? thank you."
9964,Lynette,again? how often does this happen?
9965,Lynette,"tom, it's nine o'clock at night."
12018,Lynette,i didn't know you guys had kept in touch.
12021,Lynette,"oh, well, good. at least she's not living like a hobo. oh, my god. i'm so glad to see you again."
12030,Lynette,"i am sorry about that, mom. we were just venting. people who love you need to do that."
12031,Lynette,"drop it? do you hear that? she wants me to drop it. and when she cheated on you, and when she wrecked our family, i bet she wanted you to drop that, too."
9988,Lynette,why? are you worried they might get in?
12039,Lynette,"if i understood why you couldn't stay married to the only father, the only stable parent i'd ever known, yeah, i could've found a way to forgive you all sorts of things. we can talk about this later. let's go home."
12040,Lynette,listen to me. i would be honored if you would come and live with us. having you around these past few months was sort of--fun.
12042,Lynette,but where will you live?
9995,Lynette,"nina, i think i speak for everyone here when i say we are sick and tired of your abuse. frankly, you owe us an apology."
12043,Lynette,i'm sorry. you want this around?
12045,Lynette,sorry. can you say that again? i don't think i heard you right.
9998,Lynette,"all right. this is my last hand, then i gotta go."
10000,Lynette,"well, if one of you would just agree to raise my kids, i wouldn't need a job. any takers?"
10003,Lynette,"edie, how old were you when you lost your virginity?"
10006,Lynette,sure.
10007,Lynette,"tsk, tsk, tsk. having sex with the support staff. that's a big no-no. ed's been known to fire people for that sort of thing."
12055,Lynette,that's in the middle of skid row. you think i want my kids around a bunch of winos?
12056,Lynette,i am asking you as a friend. please?
10010,Lynette,"yeah. pretty sweet deal, don't you think?"
10013,Lynette,i kid the nina!
10016,Lynette,you fired stu?
12064,Lynette,what?
12065,Lynette,"no, toby's an animal, and my husband, a human being, will get very sick if he stays down here, so, please, put the cat upstairs."
10022,Lynette,oh course i noticed! you are one of my favorites and i thought it was really unfair how it all went down.
12071,Lynette,"karen, after all our years of friendship, how can you choose a cat over my husband?"
10025,Lynette,being intimate. and nina fired you to keep ed from finding out.
12074,Lynette,that is not true. i genuinely care about you.
12078,Lynette,"damn it! i'm not gonna let you die, so don't make me drag you!"
10031,Lynette,yeah.
12082,Lynette,"oh, my god! oh, my god! tom! help me! help me, tom!"
10039,Lynette,"oh, nina, come on."
10043,Lynette,our company insurance policy. you ever bother to read it?
10048,Lynette,"oh, hi. excuse me. hi. i'm lynette. you must be fran."
12096,Lynette,ida? i have trouble seeing her as the leadoff hitter for anything other than osteoporosis.
10050,Lynette,"i'm not suggesting that you sign her up for all day. maybe just a couple of hours in the afternoon. wouldn't that be great? have some time to yourself, relax, unwind?"
10051,Lynette,"oh, of course, of course, but we all have days when we're starting to lose it. wouldn't it be nice to have some place to take her before you want to strangle her?"
12099,Lynette,what do you mean?
12101,Lynette,"well, we'd do anything for your aunt. i hope you know what an amazing woman she was."
10059,Lynette,"i bet. make no mistake, i'm a good mother."
10061,Lynette,"kiss the kids good night and i'll see them in the morning. okay, yeah. i love you, too. bye-bye."
12109,Lynette,"fine. and for what it's worth, you passed bi*chy ten minutes ago."
12110,Lynette,wait! you'll never find it i'll get it for you.
12116,Lynette,"she played third base, right?"
12119,Lynette,"damn it, karen. i'm running out of ida."
10072,Lynette,"pat, can you see here i'm holding a baby hostage? i will call back!"
12120,Lynette,"okay, split up, and i'll meet you back at the car. go!"
12123,Lynette,then why don't i feel better?
12124,Lynette,"because it wasn't enough, not compared to what she did for me. she saved my kids. she's this amazing woman, and i never bothered to get to know her, so, yeah, i sprinkled her ashes, but it would have been nice to do something before she was ashes."
10079,Lynette,he played the tuba.i have pictures.
10080,Lynette,"so, uh, gaby--you know that thing you and tom did tonight?the-- the kiss?"
12129,Lynette,"no, we came here. we wanted to help you, to fix you lunch or clean your house. or offer up our own houses for you to clean, if that's your thing."
10085,Lynette,"no, no tension.what?"
10090,Lynette,"oh, cool. listen,i just wanted you to know i appreciated you backing me up last night,you know,with the kiss thing."
10095,Lynette,i am stunned.who was it with?
12143,Lynette,"but here's where you lost me--""god's love is as sure as the sunlight."""
10101,Lynette,"hey, i'm right by the supermarket.you want me to pick up anything?"
10102,Lynette,not at all.
12153,Lynette,"well, what if i need to? what if that's the kind of church i'm looking for?"
12158,Lynette,"i'm not presbyterian. i'm a free agent. and if you're open to a little q and a, you've got me."
12159,Lynette,"okay, what gives?"
10113,Lynette,i don't know.
12164,Lynette,"because i have had a rough few months. okay? but i know you've had rough times, too, and i always assumed that your faith had helped you get through them. i envied you that, to be honest."
12166,Lynette,"well, that's not a good answer. i have been through cancer and a tornado, and i don't know why i survived, and so many other people didn't. i don't understand, and i need to."
10119,Lynette,"good night, tom."
12167,Lynette,"why didn't you ask? oh, that's right. you don't like asking questions."
10121,Lynette,hey.um--i hope it's okay.carlos let me in.
12172,Lynette,well--there are some things that are easy to believe in.
12174,Lynette,"oh, well, i'm pretty comfortable with the catholics. they're the only ones who don't judge me for having so many kids."
12176,Lynette,"oh, my god. rick."
12178,Lynette,"hey, tom. look who's here--rick."
10134,Lynette,"yeah, i can imagine."
12183,Lynette,you were supposed to be home at 8:00 to help me wrangle the kids for bath time. it's--it's almost 11:00.
10136,Lynette,yeah?
12185,Lynette,"oh, yeah?"
10138,Lynette,why are you telling me this?
12186,Lynette,so you're really okay with this?
10144,Lynette,"that's okay.they don't trust you,either."
10147,Lynette,what's wrong? pat said you told her it was an emergency!
10149,Lynette,chicken pox?that's the emergency?
10151,Lynette,"well,you never told me that."
12199,Lynette,"hey, guys, would you go play in the back for a while? i need to talk to your dad. thanks."
10157,Lynette,i'll call the office.
10159,Lynette,"hi,carlos."
10161,Lynette,see ya later.
12213,Lynette,"the open bar is no longer your friend, huh?"
10171,Lynette,i'm assuming there was a crash.it could've been something else.
10173,Lynette,"okay,well,that's easy to say,but i need you to show me."
12227,Lynette,"well, for starters, mr. coletti opened his restaurant to get back at me because i wouldn't have an affair with him."
10182,Lynette,"oh,please."
10183,Lynette,staying home and taking care of the kids doesn't make you less of a man.that's crazy.
12233,Lynette,"sure, i do. it must've been some other random maniac with a grudge against rick who burned down his restaurant."
12238,Lynette,"hey, you guys know you're not supposed to be out of bed."
10192,Lynette,"come on, i'm sorry.i just really need to focus here."
12244,Lynette,you did what?
10198,Lynette,"yeah, and ed said we can finally afford to hire another executive."
12249,Lynette,no. we can handle this in house. we can make sure they never do anything like this again.
10202,Lynette,hi!
12250,Lynette,wait a second. those are your chores.
10210,Lynette,what about penny?
10212,Lynette,"oh, it's just--i'm--i'm not sure that you would find this job that satisfying."
10218,Lynette,i know! i know! i know.so who's up next?
12266,Lynette,"i am just saying, apple--tree. maybe not so far."
10220,Lynette,tom cavos?
10226,Lynette,"uh, just let your rsum speak for itself?"
12274,Lynette,"actually, i think we're okay. we--resolved our problems just sitting in your waiting room. boy, you're good. 'kay. so we're gonna go."
12275,Lynette,"and i wouldn't have done that unless i thought we had a serious problem, which we do."
12277,Lynette,you are.
10231,Lynette,"what, did you get recruited by another firm?did somebody cherry-pick ya?"
10237,Lynette,hey.
8195,Gabrielle,that's perfect. i'm trying to fit in an old dress. i need intense.
6147,Gabrielle,"well, now you know."
8197,Gabrielle,"oh, you're just afraid i'm gonna look better than you!"
6149,Gabrielle,"uh, feng shui."
8199,Gabrielle,"oh, no need. i'm up for anything. although i did just get a manicure, so nothing that might chip a nail."
8200,Gabrielle,"not tough enough? let me tell you something, mr. iraqi army guy."
8204,Gabrielle,"it's an exercise class. why would anyone say ""doughnut""?"
8209,Gabrielle,"yeah, yeah, yeah. time-out."
8210,Gabrielle,"look, i appreciate this whole military commando act, but i'm new at this, and frankly, this is a bit much."
8213,Gabrielle,i said time-out!
8215,Gabrielle,what?
6180,Gabrielle,"all right, well, let's just say something happened to postpone the divorce.i would still get my share of that two million, right?"
8234,Gabrielle,beat it. what?
4139,Gabrielle,"what kind of problems could she have had? she was healthy, had a great home, a nice family. her life was? -"
6190,Gabrielle,"anyway, what if i never find that passion with anybody else?"
4147,Gabrielle,is your finger ok?
6196,Gabrielle,"go, ida!"
8245,Gabrielle,"oh, honey, you heard maria the other night. your hard work is what's brought them so much closer."
4149,Gabrielle,"this table is hand carved. carlos had it imported from italy. it cost him $23,000."
4150,Gabrielle,absolutely.
6199,Gabrielle,"oh,thanks.i'm gonna go meet some new friends for dinner.but my zipper's stuck.can you help me?"
6200,Gabrielle,"huh. weird. well, you know what? i don't wanna be late, so i should, um, probably change."
4154,Gabrielle,turns out i wanted all the wrong things.
8254,Gabrielle,"oh, you're in counseling. that's great."
6211,Gabrielle,what?! why would you do that?
4170,Gabrielle,what's that?
8268,Gabrielle,"oh, yeah. uh, but i'm not enjoying it as much as i thought i would."
8269,Gabrielle,"so, brad, what sort of bonus are we looking at?"
4177,Gabrielle,damn it!? come on.
4178,Gabrielle,"come on, come on, hurry! let's go, let's go!"
8275,Gabrielle,shh. hi!
6229,Gabrielle,i said dead!
6233,Gabrielle,what? what are you gonna do?
4186,Gabrielle,we could always call the police.
8284,Gabrielle,nope. he is not to be believed.
4189,Gabrielle,"nope. no, no, no, no. you're not gonna buy your way outta this one."
8290,Gabrielle,"yes, he wants me to take maria shopping tomorrow."
6245,Gabrielle,he's cute.
6246,Gabrielle,"i had a career and a future,but i gave it all up for you,and what did i get in return?"
4199,Gabrielle,"oh yes, i heard that. uh, john, we need to talk about what happened the other day."
6247,Gabrielle,"sure, knock yourself out."
4202,Gabrielle,"well, uh, what time does your mom get back from soccer practice?"
6252,Gabrielle,"well, i fell in love, got married and moved to the suburbs for the whole fairy-tale happy ending thing. that was a crock."
6253,Gabrielle,"no. no, no, no, no, no, no."
8302,Gabrielle,and he has kidstwo adorable little kids.
8303,Gabrielle,"well, maybe i am tired of being that kind of selfish bitch."
4207,Gabrielle,"it's just beautiful. i, uh, i gotta go."
4208,Gabrielle,so now you're taking julie on your dinner date with mike?
4211,Gabrielle,attagirl. i'm just gonna take these upstairs.
8309,Gabrielle,i'm just trying to protect you here.
6261,Gabrielle,"look, marcella, i'm back. and we made such a great team before, and i think we can be again."
8311,Gabrielle,this is why people should never get their hair cut in a mall!
8312,Gabrielle,"jeez, bradley, you scared me!"
6262,Gabrielle,"well, i just wanna work."
6266,Gabrielle,i've got some wardrobe choices. i want to be buried in this dress!
6268,Gabrielle,"excuse me, durkin?"
6270,Gabrielle,"i do. aren't you a little worried that i'm gonna pull focus? i mean, it's a little confusing. people are gonna see tanya, and then they're gonna-- see that guy, and they're gonna wonder who i am."
8321,Gabrielle,i'm so sorry.
4226,Gabrielle,awww.
6273,Gabrielle,fine. i just need a moment to get into character.
6275,Gabrielle,"oh, i made it work. i'm hot mom."
6278,Gabrielle,do you know how many photographers would die to work with me again?
8331,Gabrielle,"well, what did he say?"
8332,Gabrielle,"that was my guess, too."
4235,Gabrielle,i don't know. hey! you!
8336,Gabrielle,"we've moved on to my daughter, the thief."
4240,Gabrielle,"hey, ash. i was at the mall, and i saw this. thought you might like it. she's hawaiian. her name is princess kahaluia. and, and i think it means little waterfall- or big pond-or something."
8339,Gabrielle,"susan, if you're not sure what she meant by it, why don't you just have a talk with her?"
4243,Gabrielle,"here you go. top of the line, free speed, aluminium frame, handlebar ribbons, and a bell. and you'll notice it's royal blue to match your pretty little eyes."
6291,Gabrielle,"fine. i'll do it, but i want this dress for free."
8342,Gabrielle,"oh, for god sakes. was it this--or was it this--"
4248,Gabrielle,oh honey. these heels don't have another block in them.
6297,Gabrielle,"hey, girls, let's talk beauty."
6301,Gabrielle,but where's your confidence? where's your pride?
8351,Gabrielle,well--
4255,Gabrielle,it's so weird to hear mary alice.
4257,Gabrielle,"that doesn't make any sense. i've seen her driver's licence, it does not say angela."
4258,Gabrielle,so what the hell do we do now?
6308,Gabrielle,"yeah, every day's a parade."
8359,Gabrielle,now i know why you wanted to hire her. she's a force of nature.
6312,Gabrielle,i know.i never did that.you would not believe the horrible things these girls did to stay skinny.
8361,Gabrielle,"well, she's obviously stopped counting calories since the last time you saw her."
6315,Gabrielle,"well, yeah. when's the last time you saw a fat person on a magazine cover? now i'm gonna go talk to vern about our next session. you guys finish lunch so we can get back to work."
8364,Gabrielle,except maybe at an airport.
8365,Gabrielle,"yeah, i thought that was something we had in common."
4268,Gabrielle,the cable guy fell. he hit his head on the tub. he may have a concussion.
4271,Gabrielle,that's a sock.
4275,Gabrielle,he's on his way over.
4278,Gabrielle,carlos found this under the bed.
8376,Gabrielle,great news! you got the job!
6328,Gabrielle,"come on, you guys. let's go!"
4284,Gabrielle,really?
6332,Gabrielle,"yeah, she's a trooper. let's dump her."
4286,Gabrielle,yeah.
6333,Gabrielle,"pageant consultants are judged on the strength of their roster. you know, we can't afford to bounce every nose-picking no-talent, but we can definitely lose the one who's dragging us down, and that's amy."
8385,Gabrielle,"oh, well, you know me."
4289,Gabrielle,no.
6337,Gabrielle,do not wimp out on me here. we gotta do what's best for the business.
6339,Gabrielle,"i'm always diplomatic. now just get in there, you spineless 'mo."""
4293,Gabrielle,"i'll tell you who wasn't giving mixed signals, was that sexy officer thompson.he was staring at you all night."
4294,Gabrielle,"honey, trust me. when they're not staring at me, i notice."
4296,Gabrielle,mama solis!
6346,Gabrielle,i've got the restaurant thing down. i can't bring myself to cook for one. not that i ever cooked for two.
8396,Gabrielle,i talked to carlos. you're in!
4301,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, whatever. it's rude."
8398,Gabrielle,but can't lucy cover it?
4304,Gabrielle,i may be a while. and i may get a facial.
8401,Gabrielle,all gone. now let's do this. it'll be like old times.
8402,Gabrielle,"yeah, we did, years ago. don't you remember?"
6354,Gabrielle,you always do the chips!
8406,Gabrielle,"i just can't get used to everyone working--first bree, then susan, now lynette. thank god for you. i just had to get out of that boring house."
4310,Gabrielle,"and for the record, i am not one of those women who has a hole in her heart that can only be filled by a baby. i like my life. a lot. it's very fulfilling."
4312,Gabrielle,now don't be mad.
8409,Gabrielle,okay. we'll start with something a little easier--bitching.
6360,Gabrielle,i'd love to grab a cup of coffee--or something.
6361,Gabrielle,"amy, you are so lucky to have such a nice dad."
8412,Gabrielle,"yeah. lately, carlos just doesn't want to do it."
8415,Gabrielle,huh. that's good to know. you're good at this girl talk thing.
6368,Gabrielle,"you're working so hard, sherri. you must really wanna win this pageant."
8418,Gabrielle,i couldn't sleep. i was a little hot. that's better. you look a little warm yourself.
6370,Gabrielle,"well, you know how the pageant starts with a big opening number? this year, all the contestants are gonna dance in pairs, and i've arranged for you to dance with your best friend amy!"
8420,Gabrielle,"i'm releasing the horny teen inside of you. now come on. two boobs, no waiting."
8422,Gabrielle,"now listen up, the pair of you. i haven't been sitting around in butt floss all night for my health. you're putting out. that's more like it!"
8423,Gabrielle,i forgot these were in the nightstand. this is gonna be fun.
4328,Gabrielle,"oh, mama, you're in a rut! we need to spice up your wardrobe. oooh, try this one on."
4335,Gabrielle,"yes, apparently they found a blouse in her bag-oh, i don't know, carlos. at some point older people just start to get confused. she probably thought she paid for it. no. no charges."
8433,Gabrielle,"oh, my god."
6385,Gabrielle,hello?
4341,Gabrielle,carlos said that his father left for a waitress in el passo.
8439,Gabrielle,"okay, my hour's up. someone else hold edie now."
6391,Gabrielle,i'm gonna hang up now.
8443,Gabrielle,yeah. edie britt shamed you into being a better human being. that is embarrassing.
6395,Gabrielle,really? i only counted half that.
6397,Gabrielle,look at you! who knew you were such a romantic?
8446,Gabrielle,this is gonna be fun. i can't believe we've never gone out on the town together.
4356,Gabrielle,"hi, john."
8455,Gabrielle,wow! you were right about this place.
6410,Gabrielle,"i--am fine. yes,i just remembered today's my mother's birthday. can we stop by the florist on the way to the shelter?"
6412,Gabrielle,yeah.
6413,Gabrielle,"really? uh, well,the flowers were so beautiful, i'd like to know who to thank."
6420,Gabrielle,"this is totally her fault. i mean, i simply asked her if carlos sent me the flowers, and she refused to show me the order slip."
8470,Gabrielle,what?
4378,Gabrielle,"well, if the mall is crowded, it might take over an hour."
8475,Gabrielle,isn't that weird? she knew she was gonna die young.
8477,Gabrielle,so are we ready for this?
6430,Gabrielle,"i hate that you know me so well, and it took so long for that to happen. now i have to start over again with somebody else."
8479,Gabrielle,she should be. she's been doing it since she rode shotgun on an actual stagecoach.
6434,Gabrielle,it would've been nice if someone else could've found you.there was a whole lot of drama around here.
6435,Gabrielle,"susan, please. we look stupid enough for suspecting him. just let it go."
6439,Gabrielle,oh. i had a great time. bye.
6440,Gabrielle,hi. you're sleeping at my place tonight.
8493,Gabrielle,"gee, this bit just gets funnier and funnier."
6445,Gabrielle,nothing. just having you here helps.
8495,Gabrielle,"i know i'm new here at the garden club, but what's with all the gardening? i thought this was just an excuse to get together for bitchin' and boozin'."
6446,Gabrielle,"because when he breaks in and starts hacking you up with his machete, your screams will wake me up, and then i'll be able to escape."
6448,Gabrielle,what?! you can't abandon me! there's a madman stalking me. my life is on the line. do you know how scared i am?
4402,Gabrielle,"oh, and i would so love to help you get there."
6449,Gabrielle,"hey, i'm scared, but not of the dress."
6451,Gabrielle,what? no!
8501,Gabrielle,"okay, so the lush gives us six. what about them?"
4407,Gabrielle,john--john--
6457,Gabrielle,"this is gabrielle. who the hell is this? yes, i got your token of esteem,' and i'm not impressed. because you're freaking me out, that's why! no, i don't care how much it cost. that's beside the point. really? that much?"
4411,Gabrielle,"john, please, what we had was so special. i think it deserves a proper goodbye."
8511,Gabrielle,"""oh, tom, what big arms you have""--that kind of talking?"
6464,Gabrielle,"but you have to promise to stop buying me these expensive gifts. because i'm not that kind of girl. well, for that many karats, yes, i could be that kind of girl. um, i gotta go. i'll talk to you tomorrow! oh, how about that? and here i was, thinking some guy wants to murder me in my sleep."
8513,Gabrielle,"hey, tom."
6466,Gabrielle,ooh-kay.
4421,Gabrielle,you can't go on like this. you have to take care of yourself.
6469,Gabrielle,so what does this diary look like?
8519,Gabrielle,i trump your mother. i am garden club president.
8520,Gabrielle,"look, i love you, tom, but you're my friend with a small ""f."" my friend with the big ""f"" is lynette. so if i see something that could hurt her, you bet your ass i'm gonna do something about it."
4423,Gabrielle,john!
8522,Gabrielle,"really? any favorites, tom?"
4424,Gabrielle,"um, no, i think i will stay here with mama."
4425,Gabrielle,come again?
4426,Gabrielle,i think i'll pass.
4430,Gabrielle,"oh, that's very sweet, danielle, thank you."
8529,Gabrielle,"if you have a shower at the office, how can you come home smelling so bad?"
8531,Gabrielle,"oh, phyllis got tanked on cosmos and threw up on edna--so now we're back to planting crap. look, i'm really sorry for sticking my nose into that whole patty rizzo thing."
4436,Gabrielle,"keep working! what were you thinking, showing up at the hospital?"
6484,Gabrielle,you've heard about my divorce.
4438,Gabrielle,why would you say that?
6485,Gabrielle,and let me guess--now you're my upgrade?
6490,Gabrielle,"for god sakes, zach! don't hijack a ferrari if you don't know how to drive!"
6496,Gabrielle,"yeah, about that--um, i'm installing an alarm system tomorrow, so i'm not gonna need you to look after me anymore."
4449,Gabrielle,"okay. you can stop condemning me with your eyes. right now. i know you know, about the affair. but you know nothing about my life. look, it's not even an issue anymore. john and i are finished."
4450,Gabrielle,"well, aren't you just a ball of fun. so, if i confess, it'll clean the slate, right?"
4452,Gabrielle,"well, let's say i don't die. i do yoga, i eat well. if i wait, does my repenting still count?"
8551,Gabrielle,"okay, see? your daddy's got a great idea."
4458,Gabrielle,my life. it hasn't turned out like i thought it would.
8555,Gabrielle,"i was in labor for 20 hours. she still owes me for that! fine. i will make the ultimate sacrifice, and i will be ugly for my daughter. but if she ever needs a kidney--"
6506,Gabrielle,"listen to me, you pimply psychopath. you and i are never going to party. in fact, the only reason we're ever gonna be in the same room again is if you strangle a cheerleader and i wind up on the jury!"
8560,Gabrielle,"oh, thank you. i'm not ill. i'm just not wearing any makeup."
4465,Gabrielle,"sure, no problem. there you go."
8563,Gabrielle,the newspaper? forget it.
6516,Gabrielle,"great. in order for this magical night to occur, you're gonna need to help mike delfino."
6518,Gabrielle,no?
8567,Gabrielle,"ladies! attention, please. i am in a jam, and i need lipstick and eyeliner. come on. chop chop."
6519,Gabrielle,a whole day?
4473,Gabrielle,oh! finally got the charity bug?
8571,Gabrielle,"oh, don't worry. i'm as healthy as a horse."
8572,Gabrielle,that's 'cause i don't have any makeup!
4475,Gabrielle,have a seat. you can start by helping us alphabetize the donation cards.
8574,Gabrielle,"you know, for a woman who has a purse full of dinner rolls, you sure have a lot of attitude."
4477,Gabrielle,is that because of me?
8579,Gabrielle,i tell you what. you can wear makeup the day you realize you don't really need it.
8580,Gabrielle,we're rich again! hallelujah!
4483,Gabrielle,"okay, yes, but you have to promise not to tell anybody."
6534,Gabrielle,"wait, zach. zach, i'm not mad!"
8585,Gabrielle,"you know, i should really get you tested."
4489,Gabrielle,"john, your timing is impeccable."
6537,Gabrielle,"i had a good time tonight, but i hated the way it ended."
8590,Gabrielle,"well, mommy shouldn't have said that. just, when aunt bree started bragging about her prada bag, mommy kind of lost it."
8592,Gabrielle,that vase is not stupid.
4496,Gabrielle,"you know, i think that's a great idea! okay, let's go!"
6545,Gabrielle,"no, zach, i only accept jewelry from men i plan on sleeping with."
6547,Gabrielle,"there will be no celebration. i'm turning thirty-one. i'm a single woman in her thirties. i now have to subscribe to ""cat fancy."" it's the law."
6548,Gabrielle,"it means something to me.being alone at this age, it's hard,and it's only gonna get harder.i'm so depressed."
8598,Gabrielle,so what are you doing here? are you volunteering?
6551,Gabrielle,"well, i think it's a regular. california kings are much longer. is your--wife particularly tall?"
8600,Gabrielle,haha--ew
4504,Gabrielle,helen! do you have a minute?
8602,Gabrielle,i'll explain it to him later.
8603,Gabrielle,thank you.
4506,Gabrielle,it wasn't susan. it was me.
4507,Gabrielle,i'm the one who was sleeping with your son. i'm so sorry.
6554,Gabrielle,it was a--shameless sex joke. i was flirting with you.
4513,Gabrielle,i'm going to bed.
6563,Gabrielle,"well, he seemed to like me in the mattress department, so here's hoping i like him the mattress department. what? friends say these things."
8612,Gabrielle,"oh, relax. i already ate dinner at home--in my box under the bridge. fran? oh, god. i was afraid i wouldn't find you here."
4516,Gabrielle,huh?
4517,Gabrielle,"carlos, wait!"
4519,Gabrielle,"yao lin, listen to me. it's very important that we find carlos' passport. i've already looked through his office, so i need you to search the bedroom."
6565,Gabrielle,"well, let's just say it's going to be served upstairs and involves whipped cream."
8617,Gabrielle,"well, then what the hell happened? this doesn't make sense. i was at your house. you had such lovely things."
8618,Gabrielle,mark died? i didn't know.
6571,Gabrielle,what?
8620,Gabrielle,"i don't agree, fran. you know, carlos went blind for five years. we went broke. we almost lost our house. but we worked our asses off and we made it back."
6572,Gabrielle,"but can't it wait till after dessert? and by dessert, i mean sex. you are clear on that, right?"
8624,Gabrielle,"honey, you're 6 now, so i think it's time we had a little mother/daughter talk. your father's side of the family's trash. any questions?"
4530,Gabrielle,"no, you don't understand. i have dug myself up from dirt to afford these things, and no one is going to take them away from me!"
4531,Gabrielle,"my china. i know how you've always loved it, and i thought you might want to borrow it for a while."
6579,Gabrielle,"i still got a lot of kick for an old broad, don't i?!"
8640,Gabrielle,"well, you know--we're still gonna be family tomorrow, so i think we should think about it overnight and search our hearts, and try to figure out which one of your homes is best for ana."
8641,Gabrielle,"we love you, aunt connie! yeah."
6595,Gabrielle,"uh, oh, yeah. um--he just came by to, uh--drop off a birthday card. really cute little cat with balloons. all right, bye."
6597,Gabrielle,"i mean, i think we did. that's what he told me."
6598,Gabrielle,"no, i don't remember anything! i just woke up, and he was in bed next to me."
6601,Gabrielle,"oh, you're--here."
4554,Gabrielle,ladies and gentlemen. i present to you the fabulous buick lacrosse.
8651,Gabrielle,"oh, i doubt it. you haven't seen her since she was 6."
8652,Gabrielle,brought you a laundry basket. you need me to show you how to use the washer? it's my clever way of saying you're gonna be doing your own laundry.
6603,Gabrielle,would you excuse me a second?
4560,Gabrielle,i guess i got too close to the turn table. i'm a sucker for these buicks.
6608,Gabrielle,"thank you! okay, look, there he goes. go! go get all cholo on his ass."
8659,Gabrielle,vera wang! where are you getting all these dresses?
8661,Gabrielle,"yeah, the economy has hit us all. so--what kind of boyfriends can afford things like this?"
4567,Gabrielle,"hi, honey! welcome home!"
8665,Gabrielle,ha. funny.
4569,Gabrielle,what's that?
8672,Gabrielle,did she?
6624,Gabrielle,really? i think it's been nice.
6628,Gabrielle,now you're hitting on me?
6629,Gabrielle,"well, good. i'm glad you like it, 'cause you're gonna pay to fix this."
4582,Gabrielle,"and who is going to be changing the diapers when you're pumping iron in a federal prison, huh? i like my lifestyle, and i don't want you to kill it."
6631,Gabrielle,opponent?
8680,Gabrielle,she turned me in.
6635,Gabrielle,"yeah. check, please."
8687,Gabrielle,so let me get this straight. you play tennis. you know wine. and you speak mandarin. does every other man in the world want you dead?
4591,Gabrielle,what?
8689,Gabrielle,"forgive me,father, for i have sinned."
8690,Gabrielle,"well, now, this i can work with."
4592,Gabrielle,"don't talk like that. everything is going to be fine. we're going to sort this mess out, and you're gonna be on top again."
8692,Gabrielle,"god, no!"
8693,Gabrielle,"ah, get the camera, get the camera!"
4593,Gabrielle,"okay, carlos -"
4597,Gabrielle,i'm gonna go get the mail.
4607,Gabrielle,"hi, um, i don't know if i have the right address. does john rowland live here?"
4608,Gabrielle,"uh, yeah, i'm, i'm sorry i haven't returned any of your calls."
4609,Gabrielle,"yeah, well, you know me, i'll survive."
6656,Gabrielle,no!
6659,Gabrielle,not much longer. this is our last date.
4616,Gabrielle,john caught me off guard. obviously i'm going to give back the ring.
6664,Gabrielle,"sweater, now."
4620,Gabrielle,"i guess. i understand if, uh, you hate me just a little."
6671,Gabrielle,"okay, ""a,"" i'm not your girlfriend, and ""b,"" she's not gonna find out unless you tell her. come on! a dress this gorgeous is meant to be seen. every day it hangs in the closet, an angel loses its wings."
6675,Gabrielle,i feel ten pounds lighter. thank you.
4628,Gabrielle,"i'm running out of money.in a couple of weeks, i will be screwed."
4632,Gabrielle,"no, mikki, you're wrong. i wasn't acting like a diva. i left the boat show because that coordinator was making passes at me. it's not my fault."
6681,Gabrielle,"wow, good eye."
6687,Gabrielle,"hey, victor. you're probably wondering why i've been in here so long. funny story. i ran into your ex-wife."
4640,Gabrielle,anything to get you back on your knees scrubbing where you belong.
6692,Gabrielle,guess so.
6695,Gabrielle,she threatened me with mace and then slugged you. now you're on her side?
4649,Gabrielle,i just met the woman today.
4650,Gabrielle,"oh no, no, no, wait, wait."
4651,Gabrielle,no!
6698,Gabrielle,"a guy who can admit he screwed up, one who's not trying to impress me every second of the day with how perfect and charming he is. i wouldn't mind seeing more of that guy."
6700,Gabrielle,"look who's back, mr. cocky."
4654,Gabrielle,"hello, yao lin. how are you?"
6703,Gabrielle,"not tonight, thanks."
4658,Gabrielle,"that's the difference between you and me, yao lin, our dreams. close your eyes, please. thank you. you see i dreamed of pulling myself up from nothing, and i did. i dreamed about the things i wanted and i got them all: a high powered career, a handsome husband, an extravagant house. so, this is just a blip in the radar for me, because now, i know what i'm capable of and if i did it once, i can do it again. i'm never really down, yao lin, even when it looks like i am. so, enjoy this moment, enjoy your dream, because for you, it doesn't get any better than this. there. don't you look beautiful."
6711,Gabrielle,i don't care! he can find two lousy minutes for me.
6712,Gabrielle,"sorry, no poker today. lynette had to work. want a margarita?"
4666,Gabrielle,what kind of favor?
4669,Gabrielle,"because my husband is home quite a lot these days. if any bush needs trimming, he takes care of it."
4673,Gabrielle,have you seen these? five more past due notices.
6721,Gabrielle,thank you. you can go now. i don't want to take any more time out of your busy schedule.
4676,Gabrielle,"no, it's not. we are seriously screwed, and i am freaking out that you're not freaking out."
6729,Gabrielle,shouldn't there be an emergency light? sometimes in these elevators there's a. . .
6730,Gabrielle,"well, aren't you clever?"
6731,Gabrielle,"no, wait! this is the first time i've had you to myself all night."
4685,Gabrielle,do you know how easy it would be for me to call my husband and tell him what you just tried to do?
4688,Gabrielle,"well, now we have something to talk about. you."
4689,Gabrielle,"yes, i'm gonna tell him how you're trying to blackmail me into sleeping with you. i wonder how he'll react."
6736,Gabrielle,"oh, my god, that's amazing! what are you doing?"
6738,Gabrielle,"oh, man, i was just starting to get into it."
6741,Gabrielle,they're just toaster waffles.
4694,Gabrielle,oh.
4696,Gabrielle,wow.
4697,Gabrielle,"yeah, but why me? you're a good looking kid. why don't you test drive someone your own age?"
4698,Gabrielle,"well, i guess that makes sense in a weird sort of way."
6746,Gabrielle,"well, if you can choke down that lousy waffle i made you, that'd be a start."
4700,Gabrielle,i should probably go.
4703,Gabrielle,"carlos, we can't afford to live here anymore."
4705,Gabrielle,"honey, i know. i love this place, too. it's just, i think it's time for us to face the music."
6753,Gabrielle,"i want all the negatives of those photos, or i start breaking fingers!"
4711,Gabrielle,how will you work?
4712,Gabrielle,what?
6761,Gabrielle,"look, i know this is my fault, so if you wanna bite my head off, go ahead."
4721,Gabrielle,hope he's more innocent than you are.
4730,Gabrielle,"yes. if you hadn't gotten yourself indicted, we would have pipes right now."
4734,Gabrielle,"carlos, i have to go."
6784,Gabrielle,"edie, are you okay?"
6785,Gabrielle,"oh, sweetie. don't worry. you're gonna find someone soon. i just know it. what?"
6789,Gabrielle,who?
4742,Gabrielle,i don't know. probably for the same reason you didn't tell me rex was one of maisy's clients.
4743,Gabrielle,"why? because it happened to you? bree, this is how i see it -- good friends support each other after they've been humiliated. great friends pretend nothing happened in the first place."
6791,Gabrielle,why should we be embarrassed? we're not the ones who kept a corpse-icle in the basement.
6792,Gabrielle,"uh, yeah. why else would she have hid the body?"
4750,Gabrielle,and that's - good?
4756,Gabrielle,"what? no, this is her daughter-in-law."
6806,Gabrielle,"i mean, we as in she betrayed me, and you're my best friends, so you're gonna support me because that's what friends do."
6808,Gabrielle,"really? because i wasn't very comfortable taking your side when you were feuding with patty monroe over the backyard fence line, but i did."
6812,Gabrielle,"hey, lynette, it's gaby. victor got pulled into some photo op at the homeless shelter. so i'm free for lunch.you wanna go with? i tried susan but she's not home, which is weird because her car's in the driveway and--so is yours. where is everybody?"
6813,Gabrielle,lynette! susan!
4766,Gabrielle,"hi, i'm gabrielle solis. you're nurse heissel?"
6814,Gabrielle,what are you two doing here?
4768,Gabrielle,"no, you see my husband and i still don't have a clear account as to how juanita passed."
6818,Gabrielle,"i am leaving this party right now, and if you two don't come with me, our friendship is over."
4771,Gabrielle,"uh huh. was anyone with her? an orderly, candy striper, anyone?"
4773,Gabrielle,"oh, you can just toss that!"
6823,Gabrielle,i'll tell you what's ridiculous. you not having the guts to tell me you were dating edie.
6824,Gabrielle,yeah. i had to find out from her at my damn engagement party.
4777,Gabrielle,what's going on? why are we slowing down?
6829,Gabrielle,"well, i wanna look fabulous tonight when victor's elected mayor."
4785,Gabrielle,am i? all i want is the same respect that you gave your dead mother.
4786,Gabrielle,at least she's gonna have a roof over her head.
4788,Gabrielle,why?
6837,Gabrielle,you can't talk to me like that!
6840,Gabrielle,"well, it is ending a lot better than it started."
6843,Gabrielle,keep talking.
6844,Gabrielle,you ready to be the mayor's wife?
6848,Gabrielle,really? 'cause i just did.
4808,Gabrielle,"no, sometimes you do."
4809,Gabrielle,"hi honey, i'm back."
6856,Gabrielle,"ow, you're hurting me!"
6857,Gabrielle,"you know what that sound is, fat boy? the sound of your career circling the bowl. yeah, you're gonna find out what happens when you screw with the first lady of fairview!"
4813,Gabrielle,because i couldn't trust you to make the right decision.
4816,Gabrielle,you had laotian convicts sewing casual wear for 2 cents an hour. don't you think you deserve a time out?
4821,Gabrielle,"hmm, so the post-nup changes the terms of the pre-nup so that-"
4822,Gabrielle,you don't trust me?
4825,Gabrielle,"oh, but i'm not. i have flaws."
6876,Gabrielle,really? same day?
4830,Gabrielle,"no, but i could. hey, isn't that why the prosecution didn't have a case against you? they couldn't find the profits you made. so if i were you, carlos, i wouldn't mention the words divorce, trust or post- nup ever again. you don't wanna piss me off."
6878,Gabrielle,"no, i really can't."
4834,Gabrielle,"oh honey, nobody's blaming you."
6882,Gabrielle,i am so throwing the bouquet to you!
4836,Gabrielle,i told you i'm not signing this.
4837,Gabrielle,then i'll go to the police.
4838,Gabrielle,"huh, you moved the money?"
6888,Gabrielle,"""yeah. listen, about that--"
4841,Gabrielle,are your roommates here?
4842,Gabrielle,yeah.
4843,Gabrielle,"that? uh, oh carlos just got a little rough, made me sign some papers."
6892,Gabrielle,"well, you can't have it. and if you ask me, i am doing you a really big favor."
4849,Gabrielle,i'm not signing this.
4858,Gabrielle,what am i supposed to do for money?
6906,Gabrielle,get married together!
6907,Gabrielle,"oh! no, stupid. i mean, a double wedding!"
4861,Gabrielle,i feel trapped.
4863,Gabrielle,"no no, keep going."
6911,Gabrielle,i hope i didn't wake you last night. i was at susan's till midnight.
4865,Gabrielle,dammit john! what is our new rule?
6919,Gabrielle,so what do you think?
4872,Gabrielle,i can't.
4873,Gabrielle,i'll pay it off.
6922,Gabrielle,that's your problem?
4875,Gabrielle,"what? oh, no. that's impossible. it's a new card, i just went shopping with it. try it again."
6925,Gabrielle,how about the bride?
4883,Gabrielle,uh??
4886,Gabrielle,"oh no, you shouldn't."
4887,Gabrielle,"hi, honey, look at my new shoes."
6939,Gabrielle,"god, it is ten after, and bree is never late! where can she be? all right, that's it. after i finish ""tszujing"" my hair, tell the preacher it's showtime. i can't believe my wedding's already ruined, and it hasn't even started."
6940,Gabrielle,is that bree? she better not have come empty-handed!
4894,Gabrielle,"yes, you are. because if you don't, i'm going to put on my new shoes and walk out that door."
6944,Gabrielle,why not?
4900,Gabrielle,it's-it's a sort of- a government sponsored sabbatical-
4902,Gabrielle,it is. its is. it's just the smell is a little intense.
4903,Gabrielle,"i am so sorry, it just hit me out of nowhere. it is so weird, smells have been making me nauseous lately."
6956,Gabrielle,"well, they're not gonna get us again. i made nice with fairview. i'm not about to suck up to the whole damn state."
6963,Gabrielle,"fairview is my home, and i don't want to leave it. and you can't make this decision without me. i'm gonna be your wife."
4916,Gabrielle,"no, it was-you just had to be there. but, my point is, that i'll be an awful mother. i'm selfish and i'm self-centred. and the only person more self-centred than me is carlos! i mean, he's so self-centred that he doesn't even know how self-centred i am! we'd be terrible parents!"
4917,Gabrielle,i want to know who to be angry at.
4918,Gabrielle,i don't have time for this crap. i have a party to plan.
6971,Gabrielle,why?
4926,Gabrielle,"no, i know, susan. i don't know what i'm going to do."
6974,Gabrielle,he did?
4933,Gabrielle,what?
4935,Gabrielle,"yeah, so?"
4936,Gabrielle,that bitch! i can't believe her!
4937,Gabrielle,"reaching out from the grave to screw with me. god, she's good."
6988,Gabrielle,i just got married.there are 200 people out there waiting for me to lead a conga line.
4942,Gabrielle,i wanna make sure you'll let me protect you.
4943,Gabrielle,"um, carlos? your parents? john, something like this could ruin your life. that's why you have to keep quiet about our affair. there's no point in this catastrophe taking both of us down."
4944,Gabrielle,forget about it.
4945,Gabrielle,"yeah, that would have been helpful."
6991,Gabrielle,nope.
6997,Gabrielle,"okay,that's all right.i'll just take a cab and meet you."
4950,Gabrielle,"no, nobody expects you to do the right thing."
7002,Gabrielle,i remember telling you i wasn't ready to sell the house yet.
4955,Gabrielle,because i was going to get in.
7003,Gabrielle,i still have a lot of stuff here.
7004,Gabrielle,"i'm just not in a rush to unload this house,okay?this was my home.i was very happy here."
4959,Gabrielle,i'm turning on some music.
4960,Gabrielle,"um, carlos is unavailable at the moment."
4961,Gabrielle,"john, what are you doing?"
4963,Gabrielle,what the hell are you????
7014,Gabrielle,you were not.
4967,Gabrielle,really? i've been finding it so bland.
4968,Gabrielle,"john! stop! shut the hell up! listen to me, you are never going to be the father of this baby. no matter what the paternity tests say, it is carlos' child."
7015,Gabrielle,"yeah,well,i--kind of thought about you,too."
7023,Gabrielle,"well,not unless we kill you."
4976,Gabrielle,excuse me?
4979,Gabrielle,so is susan coming?
7031,Gabrielle,what the hell's the matter with you?
4985,Gabrielle,"you see, your health insurance sent us a letter because someone ordered a year's worth of birth control pills, and apparently our policy doesn't cover drugs bought by the kilo."
4988,Gabrielle,away.
4989,Gabrielle,i know. that's why i only packed one bag.
7040,Gabrielle,or maybe a coffeepot or scented hangers or--a nice clock radio.
7048,Gabrielle,"oh, no cream for me, thanks."
5012,Gabrielle,"all right, there we go. so we're good? see you in court."
5013,Gabrielle,"oh, honey, if you can swing that one, more power to you."
7062,Gabrielle,"i'm not finished. those last weeks, every day we thought we were gonna lose him. and every day, before i would go into his room, my mom would say, ""no tears"". daddy wants to see you smiling. if you're gonna cry, you can't go in"". so--on the last night--i sat there and i watched him die. his eyes were closed, but i thought he could still see me. so i kept smiling--all night. i was 5."
5018,Gabrielle,"my point is that carlos is an angry, jealous neanderthal. but he's not a gay-basher."
7070,Gabrielle,don't answer it! it's susan. she's hosting another game night.
7077,Gabrielle,a bracelet's always nice. for edie's sister.
7080,Gabrielle,"yeah, you're lucky."
5034,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no. i don't need to take a test. i am just trying to reassure my husband of what i know is true in my heart. so if you could just slip me someone else's test results, i could make my own. i got photoshop for christmas. oh, come on. you look like a fun-loving girl. i am sure you've been in a couple hairy situations of your own."
7083,Gabrielle,she's got a ring!
7090,Gabrielle,i think i got a chill. now let me see if i can give you one.
5053,Gabrielle,why are all rich men jerks?
7105,Gabrielle,sorry.
7108,Gabrielle,what do you mean by that?
7109,Gabrielle,"oh, no, no. tell me. what's my reputation? am i smug and holier-than-thou? oh, no, wait. that's you."
5063,Gabrielle,he's actually willing to take a check?
7111,Gabrielle,"yeah, she asked about her father and then you smacked her. why'd you do that?"
5065,Gabrielle,"you're a strong guy. you went to college on an athletic scholarship, for god sakes!"
7112,Gabrielle,i guess you--saw what happened down there.
5067,Gabrielle,excuse me. i'm looking for rita rivara.
7114,Gabrielle,now or before tonight?
5070,Gabrielle,"oh, i see. well, uh, your boyfriend asked my husband to give this to you. it's a sort of favor. it's all there. seven thousand dollars."
7118,Gabrielle,see you thursday.
5072,Gabrielle,"um, hello! is there a problem?"
7121,Gabrielle,"and we can play games, like ""how big is mummy's tummy?"""
5075,Gabrielle,"uh, they're, they're nice."
7124,Gabrielle,what?
5080,Gabrielle,"honey, he's in jail. how far is he gonna go? maybe it's time you stood up for yourself. tell him you don't need the surgery."
5082,Gabrielle,"carlos, what happened?"
5085,Gabrielle,because it's for a boob job.
7134,Gabrielle,"yeah, if i didn't, he would think something is going on. what is your excuse for doing it with edie?"
5098,Gabrielle,how could you forget our anniversary? you sit in a cell all day long staring at a calendar.
5099,Gabrielle,"oh, we're not doing this again."
7152,Gabrielle,ooh.
5106,Gabrielle,"no, he really did."
7155,Gabrielle,ooh! they're coming.
5108,Gabrielle,"no, it's our anniversary. we're just reliving the good times."
5109,Gabrielle,uh-huh. brand-new. limited edition. a little anniversary present from my husband.
7166,Gabrielle,okay. so-- are you guys staying here?
5119,Gabrielle,"yeah, like five minutes ago! haven't you ever heard of a mourning period?"
7167,Gabrielle,that's right. you're a hotel heiress.
5121,Gabrielle,"no. oh, no, no. it's me. i am beyond stupid."
7169,Gabrielle,"uh, no. he's away at a conference, so i decided to treat myself to a spa weekend."
5132,Gabrielle,"okay, look, all we need is twenty minutes."
7182,Gabrielle,"well, i think you're paraphrasing. okay, seriously, you have to go."
5135,Gabrielle,"carlos, will you calm down?"
5136,Gabrielle,it wasn't a riot. it was more of a melee.
7186,Gabrielle,and i will see you later.
7189,Gabrielle,"yes, i had an affair. old news. move on. where's that room service?"
5142,Gabrielle,"oh, don't judge me! you're not in here because you got caught helping the poor."" ""see, we'd be enjoying this argument more if we had something to look forward to!"
7190,Gabrielle,you deserved it. all you cared about back then was work.
7191,Gabrielle,i shopped because i was bored and lonely--same reason i had an affair.
7194,Gabrielle,hey. what's going on?
7200,Gabrielle,this kiss has to last six months. you better make it good.
5154,Gabrielle,no. i like to keep a clear head when i'm telling people off. what makes you think you know anything about me or my husband?
7205,Gabrielle,"well, if he really wanted me to stay, he would've come here himself, instead of siccing daddy on me."
7206,Gabrielle,"oh, great. now i have to break up with him all over again."
7208,Gabrielle,"milton, there is no amount of money that is-- wow!"
7213,Gabrielle,"oh, uh, yeah, about that--what if we make it 13? okay, no, just go with me on this. what i'm about to propose will give us total financial freedom and-- help a conniving billionaire's dream come true."
5170,Gabrielle,are you hitting on me?
7218,Gabrielle,"how much is ""a little""?"
5174,Gabrielle,i wonder where david is. he should have been here by now.
7225,Gabrielle,"no, i'm serious. after everything i have been through? no! no, get out!"
7227,Gabrielle,"susan, hey, it's me. um, sorry to leave this message on your machine, but can you tell the other girls i'm, uh, going to be by myself for a while? i-- just--going through some stuff and need to think. um-- oh, god, that's my car ready to take me to the airport, so i'll tell you everything when i get back. okay? love you. bye."
5180,Gabrielle,we would love to come.
7228,Gabrielle,"this is nice. i didn't order a stretch, but i'll take it. victor."
5186,Gabrielle,"one more word out of you, lisa, and i will back hand you myself."
7234,Gabrielle,and i told you it's over.
7236,Gabrielle,"oh, that's great. yeah, well, i-i gotta go, bree."
5189,Gabrielle,no!
5191,Gabrielle,"yeah. i thought you'd schedule an appointment later. right now, i'm, i'm sort of disgusting and sweaty."
5192,Gabrielle,"i don't want a new lawyer. i want you. so does carlos, he just doesn't realize it yet."
7244,Gabrielle,"oh, my god!"
7253,Gabrielle,"well, if he's so mad at me, why would he take me on a boat trip?"
7254,Gabrielle,"oh, crap."
7255,Gabrielle,"oh, i-i was just talking to-- bree."
7256,Gabrielle,"no, i'm good."
5210,Gabrielle,"yes, you did, and i considered it for about a second."
5212,Gabrielle,what?
7261,Gabrielle,"well, it'd be easier to talk if we were back on shore. what are you doing?"
5217,Gabrielle,has she seen paul yet?
7267,Gabrielle,ice pick? what are you doing?
5225,Gabrielle,"well, i'm not gonna let you starve to death. besides, you're gonna need your strength to get my husband out of jail."
7276,Gabrielle,victor! victor!
7280,Gabrielle,"no one but you knows i was with victor. i'll say he went out alone. i told him i was leaving him, and he was depressed, suicidal even."
7281,Gabrielle,then maybe the boat needs to go back out--alone.
7285,Gabrielle,let them ask. no one knows we were on that boat. let's just play dumb and ride this thing out.
7286,Gabrielle,"yes, i feel awful, but he threatened our lives. it was self-defense."
7288,Gabrielle,"carlos, if victor had lived, he would've killed us. i'm thinking we already had our miracle."
5242,Gabrielle,"this, us, stolen moments, seeing each other whenever we can. carlos never needs to know."
5246,Gabrielle,making my point. you don't love me.
7295,Gabrielle,"well, that's weird. what--what do you think that means?"
5256,Gabrielle,because some of my model friends are coming down from new york on friday so i have to look better than ever. i can't have them thinking i moved to the suburbs and i shop at strip malls.
7306,Gabrielle,crap!
7308,Gabrielle,"oh, okay. so ask away."
5261,Gabrielle,i'm just not gonna eat for two days.
7310,Gabrielle,"oh. well, you tell edie britt, just because carlos dumped her doesn't mean she has to go around trashing my reputation, especially when she's the slut."
5263,Gabrielle,"i have to fit in this, so for god's sakes, put some muscle into it."
5266,Gabrielle,oh! thank god.
5269,Gabrielle,trust me. they're merciless.
7317,Gabrielle,"don't strain yourself, victor. there's plenty of time to talk later. what's important now is that you rest. just stay quiet and rest--quietly."
7324,Gabrielle,victor!
7326,Gabrielle,"uh, you want the fondue set back? fine. but don't act like it cost a bundle, 'cause it clearly didn't."
7331,Gabrielle,"look, we'll be back-- someday. we just have to wait till this all blows over."
5284,Gabrielle,i doubt that.
5285,Gabrielle,"all right, but hurry up, because i've been having to pee since hors d'oeuvres. are you free to go shopping tomorrow? i figured it's probably time i bought some clothes that actually fit."
5286,Gabrielle,i like the sound of that. thanks.
5287,Gabrielle,wait.
5290,Gabrielle,"i'm fine. thank you for the messages. i'm, i'm sorry i haven't had time to return calls."
7340,Gabrielle,"edie, what have you got there?! oh, crap!"
7344,Gabrielle,"give me the damn folder, edie!"
7346,Gabrielle,give me my money!
7351,Gabrielle,"no, you!"
7354,Gabrielle,move your ass!
7357,Gabrielle,"well, i thought just in case we-"
5310,Gabrielle,"no, it's not cool! who the hell are you?"
5312,Gabrielle,"inside what? you mean, you mean, in prison?"
5315,Gabrielle,okay?
7363,Gabrielle,is it? i'd forgotten.
5318,Gabrielle,"look, the guy who broke in stole ice cream. i don't think i'm in any danger. so you can go. i don't need you."
7367,Gabrielle,go? you can't kick me out of my husband's funeral.
7373,Gabrielle,"um, remember that day, uh--when al was going to drop off the account information?"
7374,Gabrielle,"no, no, no. he did. it's just--remember how windy it was that day?"
7375,Gabrielle,"i know, but edie was trying to steal the papers from me, and we got into this fight, and then the tornado just took them away."
7380,Gabrielle,"hi. um, i'm a friend of al's, and i was wondering if i could see him."
7381,Gabrielle,"oh, al."
5336,Gabrielle,"you're kidding, right?"
7384,Gabrielle,"that sucked, too. so what happened to al?"
5339,Gabrielle,"fine, if i do this, will you go?"
7387,Gabrielle,which is--
7390,Gabrielle,"why do people have to die?! why, god?! why? why? why? why? why?"
5347,Gabrielle,"uh, i don't know. i can't see him."
7406,Gabrielle,"absolutely. oh, but if i don't, i promise you, i will change religions."
5364,Gabrielle,what the hell did they do to you in that prison?
5365,Gabrielle,"how do you ease into, 'hi, i'm your illegitimate daughter'?"
5367,Gabrielle,you're up early.
7419,Gabrielle,what are you talking about?
5383,Gabrielle,share? what if you have the car and i need to go shopping?
7432,Gabrielle,"""uh-oh"" is right, you blind bastard!"
5390,Gabrielle,that's so sweet. i feel so close to you right now.
5393,Gabrielle,hi. carlos will be down in a little while. we had an intense talk. he's resting.
5397,Gabrielle,huh?
5398,Gabrielle,i know what you said. i'm wondering why you said it.
7447,Gabrielle,sorry i'm late. blind husband. you know the drill.
5402,Gabrielle,"yeah,that's him."
5403,Gabrielle,who's sister mary bernard?
5406,Gabrielle,"god, and he's our pharmacist. it's enough to turn you holistic."
5407,Gabrielle,"oh, i hope that little creep suffered."
7454,Gabrielle,"look at all these handicapped spots. i mean, what a waste. take that guy selling oranges, put him in a vest, stick him under an umbrella, and bam! you got valet parking. i don't know why poor people refuse to better themselves."
5412,Gabrielle,that's your excuse? we missed side-by-side water massages. i had to book them weeks in advance.
5413,Gabrielle,there are going to be people dying in this church if you don't wipe that patronizing look off your face!
5414,Gabrielle,"sister mary, will you excuse us, please?"
5418,Gabrielle,"carlos, where are you going? carlos!"
5421,Gabrielle,"well, bon voyage, father."
5422,Gabrielle,sister mary was going on the trip?
7473,Gabrielle,"thank you. sorry, babe. that took a little longer than i--carlos? carlos? carlos? carlos! carlos! oh, there you are."
5426,Gabrielle,huh?
5427,Gabrielle,what?
7475,Gabrielle,i don't believe this. i was worried sick about you!
5430,Gabrielle,"i may be a catholic, but i am so not above slapping a nun."
5438,Gabrielle,"baby, that's the fever talking. the doctor said you're having an allergic reaction, but you're gonna be fine, okay?"
7486,Gabrielle,"if it were anyone but you, it wouldn't be worth it. you ready to go to the party?"
7488,Gabrielle,how do you know that?
5443,Gabrielle,"no, no, not at all.as a matter of fact,all of my secret crushes were on the band geeks."
5448,Gabrielle,"oh, here,let me take that."
5449,Gabrielle,was that hysterical?the look on tom's face!
7498,Gabrielle,"really? well, for a dog who's supposed to help us, she sounds kind of limited. sorry, but it's true."
7500,Gabrielle,"no, it's crystal clear. carlos gets a new best friend, and i get to check the sofa for ticks. yay for gaby!"
7503,Gabrielle,"carlos, i said no--fine. one treat. that's it. those things are expensive, and until your disability kicks in, we have to tighten our belts."
7504,Gabrielle,"carlos, remember what my fingers look like? just picture the middle one all by itself. besides, you're the one who married me for my looks."
5457,Gabrielle,i'm not worked up.
7509,Gabrielle,"oh, so now i can't hit my own husband in my own house?"
7511,Gabrielle,"no. no, it's not. i read the pamphlet steve left. these dogs are not allowed on furniture."
7514,Gabrielle,"you're right, baby. i'm sorry. let me try it this way. you listen to me, you blind son of a bitch. if you don't get this mangy, 6- nippled, cujo wannabe off my satin sheets, you won't just need a dog to get around. you'll need a motorized wheelchair that you steer with your tongue."
5470,Gabrielle,i can't believe you.i have done nothing to deserve this kind of mistrust.
5471,Gabrielle,what does that mean?
5472,Gabrielle,i'll tell you.your wife doesn't trust me around you because i had an affair with my teenage gardener.
5473,Gabrielle,"oh.so i know susan mayer would never tell.it must've been helen rowland.she probably blabbed to all the girls at the salon.and ida greenberg goes to that salon.so if ida knows,the whole town knows.and we're just gonna have to move. that's all there is to it.carlos, can you stop putting for two seconds and show me some support?"
7518,Gabrielle,"oh, roxy, this way."
7519,Gabrielle,"hi. uh, i'm bringing roxy back."
7522,Gabrielle,"oh, well, actually, we found one."
5477,Gabrielle,i had my little indiscretion.so you go have you.get it out of your system.i know you want to.
5478,Gabrielle,sure you do.knock yourself out.call up an old college flame.rent a call girl.fly to africa and nail that little nun you've been drooling over.i don't care!
7525,Gabrielle,"well, you know how you like it when i read you the box scores? when i went out to get the paper - only thinking of making you happy-"
7526,Gabrielle,"she ran away. when i opened the door, she saw a squirrel, and she took off."
7528,Gabrielle,"how dare you. i have looked from one end of town to the other, and i'm telling you, she's nowhere to be found. but since you love her so much, i'm gonna keep looking."
7531,Gabrielle,"yeah, still no sign of roxy. but don't worry. i'm on the case."
5487,Gabrielle,"no.i kissed tom,and it was a harmless joke.i think if i had kissed anybody else's husband,they would've laughed and then forgot about it ten seconds later."
5488,Gabrielle,"see? i don't care.that's--just a waste of time--and spit.oh. okay.okay, okay, okay."
7536,Gabrielle,not that much. just his eyes.
7539,Gabrielle,"well, you know--anyhow, uh, you have a great credit score."
5495,Gabrielle,count me in.
5498,Gabrielle,why?
7550,Gabrielle,"hey, uh--oh, i'm sorry. i didn't know you were--entertaining. hi, i'm gaby solis."
5507,Gabrielle,it was supposed to be funny--a naughty little christmas gift for my boyfriend.
7557,Gabrielle,"there have been men coming out of her room at all hours of the night, and i saw her counting a wad of cash. so long story short, i need your help to get that hooker out of my house."
5510,Gabrielle,"not necessarily.see,here's what i'm thinking--scott's a coward,so you could totally put the scare into him.all you gotta do is go and rough him up,and he'll take my pictures off the web site like that."
5511,Gabrielle,"and i would love to,but i have the upper body strength of a kitten.i need a brute!"
7559,Gabrielle,"exactly. you people are theatrical, and i need someone i can count on to give a decent performance."
5514,Gabrielle,"good morning,honey."
5515,Gabrielle,"well,i thought about what you said--about the pictures--and you're right.it was my mistake and i have to live with it."
5516,Gabrielle,i'm living with it!
7564,Gabrielle,"must he put his hand on his hip like that? butch up, for god sakes!"
5519,Gabrielle,"then you better think of another way to get my pictures back.because if you don't,people on wisteria lane are gonna be seeing a lot more of me!ralph,luis,feast your eyes!"
5527,Gabrielle,be a good person.knock yourself out.
7579,Gabrielle,"me, too. it's impossible to argue with her in the house. she makes us laugh. she takes you off my hands every once in a while."
7580,Gabrielle,she's amazing. i don't know where she gets all her energy.
5533,Gabrielle,"babies, babies, babies.you sound llike a broken record.i just had a miscarriage.it's gonna take some time before i'm ready to get pregnant again."
7584,Gabrielle,you guys going for another walk?
5537,Gabrielle,okay.
5539,Gabrielle,"because i can't say that i'm gonna wake up tomorrow and suddenly wanna do something that i swore my entire life.i would never do. ""maybe"" is a very big step for me."
7589,Gabrielle,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! shouldn't we hear ellie's side of the story first?"
7590,Gabrielle,"okay, look, maybe i was wrong. maybe it was flour. maybe she's a pastry chef."
5543,Gabrielle,the only promise i am making you is that this is so not over.
7592,Gabrielle,"so that's when i saw all those bricks of cocaine under her bed. i mean, i-i mean, i think it was cocaine, and i think they're called bricks. i'm just a simple housewife. i don't know what i'm saying."
5546,Gabrielle,"yeah.look,i need you to do something for me.i need you to get rid of sister mary bernard."
7597,Gabrielle,i can. she went after carlos and mike and karl. the only person she hasn't gone after is tom.
5550,Gabrielle,yeah-- yep.they're having sex.carlos confessed everything--right before he asked for an annulment.
7600,Gabrielle,ellie? brunch is almost ready! this is gonna be so hard.
7601,Gabrielle,i'll try.
5556,Gabrielle,i heard you were being transferred so i came to say good-bye.
7604,Gabrielle,"carlos, i was a fashion model in the '90s. i know cocaine."
7615,Gabrielle,"well, we needed some privacy. see, roy and i are lovers."
7616,Gabrielle,"i know, it's crazy. you wouldn't believe the passion. i mean, i was powerless to resist."
5569,Gabrielle,"and i need to know i'm the woman you want to spend the rest of your life with,not just some uterus in high heels."
5570,Gabrielle,"no, carlos, i am sorry.i am not gonna be blackmailed into giving birth.you have to choose.and i wish you would do it so i can move on with my life."
7618,Gabrielle,that's for using your tongue.
7619,Gabrielle,hey! lunch is almost ready. i'm making your favorite. i take it you're still mad at me.
7622,Gabrielle,"of course i do. carlos solis is the love of my life. but sometimes you get bored, and a big, greasy, disgusting handyman really hits the spot."
5577,Gabrielle,"really? baby, can i talk to you for a second?"
7626,Gabrielle,"so sarcastic, but what would you expect from a ""lynette""? what? if your name was ""francesca"", you wouldn't have time for sarcasm. you'd be too busy having sex on a vespa."
5579,Gabrielle,"oh, this time.you are quickly becoming father crowley's go-to guy for charity cases."
7631,Gabrielle,"oh, you moron! there was no affair! that was the cop. ellie caught us putting the bug in her room. that was just an excuse we used as a cover."
5586,Gabrielle,i like a lot.
5588,Gabrielle,they put them in forced labor camps.isn't that awful?
5589,Gabrielle,you know what i mean?it's such a repressive regime.we forget how good we have it.
7637,Gabrielle,"oh, ellie, i'm so sorry. i had no idea."
7643,Gabrielle,"name one, and keep in mind that ""aloof"" and ""unfun"" have already been taken."
7649,Gabrielle,"oh! ellie, i don't know. what is it?"
5605,Gabrielle,i want to have a babywith you.
7653,Gabrielle,"over here, carlos."
7656,Gabrielle,"oh, carlos, we're never gonna have kids. shoes are my kids. let me be the mother i was meant to be."
5614,Gabrielle,"okay,mom,put these away!"
7668,Gabrielle,"well ,not as dangerous as poverty!"
5626,Gabrielle,"i have a migraine.i'm gonna go lay down upstairs.then when i get up,i hope we can all talk about this like rational human beings."
7676,Gabrielle,look at this mess! you are lucky i got in here before you touched my dresses!
7678,Gabrielle,"juanita, this dress is awfully tight. i don't think you can get into it."
7682,Gabrielle,"juanita, take off the dress! we're going."
7694,Gabrielle,juanita!
5648,Gabrielle,"oh,bree, she didn't trash you. honest."
7697,Gabrielle,you sure? running around in the sun and fresh air would make you feel good.
7698,Gabrielle,okay. why don't you go throw that in the trash? and i'm gonna get the car started.
7699,Gabrielle,"hey, juanita. you wanna play a new game on the way home? winner gets a new doll."
5652,Gabrielle,so how does this work?do we flip through a catalog or something?
5657,Gabrielle,so?
5658,Gabrielle,"yeah,but it's st. barts,and your hands are covering my naughty parts."
7705,Gabrielle,"carlos, our daughter sucked down half a sheet cake, and afterwards, no one could find the candles. wake up! we have got a problem!"
5666,Gabrielle,"well,as long as they don't make me play guitar,i think we're home free."
5667,Gabrielle,mm-hmm. yes.
5668,Gabrielle,"parker and,uh--porter,uh--and,uh--well,they're all p's.it is super cute."
7716,Gabrielle,"bottom line, i miss our life. i miss shopping. all i have to look forward to is the occasional invitation to a fancy party. and i can't even afford a dress to go to it. carlos, please, i am begging you."
7724,Gabrielle,"oh, don't be silly, carlos. we're still on everyone's list."
7726,Gabrielle,"bree! shouldn't you be in the kitchen? don't move, honey. the press is taking your photo."
7728,Gabrielle,"oh, they are fun. mm-hmm. but i enjoy my intimate lunches with michelle even more. we have intimate lunches. we're friends."
5683,Gabrielle,"okay, this isn't easy to say,so i'm just gonna say it,but have you taken a good look at her?"
5688,Gabrielle,"these can't be our only choices, mr. beale.i mean, come on.each girl is uglier than the next."
5690,Gabrielle,"if i wanted to catch flies,all i would have to do is call up one of these girls.trust me, the flies would follow."
7738,Gabrielle,that's mrs. downing. how am i gonna fix this?
7740,Gabrielle,poor blind bastard. i'll meet him outside.
5693,Gabrielle,"yeah, we'll do that.so, libby, who's the father?"
7747,Gabrielle,"oh, come on. it's already priced way below blue book, not to mention it's mint."
7748,Gabrielle,"okay, this car goes zero to 60 in 5 seconds. by the time someone says, ""wow, a ding,"" you're in the next county."
7749,Gabrielle,"what? no! no, no deal! the nondriving blind guy does not speak for me."
5704,Gabrielle,"no! no,you don't just toss people aside because of the color of their skin."
7752,Gabrielle,"okay, that one hurt."
7755,Gabrielle,"i don't know, andrew. i mean--we like it. we don't love it."
5713,Gabrielle,"well,here."
5714,Gabrielle,"honey,the one in the center is 3 karats."
7761,Gabrielle,$100.00
5717,Gabrielle,really?just like that?
5718,Gabrielle,i always hated math.
7768,Gabrielle,"okay, i-i can't drive around avoiding gravity and the sun."
5723,Gabrielle,"well,why wouldn't she?it's exactly what she asked for,the most expensive one in the store.you know,i'm telling you,carlos.i'm getting really tired of kissing her ass."
7772,Gabrielle,really?
7776,Gabrielle,are you suggesting that juanita is fat for her age?
5730,Gabrielle,"are we talking about the same idiot?i think for $8,000,he'd throw in a kidney."
7779,Gabrielle,"susan, i saw that! kids, get inside!"
7780,Gabrielle,really? 'cause it looked like you body-slammed my daughter.
7781,Gabrielle,"that's your defense? you were only assaulting her ""a little""?"
5734,Gabrielle,"there is nothing to work out.if frank is not on board with this,it's over."
7783,Gabrielle,i did.
5738,Gabrielle,"oh,bree could never have done that!"
7786,Gabrielle,come on in.
7791,Gabrielle,"for how hard life is. i mean, i have to admit, when you told me juanita was bullying m.j., my first thought was, thank god! let her do the pushing, just as long as she's not a victim."
5744,Gabrielle,"exactly. we're not ready!you know,this is a total inconvenience."
7793,Gabrielle,today doesn't count. today i was mad.
5746,Gabrielle,"oh,we missed it!"
5747,Gabrielle,"no,thanks.you guys look like you got it covered."
7795,Gabrielle,to susan mayer--good mom.
7797,Gabrielle,i want my 300 bucks.
7801,Gabrielle,"i am tired of being a victim, andrew. and trust me, that is no bluff."
5759,Gabrielle,"oh,for god's sakes.just take the baby."
7807,Gabrielle,"honey, she's only been here 20 minutes. we invited her over to play, so go play."
7808,Gabrielle,"honey, we want bethany to be our friend, so if she wants to spin, just suck it up and spin."
7810,Gabrielle,bethany's mom hosts a weekly playdate. i'm trying to get juanita an invitation.
7811,Gabrielle,"carlos, the only time you and i have to ourselves is late at night, but by that time, we're too exhausted. and now that we have celia in afternoon preschool, all we have to do is unload juanita, and then we can get back to doing the nasty."
7812,Gabrielle,"wake up! playdates were invented by mothers for this exact purpose. shopping, sex, drinking in the afternoon--playdates make all these things possible."
7813,Gabrielle,bethany's mom will take juanita once a week for two whole hours. that is sex and a nap.
5773,Gabrielle,"and that's what put her in an early grave!well,that and the hit-and-run thing."
7824,Gabrielle,"no! no, that wasn't real. sometimes i fake it when i wrestle with daddy."
5794,Gabrielle,"you know,it's been challenging,but i-i soldier on. so what about you?you look so rested."
7842,Gabrielle,"hey, beautiful!"
7848,Gabrielle,because she's the one who assures me that you won't get a baby brother or sister.
7851,Gabrielle,this isn't a miracle. this is a disaster. my husband's blind. neither one of us have jobs. my husband's blind.
5807,Gabrielle,huh?
5811,Gabrielle,"no, you listen!we were granted custody.if you want her,you talk to the judge."
5814,Gabrielle,let's talk turkey.what is it gonna take for you to give up the baby?
7864,Gabrielle,i got news for you. we just converted to judaism. problem solved. mazel tov!
5822,Gabrielle,"who's the pretty girl?oh, looks like it's daddy's turn."
7874,Gabrielle,"katherine, great dress. you're gonna turn some heads with that one. i hope you're enjoying this party, carlos, because you're not gonna live to see another one."
7875,Gabrielle,you know what's gonna tear me apart? another 10-pound baby shooting out my hoo-ha.
5829,Gabrielle,i don't want my money back.i want my baby!
7877,Gabrielle,"whoo-hoo! halle-damn-lujah, i got my period! oh, was she surprised?"
5832,Gabrielle,"no, we've been--we've been feeding her, and we--we've been bathing her,and we wake up in the middle of the night and we rock her--"
5833,Gabrielle,"--which is crazy,'cause if you knew me,i don't do that.i don't do that.and--and my husband--my husband, he sings to her. he sings,so you can't take her away.it's too late. we've already fallen in love with her!"
5836,Gabrielle,"oh,no,thanks,xiao-mei.the poor thing.she was so attached to lily."
5837,Gabrielle,the people from carlos' church.
7886,Gabrielle,"oh, that's carlos for you. mr. magic hands. he hits the ol' sweet spot every time."
5840,Gabrielle,"xiao-mei,i appreciate your grief,but,really,you're bringing everybody down.will you pull it together?"
7890,Gabrielle,"well, pip-pip and arrivederci!"
7891,Gabrielle,"well, uh, what's to discuss? for that kind of money, you can lock him in a cage and feed him peanuts."
5844,Gabrielle,"bree,you heard what she said.i can't let this poor kid go back to china and become someone's slave."
5846,Gabrielle,"uh,xiao-mei?we spoke to homeland security,and we have good news!"
5847,Gabrielle,mmm hmm.
7895,Gabrielle,"hey, clay. is mr. banks around?"
7899,Gabrielle,"they both did. you should have seen the woman, looking at carlos, gushing like crazy."
5852,Gabrielle,"okay,uh-- well--okay,it's like this--the three of us are making your famous szechuan dumplings,and i'm the dough,and carlos is the pork,and you're the oven."
5853,Gabrielle,"well,uh,maybe just a little light dusting.nothing major."
7905,Gabrielle,"hmm. well, when the time comes, an alibi would be nice."
5860,Gabrielle,"well,what kind of husband do you want?do you want a rich husband?well,then,rich men don't marry virgins for the same reasons they don't hire chauffeurs who can't drive--they value experience."
7909,Gabrielle,"i know about--the big ""o."""
5865,Gabrielle,oh. and were you planning on setting her straight?
7915,Gabrielle,"what the hell? you're never too young to see paris, right?"
5869,Gabrielle,susan?we've all been talking.we've decided you and julie should stay with bree.
7919,Gabrielle,why not?
5872,Gabrielle,excuse me. what?
7921,Gabrielle,"carlos, just nod your head, 'cause i ain't leaving this pool."
7923,Gabrielle,what? you heard the woman. she wants children's laughter. and i want the lobster the chef is serving for dinner. it's a win-win.
7925,Gabrielle,what is your problem?
5878,Gabrielle,oh!
7930,Gabrielle,you sure you don't want to shut your piehole?
7932,Gabrielle,some animated thing.
5885,Gabrielle,"you're not a model, carlos. maintenance is my only skill."
5896,Gabrielle,like hell she is.that is my egg.
7945,Gabrielle,"carlos, it's not worth it. she's really starting to freak me out."
7946,Gabrielle,"hey, i seem to remember some melted butter on your bib, too. now how we getting out of here?"
5899,Gabrielle,"carlos, stop with the dance.it's already in the wallpaper."
5904,Gabrielle,"honey, look. i bought us matching golf outfits for our lessons tomorrow."
5905,Gabrielle,i'm sorry?
5911,Gabrielle,okay.
7959,Gabrielle,"well, maybe that's because the last time we spoke, you called me a greedy bitch, and i called you a scary old hag."
5914,Gabrielle,"no, you don't understand.he's already dead.there was an accident.he's all over the highway."
7966,Gabrielle,virginia! why can't i stay mad at you?
5920,Gabrielle,hi there.
7970,Gabrielle,"no, uh, what i remember was you asking me to the movies tonight, and me saying i couldn't because i was going to watch carlos' band play. you got invitation out of that?"
7974,Gabrielle,"well, thanks, but the girls already have a school."
7977,Gabrielle,excuse me. you don't get to insist on anything when it comes to my daughters.
7978,Gabrielle,"you know something? i like money. i like it a lot. a couple years ago, you could've bought me with that big fortune of yours. but i'm a mom now, and i make the decisions for my kids. and that is something that cannot be bought."
5931,Gabrielle,"yeah, i know.it's just, she's been having pain-- down there.so if you could take a peek, it'd make me feel so much better."
7981,Gabrielle,"no, i haven't. why? is he supposed to be here?"
7985,Gabrielle,"eh, it was worth a shot."
7986,Gabrielle,"hi, sweetie. how's our patient?"
5940,Gabrielle,"well, good. i'm glad, because this can never happen again."
7992,Gabrielle,"i know. it's just--he's been through so much these past five years, and he's never complained. i just think he deserves to open his eyes to a wife who doesn't tuck her boobs into her pants."
5952,Gabrielle,"to have meaningless sex, carlos. not to sleep with the woman who's carrying our child!"
5954,Gabrielle,"forget the hotel, carlos.get a lease."
8004,Gabrielle,you got a lot of nerve. part of the reason i'm on this diet is because carrying you 2 brats for 18 months made mommy fat! and you with the head-- you ruined me! so this is how it's gonna go down. you're going to eat this with mommy and you're gonna like it. got it? thank you.
5960,Gabrielle,"you know, that's all i got."
8008,Gabrielle,"friday?! but you said it would be at least a month. i mean, that's so soon."
5963,Gabrielle,"oh, cut it out, xiao mei.the doctor didn't say anything about me rubbing your chubby stumps.rub'em yourself."
5968,Gabrielle,"what's the occasion?bree: oh, um, no occasion.just a little get together."
8016,Gabrielle,"no, no, you rest. you're gonna have surgery in a couple days."
8017,Gabrielle,"you know, carlos, i know you're really excited to see christmas decorations again, but--i just want you to be prepared because--well, some of those lights may have lost their luster."
5971,Gabrielle,"oh, generous.that means he's good in the sack."
8018,Gabrielle,"no, i'm talking about me. i may have lost my luster."
8020,Gabrielle,first time you saw me on the runway.
8026,Gabrielle,"carlos, that's the doctor. i'm right here."
8027,Gabrielle,"uh, doctor, we are very grateful, so don't take this the wrong way, but--"
5982,Gabrielle,"oh, don't give me that we are the world' crap!that woman's uterus is harboring a stolen baby!so if you know where she is you'd better start taking, or else i'm going to get the health department down her and get a closer look at what you're serving as moo sho pork!"
5984,Gabrielle,"i'm just dropping off carlos now and i'll be by to pick her up.okay, thanks edie. xiao mei's fine.crisis averted, no harm, no foul."
5985,Gabrielle,don't you dare give me that attitude.you have no idea what i've been going through this past six months.
8032,Gabrielle,"oh, don't look at me that way. i did what i had to do."
5988,Gabrielle,thank you.
5990,Gabrielle,"once that baby comes,i'm gonna be stuck raising a child alone."
5993,Gabrielle,"yeah, bree, i always thought of you as a person who wants time to plan."
5994,Gabrielle,susan! we don't know that! all we have is some crazy woman's accusation.
8053,Gabrielle,get your boss.
6008,Gabrielle,here.
8056,Gabrielle,it's beautiful. where'd it come from?
8060,Gabrielle,that's wonderful! oh!
6013,Gabrielle,i said it was a theory.
6014,Gabrielle,"hey, look at you."
8061,Gabrielle,wow! neat! why don't you guys go wash your hands for lunch?
8062,Gabrielle,"yeah, pretty. what? you're gonna be late for work."
8065,Gabrielle,"carlos, you don't just quit a job because of a few moles and a little back fat."
8066,Gabrielle,"yeah, it sure is. i'll get you the want ads."
8069,Gabrielle,"good, good. i don't know if you heard-carlos got his sight back."
8070,Gabrielle,i know. life is good. now all we have to do is find him a job.
6027,Gabrielle,"lynette scavo, i want to talk to you!"
8076,Gabrielle,aren't they? daddy bought them for mommy - he doesn't know it yet - because he has a wonderful new job. he doesn't that yet either.
8080,Gabrielle,who cares? bradley's offering perks. what kind of perks is this blind thing offering?
6033,Gabrielle,now look what you've done!
6035,Gabrielle,"give me those! get away, those are mine."
6036,Gabrielle,"not now, xiao-mei!"
6042,Gabrielle,you and tom will survive this.
6043,Gabrielle,"because some marriages were built to last. and some aren't. trust me, i know the difference."
8091,Gabrielle,hahaha--aw.
8105,Gabrielle,"uh, wait, you're moving?"
6062,Gabrielle,she's right here. did you say something?
6063,Gabrielle,i know.i wouldn't trade with you for anything.
6064,Gabrielle,thank you.
6065,Gabrielle,"what is this, freakin' noah's ark?!"
8111,Gabrielle,"hey, what did i say about that kind of language?"
8116,Gabrielle,"oh, yes, i will. my rage is fueling me in ways you can't imagine."
6071,Gabrielle,really? then why are you smiling?
8123,Gabrielle,"o-okay. i'm gonna put you on speaker, and i want you to rip 'em a new one."
6077,Gabrielle,oh! your fiance?
8126,Gabrielle,"okay, girls. pick up your toys and put 'em in the basket before dinner."
6083,Gabrielle,don't you mean her daddy will buy her a new one and just launder the money through you?
6086,Gabrielle,"well, i'm single now, and i thought we could maybe--"
8134,Gabrielle,"it's out of my hands, girls. word got out that you were disobeying, and they sent reggie over."
6088,Gabrielle,"well, that's what i thought, but trust me, marriage is hard."
6089,Gabrielle,"yeah, that can happen."
8140,Gabrielle,"well, i wouldn't have to if you would do it."
6094,Gabrielle,"so i should be punished? attention, shoppers, for the next minutes, free golf club with every purchase!"
8142,Gabrielle,i just wanted us to have a normal life.
6097,Gabrielle,oh?
6099,Gabrielle,wait! you can't stay here!
6100,Gabrielle,who is it? it is sharla banning?
8147,Gabrielle,don't leave me here. i'm going out of my mind. everyone is so boring and suburban. and how many freakin' honor students n that school have?
8149,Gabrielle,"you hear that, carlos? you've brought me to a place where people are named ""eli scruggs."""
6103,Gabrielle,"i wouldn't. women always say they wanna know if their husband's cheating, and they always resent the person who tells them."
6104,Gabrielle,no! but i would hire someone to beat the crap out of him.
6106,Gabrielle,"uh, would you excuse me?"
6107,Gabrielle,what are you doing? i told you i was having friends over!
6109,Gabrielle,don't act like you didn't deserve that.
8157,Gabrielle,"there are no good nightclubs, no theater. what do you do for a good time?"
8158,Gabrielle,"church. oh, you're serious."
6114,Gabrielle,that's probably because i had the locks changed.
6115,Gabrielle,can't be too safe. you never know when someone might move in on you when you're not looking.
8162,Gabrielle,really?
8168,Gabrielle,i brought muffins.
6123,Gabrielle,"that's too bad, because i don't love you."
8171,Gabrielle,"actually, why don't you let me pay for it? it can still be from all of us."
8176,Gabrielle,"watch out, ladies."
8177,Gabrielle,hey. you coming back in?
8178,Gabrielle,eli would've liked it.
6133,Gabrielle,"she promised to stand by him, and once you make that commitment you have to see it through."
6134,Gabrielle,i'm done talking.
8182,Gabrielle,"yikes. that's, like, a half a step away from selling your eggs on the internet."
8184,Gabrielle,"oh, my god! that's great! oh, why didn't you tell me this when you were begging for sex this morning? you would've closed that deal, too. we're rich again! hallelujah!"
8187,Gabrielle,"no, no. this'll be way more romantic. i'm one good colonic away from being the old me!"
8189,Gabrielle,that would be cheating. i'm gonna try to go pee again.
