2882,Bart,"but you can't kill krusty. he made you what you are. without him, you wouldn't even be called sideshow."

12816,Bart,that reminds me. i've gotta get over to milhouse's and... uh... play sports.
4072,Bart,"oh, you'll never make it, dad!"
12410,Bart,"but dad, you're giving in to mob mentality."
10328,Bart,"well when you meet them, tell them your game's too easy."
9971,Bart,are you willing to take that chance?
11080,Bart,tv's gotten so lousy.
10555,Bart,"man, homer, you've always been a loser."
6597,Bart,can i keep this?
7672,Bart,"now, to make sure homer and marge are in proper viewing position..."
13026,Bart,i had a speech ready... but my dog ate it!
4655,Bart,crap rock?
5209,Bart,you can't do that to duncan. it's not his fault that his owner was a sleaze.
6676,Bart,"dad, five minutes ago you hated him."
6582,Bart,ay carumba!
6501,Bart,"dad, do you plan to get in shape?"
12011,Bart,"they'd work much better without the padding, doc."
12118,Bart,"uh oh, he's right!"
4172,Bart,my joe isn't sloppy enough!
6254,Bart,this is great.
13063,Bart,oh my god! it's just like dad's!
7648,Bart,i'm afraid he has to spend another year searching for his brain.
10188,Bart,"i dunno. it's one of those mysteries, like how do my clothes get clean and put back in my drawers?"
5539,Bart,"mush, homer, mush!"
8894,Bart,i thought it was fifty.
11492,Bart,...send her home with aching tum!
513,Bart,"grampa, if you wanna go right..."
12768,Bart,truckasaurous!
12795,Bart,why?
6232,Bart,"well, i'm my own toughest critic, but i think it's genius. now to sell it for millions."
5344,Bart,wow. you're really asking for my help?
4544,Bart,"man, those are some funky-lookin' birds."
7511,Bart,my heart! it hurts so much! like it's caught in a vice!
13049,Bart,"hey homer, you wanna eat my shorts?"
4295,Bart,fine. take it.
12862,Bart,oh.
4363,Bart,"hey, everybody, vote for my dad, homer simpson. if you don't he'll beat us."
2906,Bart,"oh, yeah."
608,Bart,"hey homer, can we have a can of frosting for lunch?"
2414,Bart,"i don't think so. you're all the way in australia. hey, i think i hear a dingo eatin' your baby."
10041,Bart,"so, the family's still gone. what do i do now?"
8230,Bart,"why do i have to go to a stupid psychiatrist? i told a scary story, big deal."
2383,Bart,"dad, you can't just go around pretending to be krusty. it's sacrilege. he's a one and only. i mean, he invented the pie fight, the prat fall, and the seltzer bottle... as far as i know."
9466,Bart,what are you doing?
4145,Bart,"hey! get away from him, you little freaks!"
11005,Bart,but i'm so pretty.
3686,Bart,"yeah, he was a great dog."
6487,Bart,"hey dad, will you read me a bedtime story?"
10745,Bart,nineteen seventy-four! i won't be needing this.
6836,Bart,an elephant's butt?
10883,Bart,it's hopeless. i can't make up for ten years of goofing off in one day. i need two days!
13101,Bart,"hi, mrs. k. this is sure weird, huh?"
4060,Bart,"hey, highpockets! win somethin' for your girlfriend?"
7430,Bart,my sister has no sense of humor. i'm sure you understand. it's why you became a judge instead of finding a husband.
1622,Bart,a human going!
7535,Bart,"no fair, lisa didn't get sick."
2704,Bart,milhouse!
3982,Bart,how sweet it is!
935,Bart,"i did, but i couldn't understand what the hell he was saying. lisa, i feel terrible. i ratted on my best friend and he doesn't even know i did it."
2838,Bart,"dad, i know we don't do a lot together, but helping you gain 61 pounds is something i want to be a part of."
2652,Bart,"okay. think, bart. where have you seen roman numerals before? i know, ""rocky vee!"" that was the fifth one. so ""rocky five"" plus ""rocky two"" equals ""rocky seven: adrian's revenge!"""
4883,Bart,"oh, get with the times, man. it's jerry rude and the bathroom bunch."
1488,Bart,well... somebody just wrote a bawdy limerick on the men's room wall.
3632,Bart,wait a second. you don't have to leave just because superintendent chalmers told you to.
10381,Bart,let's steal back our book.
5505,Bart,"c'mon, lis. there's gotta be a way to lure that badger out."
5948,Bart,"hurry up, dad!"
1444,Bart,what's in it?
5384,Bart,check out the gut!
730,Bart,"""edna, every second until we meet stabs me like a thousand needles..."""
9784,Bart,are you taking me to the dentist?
10427,Bart,it's never too early to call shotgun!
11980,Bart,"right on, dad!"
11027,Bart,"lis, you saved us!"
13091,Bart,"jenda, i think we're ready to go all the way."
7596,Bart,"why did you guys have to take me away? you're always nagging me to go to church, and now that i am, it's the wrong one."
3449,Bart,i'll get right on it.
8321,Bart,who warned you?

7650,Bart,"skanks for nothing, lamerella."

12913,Bart,fine. now just get inside already.
3125,Bart,i never even heard about that.
7332,Bart,"hey, idiot. you're fat, and your mom's naked on the internet. you also smell."

5591,Bart,"dad, only one of them is real."
1780,Bart,"boy, show business is kinda cruel, isn't it?"
7626,Bart,"oh, glad to hear you say that -- because the person who doesn't believe in zombies is always the first to get feasted upon."
7703,Bart,"now, enjoy scenery. enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!"
12209,Bart,ah... about twenty three minutes and five seconds.
10789,Bart,did you give the money back to the people who lost it?

4751,Bart,stop what?
5951,Bart,the town keeps getting bigger. will there always be enough electricity?
4818,Bart,"rejoice, good people. goliath the terrible shall rule no more!"
12429,Bart,"true, sideshow bob, but that doesn't bother me. you see, my sisters and i have been doing a little investigating, and it looks to us like krusty was framed."
4463,Bart,remember when you almost became heavyweight champ?
9440,Bart,the krusty show sucks now. it's all pink and princessy. why are great things always ruined by women? the army... the fantastic four... think how awesome american idol would be with just simon and randy!
6121,Bart,aha! a free baseball.
7647,Bart,that's why he had to go away forever.
2438,Bart,rat boy? i resent that.

9011,Bart,"relax, mom. i'll mold them into a shape you know and love."
2417,Bart,"hey, guys, just so you don't hear any wild rumors... i'm being indicted for fraud in australia."
1810,Bart,"aw it's okay, there's no sugar in pixie sticks. trust me."

2549,Bart,"look mom, it feels really weird having you on my turf. how would you feel if i started moppin' the floor?"
6826,Bart,"finally, i can get what i've always wanted... a used toyota."

4028,Bart,but i can't go out dressed like this! what if someone sees me?
3008,Bart,"if you get one up his butt, it's a million points."
10351,Bart,how is that the lesson? the point of the dinosaurs is: no matter what we do an asteroid's gonna wipe us out. so we should party hard and wreck the place.
1462,Bart,maybe you better take that temperature one more time.
2730,Bart,watch itchy and scratchy!
8822,Bart,nope... nope... nope...
7956,Bart,"c'mon, doc -- she's a fine-lookin' woman! you don't wanna work that?"

6862,Bart,how do you know all this stuff?
4315,Bart,"silence, octopussy."
10982,Bart,you sure you're not just doing all this because it's cool to be accepting of a gay family member?
3201,Bart,"you coward! you're an embarrassment to the name ""hellfish!"""
9772,Bart,"a little's not gonna be enough, honey pie."

5257,Bart,"you're right, i'm sorry. tell you what: saturday night we'll go out for steaks, just you and me."
10017,Bart,"dad, i was thinking about it and... you're right. you shouldn't buy me something i didn't earn. and because you gave me the tough love i didn't know i needed, i'm gonna be spending lots and lots more time with you."

6724,Bart,hey! some jerks cleaned our field!
1675,Bart,"the guys who wrote this show don't know squat. itchy should have tied scratchy's tongue with a taut-line hitch, not a sheet-bend."
781,Bart,you've got yourself a narc.
11715,Bart,i thought we were just going to ask if he had seen homer.
11185,Bart,because then i'd be the one thing i swore i wouldn't: you.

4947,Bart,i have to take these stupid pills twice a day.
11422,Bart,"he's been playing dancing revolution for hours, but the tv is off."
5455,Bart,"okay, maybe not."
6853,Bart,okay.
12916,Bart,have i ever. just the thought of doing anything bad again makes my stomach turn.
4603,Bart,"we've been looking all over for you, dad. where did you land?"
3014,Bart,let's go to the sharper image. they've got a tv shaped like a fifties diner!
2398,Bart,i can't get a straight answer out of this crazy hemisphere!
9410,Bart,"hey, the only thing i bring home are notes to my parents, and those do not arrive the way that they left."
8033,Bart,"no, i'm gonna go backstage and complain. this krusty brand alarm clock sprays acid in your face."
2307,Bart,i'unno.
1261,Bart,"but now, i want to follow in your footsteps."
6845,Bart,"screw that. when i grow up, i'm legally changing my name to joe kickass."
6105,Bart,i knew it. you're there. just hear me out.
5282,Bart,"ew, that's me in the future?"
3649,Bart,"a quarter?! well, you're just the dog that keeps on giving, aren'cha?"

4317,Bart,"the shirts continued their domination over the skins today. and in schoolyard fights...the highly anticipated match between kearney and mr. largo ended in a disqualification, for use of dog doo on a stick. lisa?"
12452,Bart,not if i can help it.
11115,Bart,are you gonna walk upstairs and ask her?
9912,Bart,"well, who needs wrapping paper anyway? just stick a bow on the toy and you're ready to go."
3235,Bart,your daughter is named seymour?
10479,Bart,okay. that was the last school myth and it's officially... cracked.
250,Bart,"no, mom, you said poor house."
726,Bart,"strap on your skates gordie, you're going in."
2831,Bart,no.
4752,Bart,"hey, that's what i do in my room, 'lis. i squeak my chair."

11229,Bart,"mom, is that true?"
9587,Bart,really? did that ever work for you?
4575,Bart,"nah, it's too early. i need to work under cover of darkness."
10571,Bart,"i'm actually in fourth grade, but i read at a second grade level. they think i might have a ""problem."""
10123,Bart,"no! stop! no ""star wars"" parodies!"
6342,Bart,"woo! yay, homer!"
9512,Bart,"so, what are you lookin' for?"
5423,Bart,quick. up here.

11123,Bart,grampa says he was a commie.
7553,Bart,"mom, am i a ""butch"" or a ""fem""?"
6718,Bart,how come i'm not doing this stuff with milhouse?
4296,Bart,"then can i get a tattoo that says, ""bite me?"" you never know when it might come in handy."
2280,Bart,"you go, mom. for the greater good."
11989,Bart,"hear that, dad? you can lie around in your underwear and scratch yourself."
511,Bart,"hey, how come lisa gets a pony?"
1341,Bart,i'm prepared to make that sacrifice.
6349,Bart,how about the clock channel?
7273,Bart,thanks for cushioning my fall.
6769,Bart,all right. it says here we can learn watch repair in eight one-hour lessons.
9165,Bart,"dad, what are you doing here?"

10606,Bart,"mom, dad, do you know there's a boat out there where nothing sucks? it's called royalty cruises and royalty cruise specialists are standing by now!"
10652,Bart,nelson took my lunch money again!
6222,Bart,"dad, i thought you didn't like her saxophone."
11622,Bart,i smash fluorescent lights at the gravel pit.

12571,Bart,"thanks, dad. but part of this d minus belongs to god."

2312,Bart,"so, finally, we're all in agreement about what's going on with the adults. milhouse?"
981,Bart,"don't look in my closet. in fact, stay out of my room all together."
3167,Bart,"lisa? this isn't working. i've got to courier something to springfield. and it's gotta be big enough to fit milhouse, martin, and nelson inside."
2494,Bart,"me and santa's little helper used to be a team, but he never wants to play anymore since his bitch moved in!"

10776,Bart,"gentleman doesn't ask, lady doesn't tell. now all i need is one for martin luther king day."
5567,Bart,"so when i took the test, the answers were stuck in my brain. it was like a whole different kind of cheating."

11850,Bart,i got a bad feeling about this.
7958,Bart,"dad, because you and mom screwed up buck mitchell's marriage, some kids beat me up at school today."
9042,Bart,i can't believe we have to start another year of school. i never learned anything at that suck shack.
3101,Bart,"so, you don't work on a contingency basis?"
1304,Bart,i'm tom. let's ride.
9932,Bart,aunt selma's leg!
4788,Bart,"man, captivity blows."
770,Bart,"thank you, ma'am. you've been most cooperative."
4955,Bart,"well, this has been terrific. let's do it again sometime."
12731,Bart,"all right. twelve big ones and free grub to boot. viva skid row. hey, it's that anchor dude from channel six."
773,Bart,really?
6618,Bart,"i'm telling! oh, man."
11747,Bart,"oops, my homework!"
8775,Bart,"lisa, your movie exposed our crappy side to the world. i knew you were lame, but i never imagined you were bogus."
8512,Bart,"lame, lame, lame, lame, have it, lame, superman dies, aquaman dies, casper dies, caveman robin, black robin, born-again robin..."
5051,Bart,and then i learned the true meaning of winter.
235,Bart,"dad, maybe you should do this."
11742,Bart,then can we get pizza on the way home?
3422,Bart,"12:80. no, wait. wait. wh-- what comes after twelve?"
144,Bart,ow!. . .ow!
8689,Bart,"oh, right. dad was colonel homer and he wore that awesome suit and lurleen wanted to bunk his brains out! but i forget how mom felt about it..."
4038,Bart,out of my way! i'm hitler!
601,Bart,were you like this when mom was pregnant with me?
7099,Bart,wait... do you even have a family?
8393,Bart,"let's get this show on the road, man. we got things to do."
7250,Bart,"oh mom, this guest list sucks."
9141,Bart,"milhouse, real best friends often don't speak for years at a time. like john adams and thomas jefferson."
6661,Bart,"hey beavers! remember me, you buck-toothed nerds?"
5077,Bart,"i'll show you who's scared. oh, wow, this really hides my thighs."
12476,Bart,it's about these pirates. pirates with patches over their eyes... and shiny gold teeth... and green birds on their shoulders...
10341,Bart,"aw, come on, dad, be a foodie! you're already a fatty and a drunkie!"
1399,Bart,"dad, i'm so sorry. i know i haven't been a perfect kid..."
11918,Bart,"hey, guys! great to see ya."
1344,Bart,"watch this, lis. you can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half."
6754,Bart,"wow, she looks like a background character in a hanna barbera cartoon!"
5417,Bart,what'd we do?
5584,Bart,"man, magic can do anything!"
5904,Bart,"hey, a fortune teller."
5670,Bart,"cool, japanimation."
1608,Bart,he said what now?
1333,Bart,"cool, i broke his brain."
3943,Bart,wuh?
1545,Bart,college? barber or clown?
2967,Bart,nothing.
1051,Bart,and?
8108,Bart,'cause my chest is cold and my arms aren't.
12033,Bart,"all right, all right. look. i'm sorry. i-i got upset. in the heat of the moment, i said some things i didn't mean."
8181,Bart,any of you ladies like stereo music?
1322,Bart,i was faking it.
3537,Bart,you made all that money for sitting around and watching tv and eating food?
8765,Bart,"you're in a better place now, lou. i'll always be proud for once in my life... i had a cow, man."
9465,Bart,homer?
11247,Bart,"i know a kid should never turn to his father for help, but i got screwed. is there anything you can do?"
6524,Bart,you spent all the money i earned?!
6620,Bart,the only way to be cooler than him is to do exactly what he does. i've gotta steal me a hood ornament! but how?
1559,Bart,"dad, the longer he has to wait, the more he'll pay."
7995,Bart,the doctor did say surgery might help... but it costs seventy-eight thousand dollars!
3054,Bart,"well, if you're not krusty, how come you have the exact same signature as him?"
10607,Bart,"okay... maybe i can pay for the cruise. let's see how much it costs for a cabin on a low deck, no porthole, group z lifeboat access... it's still a ton of money."
274,Bart,"that's right! hope you like your present. and a-one, and a-two, and a one, two, three, four --"
5046,Bart,"she's right, dad. they can afford a lot more."
7364,Bart,"dad, you completely sold me out!"
12844,Bart,i am in constant pain.
4045,Bart,cops took it.
11614,Bart,yi-yo-yu!
118,Bart,"aw, mom, i couldn't ask you to do that. you're already taking care of maggie, and lisa is such a handful --"
303,Bart,cool! a ruckus!
10353,Bart,"no fair, then i get four small toys and lisa gets one medium and one small."
11859,Bart,"sorry, dad."
10127,Bart,sure do. i'm just bad at counting. two to the right...
782,Bart,"hey, jimbo, keepin' your nose clean, dude? attaboy! hey, donna, who loves ya, baby?"
3021,Bart,"i'm sorry, mom. i'll behave."
6693,Bart,we touched hands and then we had to wash the cooties off.
845,Bart,"hey, they chose maggie, okay?"
3427,Bart,"did you hear that, lis? dad's gonna be just fine."
10047,Bart,my stupid cartoon a movie? thank you!
4016,Bart,"yeah, their guns are right there!"
13086,Bart,"speakin' of cracks, pull up your pants, dude."
11517,Bart,big deal. i don't like girls either.
3838,Bart,i said gimme!
4816,Bart,"great news, everyone. goliath is dead! although i haven't seen his body, the blast that failed to kill me, surely killed the giant. anyhoo, now that i'm your king again..."
408,Bart,one... two... three... community chest.
2829,Bart,'fraid so.
5008,Bart,it's xena! she's been kidnapped! come on!
12329,Bart,jam a dagger in your thigh?
5959,Bart,would you mind? i'm trying to do my homework.
5351,Bart,i guess i am an embarrassment.
5571,Bart,rusty the clown?! springfield gets the lamest balloons.
9162,Bart,"and, cue snow."
7192,Bart,"thank you. and let me say i missed your sweet, sweet voices."
13078,Bart,"yo, homer! can you take me to when you were ten to see if i can kick your butt?"
8576,Bart,"oh, i ""capeesh."" i ""capeesh"" just fine."
2501,Bart,"hey, jerkface! you have the face of a jerk!"
2379,Bart,cool!
12858,Bart,they say this cat shaft is a bad mother...
1403,Bart,"and no matter what happens, i'll never forget the advice you gave me."
2980,Bart,"... ah, my punishment?"
2356,Bart,why don't they look anything like their names?
5286,Bart,"dude, you know i'm good for it. i'll have plenty of money when my lawsuit pays off."
6999,Bart,i know a guy who did.
2513,Bart,"no, it's dogs. i'll prove it."
10806,Bart,"dad, look, i'm walking on the wall around the lion pit!"
9342,Bart,"oh my god, i want a brother!"
4203,Bart,"yes, sir."
4532,Bart,"hey, fellas, good news. i found an extra 75-watt bulb lyin' around."
12970,Bart,"see boy, it's not so hard. here, roll over... roll over... like this."
12057,Bart,"hi, mom. hi, dad."
13051,Bart,s'allright.
2036,Bart,go!
7245,Bart,there's my hundred -- where's my party?
9324,Bart,"ladies and gentlemen, i am a big dummy with a stupid job. i write down what other people say just like a big dummy would. could the court reporter read that back?"
8520,Bart,you want to know what i think?
10642,Bart,"it was all a hoax, there's no virus."
488,Bart,"less talk, more sleep."
5531,Bart,"ooo, baby."
10794,Bart,lisa eats bu-ugs...
12391,Bart,"so, basically, i met one nice french person."
3563,Bart,you're the boss.
499,Bart,"good night, dad. you know, these last few days have been really swell. i wish there was something i could do to repay you."
2696,Bart,"i've got to grow an inch by tomorrow or i won't get that part. pull, you mighty stallions, pull. show me no mercy."
1487,Bart,"well, it's... ah, you wouldn't be interested. it's too low brow."
3647,Bart,my name is... santa's little helper.
3872,Bart,i'd be stupid not to do this.
5972,Bart,"your honor, it's not easy being my parents. i'm always screwing up in school, and getting in trouble with the law. but if i grow up to be a halfway decent person, i know it'll be because of my mom and dad."
5325,Bart,"relax, lis. you'll live longer."
11208,Bart,did the goodnight pixie just kiss my cheek?
10633,Bart,now to make sure no one can call home to check... with a little help from the make-your-own-sundae bar.
12927,Bart,is not.
10419,Bart,can't we just send out a picture of the pets dressed like reindeer?
6467,Bart,"so because i nominated mrs. k, our whole family gets a free trip to the award ceremony in orlando!"
12758,Bart,why should i?
9259,Bart,but it's stale.
850,Bart,"sideshow bob, i'm afraid the only victims here are the good people at best western hotels."
3291,Bart,um... uh...
10176,Bart,"well, this is yours."
11035,Bart,"the only thing bigger than you, is you tomorrow."
1101,Bart,"dad, you gotta let me see that movie. can't you just give me a spanking?"
1468,Bart,mr. hutz when i grow up i want to be a lawyer just like you.
7959,Bart,"oh, papa."
6959,Bart,"wander away from the group? man, you've been huffin' from the bart bag."

12616,Bart,"okay, okay."
9313,Bart,"okay, buddy. lower the eyebrows. nice and easy."
6358,Bart,"i know. that's how you remember the four original provinces of canada: quebec, new brunswick, ontario, nova scotia -- ""quiet nerds burp only near school."" and here's how you remember the principal exports: ""dogs eat barf solely on wednesday, mabel."""
8225,Bart,they hanged him for murder and buried him in an unmarked grave. when they came back the next day... the whole cemetery was missing.

1633,Bart,"lis, everyone in town is acting like me, so why does it suck?"
4576,Bart,there's gotta be some batteries in here somewhere.
1021,Bart,"ooop, i got him."

12098,Bart,i won't have cowards in my army.
3072,Bart,"lisa, if i ever stop loving violence, i want you to shoot me."
10978,Bart,that's all you pay for screwing up a child for life?
12659,Bart,"give up, homeboy. there's a six-stroke limit."
11213,Bart,"first we reel them in, then we scare the hell out of them."
11109,Bart,is it too late to make you breakfast in bed?
3188,Bart,"great story, grampa. coulda used a vampire, though. 'night."
5565,Bart,"mercury, venus, earth, mars..."

1543,Bart,"i knew i had to buy some time. so, i asked him to sing the score from ""the hms pinafore."""
444,Bart,"oh great, we came all this way and it's the wrong guy."
1026,Bart,was it scary?
10754,Bart,"ma'am, whatever you do, do not marry that ape."
6953,Bart,oh c'mon. can't we at least have one pity scalp?
11064,Bart,i was supposed to be in charge of you. i can't let mom and dad know what i did. but i promise i'll take good care of you until you're well again.
8501,Bart,"oh man, now he's even more popular!"
2015,Bart,"friends and well-wishers, yes."
12025,Bart,"teacher's pet, apple polisher, butt kisser..."
1351,Bart,"unhand me, yankee."
6699,Bart,"hey, there's nothing wrong with that. i just wonder how they keep it so fresh after forty-three episodes."
6411,Bart,it's simple. we just have to cause a riot at the springfield shoe expo.
10460,Bart,"what's for dinner, ma?"
10967,Bart,"now, did you get kirk's license?"
10805,Bart,"dad, over here!"
10156,Bart,you're a truffle.
10523,Bart,"man, you're the talkiest bullies i ever met."
1062,Bart,"let's see what we've got... ""how to get your skeletons their whitest""... ""selling your soul in a buyer's market""... ah, here we are, ""how to raise the dead."""
11836,Bart,"yeah, homer."
2432,Bart,hey! we can get away in their pouches!
8506,Bart,from milhouse! i love him so much!

11302,Bart,da-ad! lisa's my little sister!
10534,Bart,"c'mon, dad. you made me mad so i got back at you. how was i to know parents had feelings?"
5472,Bart,"the script originally called for me to jump the gorge. but i'd been up all night paying people to kiss, so dad volunteered to do the stunt."
2448,Bart,i don't want to be the next anything. i'm only taking this stupid class because they made me.
1725,Bart,have any of your workers ever had their hands cut off by the machinery?
8388,Bart,the hot dog water's gonna push us into the fan!
9880,Bart,as long as it means we're not learning.
11697,Bart,enough!
11866,Bart,like strip poker!
3002,Bart,"hey, where's your candy?"
8800,Bart,"no, i hope you get it."
5548,Bart,man i need a job.
9794,Bart,nothing beats a weapon made of weapons!
11215,Bart,and what programs would you cut to pay for this precious garden of yours? the new whiffle-bats? pizza friday?
9833,Bart,normal. you?
2876,Bart,so krusty double-crossed you. but your basic plan was pure genius. where do you get your ideas?
204,Bart,"yeah, mom. we got hosed!"
9452,Bart,i don't care!
1577,Bart,"milhouse. milhouse, wake up. quick, look out the window."
13032,Bart,"hm, yeah."
7450,Bart,time to open the envelope i gave you.
5338,Bart,"all right, which one of you suits ran over my moped? i just put a dollar's worth of gas in that thing."
10023,Bart,no! why in the world would you get me this?
7293,Bart,that i'm not a kid anymore.
9441,Bart,what the--
12696,Bart,"put her there, man!"
1530,Bart,"i'll be gus, the lovable chimney sweep. clean as a whistle, sharp as a thistle, best in all westminster. yeah!"
12374,Bart,can i have something to go with my turnip?
7475,Bart,"uh... apron, boobs-face?"
7610,Bart,she should be back now. it's dinner time.
9091,Bart,such a beautiful language.
4521,Bart,ow! what are you doing?
4596,Bart,"well, if we'd left at four a.m. like i wanted to..."
3042,Bart,yes. yes it would.
2487,Bart,my strobe light!
5129,Bart,they need to soak.
2509,Bart,we've gotta get the dogs outta there!
4132,Bart,krusty the clown!
2599,Bart,no time.
8044,Bart,"finally, someone who does whatever i say."
11235,Bart,that's not where i buried them.
7082,Bart,but you've got twenty pounds on me!
414,Bart,i don't wanna play with milhouse.
6219,Bart,you know him?
3917,Bart,"but, coach?"
3795,Bart,"that's it, lis. now start crawling."
9348,Bart,a romantic dinner? that's a great idea!
2021,Bart,"hey, guys! sign my cast? sign my cast? guys...?"
6682,Bart,what do you do for fun?
460,Bart,au revoir.
991,Bart,that's not krusty the clown.
11692,Bart,nooo!
10812,Bart,fine. you have a weird old version of something. let's just watch tv.
9045,Bart,you can't teach this way!
3934,Bart,"dad, i've got some bad news."
12929,Bart,"so, any idea where this bastard lives?"
5919,Bart,this is partly my fault.
9755,Bart,this won't even cover the vig on what i owe!
3423,Bart,"no, after twelve."
3283,Bart,what the heck? gah!
7140,Bart,and i have a card that can take us anywhere they go.

8207,Bart,aww. and someday you'll be one too.
6906,Bart,"yeah, great workmanship."
4254,Bart,"sorry, ralph."
10702,Bart,i can't believe she ran away. and this isn't helping.
2235,Bart,no.
3098,Bart,"he's not a regular bum, mom. he's a genius bum. he created itchy. and he's the father of cartoon violence."
1179,Bart,what's wrong?
10697,Bart,"oh my god, is that true?"
5052,Bart,"gee, sorry for being born."
2613,Bart,"well, i know you are, but what am i?"
8534,Bart,bob's playing all of you like saps. this man's a killer!
10397,Bart,"shut up! shut up! i'm a bad reader, okay?!"
1483,Bart,yes they do.
1817,Bart,i'm tired. i'm hungry. can't we just buy a new house?
12883,Bart,cool. this is where wall street gets arrested.
2258,Bart,"mrs. krabappel, i didn't..."
3893,Bart,uhmm...
3122,Bart,well... i wasn't the one who solved the problem and neither was lisa. there's something unsettling about that.
860,Bart,"thanks, mom. now. let's get out of this gas-filled hallway before we all suffocate."
12257,Bart,hi guys. what's up?
2642,Bart,"uh... hey, look! someone's attractive cousin."

254,Bart,"homer, whatever they've got you on, cut the dose."
5328,Bart,"hey, lis. i need a favor."
1034,Bart,"whooo! whooo! dad, do you know anything else about women?"
12749,Bart,"my wiffle balls, my frisbees, my water rockets... i've hit the jackpot!"
3219,Bart,check the authenticator spot.
10682,Bart,"hey lis, some fifth graders are having a make-your-own pizza party at flesh-in-the-pan pizza, and wanted me to invite you."
4592,Bart,"oh, that's disgusting."
11679,Bart,this new teacher i got gave me a haircut.
7343,Bart,"uh, mom? looks like someone beat you to it."
11053,Bart,mom and dad still gone?
7005,Bart,"you should hang with us sometime, lis."
1618,Bart,"one, two, three."
11572,Bart,"how's that, kiddo?"
5158,Bart,wow! is there anything he can't do?
214,Bart,"yeah, but don't other people have mail in there?"
6991,Bart,look! he's pickin' his nose.
13099,Bart,why'd you buy the first hover car ever made? didn't you know it'd take time to work out the kinks?
3031,Bart,"if he wants these 25 cents, he'll have to endorse the check by signing it on the back. then when my monthly bank statement comes, i'll get the check back complete with autograph. no fuss, no muss."
8706,Bart,i wouldn't mind driving that over a prairie dog village! honk to the driver!
4739,Bart,"look, it's mom!"
1397,Bart,"yeah, well, anyway, i wonder what he's thinking now."
11683,Bart,"milhouse, i am gonna get back at lassen. now ""the hobbit"" taught us that every dragon has a chink in its armor."

5715,Bart,"okay, but get on your tippy-toes."
2861,Bart,"quick gramma, hide!"
7944,Bart,not if i spend the whole time running around like this.
10170,Bart,bart... i haven't been selling the truffles. i've been eating them.
8360,Bart,"i like it -- ""strangles."" hey lis, wanna touch strangles? he's not slimy at all. he's scaly."
5682,Bart,is that enough?
10057,Bart,i am the bart.
891,Bart,"you can do it, otto. you're the coolest adult i ever met."
9061,Bart,there's twelve more boxes. and they all sound the same!

2821,Bart,"come on, willie. i know you're out there."
13084,Bart,"don't have a cow, man."
10253,Bart,"and one time, during a speech, he was shot by a saloon-keeper -- but teddy finished his speech before heading to the hospital!!"
4689,Bart,adults! / you run our lives like you're colonel klink.
7574,Bart,"no way! i didn't do it! unlike all the other stuff i told you i didn't do, which i did!"
9210,Bart,uh-oh. do you think we went too far?
1753,Bart,show business sucks. i'm outta here.
3721,Bart,...and i miss him so much and i know you like him but i like him too and he was mine first and i know i don't deserve him but...
7819,Bart,i'm gonna order a steak dinner and eat it on the toilet!
12917,Bart,"well, willie, you can take it from here. adios, dude."
12049,Bart,i ain't gonna get outta the fourth grade alive.

2516,Bart,come on! come on!
8808,Bart,i can't believe you're working for krusty and i'm not. i know everything about that clown. favorite blintz -- blueberry. favorite horse in the 2004 belmont -- smarty jones. krusty lost a bundle and had to endorse baby wipes in norway. which i have a case of!
834,Bart,it's like they saw our lives and put it right up on screen.
11221,Bart,leave the bottle.
10886,Bart,"the least common blood type is a--b, b--a, c--a.b., d--o. d'oh!"
12423,Bart,"i don't know, but i know someone who would: krusty's best friend in the whole world, sideshow bob."
3005,Bart,"hey, cool, what does this do?"
4384,Bart,"dad, wait. you're not risking your life just to impress me, are you?"
11904,Bart,"oh, mom! not tonight."
1580,Bart,"no! no, it's true! there's a monster on the bus."
984,Bart,the krusty brand seal of approval. you can only find it on products which meet the high personal standards of krusty the clown.
6673,Bart,"oh, that's it. you are going down."
1184,Bart,wow...
8063,Bart,"yay, grampa!"
12539,Bart,study area?
492,Bart,okay.
3086,Bart,itchy the lucky mouse in: manhattan madness.

6828,Bart,why are you greeting low-lifes like us at the airport?
5773,Bart,you got that right.
7656,Bart,"ha, ha, you read books."
11440,Bart,and that's why i was tardy today.
1732,Bart,"here's a danish, krusty."
7686,Bart,this is where stem cell research led us!
12661,Bart,"final score: bart, forty-one. homer... let's see, six plus six plus six plus six plus six plus six..."
12722,Bart,wow! swan-ky!

7228,Bart,"outtasight! lay it on me, mama."
9282,Bart,exactly. crisscross! do we have a deal?
8968,Bart,pg-13.
4779,Bart,"dad, stop!"
6792,Bart,you taught me a criminal can evade the law well into old age.
2407,Bart,"draining? oh, i don't care about that anymore."
12352,Bart,"'bye, spanky."
11252,Bart,she's in a better place.
7789,Bart,how's things with you and frank?
10477,Bart,"he's still inside-in, folks! and just to prove it:"
432,Bart,god bless that clown.
6626,Bart,"hey, we're all gonna be murdered some day."
10149,Bart,i was invited to that party!
5691,Bart,"hey dad, bet you five bucks you can't eat the whole box."
765,Bart,"hey, fellas, let's go shoot some bad guys."
7593,Bart,"yes'm. anima patri, et filio, et spiritui sancto..."
11158,Bart,now i'll just cut off her annoying head and this body will be all mine. or we both die. not really sure what the rules are.
7803,Bart,nobody tells bart simpson what to do.
2073,Bart,"i can't stand to see you so miserable, lis, unless it's from a rubber spider down your dress. hmmm. that gives me an idea."
6563,Bart,"sorry, no can do. i'm taking off for six months to join the skewed tour."
7531,Bart,i learned my lesson -- mr. spangler showed me the true cost of my junk food addiction.
6079,Bart,what are you doing?
5187,Bart,"okay, i'll see what i can do."
1270,Bart,no use complaining about something you can't change.
3762,Bart,"mardi gras, man! when the big easy calls, ya gotta accept the charges!"

2562,Bart,"um, the guy who chopped up george washington?"
7811,Bart,"well dad, we may not always get along, but we'll never be that lame."
10968,Bart,ay carumba!
4687,Bart,taped and corked.
1404,Bart,"dad, it's all my fault! i shook up that can of beer!"
6070,Bart,no one's doing any bumping. time to ram-a-lam these ding dongs.
3594,Bart,"i'm trying, dad."
11023,Bart,don't need to. i've got you.
4449,Bart,"oh, yeah. good one, mom."
10550,Bart,trying to fix your broken brain.
1356,Bart,"soitenly. nyuck, nyuck, nyuck."
7586,Bart,stealing pairs of what? hubcaps? reeboks? human eyes?
9178,Bart,lousy teachers.
11965,Bart,"don't give up, dad."
10725,Bart,yeah... plus i thought i might get to see an air conditioner fall on someone's head. but i guess that never really happens.

663,Bart,sting!
10079,Bart,cool! are they robots?
7253,Bart,"mom, this was the worst party ever."
401,Bart,"milhouse, a little salt?"
8858,Bart,"milhouse, i hold in this hand denis leary's cell phone. and in this hand, the phone numbers of bars around the world. let's start with hawaii."
6083,Bart,"yeah, this is milhouse. he's my best friend, because ... well, geographical convenience really."
5511,Bart,"no, there's a badger in there."
11034,Bart,dad?! you always hated church!
5016,Bart,you have been selected for operation exodus...
11954,Bart,and i was that boy!

8261,Bart,"hello, redemption."
5960,Bart,the lady said no.
8245,Bart,"i saw you yesterday in the dining room, and i didn't know if i should say ""hi"" or not."
9491,Bart,you don't look fat.
7916,Bart,wait a minute -- do you know why you did good at math?
9714,Bart,two little maids in attendance come.
19,Bart,traitor! how dare you betray the planet i got laid on?!
6855,Bart,"hey mister, would you like a puppy?"
5561,Bart,i just buckled down and studied.
7496,Bart,"i was gonna have my classmates over for a homework party, but now my refreshments are ruined."
8076,Bart,wait. what if... nobody goes? he can't kill all of us.
9302,Bart,there's gotta be something yummy out there.
2873,Bart,"free 'n' easy, lis. ahh. there's nothing like an unfurnished basement for pure comfort."
10583,Bart,no!
12752,Bart,"hey, lis! lisa! it's me, bart!"
1014,Bart,"lisa, this is neither the time nor the place."
8542,Bart,"well, i guess i could say goodbye."
998,Bart,"krusty, this camp was a nightmare. they fed us gruel, they forced us to make wallets for export, and one of the campers was eaten by a bear."
2051,Bart,a human head!
9323,Bart,"your honor, i'd like to enter something into the record."
9105,Bart,did you unscrew all the phillips heads?
4717,Bart,"you're right, mom. i understand."
9600,Bart,absolutely not.
7165,Bart,i wouldn't mind pushin' that in the mud.
116,Bart,no.
2060,Bart,but i distinctly heard you say that maude was with god.
1482,Bart,somebody ought to ruin gabbo's career the way he ruined krusty's.
10158,Bart,you're lookin' at him.
13108,Bart,i guess everyone in this family is doomed to wind up alone.
1248,Bart,"what is it, dad?"
2615,Bart,"i know you are, but what am i?"
11831,Bart,ow! quit it!
4094,Bart,"or as the indians call it, maize. another famous indian was crazy horse. in conclusion, libya is a land of contrasts. thank you."
3208,Bart,"there's no denying it, sis."
1564,Bart,"paintings. lifeless images rendered in colorful goop. but at night, they take on a life of their own."
5199,Bart,"wow, you can do anything out here."
5284,Bart,"way to make a guitar, sears."
136,Bart,say... writing all those tickets must make you guys thirsty. how about a couple on the house?
11261,Bart,just don't lose this claim ticket.
1521,Bart,since when could you write a song?
11031,Bart,cool! they give you a bag of the bedbugs they killed.
2299,Bart,wow. v8 juice isn't one-eighth gasoline.
3034,Bart,krusty's my hero! how could i do this to him?
1249,Bart,nothing you say can upset us. we're the mtv generation.
1764,Bart,obnoxious fad?
8078,Bart,"yup, he'll be all alone on his birthday! oh, i wish i could see it. boo hoo! i'm nelson. no one likes me."
1595,Bart,whee!
10912,Bart,"soon, baby, soon. let me just kill milhouse's character. he thinks we're on the same team."
1170,Bart,"dad, if there's a really special girl and she likes some clod who's beneath her, what should you do?"
1390,Bart,"i won't jump anymore, i promise."
10529,Bart,yeah.
4591,Bart,what's wrong with stinky?
6666,Bart,if i understand the female mind -- and i do -- they're plotting against us.

6841,Bart,"dad, you got attacked by a bear?!"
2643,Bart,"uh oh, wet cement!"
12910,Bart,"hello, is homer there?"

10779,Bart,"okay, baby, let's see the flop... dammit! lost again."
7065,Bart,"ah, cartoons, america's only native art form. i don't count jazz, 'cause it sucks."

10440,Bart,"helpful hint: if you want friends, don't use words like ""conundrum."""
8462,Bart,i'm just gonna take off now. i'm sure you have a lot of calls to make...
7595,Bart,i thought there was a monster in the potty.

7002,Bart,"hey, he's my best friend."
7980,Bart,i thought you wanted me to drum!

6740,Bart,"good grief, this candy's terrible."
4826,Bart,"well, i'm flunkin' math, and the other day i was a little attracted to milhouse."
5774,Bart,"way to go, slim!"

3095,Bart,just move that cot out of the way.
4136,Bart,"no, he's alive. and he is so funny you could plotz. at least according to his press release."
623,Bart,fine.
7913,Bart,"now, for your final test. to fully become a man, you must pick a fight with someone weaker than you."
8564,Bart,"okay... but if dad kisses mom too much, a stork will lay an angel egg in her tummy, and the next thing you know we find a baby brother in the cabbage patch! here's a thumbnail sketch:"
7173,Bart,"way to go, dad!"

6058,Bart,we're rehearsing a play.
5813,Bart,all night. you were yelling at the swing.
9252,Bart,"listen... i was thinking...if someone did a really bad thing to one teacher... and then did the same bad thing to another teacher to get the first teacher her job back, would it be okay?"
12617,Bart,nevermore. nevermore. nevermore. nevermore. nevermore.
3601,Bart,one of the stills --
8921,Bart,awesome!
8782,Bart,like what?
6756,Bart,"if we're both touching the watch, neither of us will be affected."

10224,Bart,"mm, i use it to workshop my pranks."
5510,Bart,okay.
11176,Bart,"but milhouse, i already let you push me on the swings."
6675,Bart,"don't worry, boy. we'll get you out of the dog house. and then you and dad'll be chasing butterflies together again."
12143,Bart,"hey, don't say stuff like that about me to maggie. she's on my side, anyway."
7143,Bart,you guys lied to us!
3145,Bart,"we're not going to a grammar rodeo! that was just an alibi, milton!!"
12561,Bart,"do you think you could grade it now, please?"
2837,Bart,"if you gain 61 pounds, they'll let you work at home?"
7103,Bart,i thought you might want to have a nice family dinner.
9325,Bart,"yeah, yeah, miracles are all around us. now please, i am trying to hear the school closings."
10025,Bart,it's still here! yes! i get the flash drive back and the manila envelope.
6837,Bart,"lis, your stupid present will only last a week. mine will sit in a closet for years."
12260,Bart,you're not really talking to me. you're just my overactive imagination.
3660,Bart,"aw, you've been all edgy and suspicious ever since i gave you those pep pills."
10865,Bart,"thanks for the freedom of speech, dorks."
5386,Bart,picture?
9057,Bart,"what's your plan now, skinrash?"
7729,Bart,what? um... uh... i just shoplifted this bad boy. housewares never knew what hit 'em.

8051,Bart,"milhouse, that is the most pathetic thing i ever... oh my god, she's beautiful!"
10488,Bart,yeah! i could sneak into the school and write whatever i want on the chalkboard!
11232,Bart,mom!
5651,Bart,"silence, seymour. we're in charge now. your reign of fussiness is over."
3438,Bart,let me get away with moider.
1443,Bart,i guess that's it. i just can't be educated. i can always get a job testing dangerous food additives.
12435,Bart,"attention, fellow children. krusty didn't rob that store. sideshow bob framed him and i got proof."
1207,Bart,baby.

7759,Bart,heeere's bart!
783,Bart,"not in my hall, bub."
3732,Bart,"lis, have i told you lately that i love you?"
10755,Bart,"now to return to a future where i'm either rich or allowed to stand in front of a rich guy's house. either way, better than now."
6283,Bart,i got a plastic krusty-saurus.
4906,Bart,"knife goes in, guts come out. knife goes in, guts come out..."
8809,Bart,"lisa's got school, career, posture -- why'd she have to steal krusty from me?!"
1042,Bart,"lis, as your brother, this is the hardest thing i've ever had to say. you're not ugly."
12614,Bart,anything!
1291,Bart,"mitch, you're doing a bang-up job."
9202,Bart,dr. hibbert found out my thyroid isn't pumping out enough--
9357,Bart,don't you wanna do it?
8812,Bart,"okay, here's my offer -- all this primo krusty merchandise for that copy of ""radioactive man vs. muhammad ali""."
2807,Bart,it's gone.
2772,Bart,suppose someone wanted to buy it from you?
5156,Bart,wow! he dances better than jesus himself!
6450,Bart,"ooh, algebra... i'll just do a few equations. no! no more distractions!"
10628,Bart,"the song's right! no matter how much fun i cram into this cruise...it'll only last a week. then it's back to mom and dad fighting, lisa moping, homework, bullies, and a lunchbag sandwich soggy with the sweat of a juice-box!"
2305,Bart,i'm getting this book on u.f.o.s.
8966,Bart,knock it off back there.
4012,Bart,"hey, that's my washcloth."
10116,Bart,"how's that water, wet like your tears?"
11561,Bart,come on. you were in world war two.
12134,Bart,"yo, chump, you back again?"
1414,Bart,"giddiyup! merry christmas, suckers."
6331,Bart,"hey dad, check it out!"
4264,Bart,"hmm, maybe it still works. gimme the newlyweds from that cake."
8242,Bart,huh? but we were doing such good work.
7524,Bart,"look, i'm really, really sorry. now let me get that ice cream off your shoe."
12060,Bart,dad... i need help... please...
9039,Bart,"plaques come, plaques go."
2856,Bart,"hey, since you were a no-show at all the big moments of my life, you owe me years of back presents: christmases, birthdays, easters, kwaanzas, good report cards...at seventy-five bucks a pop, plus interest and penalties... you owe me twenty-two thousand dollars."
9152,Bart,not our entire relationship. just the stuff i said.
2359,Bart,uh huh.
11341,Bart,i wasn't drinking. i was learning that nature isn't a complete waste of space.
187,Bart,"oh, so that's your little game. let old bart get nice and drowsy, then, when his back is turned... wham!"
1307,Bart,"someday i want to be an f-14 pilot like my hero, tom. he lent me this new weapon called a neural disrupter."
2552,Bart,"mom, i need a dollar. ever since you started teaching here, kids have been taking my lunch money. and i need that money for candy."
1923,Bart,"yeah, great."
6198,Bart,are you crazy? i can't believe a play where every character was murdered could be so boring.
3153,Bart,"branson, missouri. my dad says it's like vegas if it were run by ned flanders."
1824,Bart,"well, all that money sounds mighty tempting, marty. but i think i'm gonna have to go with the elephant."
3240,Bart,"nice try, todd."
2926,Bart,i-i-i could pay for the game. i'll pay for it.
8206,Bart,"you know, for a while, i was kinda looking forward to bein' a dad."
1533,Bart,mom! dad! i saw sideshow bob and he threatened to kill me!
10484,Bart,prepare to be disappointed!
3814,Bart,you're the boss.
5471,Bart,we found a secret room that was filled to the ceiling with parachute pants. i'm wearing some now.
296,Bart,good morning. this is your wake-up call.

2278,Bart,"mom, that is really annoying."
5766,Bart,i am in your power.
8223,Bart,"one day, stanley picked up a cleaver and put a new entrée on the menu."
4343,Bart,"""should i abandon hope or fight on bravely against impossible odds? oh, this is too perfect."
5730,Bart,"i must warn you that once this next tape starts, it will not stop. because that button is broken."
2007,Bart,"wow, i've never seen mom so mad at homer before."
6766,Bart,just keep it above the belt.
407,Bart,i had a fight with milhouse.
6476,Bart,"all right, i'm in. i'll humiliate the love of your life. because i like you, i'll even do it pro boner."
10769,Bart,i don't hear anything.
5506,Bart,"hmm... stoats, stoats..."
12769,Bart,"pull, pull you dogs."
10783,Bart,"aw, c'mon, lis. no gambling story has a happy ending, except seabiscuit. but you never hear about the ruined lives of the people who bet against him."

11670,Bart,you're nuts. i've got a will of iron.

9915,Bart,you're outta your elfin mind!
5657,Bart,"oh, boo hoo. after all the times i've done it, my wrist sounds like a cement mixer."

10751,Bart,ay carumba! if you guys don't get together... what does that mean for me in the future?
8249,Bart,you know what -- i think i'm good.
10720,Bart,i guess my search for true love is doomed.
11499,Bart,just how do women get babies?
4062,Bart,"we're natural born carnies, dad. if only we weren't tied down with a family..."
8718,Bart,"so, what do you think of my calf?"

3310,Bart,can't you read? call the police!
7746,Bart,"mother, what are you doing?"
2225,Bart,"you're right, lisa -- love isn't about fixing someone. i'm just going to give her up cold turkey. i'm not gonna talk to her or see her. it's over. thanks for the advice, sis."
5637,Bart,daa-ad!
3090,Bart,you can't just go back to the gutter! you created itchy. you should be a millionaire!
342,Bart,but i'm only... ... ... five... ten... twenty... forty minutes? that's pretty damn late.

3060,Bart,"what about: being an illiterate tv clown who's still more respected than all the scientists, doctors and educators in the country put together?"
11608,Bart,what does that mean?
9727,Bart,great day to be alive!
11977,Bart,"way to go, homer!"
5148,Bart,glad that's not me.

8557,Bart,"yeah, you always said that after high school, dad ""blessed you with the unplanned miracle of me."""
6332,Bart,"""homer, i need cash or they're gonna break my legs."""
9591,Bart,that's no problem -- mom can make garbage taste great.
912,Bart,"no, but my sister's got a wide selection of crappy comics."
1499,Bart,"no problemo. hey, moe! look over there."
5216,Bart,"duncan's really fast, dad. he was just intimidated by those other horses."

5563,Bart,i was trying to breed the hamster with the lizard to create an unholy super-creature... when i saw an even worse crime against nature.
7919,Bart,that's honest work for honest pay!
6428,Bart,"this has been the worst week of my life. i miss my toys, my video games... ""mutt 'n' jeff"" comics are not funny."

1193,Bart,"shove it? ""shove it?"""

5983,Bart,my dad's always yelling that whitey's keepin' him down.
1065,Bart,"please lis, they prefer to be called the living impaired."
4414,Bart,"well, you should have thought of that before i glued all this stuff to my face."
6898,Bart,"she said ""yes."""
12814,Bart,"thanks, nelson."
6840,Bart,"i'm gonna pour caramel on my clothes. and then, finally, i can eat my shorts."

11063,Bart,thank god your mental powers haven't deteriorated.
8670,Bart,i'm not a nerd -- i'm a jock who's too cool for sports.
12894,Bart,aye carumba!
1890,Bart,"mr. burns, i don't want to seem ungrateful. but, i want to go home to my family."
6907,Bart,"you actually did it! you're the coolest, dad!"
2185,Bart,"is it my hair? my overbite? the fact that i've worn the same clothes, day in, day out, for the last four years?"

1100,Bart,"come on, homer. this isn't funny."
5383,Bart,"lisa, people these days don't want to see a baby bird. they want to see celebrities at their worst."
2857,Bart,what?
8309,Bart,"behold, my naked butt!"
7683,Bart,did you replace me with this tinkertoy?
11463,Bart,you seem stressed.

3492,Bart,nope. something about a bunch of guys alone together in the woods... seems kinda gay.
4368,Bart,"gentlemen, the game is capture the flag. rod, ladies pick first."
1133,Bart,ivanhoe is the story of a russian farmer and his tool.
9796,Bart,"so which of these ""bored lames"" shall we play? taffyland?"

5952,Bart,"uh, i don't think lenny's house has a steeple."
2201,Bart,"sorry, i have kind of a short fuse, which some find charming. speaking of charming, watching fox last night, i heard a rather amusing story... this character named martin was feeling rather randy and he was heard to remark..."
181,Bart,"sweet dreams, boys."
12315,Bart,oh sure. like i'm really gonna take a picture of my butt.
12757,Bart,i don't know! i don't know why i did it! i don't know why i enjoyed it! and i don't know why i'll do it again!
12495,Bart,"ah well, maybe just one more hour."
573,Bart,"""the inventor i admire"", by bart simpson. the inventor i admire is, not a rich man, or a famous man, or even a smart man. he's my father, homer simpson, creator of... the ""flaming homer""!"
2732,Bart,"when she swallowed that quarter, he spent all day with her."
164,Bart,"look, pal. we've got a hundred bucks and we'd like to buy ""radioactive man no. 1"". so why don't you just waddle over there and get it."
8580,Bart,there's this new kid at school who everyone thinks is cooler than me.
805,Bart,"what are you gonna do, homer?"
5049,Bart,cool costume!
5830,Bart,"all right, i got another one!"
4641,Bart,even i wouldn't do that. and i'm america's bad boy.
3138,Bart,maybe when we find something decent to do with this i.d.
6755,Bart,"to restart time, click watch again."
931,Bart,"samantha and milhouse sitting in a tree, about to lose their pri-va-cy!"
7784,Bart,"yeah, but that also works for the dog's butt."
6386,Bart,"oh lord, please strike these mountain folk dead--"
11786,Bart,"whoa. thinking back, i'm kinda surprised mom and dad let a crazy man spend all night in my bedroom."
5497,Bart,"speaking of which, how about seconds?"
12489,Bart,"whoa, take that, granny! oh, hide in the closet. oh no, deadly mothballs."
8112,Bart,no thanks.
937,Bart,milhouse?
11767,Bart,fast pass can't solve everything!
8527,Bart,amen.

3253,Bart,it's the principle. she's gotta learn!
1129,Bart,suckers.

6901,Bart,yes!
1750,Bart,"thanks dad, that's great advice."
12223,Bart,what?
5301,Bart,flanders is a soft touch. he'll give us the money for sure.
10610,Bart,"i can't, i sold my ""dinner futures."""
2179,Bart,"that's not fair, nelson. they didn't have the killmatic 3,000 back then."
2105,Bart,"wait, that did end in heartbreak. thanks for opening up old wounds, you ma."
3605,Bart,okay. so...
6196,Bart,cool. does he get to marry his mom?
10825,Bart,"screw that, it's krusty time."
359,Bart,i don't know.
9047,Bart,looks like you took a big number two.
11357,Bart,so they're transferring him to another hospital.
5669,Bart,"boy, that salt really ate through the car."
4786,Bart,any thoughts on how we're gonna get there?
10199,Bart,"maybe this key will be the key to putting the ""key"" in anarchy."
11662,Bart,"hey homer, you gonna kiss him or kill him?"
8191,Bart,how religious can you be if you're pregnant?
10035,Bart,i... i don't want to talk about it.

5220,Bart,"that's it, d. don't let anyone push you around. be as bad as you wanna be."
6644,Bart,"hey, i love watching you guys fight. it's my earliest memory."
611,Bart,isn't that nice? take a message. right now i'm off to hit forty-six local merchants for free birthday goods and services.
11045,Bart,and that's why flanders will never ever be my partner in crime again. thanks for bailing me out.
431,Bart,"he is, for sure?"
3332,Bart,no.
11700,Bart,"help me, desert weirdoes!"
8075,Bart,"milhouse, steady my duds!"
6022,Bart,i thought kearney was dating your mom.
4100,Bart,"what's everyone's problem? i'm glad we're stranded. it'll be just like the swiss family robinson, only with more cursing. we're gonna live like kings. damn hell ass kings!"
7774,Bart,"krusty, you gotta help us."

9646,Bart,i know.
2850,Bart,what isn't he doing?
7788,Bart,"what can i say? i missed you, myra."

2670,Bart,"that's my dog, man."
184,Bart,our dear friend martin was trying to steal the comic book.
12299,Bart,"dad, you didn't even say ouch."

188,Bart,"well, it is not going to happen, see?"
7425,Bart,no... you don't mean...
8004,Bart,ow!
11141,Bart,"but if the gumbamel should ramble, then stumble, then just hop atop a krustiferous krumbull. but then if that krumbull should happen to tumble, just call your amigo, the bee man of bumble."
4418,Bart,"okay, be that way. be a big, stupid jerk."
3607,Bart,"hey, houdini, why don't you saw martin in half?"
6374,Bart,"if i'm such an idiot, how come i'm the smartest kid in the third grade?"
704,Bart,here you go... just kidding. here you go... just kidding.
12898,Bart,i promise i will never watch that channel again.

5116,Bart,are you sure? you sound nervous.
2285,Bart,damn fda. why can't it all be marshmallow?
1017,Bart,"tell it, daddy!"
1412,Bart,probably not.
1061,Bart,"hey, maybe there's a spell in here that'll bring her back from the dead."
11629,Bart,"uh, guys... what the hell is that?"
7007,Bart,what're you talkin' about?
8609,Bart,"don't worry, we'll get him out in a couple hours."
5174,Bart,a real preacher knows how to bring the bible alive through music and dancing and tae-bo!
4346,Bart,"lisa, i've just arrived at the springfield dump. a lot of things get thrown out here. sometimes, even a human being. somewhere in this pile of twisted metal and soiled mattresses..."
6982,Bart,"i'm gonna hit you so hard, i'll kill your whole family."
5473,Bart,"fine! i'll do ""teen wolf iii."" i've got fair-weather friends to feed."
9516,Bart,so that's why i'm so cool!
6235,Bart,what did i do wrong?
11563,Bart,"wow, that sounds pretty sweet."
8014,Bart,it's like you're the jesus of carpentry.
12640,Bart,"you throw like my sister, man!"
12541,Bart,no.
8608,Bart,you grew tired of always being in my shadow.
8767,Bart,"no, everything is better."
265,Bart,"hey, looney tunes, this is what michael jackson looks like. you look like a big fat mental patient."
1200,Bart,domer.
107,Bart,no.
7911,Bart,"""if they fall on the floor, you want 'em more."" because then they come with extra toppings."
1610,Bart,wowww!!
4629,Bart,"hmmm... i suppose maybe if, uh... no. no, sorry, thought i had it there for a sec."
1043,Bart,nope. metal.
6794,Bart,"c'mon, big guy. this'll help you get to sleep."
2328,Bart,"hi, dad."
4566,Bart,don't you get it? he swore he'd kill me too. i'm next!
12393,Bart,my father. what a buffoon.
7322,Bart,how much?
5083,Bart,"i can't take mr. burns to the ho'pital 'cause i'm too dumb to read a map. oh, why did my school have to close?"
10110,Bart,what was that?
12427,Bart,"bart simpson, sir."
2598,Bart,"wet cement! is there any sweeter sign? well, maybe ""high voltage."""
3684,Bart,"uh, yeah."
10897,Bart,whoa! look at that guy!
11175,Bart,"now, i, bart simpson, shall send the first coaster down the track."
10134,Bart,"y'know, i was skeptical, but i guess therapy works."
10663,Bart,"yeah, why aren't we doing lenny's story? that thing's hilarious."
9643,Bart,oh no. you are not taking the children.
4835,Bart,ow!!
4097,Bart,go apple!
9863,Bart,"this town can't teach its kids or collect its garbage, but we lead the nation in pointless revenge."
310,Bart,six. seven if there's something good on.
8687,Bart,does that mean i can stop training to be a mexican wrestler?
6960,Bart,"milhouse, why are you acting so crazy? did your imaginary friend try to kill you again?"
4541,Bart,"is the nest still warm enough, mom?"
748,Bart,"gotcha. can't win, don't try."
8613,Bart,"my pleasure, sir."
5500,Bart,it's approaching the podium!
4010,Bart,"yeah, but they've still got plenty of pumpkins."
10920,Bart,...and then i ran right home to you.
6490,Bart,she's in the back yard!
6437,Bart,"dad, i can't believe you're putting my life at risk to save your own."
12122,Bart,"ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls. contrary to what you've just seen, war is neither glamorous nor fun. there are no winners, only losers. there are no good wars, with the following exceptions: the american revolution, world war ii, and the star wars trilogy. if you'd like to learn more about war, there's lots of books in your local library -- many of them with cool, gory pictures. well, good night, everybody. peace, man."
10879,Bart,"no, no!"
3659,Bart,let me answer that question with... cookware!
1740,Bart,wow! a big clown hankie!
10811,Bart,check out all these sergeant activity dolls!
1906,Bart,i need something for show and tell.
55,Bart,"after the supermarket, we'll go to the video store, grab a krusty burger and head for the arcade."
10071,Bart,oh my god! the legends are true!
10487,Bart,but bunkerball is keeping us sane!
3389,Bart,"so then i says to mabel, i says..."
5256,Bart,don't you do enough yakkin' at the beauty parlor?
12896,Bart,"oh, here's what i was looking for."
7994,Bart,"well, i've got a confession to make. this right arm... it's not mine."
7016,Bart,"all yours, homer."
4489,Bart,"i gotta admit, homer. you're taking this pretty well."
5437,Bart,"tonight, on the discovery channel: ""inside lisa's nose."""
8228,Bart,"oh, dark stanley would never dare attack a crowded, well-lit--"
9270,Bart,nothin'.
7110,Bart,"we got a runner. snipers, take your shot."
10486,Bart,not me.
10076,Bart,trying to get out of here before grampa wakes up.
10922,Bart,i don't know what she wants. what would my heroes say?
7513,Bart,ko-ta-hay cheese?
4649,Bart,"but, da--"
9472,Bart,i have to go to the bathroom!
7038,Bart,"chill out, mom. they gave me this hat."
2845,Bart,"dad? it says ""non-toxic."""
10584,Bart,doesn't anyone here realize i'm only ten years old?
10570,Bart,"oh, that is cool. looks like two snakes trying to kill each other on your head."
2326,Bart,"well, well, well. i never thought i'd win this easy."
3886,Bart,must-drop-pantaloons.
1526,Bart,that's good.
12600,Bart,"eww, baby spit."
2540,Bart,wuh?
2522,Bart,"ah, i think i got your lunch."
8885,Bart,night is scary...
4412,Bart,"mom, i didn't eat any of it. i'm not stupid."
11482,Bart,stop encouraging me!
4468,Bart,"that's great, dad."
2644,Bart,i could sure use that flying motorcycle now.
11336,Bart,can i join?
6705,Bart,there's no time. we're going in!
11038,Bart,well let's get lovejoy back. do you know where he is?
12463,Bart,"relax. this is cinema verite. when the brutal slow-motion killing starts, i'll tell you to shut your eyes."
882,Bart,uggh...
8038,Bart,it worked!
526,Bart,"hey, dad, you got a power drill?"
4387,Bart,shouldn't you save a couple bottles for when you're a little higher?
11172,Bart,ay carumba!
11997,Bart,"no, me!"
11768,Bart,"goodbye, friend."
4139,Bart,woo hoo! yeah! krust-ee!
6587,Bart,rainier wolfcastle!?
11088,Bart,"wait, wait! i'm not learning anything! i'm just goin' 'cause the teacher's pretty."
5460,Bart,"mom, it's great to have you back, but you walked right into my shot."
11793,Bart,and they shut down the thinkhole...
115,Bart,no.
385,Bart,no! my principal!
5980,Bart,go for it.
2707,Bart,milhouse!
8185,Bart,what?!
5882,Bart,you better stick your head in and see what's going on.
2413,Bart,no. you owe me nine hundred dollars.
2250,Bart,"ah, action news, the last place an impressionable kid can go for tv violence."
7287,Bart,the tooth fairy has made a donation in my name to the ­united way?! that gossamer witch.
4265,Bart,stand back!
8587,Bart,come see me when you get out.
9617,Bart,"reading prayers and ignoring them, just like god."
13001,Bart,"let's see, i want a teargas can, a blue gun with paralyzer darts..."
2165,Bart,"dad, it's in there again!"
4190,Bart,"so, wait a minute. this means i'm gonna be a failure?"
8550,Bart,you stink like my butt! take him away!
1385,Bart,april f...
7725,Bart,"yeah. you know, that puddle started life as a bowl of cereal."
10931,Bart,give me another chance. i'll be way more attentive to your needs on the seesaw -- i'll stay down there for as long as you want.
8005,Bart,"i wanna thank everyone for this special night. jazz folk may have the smallest apartments, but they also have the biggest hearts."
9244,Bart,"well, it's funny, really. i'm the one who put booze in your coffee and got you fired."
11528,Bart,mom! it's not funny if i can't hear the cats drown in their own barf!
10297,Bart,yeah!
6994,Bart,that's what you call commitment to a bit.
9604,Bart,just tell me what you want!
7489,Bart,oh! now i have to start over.
6589,Bart,why don't you ask those guys?
8735,Bart,"aw, man. i never figured the gate would be locked. it's like they knew we were coming."
9581,Bart,"dad, i know we don't normally talk about this stuff, but there's this girl at school i kind of like."
1090,Bart,or you could let me go play with milhouse while you spend the afternoon watching unpredictable mexican sitcoms.
10459,Bart,but-but-but...
599,Bart,"you're a machine, homer."
10233,Bart,"see, dad? having krabappel next door is nothing but trouble. teachers should not be allowed to live near their students. we're natural enemies, like george washington and abraham lincoln."
6604,Bart,"oh, okay."
12559,Bart,that all men are created equal.
11488,Bart,"okay, did you get trunch's d.n.a.?"
12409,Bart,"oh, man."
8503,Bart,"lis, i don't get it. why does milhouse's happiness make me sad?"
6572,Bart,"yes, sir."
9056,Bart,ay carumba.
9777,Bart,i wish you were a statistical illusion.
12363,Bart,"yes, sir."
5932,Bart,check this out!
11166,Bart,i'm father o'greedy! dimes for the needy!
9881,Bart,what about the detroit lions?
9879,Bart,"no, i was thinking we could use him to send messages back and forth."
10911,Bart,"doctors without borders, you're now doctors without faces!"
12227,Bart,i'm bart simpson.
1615,Bart,dad. dad! you really want to get rid of this trampoline?
4839,Bart,"hey, swiss miss. there's no missin' you, babe. heh, heh. lay off the cocoa."
11280,Bart,now why don't you donate that to whatever hopeless cause you want.
3809,Bart,that took too long! how come we had to transfer in atlanta twice?
5170,Bart,i got two words for this sermon:
8392,Bart,what about me?
8439,Bart,we can say these swears any time we want because they're in the bible!
5722,Bart,"it's a vacuum cleaner, milhouse."
5680,Bart,you gonna bribe 'em?
10495,Bart,"how're you doin', mr. assange?"
12594,Bart,do it again.
11117,Bart,kung fu werewolf chop!
7294,Bart,"well, there's one thing no one can take away: my childlike imagination."
5032,Bart,i'll dig an outhouse.
8362,Bart,"hey, don't ask me to show if you can't handle the tell."
12525,Bart,"no, i mean it. you can't hold me back. i swear i'm gonna do better. look at my eyes. see the sincerity, see the conviction, see the fear. as god is my witness, i can pass the fourth grade."
4699,Bart,"oh, man."
1310,Bart,father-son picnic.
10098,Bart,what does that mean?!
12488,Bart,uhhh... straighten up and fly right?
9710,Bart,i'll prove i'm not crazy. sideshow bob could never resist singing along to a gilbert and sullivan operetta.
381,Bart,"that is not funny, lewis."
7043,Bart,"a letter, huh? okay lis, get this down."
2049,Bart,you can start makin' it up to me right now. flanders is leaving the house. i want you to sneak in there and bring me back some evidence... and something sweet for later.
6427,Bart,"hey, you should see how much trouble dad's having shaving with a straight razor."
7793,Bart,"thank you, satan!"
3598,Bart,"oh, so many wasted nights..."
2482,Bart,ow! hey watch those virtual darts. i'm trying to play virtual pool!
99,Bart,please dad.
9080,Bart,oh my god. look over there!
2433,Bart,ewww. it's not like in cartoons.
1114,Bart,"well, dad, i guess you won."
6540,Bart,look at it.
8976,Bart,you're losin' it!
2545,Bart,mo-om.
2904,Bart,i wanna stay here with mr. burns.
6575,Bart,"c'mon man, everyone knows the first day of school is a total wank."
9633,Bart,where are you going?
10935,Bart,what's this notice on the wall?
4778,Bart,"whoa, look at him roll."
6443,Bart,sorry.
3089,Bart,i can't believe it. that was itchy all right. you did invent him! when people see this you'll be rich and famous!
2617,Bart,that's a crud rock. it belongs in crud town.
5756,Bart,this new morning announcer sounds awfully familiar.
7616,Bart,"so, how are we related again?"
1837,Bart,i think i'm gonna call him stampy.
4500,Bart,that's all i got.
7587,Bart,cool.
9631,Bart,i guess you can.
2151,Bart,but dad can't afford six dollars a night.
12719,Bart,apologize! for what?! clearing the table? having a sense of humor? they think they can starve an apology out of me. ha!
6723,Bart,and why are we gonna do it?
5964,Bart,who said that?
10813,Bart,"i think i'm done here. lisa, go nuts."
7306,Bart,forget it. my attitude isn't for sale! what am i saying? of course it is!
8516,Bart,"all right, i get it."
3066,Bart,"you missed the race, mama."
7246,Bart,"nope, it's real -- check out the watermark."
10400,Bart,i guess.
11366,Bart,so how do we fix him?
12342,Bart,ooh! ahh! ooh! ahh! ahh! ahh! ohh!
3312,Bart,but then they'll just beat me up even worse.

3473,Bart,aannd 'round and 'round she -- uh-oh.
11328,Bart,even you won't sit with me?
7747,Bart,"mom, i thought this is what you wanted."
3548,Bart,more than that.
6419,Bart,"okay, where do you want it?"
4003,Bart,will this christmas never end?
5365,Bart,i'll do my best.
3108,Bart,"i knew i had seen this exact scene somewhere else -- it was in the movie mr. lampwick showed me. ladies and gentlemen, this drawing was made in 1919, nine years before roger myers made his first itchy and scratchy cartoon."
7828,Bart,hee-eere.
1366,Bart,huh?

1084,Bart,i promise.
3078,Bart,loser.
8918,Bart,"mcmansion, mcdonalds, mcdreamy, mcsteamy, mcmansion, fleetwood mac, and maccauley culkin."
8856,Bart,that's right! let's call his business manager and tell him to spend all his money on yankees hats and derek jeter jerseys.
8585,Bart,why did you take the rap for me?
6004,Bart,"ha, busted!"
8190,Bart,"i'm ten and stupid! look, if i'm not the father, then who is?"
10080,Bart,"no, no. you're augustus gloop, the fat german boy!"
5396,Bart,"here's the mail, dad. that'll be three dollars for on-couch delivery."
4472,Bart,booger.
5168,Bart,number of miracles performed by bart: two. number performed by lisa: zero.
12985,Bart,... lay down...
6895,Bart,now to turn on the moto-mimic.
8315,Bart,is it my rabbit cottontail? the one who went to live upstate?
12646,Bart,"i'm gonna miss you, spit brother."
11310,Bart,"nothing. on tv, when a guy says something lame, another guy says he's a genius, and then he has an idea. i thought it might work for me."
5493,Bart,"eh, she seems nice. i'm gonna go with my gut and trust her."
6181,Bart,is that her?
4959,Bart,cost of paper? five cents. a mother's love? priceless.
3516,Bart,"no, he hasn't. he's more the same than ever. and i know where the evidence is. there's only one place it could possibly be."
3416,Bart,"think about it. i mean, what ""team"" was babe ruth on? who knows?"
5196,Bart,why won't anybody listen to me? i don't have any special powers! i am not a healer!
5503,Bart,"whoa, a badger! sorry man, you can't crash here. c'mon, let's go."
9875,Bart,"now that you're officially my bird, let me fill you in on the pecking order around here."
9981,Bart,"i see how it is. you get a booty call and i get a cootie call. well, it's gonna cost ya."
2321,Bart,"oh, great. i specifically asked not to be seated next to a baby."
8778,Bart,i know! we'll be in another movie -- and this time we'll act really bad!
10444,Bart,"check this out. i'm hiding a bomb in this pile of corpses, so when kearney loots their ammo, he gets a face full of ass shrapnel."
12244,Bart,ah!
836,Bart,"cool, he can teach us how to kill a man with a lunch tray."
5024,Bart,it's a history lesson come to life.
11097,Bart,thank you. i owe it all to zhenya.
7087,Bart,oh man. did she live?
7694,Bart,"i get it, i get it! sucks to be you. goodnight."

6465,Bart,"i can't express how i feel in words, so i drew this picture."
4228,Bart,"hi, guys. hot enough for ya?"
2224,Bart,"no, no, wait. hear my plan. i put up with her for seven more years. then, we'll get married. once the first baby comes along, she's bound to settle down and start treatin' me right. after all, i deserve it."
1631,Bart,i'm blue. time for some of my patented spitting off the overpass.
2925,Bart,no.
7465,Bart,not good enough! kiss!
11150,Bart,"well, my show and tell is that i'm on lisa's body--"
6911,Bart,i'm riding a unicycle with my pants down. this should be every boy's dream.
4608,Bart,"uh, so, dad, regarding that form... why not just make up a middle name?"
6312,Bart,i'm bart and this is lisa.
5748,Bart,he thought that trip to the guillotine factory was just for fun. but it was the perfect place to shoot him.
12982,Bart,"i'm gonna miss you, boy."
11046,Bart,"first, we got every dead bedbug in town."
7965,Bart,let me drive. i go through yellow lights.
9527,Bart,mommm! i have a fever!
6798,Bart,"lis, skinner is using you. like a pawn on his unholy chess set."
4744,Bart,trade you my next turn for your dessert.
7048,Bart,"wait, before you have us killed, hear us out."
690,Bart,aaah!
10892,Bart,"oh yeah, i'm a wreck."
10515,Bart,"no, no, i'm too concerned with unemployment."
7174,Bart,"face it, lis -- men are dogs. the worse we treat you, the more you want us."
8351,Bart,ow! you bit me! my own dog bit me.
9394,Bart,"sorry dude, i didn't see you."
12058,Bart,let's just say i paid the inevitable price for helping out my sister.
2683,Bart,"nah, he's just a cheap imitation of radioactive man."
4249,Bart,"oh, yeah? would a lamewad have the police master key?"
12350,Bart,uh-oh.
8828,Bart,two kinds of irish people? what are they fighting over? who gets to sleep in the bathtub?
8848,Bart,look outside your window.
7243,Bart,party! party! party! party!
11180,Bart,"hey, homer. did you just fart?"
3149,Bart,so it's a choice between disneyworld and knoxville.
3510,Bart,"it's him or me, o lord!"
259,Bart,huh?
3849,Bart,no.
9708,Bart,really? hm. maybe i...

5255,Bart,can it wait? i just got off work!
11963,Bart,woo! woo! i'm up here!
5624,Bart,"forget it, ed. do you know what it costs to sign over a check this big? why, the wealth transfer fee would run at least a hundred dollars a head."
1563,Bart,no. let's send burns the eye in the mail. he'll pay more money if he thinks the bear is in danger.
2853,Bart,"that dummy worked like a charm, dad."
11042,Bart,plagues...
6739,Bart,"lisa, it says one year and up."
64,Bart,"for the last time, yes!"
876,Bart,polly wolly doodle.
5551,Bart,"hey man, this job is too dangerous."
7320,Bart,it's goose!
12029,Bart,"hey, can you believe it, man? my sister here made a whole pile of cupcakes to butter up her teacher, and she won't give anybody else even one measly little crumb!"
9883,Bart,it's getting a little chilly -- i'd better put a blanket on ray.
12514,Bart,"uh maybe... uh, one more dish. make it double cappuccino chocolate fudge."
6077,Bart,"oh, it's okay. my bed is stuffed with hay."
6735,Bart,this is the best year of the rat ever!
12119,Bart,"wow, sounds good to me. okay. i'll sign."
4601,Bart,i don't know... i think dad might be a little heavy for parasailing.
7000,Bart,you don't know him. he lives in russia.
10537,Bart,"you're welcome. and from now on, dad, if anyone laughs at you, they've gotta go through me."
11795,Bart,we've only had a hurricane once!
6975,Bart,milhouse? is that you?
2974,Bart,let's do the fold-in.
10848,Bart,what's up? going crazy again?
12683,Bart,woooooooo!
6860,Bart,why don't we ask your dad?
12085,Bart,"to fight nelson, the bully."
2061,Bart,"but i saw the murder, and then i saw you bury the corpse in the backyard."
1424,Bart,grampa? grampa?
11258,Bart,"sure, dad."
4928,Bart,help! help! fire!... ... helmets.
10178,Bart,i'm really sorry it wasn't a year.
466,Bart,"oh, it's hopeless."
2665,Bart,"big deal. they didn't approve my idea. they said it was ""unfeasible."""
5108,Bart,unless...

10465,Bart,"sure, what've you got? puppy goo-goo comin' my way?"
8893,Bart,again!
4256,Bart,"i can't bail on a friend, even if it is ralph."
5745,Bart,"we were good, dad. they asked us to play in the krusty klassic!"
3699,Bart,you're right. i'll do it.
10746,Bart,now to get my comic book and explore a world where no one's mad at george lucas.
9569,Bart,where's mrs. k.?
7880,Bart,when is our food gonna get here? i'm starved.
11071,Bart,"grampa, we've been spending so much time together, i almost feel like you're part of the family."

2031,Bart,don't turn on that light!!
2966,Bart,"everybody thinks i'm the black sheep. well, i'll show them what a black sheep can do."
1472,Bart,dad! we're running out of clean clothes!
12084,Bart,"okay. we all know why we're here, right?"

9813,Bart,"think bart, think! what was that lesson i learned from videogames? oh yeah, kill, kill, kill!"
6639,Bart,oh. time to repress another memory.

419,Bart,thanks for sticking up for me.
6294,Bart,help me!
5714,Bart,"uh-uh, you gotta be forty inches tall for the adult section."
12439,Bart,"yes, sir."
9966,Bart,and i bet it has something to do with this scar.
1105,Bart,"look, can i please go to the movie?"
10461,Bart,"c'mon, man. a few more balloons and this'll look really awesome."
5896,Bart,big phony!
1819,Bart,kbbl is gonna give me something stupid!
4320,Bart,"anchorman, huh? well, if i'm gonna be an anchorman, i'd better go bleach the crud off my teeth. i'll be in makeup."
6420,Bart,"heads up, dad. here comes the scum!"
131,Bart,"terrible. cars slow down to laugh at me, but no one's buying."
6001,Bart,it's the body!
4102,Bart,one at first. but he'll train others.
12273,Bart,"hey lis, you think that's enough for her?"
13106,Bart,love can really be painful.
9486,Bart,homer! i need you to rickshaw me to soccer practice!
865,Bart,about the frisbee.
5912,Bart,you think you're so great just because you have god-like powers.
4986,Bart,"come to think of it, i haven't seen uter since the last field trip."
398,Bart,"wow, brown!"
1640,Bart,"crank it, homer."
6930,Bart,"okay i've been studying frink's robot, and i've discovered he has one small weak spot."
1781,Bart,"thanks, mom."
37,Bart,no.
12888,Bart,"well, that's what we learned about. i sure as hell can't tell you we learned about hell unless i say hell, can i?"
8306,Bart,"gee moe, you give great advice."
3028,Bart,"no, mom, i can handle it. let's see... pay to the order of... lisa. one cent... and no cents. and now the old john hancock... here you go."
9844,Bart,how do i do that?
2464,Bart,maps to movie stars homes! mapa por las casas de las cineastas! top-u stah noh cheezu map-u!
778,Bart,wouldn't that mean squealing on other kids?
2919,Bart,"hmmm. maybe if i stand next to the games looking sad, someone will feel sorry for me and buy me one."
8118,Bart,"we sure are far from the rest of 'em. funny how that happened, huh?"
11436,Bart,now that's a broken man.
12107,Bart,we got a rhyming dictionary.
11689,Bart,tagged as lassen!
9546,Bart,"dad, i know you're gonna say no, but mom would say..."
12065,Bart,"yeah, - he's pretty chunkified, all right."
6966,Bart,nooo!
11817,Bart,"oh, please. there's only one fat guy that brings us presents and his name ain't santa."
7757,Bart,"well, that sign would look good hidden under my bed."
11812,Bart,are you... a hostess?
10837,Bart,"man, this story is filling in a lot of gaps."
12524,Bart,"what! you can't hold me back. i'll do better, i promise."
9236,Bart,"""break your dream down into smaller 'wishes,' then break those down into 'wish-able actions.'"""
4923,Bart,and what's that?
10644,Bart,"all that happened is we got a little extra vacation, is that so bad!?"
5901,Bart,"hey, i found a bullet."
8804,Bart,now i'm a jack-o-lantern...
5689,Bart,"hey, check it out!"
3673,Bart,uhh...
3877,Bart,sucker!
11910,Bart,os-os.
5647,Bart,"what's the problem, seymour? stuck?"
5933,Bart,"you, there. put your hands up."
1711,Bart,and our portable tv!
7897,Bart,this rocks! no more stupid girl classes -- like ballroom dancing!
1429,Bart,do we have a deal?
4979,Bart,okay. sure.
3590,Bart,"hey, give me some room! watch the elbow, seamus!"
11360,Bart,can i visit him tomorrow?
7624,Bart,"then the zombies will eat you first, and you won't have to watch 'em eat us."
5883,Bart,cool!
11833,Bart,"oh, dad, you're finally home."
11931,Bart,i want to go back to my old class.
8285,Bart,"lis, you can't stay here if you're gonna keep talking."
6657,Bart,they took the bait. let's go.
3179,Bart,"oh, please, no."
8882,Bart,day is awesome!
2914,Bart,i want to buy a copy of bonestorm. here's ninety-nine cents.
12088,Bart,"whoa! whoa! all right, okay. i promise you victory. i promise you good times."
4987,Bart,"well, that's great, dad, except you were supposed to drive us to the newspaper."
7290,Bart,nooo!
1617,Bart,now just turn around and count to three.
7630,Bart,"all right, commercials!"
10567,Bart,now!
13002,Bart,a copy of radioactive man number 27. that's the first time he fights dr. crab. then i wanna buy that baseball card where the guy is flippin' the bird.
9535,Bart,but dad said i had to finish--
8045,Bart,get lost.
2091,Bart,right on!
3225,Bart,"so what's it like being famous, dad?"
4893,Bart,how 'bout here?
10629,Bart,"after this cruise, for the rest of my life, it's all downhill..."
11531,Bart,i can think of worse.
7833,Bart,maybe you could aim a little higher.
7896,Bart,woo hoo! i'm drenched in blood!
4464,Bart,"hang on, dad, this next part'll definitely make you feel better about yourself."
10994,Bart,"what kind of person, indeed?"
4491,Bart,shut up.
10421,Bart,"not me, man. this cycle of jerks has to end."
1971,Bart,what if i can get this guy off the hook. sh-should i do it?
886,Bart,"mom, i thought you might forget our little conversation this afternoon, so i took the precaution of recording it."
1627,Bart,"lis, today i am a god."
12241,Bart,you do?
7935,Bart,"sit on it, springfield! yeah!"
4771,Bart,i suppose.
2087,Bart,leaving her primed for the most traumatic hose-soaking of her life.
6619,Bart,"so? i'll bounce back. i always bounce back -- like after the time i accidentally called the teacher ""mom""."
8267,Bart,that might work too.
3545,Bart,you're dead.
5006,Bart,gotcha.
6113,Bart,but she might say no.
9435,Bart,much better.
11369,Bart,i knew you'd escape! were you carried out by a flock of falcons?
9060,Bart,just don't stretch it out.
6285,Bart,a mosquito?
2245,Bart,"hi, jessica."
11048,Bart,"ugh, one of these bedbugs is still alive!"
6972,Bart,"ralph, we're playing checkers."
8616,Bart,"ah get back to your knitting, seymour."
1121,Bart,hmmm!
9380,Bart,"uh, he was born with two noses and we hid him away till we could afford to cut one off."
10675,Bart,i'm keeping a dolphin in my bathtub!
8291,Bart,"mom, what are you doing in my game?! how would you like it if i suddenly started going shopping with you?"
1479,Bart,uh-oh. that cute little character could take america by storm. all he needs is a hook.
7078,Bart,"well, you do look pretty in the moonlight."
2646,Bart,caution: exit through door seven only. all other rooms contain man-eating tigers.
6728,Bart,get your un-poisoned candy!
10554,Bart,"hey dad, if this is your fantasy world, how come flanders is here?"
12178,Bart,no!
11402,Bart,hey! leave him alone. i too know the pain of hand-me-down underwear.
4944,Bart,i'm having some side effects from the dope.
6615,Bart,he didn't say anything about skinner-in-a-shredder.com.
9198,Bart,"actually, i like it."
1389,Bart,arrrgh!
6102,Bart,prove it. using examples from this room.
91,Bart,do you think the ghost of dirk richter haunts the bordello where his bullet-riddled body was found?
146,Bart,"listen, lady, you don't have to -- yaaauuuuggghhh!"
1876,Bart,"anything, huh? okay... i want pizza, and i want it delivered by krusty the clown."
4462,Bart,"quiet, dad, or we'll have to throw you outta here."
7712,Bart,robot musical revue?
5723,Bart,shhhh. use your indoor voice.
8985,Bart,you're all losers!
12036,Bart,does not.
2816,Bart,it was only a dream.
4740,Bart,wow! you are so much cooler than milhouse's mom.
11970,Bart,mom! mom! wake up!
6842,Bart,"yeah, we'd rather have a live sissy mincing around the house than some dead hero any day."
2525,Bart,i saw you two fighting. i'm worried there could be a strike and the school would shut down.
1282,Bart,let's see if they wore underwear back then.
5849,Bart,that's milhouse.
3421,Bart,i have a watch with a minute hand.
7448,Bart,"oh yeah, it's great. why don't we top it off by reading to old people?"
1214,Bart,mom was pregnant and dad just threw our money down the sink hole.
2633,Bart,"aw. it's no use, milhouse. if we're gonna find that lemon tree, i've got to go undercover. what i need is a new face."
12455,Bart,"aye-aye, mambo man."
3926,Bart,"gimme a ""b""?"
10572,Bart,i gotta go -- he's my ride.
12077,Bart,thanks lady.
8531,Bart,"yeah, yeah, we've all been to england. is this going somewhere?"
3274,Bart,but you'll kill both of us!
10056,Bart,"i don't know who that is, but i'm convinced. let's start cutting."
12331,Bart,"well, okay."
12095,Bart,go! go!
1871,Bart,that explains his mysterious trip to holland.
4235,Bart,"hmmm. wow! dad's been in jail six times. aw, and mom's only been in twice."
11748,Bart,"yo, this is tunnel tag. when you're tagged, you have to spread your legs and freeze."
4706,Bart,this isn't bad.
5109,Bart,thus saving christmas.
2671,Bart,wow!
8871,Bart,you got bart!
11959,Bart,"hey, wendell, you made it, buddy."
10525,Bart,"well, if it's in a gallery, how is it street art?"
3643,Bart,"oh, how come i never get any mail?"
2820,Bart,"you're right. the only thing left to do is to go into my dream and force willie into a final showdown. you stay awake, and if it looks like i'm in trouble, wake me up."
1788,Bart,just what i was gonna say.
2568,Bart,lunchlady doris! why are you here?
7066,Bart,i've lost everything i loved.
12645,Bart,"come on, milhouse. this way we'll be friends forever."
1082,Bart,there must be something to eat around here.
12787,Bart,what?
1323,Bart,"oh yeah? remember this? ""higher, dad, higher!... whee, whee... push harder, dad!..."""
1607,Bart,"eh, shut your yap."
6634,Bart,"go crazy, dorks. i got better things to do."
10750,Bart,"i'm your unwanted son from the future, who killed all your fun!"
7512,Bart,"yeah, but what does not kill me makes me stronger. wow, that was a lot of words -- i need some energy."
3663,Bart,"no, not you -- laddie."
2789,Bart,who?
1735,Bart,i'm bart simpson. i saved you from jail.
2828,Bart,"nuh-uh, 'cause we called it."
1027,Bart,oh baby!
3983,Bart,"oh, aunt selma. always good for a fin. whoa-ho-ho. here we go."
12181,Bart,you mean like we just did?
7826,Bart,why'd i put this in here?
3117,Bart,"look, if money's the only problem, i know a guy who has lots of it."
96,Bart,"all right, homer. whoa, you really are a sport, dad, taking us out to a fine restaurant like krusty burger!"
10965,Bart,nice. time for your final test.
7777,Bart,grampa?!
4599,Bart,check.
4908,Bart,i had an inkling.
11471,Bart,that man sure loved potato salad.
6363,Bart,i'll take kyle!
8796,Bart,"hey, homer! your butt still looks big from down here!"
9809,Bart,"c'mon, man, climb up!"
7239,Bart,oh yeah.
11189,Bart,"mom, lisa's ruining football."
3039,Bart,"well, if it'll make you feel any better, krusty, you can punch me in the face."
5655,Bart,mau! didi mau!
12735,Bart,"yeah, i guess it is."
5576,Bart,i'm just mad all the time.
5222,Bart,"maybe. but if duncan wins the derby, he can spend the rest of his days as a stud."
4361,Bart,i think you're startin' to crack.
507,Bart,"hey, man, you were crushing me. i tried to scream, but my mouth was full of flab."
5229,Bart,"boy, these cars are surprisingly roomy."
6462,Bart,"dad, you bought that, because it was full of gummy worms."
11156,Bart,"yep, that's me. when she's asleep i'm in control."
10442,Bart,i just un-friended skinner!
426,Bart,this could be the start of something big...
8087,Bart,"um, happy birthday, nelson."
10801,Bart,you said we were gonna see somebody get shot!
11406,Bart,where am i?
10362,Bart,"with your share of the money, you could get your own studio apartment..."
11957,Bart,"oh, no."
2457,Bart,dang.
5544,Bart,"well, maybe i should."
5391,Bart,we should be safe up here. i'm pretty sure fires can't climb trees.
7955,Bart,you suck!
4146,Bart,sorry.
9637,Bart,you plant the ants and then they grow?
6154,Bart,i can't wait till i get good.
1379,Bart,"you're goin' down, homer! i'm gonna fool you!"
5966,Bart,"no, it's terrible."
1555,Bart,"dad, start diggin' some nerd holes."

4328,Bart,"joe banks, 82 years young, has come to this pond every day for the past 17 years to feed the ducks. but last month, joe made a discovery. the ducks were gone."
7945,Bart,"die, weapons, die!"
11308,Bart,"hmm, interesting."
3111,Bart,we killed itchy and scratchy?
4229,Bart,that was too close. we gotta stay off the streets.
1503,Bart,to krusty. the greatest entertainer in the world. except maybe that guy.

8716,Bart,oh. i thought she was peeing out of her nipple.
5999,Bart,"oh, sorry."
13111,Bart,"when jenda hears about my great new career, she'll definitely take me back."

926,Bart,"hey, i've got an idea. why don't the three of us go spit on the principal's car?"
697,Bart,how much do those yo-yos cost?
5447,Bart,you don't seem to be trying very hard.
11204,Bart,"i can help, but it's gonna get rough."
4409,Bart,ow!
2827,Bart,good-bye lis. i hope you get reincarnated as someone who can stay awake for fifteen minutes.

6995,Bart,thank god we've come to our senses and worship a carpenter who lived two thousand years ago.
12538,Bart,then it's a deal.
5995,Bart,are you talking about a soul patch?
8505,Bart,"oh yeah? well when you're mean, i'm a trampoline, so everything you said goes back and hits your ugly head."
11814,Bart,"yeah, we are grown up."
4336,Bart,"well, maybe they should have three. i'm bart simpson."
3242,Bart,"lisa? with people? if they're impressed by her, i'm gonna bart their world. okay, milhouse, you know the drill."

10434,Bart,i did it just to mess with your mind.
504,Bart,"hey, dad. here's one. twenty-eight dollars an hour, plenty of fresh air... and you get to meet lots of interesting people."
1032,Bart,like what?
6884,Bart,"mom, can we get a pretzel?"

13125,Bart,"cheer up, milhouse. you got your whole life ahead of you."
10106,Bart,"okay, first i'll send down my shoes."
2799,Bart,"i think lisa's right, dad. eating meat is ba-a-a-ad."
1679,Bart,"look, homer won't want to go, so just ask him, and he'll say no. then it'll be his fault."
160,Bart,really?
3884,Bart,lisa simpson!
1504,Bart,oh boy! free trading cards!

1719,Bart,"jawohl, mein mommandant."
8913,Bart,"my father's name is homer... my mother's name is mom... my sister's name is lisa, but everyone calls her loser."
10649,Bart,"they spend all their time trying to raise a baby, and why? so it can grow up and do the same dumb thing on and on forever!"
142,Bart,"ugh, i think i'd rather just get to work, ma'am."
7083,Bart,i'm screwed.
7536,Bart,"yeah, 'cause we're through with vegetables. from now on, i'm only eating food that i know had a soul."
11068,Bart,time for your meds.
6459,Bart,"okay, there's a lot of low cards in that hand. but since we're both free, why don't you and me hit the town?"
1674,Bart,hmmm...
3361,Bart,"all right, dad, you've been warned. let's go."
2686,Bart,"well, between us we've read all 814 issues of radioactive man."

6359,Bart,"canada's governors general: ""clowns love haircuts; so should lee marvin's valet."""
2427,Bart,"hey, g.i. joe, your sign's broken. we're already in australia."
4194,Bart,"hey, i'm gonna go toss the virtual salad!"

7601,Bart,die! die! die!
977,Bart,"ah sure, there'll be a couple of uptight counselors who won't dig the bart philosophy, but i feel the human body is a thing of beauty."

6186,Bart,"grampa, look over there."
5327,Bart,"yeah, but they said i wouldn't get my first check for two weeks! meanwhile, they're making major interest on my salary. hey, maybe i can sue 'em."
12747,Bart,aha.
2823,Bart,hey lawn-boy! you missed a spot!
4119,Bart,"after careful deliberation, it's my opinion that milhouse probably did eat the food. but since there's no proof, i must find him not guilty."
5100,Bart,i want to see how this turns out.
11126,Bart,the sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side.
8036,Bart,"krusty, what's that monster?"
157,Bart,"listen lady, i can leave without screaming, and i can leave without saying a bad word, but there's no way that i am saying thank you."
12428,Bart,"i don't think so, sir."
12193,Bart,"g-g-good night, d-dad."
3320,Bart,"yeah, sure, we know him. that's mr. burns."

7575,Bart,"i didn't do it! mom, you believe me, don't you?"
3997,Bart,"hooks for hands. um, oh, uh, and he was wearing a striped convict shirt. and he was carrying a big sack with a dollar sign on it."
5357,Bart,"dude, i know. and i left a message with some guy named hans."
7580,Bart,now you tell me.
1538,Bart,"well, there is one, but..."
9184,Bart,"now to turn my sis from ""loser"" to ""schmoozer."""
10541,Bart,"as a graffiti artist, there're so many people to thank... people who build walls... nighttime, for being dark..."

3702,Bart,"excuse me, sir. did you repossess this dog from a guy named santos l. halper?"
8470,Bart,is it that you're brother and sister? because you really look a lot alike.
7279,Bart,"hey, i got a loose tooth."
5509,Bart,"hey, todd! can we borrow your woodpecker?"

6816,Bart,next!
5808,Bart,"oh, why did i get this lego shirt?"
10509,Bart,i like it in the cage. these cedar shavings are a helluva lot better than my lumpy mattress.
11154,Bart,not the pony dream again!
10497,Bart,you sure this is a good idea?
6938,Bart,"yeah! any poindexter can throw some nuts and bolts together -- you risked your own life, even though you're the sole provider for a family of five! i am the luckiest kid in the world."
4099,Bart,whatever. just tell wendell i said bye.
3723,Bart,"c'mon, santa's little helper! i'm sorry i ever let you go! pick me! please pick me!"
5305,Bart,"then please, help me help myself."

3309,Bart,"i was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but you guys asked for it..."
3998,Bart,"hey, since when is christmas just about the presents? aren't we forgetting the true meaning of this day? the birth of santa?"
8819,Bart,"""...was mistakenly minted in december of 1917, when a brief glimpse of a woman's ankle caused three days of rioting at the philadelphia mint."""
7210,Bart,"lis, i've learned a valuable lesson here: the pen is mightier than the flaming bag of poop."
3527,Bart,nooo!
10829,Bart,santa's little helper! santa's little helllper!
1866,Bart,"i just don't want to be here, dad. besides, i started a fire this morning that i really should keep an eye on."
4647,Bart,"dad, over here!"
7391,Bart,wait a minute. why do we have to come clean? nobody's been hurt. everyone's happier with the lie.
1661,Bart,"i'd love to stay, but this uniform carries certain responsibilities."
2274,Bart,hey! it's a free country. you get out.
4742,Bart,"oh, quit complaining. it's half the work of the divorced dad."
6229,Bart,why does danger dog mean more to me than school or church?
5976,Bart,make a hole.
2199,Bart,"um, actually, numbers don't have much use in my future career. olympic gold medal rocket sled champ."
6721,Bart,you haven't seen your dad in years.
2115,Bart,"yeah, but it's just pretend violence, which is actually beneficial for children."
9374,Bart,there must be some reason no one ever adopted you. is one of your feet a hand?

9142,Bart,"look, man. i have to keep my dark past hidden. there's someone new in my life now."
1247,Bart,"dad, there's a bug on that."
4294,Bart,"come on, dad. didn't you ever do anything wild when you were a kid?"
5643,Bart,this stinks. we'll miss the itchy and scratchy where they finally kiss.
10337,Bart,"yeah, just have fun -- dad would."
11716,Bart,"all right, i'm sick of waiting."
9867,Bart,"me? just what in my long, sad history with frogs makes you think i can take care of a bird?"
6454,Bart,"grampa, quick, tell me everything you know about world war one!"
10540,Bart,"art lovers and bart lovers! first of all, i'd like to thank the good folks at springfield arts daily for setting this up."
9428,Bart,"larry, you saved my life! you're the most wonderful stuffed lamb in the world! i'm sorry about the mean things i said. we'll have the rest of the weekend to--"
1908,Bart,"boys and girls, mrs. krabappel, i come before you today to solve a riddle that has plagued mankind for centuries -- what has four legs and ticks?"
8511,Bart,mr. and mrs. van houten!
7372,Bart,i still do.
12349,Bart,a cherry bomb! i thought i blew all you guys up.
7639,Bart,i'll just leave it here in the dog's mouth.
10681,Bart,"""lisa doesn't judge other people. why should we judge her?"" it's signed, ""truth teller."""
6225,Bart,what's a telegram?
12110,Bart,bring it on home now.
12008,Bart,"if you really want to impress her, show her the big empty space where our tv used to be."
4765,Bart,"come on, dad, just twelve more pounds."
1205,Bart,beep.
12440,Bart,hey! donuts!
12793,Bart,"wow, man! thanks, lance."
553,Bart,"well, i picked it up somewhere. and if i drive martin's car i can win. i'm sorry, but..."
5598,Bart,people. i guess they thought i was a charity case.
2550,Bart,"well, then. i guess i'll just have to get into the crawl space again."
5981,Bart,what's stopping you?
9306,Bart,ow!
9736,Bart,i'm a slow reader!
890,Bart,"i'll tell you the truth, dad. i wasn't good at it right away, so i quit. i hope you're not mad."
1922,Bart,"uh, i thought i heard someone say your name in the cafeteria, but they might've been saying ""skim milk."""
5614,Bart,"my bar mitzvah cake! oy, i'll never be a man!"
1297,Bart,that could be dad... station wagon... luggage rack...
7408,Bart,"so, lis, ready for your trip?"
8577,Bart,cut it out!
8339,Bart,that was never my plan.
7665,Bart,nooo!!!!!
12067,Bart,"you mean i should fight dirty, dad?"
3252,Bart,see?! that's my expression!
12650,Bart,"well, i guess it's back to good old springfield."
4616,Bart,"if you're gonna get snippy, i'll take my business elsewhere."
6924,Bart,"dad, it was so great -- knockahomer really took a pounding but then he won!"
6184,Bart,is that her?
8877,Bart,"i can do anything i want! first i'm gonna take a bath, then i'm gonna eat some vegetables, and then i'm gonna get to bed nice and early with no tv."
1660,Bart,"um, mrs. krabappel...?"
9815,Bart,this stupid thing never works.
2200,Bart,"well no offense, lady, but what you don't know could fill a warehouse."
4829,Bart,"it wasn't easy, but i got all the grizzlies."
6992,Bart,"okay, shake."
6943,Bart,i'm gonna taunt the ph.d's.
3368,Bart,"hello, i'm dr. hibbert. i'm afraid i'm going to have to amputate your butt."
12949,Bart,i thought your car was really cool.
376,Bart,you ain't seen nothin'. now beat it.
1069,Bart,"kolchak, mannix, banacek, danno!"
8233,Bart,"whoa! you've got ""d.k.c.2.d.k.s.""? that one's rated ""bad for everyone""!"
10215,Bart,psst! mrs. k!
9851,Bart,"mom, thanks to you, this box sucker didn't beat me up!"
1189,Bart,"you are fully bonded and licensed by the city, aren't you mr. plow?"
9331,Bart,huh?
8455,Bart,i thought we were supposed to do this together.
5398,Bart,i'm betting it's hunger and rage.
5171,Bart,"well, to be honest, yes."
8810,Bart,"""the inverted double-struck penny, or 'kissing lincolns'..."""
2306,Bart,"did you know they're real, but there's a huge government conspiracy to cover it up?"
7433,Bart,"well, i bet they miss me."
10018,Bart,"i love visiting you at work, dad."
8095,Bart,"um, nelson, i was just thinking about us being ""best friends."""
11930,Bart,"lord, no."
10334,Bart,"i hate it when grown-ups call kids ""gang."""
4851,Bart,that's the prize?! a banana?
5482,Bart,"you're missing the best part, sister. forget that stupid book."
5969,Bart,"i know you are, but what am i?"
7710,Bart,batting cage?
11874,Bart,"uh-oh, kwyjibo on the loose!"
12230,Bart,but sneaking into a movie is practically stealing man.
9301,Bart,hungry. so hungry. there's nothing to eat. except this.
89,Bart,"wow, i guess he wasn't killed in vietnam."
3639,Bart,"i'm outta here. skinny, krabby, catch ya later."
9120,Bart,"hey, do you want to go on a picnic tomorrow? you'd love my p.b. and j. the secret is, no p.b., double j."
8372,Bart,sweet. now i'm gonna need some wheels.
2738,Bart,that's because she can't talk.
10425,Bart,"we don't need dental floss either, mom."
4085,Bart,does anyone here like food?
3994,Bart,uh huh. uh huh. uh huh.

9914,Bart,just point me to santa.
9261,Bart,whoa. maybe some punk kid will shoot me to get into a gang.
11860,Bart,"look, dad. it's santa's little helper."
9445,Bart,snap out of it! you're krusty the clown! one of look magazine's hundred most-promising clowns of nineteen fifty-eight!
2580,Bart,five hundred dollars on red.
12006,Bart,the fat guy on tv?
474,Bart,heh heh heh...jackpot!
2936,Bart,"so we're just going to do this photo and get out, right? ba-da-bing ba-da-boom?"
5679,Bart,that bob.
5874,Bart,her pillow's stuck.
12385,Bart,"aw, forget it. i'm so stupid. anybody could have learned this dumb language by now. here i've listened to nothing but french for the past deux mois, et je ne sais pas un mot. eh! mais, je parle francois maintenant. incroyable!"
2135,Bart,but it would be funny to someone who was watching us.
3256,Bart,grammar rodeo -- head buccaroo.
8375,Bart,"son of a beach ball, they're gone!"
4669,Bart,yeah. just look at 'em over there...
12657,Bart,all right!
3790,Bart,"i'm sorry i froze you out, lis. i--i just didn't want the guys to think i'd gone soft on the girl issue."
8377,Bart,what? who is this?
8504,Bart,shut up! i don't love milhouse.
9334,Bart,there's no way that runs on electricity.
980,Bart,always thinking two moves ahead.
4466,Bart,"top of the world, ma!"
12829,Bart,"hey, cool. i'm dead."
12309,Bart,"lady, where's my spy camera? where's my spy camera? where is my spy camera, lady? where is my spy camera? where's my spy camera? where's my spy camera?"
2298,Bart,it's just hard not to listen to tv. it's spent so much more time raising us than you have.
10710,Bart,dadgummit! do you think she still likes me?
647,Bart,my name is timmy o'toole. i just turned ten years old.
8989,Bart,stupid angry mob... chasing me because i shine a harsh light on modern society. now i know how dane cook feels.
12228,Bart,you don't need an introduction. you're the worst kid in school.
2726,Bart,"hey, how come i get lice and nothing happens to milhouse?"
8719,Bart,you're the greatest cow in the world! i'm gonna be your friend forever!
6551,Bart,i'm gonna die in my jammies!
9657,Bart,i don't even remember if dylan's a boy or a girl.
6015,Bart,fine.
610,Bart,"wow, best eight bucks i ever spent."
12109,Bart,one more time.
4899,Bart,isn't this that cartoon that causes seizures?
2607,Bart,"hey, gonna win some this season?"
12367,Bart,"little breeze seems to whisper louise / birds in the trees seem to louise / la la la la / la la la la ooo la la... how much longer, sir?"
10878,Bart,mrs. krabappel? are you a... teacher of the night?
3910,Bart,cool!
12086,Bart,that guy's been tormenting all of us for years. and i for one am sick of it.
9871,Bart,you and i have shared too many seed bells to just walk away from this.
7401,Bart,"well, all you can do now is wait for some other guys to turn."
2763,Bart,geez. you're pretty uppity for someone who eats bugs all day.
5593,Bart,"yeah, and a good dad wouldn't miss his son's little league games!"
12189,Bart,"yeah, man."
5203,Bart,what about the people on the bottom?
7951,Bart,"you can take off the wig, milhouse."
11568,Bart,"...saw everything you did! milhouse is the hero! take it from me, the boy who's lied throughout!"
12017,Bart,arrrgh!
8673,Bart,it's lisa kudrow.
5719,Bart,we'll never sell these. birds won't even use them in their nests.
12500,Bart,"okay, no reason to panic. find an egghead, pump him for some answers, and boom, i'm back on easy street."
796,Bart,"yeah, but even i had my limits. you're looking at expulsion for this."
11552,Bart,i brought you a cake. read it.
1086,Bart,"stick around, mr. bond. things are really starting to ""cook."""
10650,Bart,but the slide's just like our cruise! a short awesome thing that just shows you how boring the rest of your life is!
7420,Bart,"yes, chief wiggum."
4421,Bart,ow! that had a guide pin in it.
3068,Bart,"now get cracking on my long division. and don't forget to show your work, simpson."
9363,Bart,you're right -- i can't risk another girl. use whatever birth control you want. it's your body.
4722,Bart,"i hope you're happy, nelson."
36,Bart,"ah, dad, if just me, milhouse and lewis had voted..."
6216,Bart,"hey look, there's copacabana beach. the heart and soul or rio."
8021,Bart,i brought you breakfast in bed.
3603,Bart,"we're at what now, three?"
7222,Bart,i gotta be honest -- i don't see what all the hubbub is about.
5694,Bart,what about jags?
5811,Bart,"no i don't, that's the problem."

1099,Bart,"hey, where is she?"
8723,Bart,"mom, they're gonna kill lou and make him into food and fringe vests for gay cowboys. can we buy him back? can we?"
8537,Bart,i'm not sad. i have nothing to be sad about. nothing!

9121,Bart,"yes!!! willie, i've got a girlfriend!"
4020,Bart,i hate to dance and prance and sing / that's really more of a millhouse thing!
3508,Bart,"don't you see what you've done? sideshow bob hasn't reformed! he's pure evil! oh, if only you knew what he was thinking..."
9522,Bart,good guy...

3047,Bart,"krusty?! doctor hibbert, who was that man?"
9759,Bart,what? why?
7687,Bart,what are you talking about?
5147,Bart,can we get a room with a view?
400,Bart,"my best friend shafted me. i'll never get over this, otto-man."
9072,Bart,but kicking is the only toy i have.
11652,Bart,"sayonara, sucker!"
11756,Bart,"you did it, homer! you saved me from the bullies! you're the coolest kid i ever met."
11566,Bart,milhouse! this is my chance to make things right!
443,Bart,no!
12479,Bart,any questions?
7349,Bart,it's all in this book.
10669,Bart,want my advice on dealing with the hardly boys?
2734,Bart,but it's only 7 o'clock.
3957,Bart,"it's probably a million years old, dad. i think it's as valuable as it's gonna get."
1978,Bart,fat kids...
7503,Bart,i saw you talking to yourself.
11533,Bart,hmm. nobody likes jazz that much. even the guy playin' it had to take drugs.
10676,Bart,prank you! prank you very much!
2308,Bart,"listen to this. ""unexplainable behavior. individuals acting in a secretive fashion are often involved with ufos, or other paranormal phenomena, e.g. telephone explosions."""

8017,Bart,"""his,"" eh? hmm, so it's a dude."
7158,Bart,"c'mon, pie man, hit him! that's the only reason anyone came to this stupid thing!"
6288,Bart,i don't feel so good. can you take me to the hospital?
5666,Bart,one of which?
930,Bart,"all right, milhouse. you can use my tree house."
11098,Bart,"zhenya, i couldn't have done it without you. and you."
12381,Bart,"you're a policeman, aren't you?"
4681,Bart,constable wiggum likes to act tough. but he also likes to walk the beat in control-top pantyhose?
4276,Bart,"that's it! ralph, you're a genius!"
1641,Bart,"keep cool, simpson. be in the game, but not of the game."
3611,Bart,"eh, i gave my oysters to the cat."

5819,Bart,aw darn. looks like we'll have to stay home today.
12711,Bart,yeah.
6671,Bart,isn't this dangerous?
2684,Bart,"the similarities are subtle, but many. for example, radioactive man has his famous catchphrase ""up and atom"" - with atom spelled a-t-o-m in a delicious pun..."
10064,Bart,"my lame-o sister, lisa."
8050,Bart,"uh, paw."

10795,Bart,"okay, but when i grow up and i'm living on your couch, and i drink all your booze, and sell your jewelry, you gotta be cool."
5433,Bart,are you saying he's right on the other side of that plant?
6062,Bart,whatever.

681,Bart,you hate dad is up by a touchdown.
279,Bart,"hey, michael. what happened to your voice?"

6905,Bart,"dad, no! think of the bike."
11734,Bart,dad said i could try it.
6223,Bart,"as long as you're doin' things for me, would you tie up your bathrobe when you walk around the house."
10204,Bart,but it's summertime -- the ice bridge will be a water nothing.
11370,Bart,were falcons involved in any way?

12716,Bart,bitchin'!
10453,Bart,um... well... this is usually the part where you say you're sorry.
7451,Bart,i'm on it.
1060,Bart,"chapter eight, ""let's talk zombies..."" if a zombie bites you, you become a zombie. you must walk the earth feeding on the brains of the living until the spell is broken."

12297,Bart,"aw, come on, dad. get the lead out."
9081,Bart,classic hose-play.
12622,Bart,"well, this is my day and we do, sir."
10312,Bart,"well, we gotta come up with something. hey, what if we make some kind of robo-pet?"
4559,Bart,"hey, you're right. i call the front seat!"
12808,Bart,"but, dad, you'll never make it."
3599,Bart,"uh, dad..."
295,Bart,nothing.
3791,Bart,"but if you quit, it'll be like an expert knot-tier quitting a knot-tying contest right in the middle of tying a knot!"
6019,Bart,"how 'bout judaism? when you turn thirteen, cha-ching."
7413,Bart,feel free to make a rubbing.

1406,Bart,"dad, it's may 16th."
12448,Bart,a little pre-dinner entertainment...
12674,Bart,"lisa, we can't afford all these books."
8934,Bart,"eh, you lost me. well, gotta go -- enjoy the upper-lower middle class!"
391,Bart,"""to me bestest bud milhouse, happy birthday, bart."""
9859,Bart,"look, i know you're cool now, but my dad hates you more than celery, and my mom said no new pets -- so i'm hiding you in my room."
4486,Bart,you mean the wild mood swings?
6757,Bart,do you realize what this means?
1949,Bart,aye carumba!
7649,Bart,"you'd better hope not, 'cause you know what comes next? your worst nightmare: a baby sister."
10944,Bart,not bad for a movie dog.
4998,Bart,are you a zombie?
6295,Bart,everyone's staring at me.
3373,Bart,"jeez, sorry. it's a pretty standard stunt, homer."
7044,Bart,"dear randall curtis, your movie stunk smelly butt. i am fine. sincerely..."

11594,Bart,"look, i'll drink another glass of milk."
10458,Bart,"milhouse, you're the closest thing i have to a brother. a brother with the wisdom of an older sister. and that's why we squabble, 'cause families always do. but in the end, they're still a family. what do you say... brother?"
2578,Bart,cool!
6172,Bart,"well, there's krusty, itchy, scratchy, poochie, america's firefighters and then you, dad."
1102,Bart,"come on, go nuts."

7501,Bart,"hey dad, remember when you said if i used a chainsaw unsupervised i'd hurt myself? well, you were wrong. i hurt someone else."
238,Bart,"yes. ""are you quick to anger?"""
10611,Bart,it's okay. i don't have much of an appetite tonight. i'm going to floor.
8623,Bart,and it's all gonna go down in skinner's office.

10547,Bart,"i can't believe you got all your friends in trouble, and you got the day off!"
10315,Bart,awww.
13036,Bart,"no, you're the tail!"
3875,Bart,oh! ow! uh!
7868,Bart,"help me, cameraman! i let you smoke a cigarette in my bedroom."

3266,Bart,did you guys hear something moving around in the attic last night?
4707,Bart,right. coincidence.
12728,Bart,"here you go, doll face."
1885,Bart,beats me. but it won't be back for three hours and forty minutes. once it had snow on it.
959,Bart,"oh how do i know this isn't some beautiful dream, too?"
2444,Bart,s'allright?
7543,Bart,"hell, i'll even go shoe shopping."

766,Bart,"oh, baby!"
9803,Bart,"here, i'll be the demon, you be the thimble."
346,Bart,you're making me lick envelopes?

11961,Bart,"oh, okay. i thought you were puttin' him down."
10955,Bart,"don't worry, all i need is a cigarette lighter and some sandpaper."

1096,Bart,see ya in the funny pages.
1575,Bart,"ooh, i hope this is sweat."
3634,Bart,"obviously, you two have no experience causing a scene."
6316,Bart,can't i at least incite further...
10613,Bart,i woke up and the money jar was full! that means the devil accepted my bargain. now to uphold my end of the deal!
3734,Bart,"thank you, lord, for delivering us from reverend lovejoy!"
4667,Bart,energy shortage.
11580,Bart,"i'm gonna prove you did groundbreaking work. krusty, i want you to binge-watch all the shows you've ever done."

9206,Bart,"maybe mrs. k would be nicer if we ""irish"" up her coffee."
616,Bart,"cool, larry the looter!"
6026,Bart,i thought we were caroling.
5446,Bart,"so, any words for the bride and groom?"
7628,Bart,"pay the man, homer."
1428,Bart,didn't you wonder why you were getting checks for doing absolutely nothing?
10448,Bart,what gives? he's not crawlin' back.
9515,Bart,"then they should've called it the ""above-ground normal-road."""
10533,Bart,"oh, this is just a dream. all i have to do is wake up."
11263,Bart,bless you.
6782,Bart,"i'll save you, dad!"

7859,Bart,whoa! this oreo is rank.
3499,Bart,"dad, are you hurt?"
7277,Bart,there's no cut on your cheek...
6579,Bart,"finally, a simpson has a trophy without a bowling ball on it."
4673,Bart,"oh no, it won't."
440,Bart,"krusty, do you think about your father a lot?"
392,Bart,"c'mon, open it open it open it."
3141,Bart,"gentlemen, for our road trip, i have taken the liberty of preparing an airtight and utterly plausible alibi for use on our parents..."

2689,Bart,"i'm practicing my fallout boy dialogue. if i get this role, i could finally come to terms with this funny little muddle called bart."
9271,Bart,"mom, you can't fight that guy."
11450,Bart,we outlaws have to stick together.
10940,Bart,"spuckler mary, please forgive me / all i ask is one more chance..."
6100,Bart,"greta, is this how it is?"
1651,Bart,"new york is that-a-way, man."
3996,Bart,"well, he had a glass eye, a wooden leg, um... big scar on his cheek..."

3003,Bart,"helloooo, mr. bush!"
9626,Bart,quit going for my groin!

4678,Bart,no! we have to reach people whose opinions actually matter. and i think i know how. why don't we...
11667,Bart,let this be a lesson: never throw meaningless crap in a time capsule.
7027,Bart,but they stretched out the plot and added a wildebeest... from the hood!
743,Bart,what's that? a home-made bat?
10304,Bart,"no, the science fair's not till next week!"
2573,Bart,"if it helps, i believe that after you die, you can come back as whatever you want. i'll be a butterfly."
12635,Bart,"lousy, washed-up, broken-down... old tub of guts... who does he think he is anyway..."
11234,Bart,"to avoid temptation, i'm getting rid of all the things that could get me in trouble at school. i buried all my whoopee cushions in the back yard."

11429,Bart,"man, krusty should get some of these letters."
6282,Bart,"what's your nostalgia prize, grampa?"

244,Bart,the michael jackson? no way!
10441,Bart,jimbo heard me say it. i'm dead.
1352,Bart,allow me to demonstrate.
7132,Bart,lisa made me! with a witch's spell!

12460,Bart,"you know what happens. they find captain kook's treasure, all the elves dance around like little green idiots, i puke, the end."
3161,Bart,"no!! they'd kill us! look, we got here on our own, so we can survive here on our own. all we need is money, food, and a way to get home. follow me."

9817,Bart,"wait, wait! we still get one more letter!"
10083,Bart,i've got some stuff to put a smile on that corpse.
630,Bart,we have captured your president. he was delicious.
2627,Bart,"okay, here's how it goes. i'm the leader. milhouse is my loyal sidekick. nelson is the tough guy, martin's the smart guy and todd's the quiet religious guy who ends up goin' crazy. and now, the time has come to cross this line into mystery and danger. to step out of childhood and become men."
2231,Bart,"jessica, what are you doing!"
1734,Bart,no.
6980,Bart,"hey, moldilocks. mom says i'm supposed to help you."

10301,Bart,who cares? i'll be president of hell by then.
9528,Bart,i don't want to talk about it.
10161,Bart,"that's a lot of zeros! you know, all this truffle hunting has made me a little thirsty. can we go home now?"
5044,Bart,it does. but it's smooth and mild. and refreshingly addictive.
7195,Bart,but i don't hate this country.
6665,Bart,"good. security officer, anything on scope?"
1572,Bart,"krusty visits relatives in annapolis, maryland..."

7714,Bart,bathroom?
7283,Bart,no problem.
9067,Bart,"yeah, without the sun, my hair's reverting to its natural red."
8909,Bart,woosterfield? your family owns this place! and woosterfield arena! bonnie raitt played there! you guys must be loaded!

6529,Bart,does it make him cry?
9297,Bart,let's just say... he owes me a favor.
1342,Bart,i'm prepared to make that sacrifice.
9986,Bart,sure.
7733,Bart,shut up! i don't want your stupid sweatshirt! or your tea set!
11532,Bart,"the saddest thing would be if you were driving and texting lisa, and you hit her. and the last thing she texted, before she died, was ""i got your message."" g'night."
11949,Bart,"hey, otto. hey, ottoman."
7316,Bart,hey!
10846,Bart,"we tricked you! / eat nerf, homeboy!"
9640,Bart,"don't worry. i gave 'em a pop tart. the healthy kind, strawberry-frosted."
3577,Bart,i'm afraid you'll hurt me again!
8833,Bart,i wish i had a cell phone.
6970,Bart,it is not ralph.
5132,Bart,polo!
8776,Bart,monsters! monsters! monsters!

1508,Bart,"dad, thanks to television, i can't remember what happened eight minutes ago."
1220,Bart,krusty funny.
6813,Bart,let's see someone claim that money now.
3006,Bart,"whoa, man."
9151,Bart,but now i'm good because you turned me good. isn't that all that matters?
10527,Bart,"first, i'm not sure you have the shoulders for it, and second, maybe we've pushed this far enough."
4619,Bart,"meh, it's not worth it."
7991,Bart,says you!
8067,Bart,a-yup.
8698,Bart,daddy's back and she's feelin' like she oughter!

6093,Bart,"oh, man. what a dork."
12150,Bart,"put up your dukes, homer."
2793,Bart,"oh lis, thank you."
6393,Bart,"milhouse, if you're uncomfortable with this in any way... do it, otto! do it! do it! do it!"
12466,Bart,go ahead. take 'em all.

6122,Bart,a shiny new dime!
3738,Bart,"hey, if they got a picture of you, that means they can see you. they're probably watching us right now."
1691,Bart,the beauty of it is each parking space is a mere one foot narrower. indistinguishable to the naked eye. but therein lies the game.
11972,Bart,"don't do it, dad!"
5439,Bart,no way.
78,Bart,i wonder how richie died?

6506,Bart,whoa! check out janeane giraffe-alo.
3414,Bart,"oh, cheer up, mom. you can't buy publicity like that. thousands and thousands of people saw your pretzels injuring whitey ford."
7462,Bart,duh! it's kamper kong.
5239,Bart,do you even have a job anymore?
5916,Bart,"hey, hey, you made your sale."

10856,Bart,i've got to be honest with you. it was just a bag of rice i drew a face on.
4135,Bart,"well, if you're running the show, how could you leave out, krusty the clown?"

8166,Bart,"my last words are ""lisa suuuucks""!"
6409,Bart,"listen, i have a plan that will make the world fall in love with krusty the clown again."
1882,Bart,no! this family stinks. mr. burns nurtures my destructive side. i'm suffocating here.
650,Bart,"i was trying to gnaw my foot off, but i couldn't get through my sock. goodnight everybody."
6764,Bart,thanks. i just washed them.
2854,Bart,whuth va hell ith going on heah?!
11311,Bart,"i hate this stupid holiday! the only thing you can do is screw it up. that's it! bart, you're a genius!"
9969,Bart,"you leave me no choice. i hold in my hands a mint-condition copy of the legendary ""interesting stories number twenty-seven."""
6445,Bart,"okay, time to start this paper. world war one. w.w. one. well, that's a good start. time to watch wrestling!"
11006,Bart,"honest abe, can i pin him?"
6247,Bart,"uh, it's a composite character -- your dad, my dad, a little of maggie's dad..."
9706,Bart,"i know he doesn't look like him, but i'll never forget that voice!"
11995,Bart,"kiss you? but, dad, i'm your kid!"
12360,Bart,all the time.

5400,Bart,mom! lisa's growing!
2078,Bart,"lis, i did some checkin' on this allison character and i know it's against all your moral fibers..."
660,Bart,no!
4446,Bart,"dad, all that bacon cost twenty-seven dollars."

2330,Bart,"we can? thanks, mom."
6059,Bart,there she is!
9713,Bart,we need a third maid. maybe someone will step in and help.
4814,Bart,"i'm not afraid of you, goliath. before i was arrogant. but now, my heart is humble, and my spirit is..."
7384,Bart,"milhouse, if you tell anyone, i'll tell the world you wet your pants watching harry potter."
7937,Bart,oh... so that's why everyone's been sayin' that all summer.
12653,Bart,"play it where it lays, homer."
9194,Bart,"ooh, twelve cents. i'll take eight!"
11136,Bart,can we have some candy?
8359,Bart,he is so awesome. i already love him more than i love lisa.
12681,Bart,piece of cake.
2277,Bart,"if you get hit, it's your own fault."
1493,Bart,i didn't know you knew luke perry!
109,Bart,no.
5345,Bart,"well, if my country needs me... can we skinny-dip?"
11405,Bart,this family has had a lot of hoods put over their heads.
6854,Bart,"don't worry, i know just what to do."
2013,Bart,"so long, lis. i'm gonna stow away underwater, and go where the pool goes. have a good life."
1162,Bart,oh no. you're in texas!
4116,Bart,"i remind you, we are not here to debate the existence of monsters."
10450,Bart,milhouse!
668,Bart,yeah mom?
9254,Bart,what discussion?
4767,Bart,don't you have work?
2983,Bart,"oh! there's something i used to do in this situation, but... can't... remember..."
2409,Bart,uhh... hold please.
3992,Bart,"i don't know how to tell you this, but... i came down a little early and... um... well... uh..."
1030,Bart,"and later i'll teach you the tricks of the trade: taping your swimsuit to your butt, petroleum jelly on your teeth for that frictionless smile, and the ancient art of padding ."
6000,Bart,"it's us, the simpsons."
9965,Bart,something drove them apart once before...
10582,Bart,what could a girl have that i--
8570,Bart,the system works!
11198,Bart,ay carumba!
7731,Bart,"um, well..."
8129,Bart,you mean...

7902,Bart,"i'm gonna call you ""toilet."""
10658,Bart,this is a happy ending?
9000,Bart,"look guys, everyone's different. jimbo, you're christian. dolph, you're jewish. and kearney, your family's in that cult moe started."
5359,Bart,"what happened to you, china? you used to be cool."
5142,Bart,"yeah, that sounds right."
3979,Bart,owww! i'll kill you!
3947,Bart,nothing yet.
6599,Bart,"krusty, i can't believe you're giving up. i thought you'd make a difference, that's why i voted for you."
361,Bart,"oh... i dunno... mixing drinks, picking horses, cuttin' cigars... you know -- a job."
8579,Bart,oh fine.
10756,Bart,my dad is artie ziff?
12207,Bart,"aw, dad."

4753,Bart,race ya!
9862,Bart,come back! i'm not finished giving you your bath!
227,Bart,lisa did it.
12078,Bart,"hi, grampa!"
6659,Bart,don't-really-care-just-terribly-caught-up-in-moment!
4677,Bart,she's right! homer's done a ton of crap that never made the papers.
1613,Bart,i will never get tired of this.
8998,Bart,"whoa, whoa, whoa! you can't just whale on him because he's... what religion are you anyway?"
10500,Bart,"come on, man, we wouldn't leave you behind."
596,Bart,that's because i forgot to stamp it.
8449,Bart,why did you come to our world?
6603,Bart,at last those planes are flying where they belong.
7847,Bart,i need an operation?
4005,Bart,hit the brakes! / floor it! / stop! / to the left! / head back!
7484,Bart,you're gay for moleman!
13030,Bart,"aw, dad. it's just a popularity contest."
8147,Bart,"nicely done, lis. instead of killing living things, they're just killing trees."
12563,Bart,"no, you don't understand. i really tried this time. i really tried."
2450,Bart,"i don't like wearing tights, ma'am."
1762,Bart,"uh... i never thought i'd say this, but shouldn't we be learning something?"
2569,Bart,"look, my stomach really hurts."
1601,Bart,rock the casbah!
9332,Bart,fine. i'll see what's on tv.
8409,Bart,"hey dad, have fun with your boyfriend."
7370,Bart,"sorry, fiddy. i have school tomorrow."
2587,Bart,oh yeah? take a look at this:
1158,Bart,o-kay.
8916,Bart,"driver, laugh at those people for me."
6562,Bart,"thanks dad, that means a lot to me."
4894,Bart,"look mom, they have your dress."
3767,Bart,i want candy!
2781,Bart,"well, finally, a little luck."
5678,Bart,i'unno.
4200,Bart,"look out, ralph!"
9957,Bart,cowabungaaa--
12801,Bart,"ah, nothing."
8340,Bart,"don't worry! our dog'll find my dad! we need you, boy!"
5686,Bart,that trash can must have unkinked your back.
7836,Bart,care to concede that bet?
7927,Bart,we've got to tell dad!
12401,Bart,"oh... oh! krusty, how could you?"
11250,Bart,"we have a problem, seymour."
10803,Bart,then you explain that.
1340,Bart,"you're right, lis. you shouldn't go. it wouldn't be honest. i'll go, disguised as you."
5188,Bart,heal. heal...
9097,Bart,"yeah, instead of exhausted zombies running down the clock."
5123,Bart,stomp that pickle revert!
8946,Bart,heard what?
12607,Bart,"way to go, lis."
5252,Bart,but i'm not homer simpson...
12388,Bart,"au revoir, suckers."
2959,Bart,really.
13052,Bart,s'allright.
6567,Bart,"dad, you don't understand. this was never about being cool. it was about you not caring how i felt."
1937,Bart,how can they imprison kids in school on a beautiful day like this?
2084,Bart,"then welcome to the nether regions of the soul. now here's what we do. tomorrow morning when allison comes out of her house, we spray her with the hose, soaking her from head to toe, leaving us relatively dry."
12126,Bart,no. i'm talking about your breakfast.
10470,Bart,"luckily, she doesn't know that our viewing platforms are... multi."
6256,Bart,so what do you want to do with it?
11636,Bart,hm.
1122,Bart,cool!
7735,Bart,i can't believe she suckered me into being a mama's boy. i've got to make this place mine again.
4114,Bart,no talking in the cage. court is now in session. all rise.
3807,Bart,yeah! that's what people do in russia!
999,Bart,"well actually, the bear just ate his hat."
129,Bart,all those coins were only worth three lousy cents?
5868,Bart,"excuse me, my friend and i were interested in purchasing quality fireworks."
12649,Bart,what's with these people? why are they sitting on their hands?
2622,Bart,"that lemon tree's a part of our town, and as kids, the backbone of our economy. we'll get it back or choke their rivers with our dead."
12398,Bart,"oh, you mean krusty the clown?"
11419,Bart,for ourselves?
11224,Bart,no hard feelings. a lot of good things have been happening to me.
7134,Bart,you're never alone in this crapshack!
8911,Bart,"hm, i don't know. i'm pretty attached to my family, and..."
7280,Bart,"of course i can twist it, i'm great."
10667,Bart,"/ get your hands off of me, you fat ass--"
8971,Bart,"don't worry, folks. our master chef is stirring up a fresh batch."
2144,Bart,you mean i have to repeat the fourth grade?
9958,Bart,those dudes were... intense.
11544,Bart,i did that last summer. i'm not allowed back.
5575,Bart,i took a swing at a cop.
11712,Bart,you're not a pushover.
11385,Bart,look at me! i'm sideshow bob!
4983,Bart,"hey, at least i got to see some cool colors."
10322,Bart,"hi, we need someone to re-program our robots to break out of jail."
2514,Bart,best two out of three.
1727,Bart,any popped eyeballs?
4155,Bart,"well, they are! anyway, don't you have some advice for krusty?"
1975,Bart,"i guess the two things cancel each other out, huh?"
12977,Bart,"he'll sit, he'll sit. come on, boy. sit! sit!"
1944,Bart,"mrs. krabappel, i have to go to the dentist. i have a caraway seed caught under my bridgework."
6201,Bart,"no, i think it's niagular."
93,Bart,i bet it's worth a million bucks!
10849,Bart,"guys who call themselves ""preacher"" or ""deacon"" are very bad. water is money unless gasoline is money. and even though lots of things are razor-sharp, no one ever shaves."
12166,Bart,"you're right, mom. i'd just like to use this occasion to announce my retirement, undefeated, from the world of video boxing."
11704,Bart,you mean more popular but not as good?
6478,Bart,w-u-w-h-a-a-t... w-w-wuh... h-h-huh...
3362,Bart,c'mon...
8247,Bart,"...and i wasn't planned, so when i came, my parents had to get married. and they were too young and not ready for a kid to screw up their lives. maybe... i act out because... if my parents are mad at me, they can't fight with each other!"
12383,Bart,"i don't want a piece of candy, i need your hel--"
7564,Bart,this is so humiliating.
8208,Bart,you got it.
4201,Bart,"houston, we have a booger."
7928,Bart,"my grades will suffer! in fact, they're already suffering."
4338,Bart,hmm. it really makes you think.
1709,Bart,i'm from a casino.
1968,Bart,"sell it to hallmark, sis. you're lookin' at cucumber boy. as in ""cool as a."""
2296,Bart,"and the dog in the coppertone ad? same deal, dad?"
9253,Bart,"no, i mean teacher."
2589,Bart,"yeah, like that really hurt."
6383,Bart,"oh, and i'm sorry i sawed the heads off your malibu stacy dolls. okay, you go."
11913,Bart,"hey, lees, keep an eye out for the guy with the peanuts."
13104,Bart,this time is so precious -- don't waste it!
3103,Bart,to pay for a lawyer for my bum.
5929,Bart,"ah, man, that would really keep your head dry."
1586,Bart,we come now to the final and most terrifying painting of the evening. to even gaze upon it is to go mad.
9812,Bart,crazy eights!
6691,Bart,"okay, five more minutes and i'm chewing my hand off."
3321,Bart,he's great at pointing out everyone's foibles!
2672,Bart,look what he did to my best friend!
562,Bart,"mom, i never won before. i may never win again. nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah-nyah!"
6249,Bart,"wow, i made it! my week-long dream has come true."
3819,Bart,woooooow. i will never wash these eyes again.
12990,Bart,"you know, grampa kinda smells like that trunk in the garage where the bottom's all wet."
9025,Bart,"if i know my sister, and unfortunately i do, she probably ran off to some lame-o make-believe castle."
11654,Bart,"oh man, he made us watch him dance for three hours. and he really only has one move."
9906,Bart,wha?
3993,Bart,i saw - a burglar and he was - he took - and he got all our stuff. including the tree.
12511,Bart,"sharp, stabbing pains... in my stomach."
3026,Bart,i got the account where you get free customized checks. i chose the hindenberg flip-book series.
13072,Bart,gotta stop that letter!
8262,Bart,"oh, i won't."
8600,Bart,because of your stupid accent?
8428,Bart,"well, time to move on with our lives."
4747,Bart,i'm gonna make your life a living hell.
9154,Bart,"hit me again, 'pu."
6881,Bart,so does sucking on the dog.
5898,Bart,and he gambles like crazy.
10054,Bart,a short film?
7538,Bart,i think i puked up all of my meanness.
6491,Bart,"ugh. ew, mom, i think maggie fudged her huggies."
10043,Bart,let me freshen that up for ya.
5569,Bart,"wanna rehearse, dad?"
11920,Bart,"oh, no."
6458,Bart,"he's a wiener, mrs. k. just say the word and his desk is full of boogers."
11059,Bart,please be okay...
7922,Bart,"oh dad, no one can rationalize like you."
12710,Bart,"ah, cranberry sauce à la bart."
7570,Bart,"well, this stinks. but i bet lisa got something even stupider."
2314,Bart,"dad, number one: i know how to ride a bike. number two: i already own a bike. and number three: that is a girl's bike."
4976,Bart,"hey, mom. thanks for comin' out."
4255,Bart,"go on home, ralph."
5558,Bart,"ah, yes. ghastly business, that."
8346,Bart,"good boy! now, transform!"
11178,Bart,eat safety bar!
3286,Bart,"sure you were, rummy."
2207,Bart,"right there, put it right there. oh, excellent. you're incredible, jessica. your throws, your catches, your spirals, your loops, it's like the toilet paper is an extension of your body."
9037,Bart,"dad, we need to have a talk."
490,Bart,"every day, same old cat. i'll make him more interesting."
2341,Bart,"been there, done that."
5094,Bart,"alls i know is i'm gettin' straight ""a's"". and that ain't not bad."
11272,Bart,because it's my present! did you give it to me because you thought i'd like it or because you wanted to feel better about yourself?
1883,Bart,"oh, go eat some flowers."
7400,Bart,uh-oh.
1557,Bart,incontinent... too rich.
8060,Bart,"don't worry, dad. you'll do great."
5846,Bart,i haven't said anything for a while.
5572,Bart,oh yeah...
2918,Bart,"then how come it says ""2nd player score""?!"
8923,Bart,a candy corn volcano! a ceiling from saddam's palace!
2065,Bart,"oh, yeah? well, i can do what i want in my room."
6284,Bart,hmmm...
9702,Bart,"dames. well, i'm gonna go introduce myself bart simpson style."
7141,Bart,"i understand... hey, what's that crazy girl doin'?"
10828,Bart,i don't see him anywhere. you jackass! you lost our dog!
5581,Bart,"nice to have you back, homer."
5458,Bart,"the kids are saying if you say bloody margie five times, she'll appear. but then she gouges your eyes out."
10678,Bart,"hey, dubya."
8070,Bart,"otto, you totally pimped dad's ride!"
9351,Bart,are you sure this'll work?
8769,Bart,it's just forks and plates. didn't we bring any food?
10376,Bart,"okay, stay frosty! all we need to do is find some sap to pretend to be the writer of our book. so hit the floor and find some pathetic wanna-be author!"
11549,Bart,"a chicken feather? why would you hand this to me? oh, you must've figured out i chickened out during the race! well who are you to judge me?!"
4129,Bart,"hey, if you didn't wanna tie shoes, you shouldn't a become a shoe salesman."
8677,Bart,step into our jerkatorium.
12743,Bart,i'm sorry.
9891,Bart,"see? he's a questionable character! he used to hang around racetracks, you know!"
3174,Bart,"well, milhouse, i guess interesting stuff does happen to people in springfield."
7807,Bart,"fight back, fun homer! together we can win!"
892,Bart,what's on?
4128,Bart,"yeah. excuse me, i'm looking for someone named, jay leno."
5012,Bart,what d'you think i've been tryin' to do?
6533,Bart,"yes, i want to be emancipated."
6336,Bart,"sorry we ruined your life, homer."
12537,Bart,perhaps another demonstration.
2166,Bart,"don't you remember, dad? flanders is the unquestioned lord and master of the world."
658,Bart,ow! knock it off you bald boob!
3496,Bart,i didn't do anything.
13070,Bart,"oh man, i must be the first guy who was ever pressured into marriage."
13081,Bart,a fake? then i did suck! i do suck!
1120,Bart,"behold the horrors of the slanty shanty. see the twisted creatures that dwell within. meet ""cue ball,"" the man with no hair!"
9593,Bart,this is awesome! if only real life was in 3-d.
4857,Bart,"say, i hear a foghorn. bor-ing..."
5525,Bart,duh. trashin' the hotel room.
8538,Bart,stupid sideshow bob. even when he's dead he wrecks my life. i hope he's in hell eating a barf burger.
4127,Bart,what do we need church shoes for? jesus wore sandals.
2183,Bart,i've never felt this way about a girl before. my long search is finally over.
9251,Bart,"but you think there's like a kernel of good inside me, right?"
5102,Bart,deal!
7719,Bart,"mom, all we have is carrot sticks and fresh fruit."
944,Bart,"you're asking the wrong guy, milhouse. they all look alike to me. now let's go whip donuts at old people"
5991,Bart,like the ones found in your local yellow pages.
83,Bart,i'm bartman!
1902,Bart,they're gonna eat this up at show and tell.
9704,Bart,huh? say that again.
12138,Bart,"gee, homer. looks like you got yourself a real problem on your hands."
10008,Bart,"i did it! i got an ""a""!"
3860,Bart,the principal said potty!
11876,Bart,"same time, same place?"
4142,Bart,"oh sure, there were a lotta laughs. y-you probably couldn't hear 'em, the acoustics were so bad."
6876,Bart,"mom, that's roofi. his music is why babies are idiots."
2170,Bart,hey everybody! let's all turn our desks backwards before mrs. krabappel shows up!
4823,Bart,i think he's almost done.
858,Bart,"after trying four times to explain it to homer, i explained it to mom and we were on our way."
302,Bart,"oh, this guy is awful."
1357,Bart,help me! help me!
5767,Bart,"hello, family."
8258,Bart,"no way, this is our rec room!"
1314,Bart,"dad, it just kinda happened. you're taking this too hard."
1576,Bart,"i just had a vision of my own horrible, fiery death."
8168,Bart,that's it! i want a license!
8415,Bart,dad?
3871,Bart,look in the sky! it's superfly!
9547,Bart,what do you mean?
11014,Bart,no.
6434,Bart,this place blows. i'm gonna go float a baby ruth down the mineral bath.
9411,Bart,"that's it, boy -- go for the nards!"
4958,Bart,"memo to self: shut up, lisa."
11847,Bart,"ah, come on dad, this can be the miracle that saves the simpsons' christmas. if tv has taught me anything, it's that miracles always happen to poor kids at christmas. it happened to tiny tim, it happened to charlie brown, it happened to the smurfs, and it's gonna happen to us."

11033,Bart,what's the hurry?
10514,Bart,you're in.
11299,Bart,"that's because jesus knows one day he gets to look his enemies in the eye and say: ""it was me who sent you to hell."""

8059,Bart,"whoa, even the army has humvees now!"
3786,Bart,what is it?
11012,Bart,"i know this looks bad. and i admit, i would totally lie in a second to lisa or mom or dad. but i would never lie to maggie."

4618,Bart,"wow, you didn't even feel her forehead. how do i get that kind of credibility?"
6927,Bart,our robot can kick that robot's ass! right dad? dad?
856,Bart,her only hope was a plucky young boy and his slow-witted father.
1812,Bart,"i don't get it, lis. you said everything would be back to normal, but homer and flanders are still friends."
4965,Bart,gotta finish.
8774,Bart,"you did, dad."
4798,Bart,nooo... goliath two is gonna pay. and this time it's biblical.

3198,Bart,"gotcha. hey, grampa, do you think i could've been a flying hellfish?"
2590,Bart,"i borrowed your nail clipper, what's the big deal?"
8246,Bart,i'm pretty sure i will.
5866,Bart,hootie and the blowfish?

3928,Bart,"wow, joe namath!"
1687,Bart,"dad, i know i've been a little hard on you the last couple of days. if i had the strength to lift my arms, i'd give you a hug."

8133,Bart,do you really understand what that means?
8311,Bart,now for the defining moment of my life...
12473,Bart,"awww, homer."

7194,Bart,"dad, i am going on a talk show. i have to say something!"
13015,Bart,"hey, homer, i found your weights."
7198,Bart,"well, where do you think we are?"
2178,Bart,"throw down your weapons and kiss the prairie, cowdorks."
4805,Bart,i hope this doesn't get into the bible.
12979,Bart,i don't want to strangle my dog.
3912,Bart,it's clobberin' time.
11858,Bart,"it doesn't seem possible, but i guess tv has betrayed me."

2131,Bart,"smashie, smashie."

5237,Bart,you are playing. we're a team.
6654,Bart,i thought you guys lived off the land. how come you're selling junk to jerks like us?
7816,Bart,"well, maybe if you enjoyed me more, i wouldn't be so screwed up."
3070,Bart,what did you get that for?
10331,Bart,"save us, fun dad!"
7396,Bart,sweet. fresh meat.

6736,Bart,you could be my father figure.
5547,Bart,"what are you, insane?"
5331,Bart,what? you told me i should do something with my life.
7360,Bart,"hell yeah! i'm representin' at ""murder 4 life,"" know what i'm sayin'?"

8791,Bart,"okay, comforting, comforting... uh dad, whenever i would hang out with grandma, she would always ask me about you. and i'd say you suck, and she would say... you don't suck that bad."
6012,Bart,she already ate three.
12148,Bart,"exactly, come to the one you love."
3130,Bart,"because i've always been an advocate of women in the workplace, lis."
5626,Bart,"please, fbi man, don't throw us in jail. we just made one mistake."
9808,Bart,"i wish i could see my mom one last time so i can say ""this is all your fault""!"
8127,Bart,what?

4022,Bart,springfield swings like a pendulum do!
9193,Bart,"excuse me, i just heard that before spider-man was a movie it was a comic book. is that possible?"
1029,Bart,"dad, have you seen the girls they have in those contests? hubba, hubba."
12070,Bart,gotcha.
12513,Bart,who said that? come closer.
8682,Bart,"dad, you never win a fight with animals. remember when you lost that war with the worms?"
10263,Bart,a man who is good enough to shed his blood for the country is good enough to be given a square deal afterwards.
8536,Bart,"oh my god, it's beautiful! are you buying this?"
9561,Bart,"destroy! destroy! boy, look at that iron work."
339,Bart,you ate my homework?
6066,Bart,let's approach with caution!
8621,Bart,you were like a brother to me! we were gonna take woodshop together and make nunchucks. and then take people to our lockers and show them our nunchucks!
8046,Bart,"oh, it's always the jews' fault."
3966,Bart,not in my damn house.
370,Bart,uh-uh.

7716,Bart,"wow, mom, i love tea!"
10344,Bart,"oh sorry, dad. our blog is so popular, we got an invitation to the most exclusive restaurant in town. kent brockman himself could only get a reservation at five-thirty or nine-thirty!"
12782,Bart,thank you. how 'bout a hand for these brave little animals?
7033,Bart,"yeah, but after the ice cream man cut up his credit card, he got a little depressed."
10081,Bart,"hm, wrong hands, eh? that's your cue, boys."
9974,Bart,"mom, i'll admit it: i wanted to create a devastating explosion to get back my mom."
6300,Bart,are you kidding? this little baby has made me more popular than ever.
1309,Bart,"oh, don't thank me. thank an unprece-dented eight-year military build-up."
6817,Bart,sweet! what am i gonna do with a thousand dollars?
9055,Bart,"hey seymour, i just realized something. you're stuck babysitting us losers which makes you the real loser!"
3437,Bart,just cuttin' through the treacle.
10203,Bart,"crazy classroom, bus full of missing kids... i know who'd have some answers. someone who's been here a long, long time."
12362,Bart,"okay, dad."
12497,Bart,"all right, okay, let's take care of some business. ""chapter one: a dream of freedom. on september fifteenth, sixteen-twenty, puritan separatists from the church of england, some living in holland, left plymouth, england. their destination was --"
5944,Bart,can that judge do this to us?
11104,Bart,"you know, i'm almost eleven, it's not really fair."
12279,Bart,you don't even know your own wife's birthday?
5926,Bart,big deal. it's just saltines and fig paste.
5397,Bart,this isn't real money. it's printed by the montana militia.
3200,Bart,huh. the light must've burned out.
9267,Bart,what the?
7244,Bart,"check it out, homes. you said if i ever got a hundred on a test, you'd throw me a party."

1862,Bart,"no, stampy. no!"

6310,Bart,"put him down, boy! put him down!"
3874,Bart,uh-oh.

211,Bart,"dad, there were things in the letter that had to be said. and i know you. you're an emotional guy. just because you were mad last night, is no guarantee you'd be mad in the morning. so i..."

8697,Bart,no problem. i bought you a hat.
7472,Bart,now she just bottles up her misery like a normal mom!

3352,Bart,"if there's a bad bookkeeping joke, i haven't heard it."
12205,Bart,dad! oh dad!
6378,Bart,"i used to be lost. until a friend turned me onto a book. a book that changed my life. it's called ""lisa is stupid."""
8529,Bart,there aren't any tables or chairs.
3254,Bart,so lisa has a friend. we'll see about that.
10473,Bart,"today we tackle the most terrifying ""myth"" in the history of springfield elementary: that if you press e-8 on the candy machine, you get electrocuted and die."
10963,Bart,"milhouse, if people believe you're a grownup, we could do anything."
1624,Bart,i do what i feel like.
4967,Bart,you're probably wondering about the coat hangers. they're to block the satellite that's been spying on me.
5564,Bart,i needed to get my mind on something else. anything else.
3757,Bart,"just a minute, van houten. somebody needs to guard this place tonight so it doesn't get trashed. how'd you like to be night watchman?"
1039,Bart,there's nothing to it. give me those heels.
2718,Bart,ah-ha!
8982,Bart,"hey, those are fifteen month calendars! that gives you three extra kittens!"
11439,Bart,don't want to be seen with you when you're hitting bottom.
2526,Bart,"yeah, skinner said you wouldn't have the wontons to go through with it."
1331,Bart,"i'll bet you have a lot of things planned, eh dad?"
3045,Bart,"no, on the street."
10152,Bart,next in line! what am i bid for next in line?!
260,Bart,"you know, maybe you should trust that instinct and not ask."
5089,Bart,you know what our homework is? find a toy and bring it to class!

5293,Bart,"yo, it's me."

8385,Bart,"hey, i'm fine -- they haven't made a french horn yet that can hurt me. now, i'm sending you a picture of the bomb."
2554,Bart,"that's it. i can't take this anymore, milhouse. i've gotta get the real teachers back."
4769,Bart,"well, according to red's schedule, we have to make it to atlanta in three days."
8170,Bart,no way -- i don't want my guts touching some sick guy!
5382,Bart,win the what now?
7296,Bart,what's happening to me? maybe i'm not a kid anymore.
5798,Bart,everybody ball-walk!
542,Bart,aye carumba!

5893,Bart,ow! you stepped on my arm!
7551,Bart,"yeah, school."
11541,Bart,"wake up, lis! it's the last day of school!"
2780,Bart,"okay, okay. milhouse's grandmother lives on 257th street, and i'm on third."
10842,Bart,"""learn zone?"" mom, you said we were going someplace fun."
2712,Bart,i know milhouse. i'll just check all his old haunts.
12298,Bart,simpson checks the runner on first. he's cool. he's fine. here's the windup and... here's the pitch.
6983,Bart,shut up!
7318,Bart,of goose's gags and gifts?
4456,Bart,"uh, nothing."
1990,Bart,"oh, no. i used dad's credit card to buy this?"
3586,Bart,ow! quit it!
754,Bart,i knew it.
10424,Bart,"lisa, do you really need all these kurt vonnegut novels?"
6971,Bart,just get in here.
3712,Bart,"oh, nothin'. forget it."
2920,Bart,that must be the happiest kid in the world.
5937,Bart,uh-oh.
7806,Bart,"dad, neither of us wanna go. why are you doing this? where's the old carefree homer who likes to cut loose?"
11852,Bart,"oh, go for it, dad."
1858,Bart,"stampy, quick! pull him out!"
6612,Bart,"hey dad, pitch to me!"
915,Bart,"deal! next on the trading block, your mickey mantle -- 1958, mint condition -- for my picture of homer on the couch."
10104,Bart,"i just got up, man."
7102,Bart,future skank!
10130,Bart,now do-se-do...
12212,Bart,maybe.
12628,Bart,whoa! he's here!
7212,Bart,cool! i'm vomit.
8150,Bart,ay carumba!
11008,Bart,yo.
10155,Bart,sister spit!
10069,Bart,"this whole thing is silly. i mean, isn't the idea of one person taking credit for an entire movie the stupidest thing you ever heard?"
3454,Bart,"yeah, mom. i mean, we love you and dad too, but god knows we don't need to see you every day."
10145,Bart,aye ca-rum-ba.
4868,Bart,"aw, geez, this place used to be crawling with russian subs. now there's just four."
11892,Bart,"you're stifling my creativity, dad."
12019,Bart,"hey, nice hair, mom."
10271,Bart,my desktop is sticky with soda from the kid that had it before me.
11230,Bart,"no, you're wrong! you're all wrong!"
5907,Bart,"hey, how 'bout 007?!"
6550,Bart,not up! down!
4560,Bart,"thanks a lot, chief."
10715,Bart,"why, ladies? why?!"
8725,Bart,lou?
3852,Bart,"uh, homer? it's five years later and i'm still miserable at school."
7566,Bart,can't we just keep going forward in our textbooks?
12831,Bart,snowball!
4435,Bart,"this is it, lis. the motherlode."
5067,Bart,hey! hey! that's a leave-in conditioner!
11404,Bart,this can only be good.
6021,Bart,"but dad, my heart hurts."
1525,Bart,"grampa, matlock's not real."
1551,Bart,"the only other college in fifty miles is springfield a&m, so they're our best target."
9102,Bart,"what she means is, we'll eat your cookies later. if you don't want us to tell our mom what you did, you're gonna have to pay."
11545,Bart,"goodbye forever, multiplication!"
2175,Bart,"nevertheless, i remain confident that something will come along and save the two simpson children."
11839,Bart,"hey santa, what's shaking?"
11500,Bart,i didn't mean to make her pregnant. i just hate art so much.
314,Bart,"akira, my good man. when do we break blocks of ice with our heads?"
3553,Bart,"oh, i'm a baby, huh? well, then i'll act like a baby."
11186,Bart,good luck with that. the only thing that'll change my mind is a sign from god.
1435,Bart,ow!
7062,Bart,"c'mon chief, it was just a prank. would some flatware make things right?"
6696,Bart,saunter!
374,Bart,"those fingers through my hair / that sly come hither stare / that strips my conscience bare / it's witchcraft - gimme three fingers of milk, ma."
2119,Bart,"wow, this is so much like my dreams it's scary."
1453,Bart,"thanks, seymour."
5112,Bart,"hey, don't talk to my sister that way."
1743,Bart,"hey, that's my lucky red hat sitting on top of a double-corrugated, eight-fold, fourteen-gauge box."
9191,Bart,but...
7643,Bart,"oh, mr. van houten, i love when you kiss me! yeah, yeah, kissing ladies is the best. oh baby, kiss my mouth. kiss me like we're in a fancy hotel."
5219,Bart,"don't listen to 'em, d. just remember, you've got a new persona. a new per-so-na."
11474,Bart,you must've been vacuuming for an hour.
7864,Bart,"um... it means you used to be afraid, but now you're not."
7863,Bart,"okay, but don't let our hands touch. it's gay."
10636,Bart,"hey guys! can you believe how awesome this is? if it wasn't for this virus thing, we'd all be back at our old sucky lives -- instead you're here, where you can be lovey-dovey all the time! come on, kiss! kiss!"

8367,Bart,sorry... but a boy's gotta go with his dog.
9129,Bart,"please, guys, give me a break. can you give me the duckling without beating me up?"
2723,Bart,"so, milhouse, it must be a little tough givin' up all that glamour comin' back to school, huh."
12338,Bart,oooo.
11620,Bart,mo-om! dad's imagining me as food again!

2586,Bart,"when i said my stomach hurt, you were the only one who believed me."
9007,Bart,"she said something about ""the bottom of the ocean"" and ""be back in a month."""
9482,Bart,"behold, neanderthal man -- our ugliest, stupidest ancestor!"
6917,Bart,"c'mon, homer. how long does it take to go to the bathroom?"
2888,Bart,aha! no one's around. the perfect crime.
9744,Bart,just call me barf simpson.

10578,Bart,mi-mi-mi-mi-mi...
8757,Bart,"mom, i have to do this! i love that big ol' cow!"
6492,Bart,"come on, mom, let's go."
10072,Bart,better -- the prospectors left naughty french postcards!
8461,Bart,you killed them.
8686,Bart,what if someone catches him?
2191,Bart,you know i was considering staying after school and helping teacher clean up.
6509,Bart,"lisa leslie, you got game!"
4044,Bart,uh oh.
12104,Bart,i can't hear you.
5153,Bart,"sorry, dad, it just won't budge."
4149,Bart,"oh, pew! what were ya drinkin'? gasoline?"
5524,Bart,"dad, the chloroform!"
1879,Bart,"well, for all intents and purposes."
6781,Bart,fresh urine.
8158,Bart,i'll keep thinking.
738,Bart,mrs. krabappel.
12626,Bart,cool man! a media circus.
5940,Bart,"well, it's showtime."
477,Bart,i can do that but i don't wanna.
7684,Bart,eat my shorts.
3267,Bart,the unsold copies of dad's autobiography.
4008,Bart,i accidentally burned up the tree and the presents. i'm really sorry.
4760,Bart,cool. even this menu is made of meat. it's an entire chicken pounded flat.
8250,Bart,anything could happen. one of these days i might have a complete psychotic breakdown.
3470,Bart,it's back to the basics. classic itchy and scratchy!
12840,Bart,am i gonna die?
13103,Bart,"i wish i could talk to my fourth grade self just once. i'd say ""work hard, don't be such a screw up."""
11380,Bart,enough!
10138,Bart,"i forget what phase two is, but i'll assume we just dump the peaches like we discussed."
4070,Bart,so. i let you use my leaves.
6422,Bart,"hey ma, our crap shack's going to hell."
9145,Bart,"are you nuts?! milhouse will spill everything. by which i mean juice, not secrets!"
6683,Bart,"poor santa's little helper, he's overworked."
7278,Bart,where'd the blood come from?
8379,Bart,"hey nelson, what gives? martin just skipped past you singing ""skip to my lou,"" and you did nothing!"
7899,Bart,punch for a punch.
2618,Bart,hey! they're taking our lemons!
8338,Bart,told you.
1192,Bart,mr. rogers says it all the time.
5590,Bart,"maybe i can make some money, dad. my magic act is really coming along."
3165,Bart,i'm in trouble already. here's what happened...so you've got to think of a way i can come home for free.
1961,Bart,i can't.
13067,Bart,that doesn't sound like me. could it be the drug kicking in? i am feeling an urge to straighten up and fly right...
6538,Bart,no. i assume it has hay.
3596,Bart,yeah. look at him trying to aim that stupid gun.
1226,Bart,i hate you.
5654,Bart,"well, better turn off that engine. before those fumes put us in tombs."
8344,Bart,"please, can he?"
32,Bart,uh oh.
8184,Bart,that is such a girl thing to say.
4288,Bart,hello everybody. sparkle sparkle.
7232,Bart,you're not invited.
1907,Bart,i'll be right back.
1386,Bart,just testing.
6926,Bart,"well, the next match is saturday. can you come then?"
11058,Bart,"i've got you, grampa!"
3409,Bart,uh-huh.
626,Bart,"what do you mean, how did i get on the radio? i created the universe! stupid kids."
12938,Bart,polo!
1417,Bart,"eh, too predictable. the way i see it, instead of shampoo itchy covers scratchy's hair with barbecue sauce... opens a box of flesh-eating ants... and the rest writes itself."
8997,Bart,"a different religion? do not tell anyone that, because if the bullies around here find out that you're different--"
3064,Bart,yes.
12171,Bart,"does it have its own satellite dish, sir?"
3787,Bart,"gee, lis, i'd love to, but this really isn't a good time..."
4339,Bart,"well, if i'm guilty of anything, maybe it's caring too much. i'm bart simpson."
1868,Bart,"so pick, please, me... mr. burns."
11979,Bart,nothin'.
2760,Bart,"i'll throw in my sense of decency, too. it's a bart sales event! everything about me must go!"
6497,Bart,"breaker, breaker. bartman to shut-in. the big guy's asleep. please advise. over."
12074,Bart,he is?
11497,Bart,"i admit, i did make a voodoo doll of mrs. trunch. but i just asked for a stomach ache, not a baby!"
12824,Bart,"you mean we can watch cartoons again, mom?"
1236,Bart,"i liked it when it was me, mom and homer. you wrecked everything. i'm leaving. goodbye."
5138,Bart,leprosy?!
9931,Bart,pig in a blanket!
4889,Bart,dad? dad? are you home?
434,Bart,"krusty, you don't have to be ""on"" tonight."
44,Bart,yes sir.
10329,Bart,dad! funtendo is unveiling their new system in three minutes -- in hall g!
4278,Bart,"come on, lisa! hurry!"
3116,Bart,you've got to make more itchy and scratchy cartoons.
10052,Bart,"hi, everyone. i'm bart simpson, the creator of ""angry dad."" to make this film, i had to miss countless hours of school, and there was also some hardship. i hope you like it as much as i do."
6737,Bart,i can help you.
1103,Bart,not bloody likely.
9916,Bart,okay. you got me. but i'm gettin' my dirt bike -- and you can't stop me.
9628,Bart,have you ever noticed that dad always gets the disease they write about in the in-flight magazine?
10907,Bart,that's your hand?
3038,Bart,"it doesn't matter how you live or what you did wrong. as long as you're on tv, people will respect you."
6053,Bart,"i prefer to egg him on. hey dad, has the movie started yet?"
2521,Bart,it's hard to see what's going on. i can only make out the fat soldiers.
340,Bart,i didn't know dogs really did that.
9468,Bart,"okay, let me get this straight -- you got all this moolah, legitimately, but you're too scared to do anything fun with it?"
6074,Bart,"wow, cool! uh, i guess we're leaving, too."
6607,Bart,oh yeah. from my room i can hear everything.
11644,Bart,hot stuff? i didn't realize you were that evil.
13080,Bart,"hey milhouse, did i ever tell you about the catch i made when i was ten? greatest moment of my life..."
4423,Bart,when are mom and dad coming back?
841,Bart,i can't believe you guys. this man framed krusty the clown.
11237,Bart,"firm but fair, sir."
10061,Bart,angry dad got an oscar nomination?!
12445,Bart,"hello, is al there?"
6957,Bart,"i know there's a catch, but tell me more."
2682,Bart,"aw, all these new superheroes suck. none of them can hold a candle to radioactive man."
2234,Bart,i didn't take it.
3504,Bart,"man, those cons love krusty. inside every hardened criminal beats the heart of a ten-year-old boy."
6714,Bart,a forty-year-old novelty beverage? hand it over!
6729,Bart,"well, that's it. they've beaten us."
11110,Bart,"uh, mom? i'm sorry i pretended to be good at piano-- and i'm really ashamed that i lied."
4741,Bart,"why, nbc, of course."
2512,Bart,dogs always land on their feet.
10346,Bart,relax -- dad will be the life of the party. he'll be the fourth mouth-keteer.
10589,Bart,it's not fair! you know that's hilarious!
6859,Bart,"cheer up, krusty. you're a clue in the people magazine crossword puzzle. what more can a man want?"
2423,Bart,"sorry, girl. i don't wanna get in any more trouble down here."
949,Bart,"unky herb, what advice would you give to a boy who will most likely become a bum like yourself?"
9443,Bart,aye carumba!
4930,Bart,can't help ya.
4347,Bart,...lives a poor immigrant whose home was cruelly taken away.
7041,Bart,that sucked!
6780,Bart,this is boring. can't we go home? this overpass smells like urine.
9765,Bart,awesome! who is it?
8784,Bart,that dump?
10091,Bart,ay carumba!
1929,Bart,"hmm, that's probably never gonna happen."
1795,Bart,hello! pay attention to me! look at me! i'm bart! i'm bart! look at me! look at me! look at me!
6270,Bart,thank god his pants stayed on.
3407,Bart,"well, lis, what do you think about the alien now?"
7778,Bart,what do you have against santa?
11721,Bart,we did.
1394,Bart,"right, dad."
1682,Bart,"well, at least ned is trying! what are you doing to help?"
5264,Bart,"oh, man. that would be so awesome!"
9820,Bart,"oh i've seen it, especially when i do this."
6408,Bart,the doorman died.
1112,Bart,you guys must be gettin' pretty tired of that movie by now.
1038,Bart,and now for your triumphant walk down the runway.
6595,Bart,"but, if you get elected, you can change all that, and stop those stupid airplanes from flying over my house."
12180,Bart,"are we there yet, dad?"
792,Bart,"seymour, i'll bet you a steak dinner those books are still here. all we have to do is search every locker."
7063,Bart,"juvie?! please judge, you can't... i-i'll do anything! i'll squeal on my dad -- he's been up to bad things. crap you've never even thought of."
13040,Bart,no snake tattoo.
11461,Bart,relax! listen to the music of this bubble game.
6049,Bart,the prostitute with a heart of gold.
4844,Bart,ewwww.
5268,Bart,"nice suit, jeeves!"

1767,Bart,watch the conan o'brien show. you'll see.

11514,Bart,"i wouldn't be here if you were more of a role model! pub crawls, naked frisbee golf..."

9644,Bart,i will never forgive you.
9424,Bart,"hey, slimu!"

5185,Bart,"oh, milhouse, this is my fault. i'm so sorry."
6452,Bart,black hawk up!
3285,Bart,"you can't protect them every second. sooner or later you'll let your guard down, and then -- flush! it's toilet time for tiny town."
12147,Bart,"come on, maggie. the choice is obvious."
3142,Bart,"maybe because you are, as we say in latin, a dorkus malorkus."
8135,Bart,gil's gone.
5545,Bart,i guess.
9963,Bart,hey.
9607,Bart,"i don't get you! you're hot, you're cold... what is your deal?!"

5738,Bart,"...so from now on, all hats are banned from the school."
7537,Bart,"lisa, you should enter that contest. you've got a great voice. it made us all feel better."
6152,Bart,buck gave it to me. he's just about the greatest guy who ever lived. i wanna grow up to be just like him.

6094,Bart,"lisa, i only lied because it was the easiest way to get what i wanted."
9822,Bart,"well, stop in and say ""hi"" to me 'cause i'll still be there -- chillin' in my basement bachelor pad."
3224,Bart,dear bart and lisa...
7625,Bart,"well, thanks for making me feel better, knowing that your screams when the zombies chomp your brains will warn me so i can get away."

11130,Bart,"yeah, it's tough being man of the house. you left some big underpants to fill. i didn't know they made underoos in size fifty-two."
7654,Bart,"lisa, we don't need to know how. it's just a natural thing that happens, like a hurricane or going to war."
11390,Bart,/ that's mean.
9730,Bart,"uh, you missed the turn-off, mr. warren."
618,Bart,"hell, no."
6893,Bart,"""psycho cycle conversion kit?!"" oh, wow, this will look great on my bike."

11610,Bart,"dad, look! i did a round turn with two half hitches."
11363,Bart,"so, why can't i go there?"
2261,Bart,"aw thanks, dad."

12856,Bart,you're damn right. who's the cat that won't cop out / when there's danger all about?
2986,Bart,"dad, it's right across the street from us!"
9092,Bart,"k-i/s-s-m-y/a-s-s spells ""kiss my ass""!"
8703,Bart,so dean martin would show up at the last minute and do everything in just one take?
9956,Bart,wow! we all have the same scar!
1818,Bart,"amen, ernie."
9373,Bart,me too!
11952,Bart,"oh, please, mrs. krabappel, not next to wendell. he pukes on every bus ride."

7726,Bart,"mom, this is great! it makes our real house look like a pile of crap."
10977,Bart,pretty shapes tell me to kill everybody.
719,Bart,"wow, a side of dad i've never seen."
7842,Bart,"but on the upside, i found some cave paintings and made them awesome."
9774,Bart,"my stupid sister's taken the fun out of baseball. what happened to stealing bases, the suicide squeeze, throwin' a little chin music?"
6751,Bart,let's see... x-ray gum...
903,Bart,"victim number four. hey, lewis, can i interest you in a wet willie?"
11854,Bart,"come on, dog! go, man! go! come on santa's little helper! run baby run!"
1137,Bart,"nervous, lis? i don't blame you. this is where the winfields hid their mutated son."
12204,Bart,"what the hell are you talking about, sir?"
8354,Bart,"well, i bet he can't resist this."
11685,Bart,"we've all read the terms and conditions, milhouse."
4198,Bart,bo-ring. what's that fire for?
8803,Bart,i'm a lantern fish.
1494,Bart,elizabeth taylor... bette midler...
6089,Bart,that's it. i'm blowing off the dance. this is the biggest thing that's happened to me since chocolate milk.
10485,Bart,"gentlemen, we just created a myth."
12530,Bart,"thanks a lot, son."
7612,Bart,"dad, i promise i'll be good."
2373,Bart,"hey, shut up."
10855,Bart,"oh god, now what?"

9318,Bart,not to worry. it plugs into this cigarette lighter.
3542,Bart,what?!
7419,Bart,restraining order?! bull spit! no piece of paper keeps me from whaling on my sister.
12715,Bart,"move it or lose it, toots!"
4383,Bart,he eats fifty dollars' worth of power sauce bars a day.
6155,Bart,buck's here!
9464,Bart,ow!
12336,Bart,"welcome back, dad."
8991,Bart,whoa. all these years i've been petting lambs when i should've been shoving them in my mouth. i'm bart.
11469,Bart,"so you see, chief, snake wasn't stealing that stuff out of greed. he was stealing it to thank me."
614,Bart,"sorry, rosarita. i gotta get to my birthday party."
2717,Bart,the only place left is the treehouse.
2989,Bart,"wow, a former president, living right across the street!"
4721,Bart,"hey, you're wrecking it!"
9861,Bart,"okay, okay. i'll find you some food."
4622,Bart,it's a little something i whipped up in shop. mostly latex. what're you doing out here?
1438,Bart,i got expelled.
717,Bart,no! it's not for me. it's homework.
1303,Bart,yo!
9595,Bart,"hey willie, does he taste like failure?"
35,Bart,"whoa, somebody was bound to say it one day. i just can't believe it was her."
784,Bart,"i think you've had enough, sister. c'mon, let's keep it moving."
4000,Bart,"please, i don't deserve this."
405,Bart,"whatever she's paying you, i'll double it."
9688,Bart,"blonde guys aren't dumb. they're evil. like in ""the karate kid"" and world war two."
12536,Bart,you're not. watch!

5956,Bart,"c'mon, dad. i gotta go to the bathroom."
4873,Bart,"oh, it's not fair. i'm not supposed to die now. i'm supposed to die in a foolish motorcycle stunt at the age of fifteen."
2390,Bart,no fair! you only won 'cause you had the inside track! if the water was spinning the other way--
2841,Bart,"eat around the banana, dad, it's just empty vitamins."
8518,Bart,...but let's see what you know about super-heroes.
5014,Bart,"oh, no! krusty!"
5710,Bart,"sorry, sorry."
10228,Bart,mrs. k.? are you still bumping moustaches with ned?

11630,Bart,"mom, i need a few hours off. it's milhouse's birthday party and i'm all the guests."

9615,Bart,never gonna happen.
8443,Bart,"well, i have to look good for tomorrow."
6694,Bart,hey! i brought a peruvian fighting frog!
8597,Bart,sure.
12867,Bart,what's with the candles?
1713,Bart,"hey, the burglar left his calling card."
6192,Bart,i'm on it.
11958,Bart,"they took bart simpson to the graveyard / and they buried him in the sand, oh, yeah / and every locomotive that comes roarin' by / says, 'there lies a steel-drivin' man, lord! lord! oh, there lies a --"
12247,Bart,so like sometimes you could do stuff that you think is pretty bad so other kids will like you better?
3847,Bart,"a, b, c... uh... line?"
5514,Bart,you should call that radio station and let 'em have it.
6211,Bart,"look, the room came with a fruit hat."
3974,Bart,it's crap-tacular.
7031,Bart,"come on, dad. with his brains and your musky smell, i've got a full male role model."
173,Bart,perfect.
12308,Bart,"uh oh, it's the fe-mail man."
8468,Bart,sin gets us something? awesome!
1852,Bart,he's gone forever.
12218,Bart,our teacher.
1539,Bart,nah.
6686,Bart,"here's how we're gonna get our dog back. dad'll pretend to drown and call for ""suds mcduff"" to save him."
8414,Bart,"yay, dad!"
1773,Bart,"you're right, mom. i shouldn't let this bother me. i'm in television now. it's my job to be repetitive... my job, my job. repetitiveness is my job. i am gonna go out there tonight and give the best performance of my life."
4625,Bart,"miss hoover, ""wind in the willows."""
8068,Bart,i only eat the clown heads.
11735,Bart,i don't see any breasts.
8553,Bart,let her figure out someone to dump it on.
12068,Bart,amen.
5732,Bart,yep. and we haven't been to school in days and days and days.
8464,Bart,"trick or treat isn't just some phrase you chant mindlessly like ""the lord's prayer."" it's an oral contract!"
5492,Bart,"wow, a house made of gingerbread!"
7542,Bart,"yeah. for once, couldn't you just turn into a good father? would that be so hard?"
4725,Bart,"i didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks and blows."
8910,Bart,terrific? incredible? happy as a clown?
2636,Bart,five.
16,Bart,i can't believe i'm getting combat pay for this.
9228,Bart,"so, um, you're wearing the same bathrobe you were the last time i was here. that's cool."
475,Bart,we would have gotten even more if lisa could walk faster.
8815,Bart,"all right, time to fill these slots with coins. specific coins? this hobby sucks!"
6145,Bart,is that horse vacuuming?
6347,Bart,you get to see what they do during commercial breaks.
12581,Bart,yawn. i heard that when i was in the third grade. it's not scary.
2174,Bart,"don't worry, guys. something always comes along to save us."
12337,Bart,"yeah, good luck, man."
6797,Bart,no. i was being sincere.
12271,Bart,"forgive me, sir."
854,Bart,surely anyone would have noticed a gas leak -- except aunt selma.
4105,Bart,exactly.
245,Bart,uh-huh. and is elvis with you?
6193,Bart,she's talking to her invisible friend. god.
5025,Bart,"quiet, here come the ninjas."
10501,Bart,accident! here comes another one!

7952,Bart,remember when we saw hunch's butt in the shower?
7309,Bart,"come on, chief. i can't afford to pay protection to you and nelson."
11041,Bart,the only cool thing about my dad was that he hated church. and now he's turned into a fat version of flanders. no offense.
7091,Bart,"when we split up, where are you gonna go?"
9203,Bart,that was awesome!
10462,Bart,milhouse.
2249,Bart,poor sucker. it's amazing what some guys will do for a pretty face. not me though. wait'll she sees the second rate job i do on these stairs. .
9599,Bart,you are the biggest psycho i ever met.
10230,Bart,but... what if my dog eats it?
439,Bart,"don't worry, i don't even like using the bathroom after you."
7366,Bart,"i love you, krusty-wusty."
9901,Bart,"yep. come midnight, i'll be sittin' here with cold cookies, warm milk, and hot lead."
631,Bart,uh-huh.

2625,Bart,death to shelbyville!
7085,Bart,i miss prison.
12239,Bart,"that one looks like the statue of our town founder, jebediah springfield."
10919,Bart,"well you're gonna win, 'cause you've got star quality. like the hulk in movies other than ""the hulk."""
7177,Bart,i am!
10972,Bart,"now, i asked you here because i know a cool grownup who will take you to that club in the city."
4866,Bart,how'd you like to go on a real boat trip?
5489,Bart,"hmm... oh, whoa! too hot!"
1119,Bart,yeah.
6352,Bart,what's a fortnight?
2517,Bart,"sorry, monty, but you're too big for this ride."
10174,Bart,or give it to someone who deserves it.
7768,Bart,"dad, cheese truck!"
5307,Bart,"now, we'd like to play a jimmy buffet song, but he un-coolly charges people to cover them. so here's a cap'n bart original. wasted once more in daquiritaville..."
12873,Bart,"hey, everybody! if you look real close, you can kinda make 'em out."
13114,Bart,"oh, i get it. you can't tip me because your hands are tied. my dad pulls that scam all the time."
3716,Bart,"here, boy! come on!"
2705,Bart,i didn't do it! i wished him well! i wished him weeelll!
4995,Bart,you mean you killed ned flanders.
12577,Bart,"it's like, realsville, daddy-o."

12638,Bart,"hey, dad, look, you're on jumbovision!"
5507,Bart,then what's this?
619,Bart,wha th...?
1621,Bart,what an odd thing to say.
8549,Bart,"nice try, bob -- but you didn't count on one thing."
8384,Bart,"yes, a mole. now i don't have much time, so i'm just gonna come right out and say his name, so get ready to know his name. his name is the following: m--"
8790,Bart,when did he lose his cuteness?
8451,Bart,"so, this is my krusty doll, funzo, linguo, iraq war sergeant activity with insufficient armor, phonic frog, cat skull, jim halterman bobble-head doll -- he's a local car dealer..."
7781,Bart,let's hit the floor!
11431,Bart,went to practice her portuguese.
3237,Bart,bye-bye toothbrush.
7907,Bart,"hey, no one with a choice should ever have to be a girl. i'll teach you how to be a boy."
9798,Bart,mousecatch?
11326,Bart,easiest money i ever...
9950,Bart,"ew, you're sitting on the toilet."
714,Bart,you've got a date with a xerox machine.
6401,Bart,"oh, i don't get a song? mom got a song."
12425,Bart,"well, okay, but..."
4776,Bart,he hit us!
5802,Bart,but how? we would need the ultimate chill-out song.
11206,Bart,that ain't rough. more like a gentle breeze.
6744,Bart,"please, don't take me! take milhouse. we all know there's no happy ending there."
11267,Bart,don't make me learn about it.
928,Bart,yeah?
10659,Bart,what'd you just say?
2465,Bart,"i may be just a boy, but i have an idea. if i may, i'd like to show you a few slides."
12346,Bart,clumsy homer... everything's always my fault... if he'd just watch where he was going...
654,Bart,help! help! i fell down the well.
9234,Bart,"so, did you write your dream on the index card of fate?"
2097,Bart,bo-ring.
5186,Bart,"well, i don't think i can."
12149,Bart,"gee, dad, you're really bad at this."
3978,Bart,"dear santa. if you bring me lotsa good stuff, i promise not to do anything bad between now and when i wake up. amen."
4392,Bart,all i see is a pole. maybe the flag fell off.
17,Bart,you said you were using birth control!
1154,Bart,"hey, sometimes a guy just likes his skin to look its yellowest."
8288,Bart,"actually, it's saturday."

11169,Bart,"okay bart, be cool. calm down. you're not gonna die up here."
6543,Bart,sorry mom. i gotta go.
1201,Bart,then what happened?
1718,Bart,"i believe you, dad."
7798,Bart,"hey, we can't leave here without turning one little valve."
7455,Bart,you can have it -- this one's way better.
2656,Bart,but they stole our lemon tree!
4604,Bart,"alec baldwin, wow. that is the coolest person you've ever been fired by. what was it like at their house?"
2005,Bart,what the hell are you talkin' about? you're the one who double dared us.
12071,Bart,"thanks, pop."
7583,Bart,"what's it to you, irish?"
8007,Bart,"lis, you poured your heart into rescuing society's most vulnerable critters: animals. so i want all the money we've raised tonight to go to building... the lisa simpson home for abandoned animals!"
9258,Bart,and there's no hard feelings?
9392,Bart,"charlie, you'd rat on me?"
540,Bart,"ah come on dad, if you really want to help, you can clean these paint brushes."
7438,Bart,what does that mean? you're sharpening it?
9232,Bart,cut it out. you're not a teacher anymore.
4537,Bart,i've gotta keep these warm.
10693,Bart,"dance with me, please. i need to zing my sister."
6621,Bart,nelson steals a hood ornament and now he's king of the school. all that's left for me is to become the biggest drunk this town's ever seen.
10463,Bart,"i've been out here all night, man. just let me know what it'll take for you to forgive me."
9473,Bart,no way! i wanna go a million more times!
7436,Bart,"lis, just let me be!"

11487,Bart,"uh, plastic."
8425,Bart,what's your name?
6088,Bart,"oh, yeah. maybe i should keep my promise."
7023,Bart,"welcome to ""the others."""
7795,Bart,now i gotta warn you. we could get in trouble.
10853,Bart,"dad, how are we supposed to spend the rest of our lives here? we're already bored."
3707,Bart,my name is bart simpson. i have to talk to you about your dog.
6350,Bart,"wait a minute, i saw this one."
12477,Bart,did i mention this book was written by a guy named robert louis stevenson? and published by the good people at mcgraw hill.
5728,Bart,"that's actually a great idea, milhouse."
9054,Bart,doy. doy. doy. doy.
10115,Bart,"one, two, three, cry! one, two, three, cry!"
3134,Bart,"yes. you are right, milhouse. it is a fake. which makes it a fake i.d."
12701,Bart,"who? wait a minute, who's that?"
8601,Bart,who is it?
7272,Bart,thinking is for losers!
4397,Bart,ah. no day would be completely wasted without a visit to the old joke shop.
9938,Bart,keep him safe from shanks and shivs. let him become rich in the jailyard currencies of cigarettes and dried fish...
4929,Bart,"sure, i can do something destructive!"
752,Bart,"dar-ryl, dar-ryl."
2142,Bart,don't worry. he's taken a million of these capsules.
9415,Bart,this isn't larry. it's just cotton balls on toilet paper rolls! where's the real larry?
906,Bart,"god shmod, i want my monkey-man."
7497,Bart,"goodbye, college!"
1365,Bart,"cupcakes, cupcakes. yes, sweet cakes for all."
6107,Bart,"...so to win greta back, i have to go to toronto."

8749,Bart,i didn't know cletus was your dad.
8881,Bart,"oh man... when you're alone, night is scary."
12371,Bart,"well, okay, sir."
12443,Bart,"that's okay, mom!"
5600,Bart,"so in a way, we'd just be balancing out the universe."
9171,Bart,the washington monument?
2410,Bart,bart simpson's office.
5880,Bart,"yeah, folks, the power of christ compels you to give ned an extra ten bucks."
1683,Bart,stop it! / stop it! / dad!
11076,Bart,"you're completely fine! i've been taking care of you, giving you love and attention... for nothing!"
9542,Bart,let's roll.
5618,Bart,"run, dad!"
9355,Bart,"well, i need a baby now and i'm not getting any younger!"
11018,Bart,"this case is goin' great. although as usual, i look nothing like the courtroom artist's drawing."
2632,Bart,i assumed i could.
7144,Bart,"yeah, it's a tissue... covered in blood and boogers!"
4545,Bart,"sure they are. they came from eggs in a bird's nest. therefore, they're birds. ixo fatso."
4610,Bart,"oh, please god, don't let them come in here."
2204,Bart,"i'm bad to the bone, honey."
9448,Bart,huh?
7518,Bart,"thank you, krusty. once again you've delivered an important message wrapped in entertainment. and i'm so touched that all of you would take the time to eat my shorts, lame-o's!"
9839,Bart,i don't wanna talk about it.
6097,Bart,"lis, women are easy. state capitals are hard."
4385,Bart,"oh, cool! now get goin', chop-chop!"
9804,Bart,one...
6569,Bart,i can't just sit here watching this junk.
8169,Bart,"no, to drive."

7463,Bart,we're on the freeway!
3351,Bart,"but i gotta tell ya, adam and eve must have been the first bookkeepers. they invented the loose leaf system."
1050,Bart,so?

10954,Bart,"don't worry, i'll clean it up. get me some whipped cream and a safety scissors."
1023,Bart,"pick the red, get ahead, pick the black, set you back."
11427,Bart,"everyone does that with good dads. but with our dad, it's like climbing mount everest. you either plant your flag at the top of the world or get frozen in agony forever. either way, hell of a show."
11449,Bart,i saw a guy with a gun and a snake tattoo say he was gonna hide out on top of mount springfield.
2012,Bart,"look, lis, i snatched five bathing suits. all martin's!"
7125,Bart,"please don't make us go. if you make me get on that plane, i'll give myself diarrhea! i know how!"
1634,Bart,i see.

7080,Bart,why'd you kiss me? are you lookin' to do the bartman?
2851,Bart,"hey, homer, you promised mom you wouldn't wear your dress outside."
992,Bart,"all right, that's it! i've been scorched by krusty before. i got a rapid heart beat from those krusty brand vitamins; my krusty calculator didn't have a 7 or an 8; and krusty's autobiography was self-serving, with many glaring omissions. but this time he's gone too far. we want krusty! we want krusty!"
8936,Bart,whoa! let me at it!
9998,Bart,are you kidding? you're the worst dad who ever lived! i'd rather take my chances in a hot car than go in a store with you!
3782,Bart,i want to quit and come home.
9811,Bart,"the final challenge! mousecatch... a game so lame, no one's ever finished it!"
8356,Bart,my god. i've lost him.
3306,Bart,"this isn't a belt, it's a tactical pants-retaining system. check it out: compass, matches, whistle, saw, panic button, squirrel snare, radon-slash-lie detector, sphygmomanometer... and it's even got turn signals!"
3136,Bart,"one adult and two children, please."
2497,Bart,two sets of twins and a triplet!

13038,Bart,li-sa! meet your new husband!
11292,Bart,"so what do you think, lis? who are the good guys here, the media companies or the internet freedom guys?"

12472,Bart,"this way to the scene of the crime, men. i've got her tied up in the den."
6127,Bart,"mom, a dog ate my clothes!"
4095,Bart,point of odor. lisa stinks.

12027,Bart,"uh oh, school bus! gotta go."

6800,Bart,"""all extra-curricular activities are hereby canceled, to be replaced by nothing."""
1547,Bart,"i dunno, dad. don't you have a better picture?"
2725,Bart,but they told us to wear 'em.
2588,Bart,"lisa, please, you're too puny to --"
1420,Bart,rock.
3458,Bart,haven't you ever listened to yourself on a tape recorder?
1045,Bart,"thanks, grampa."
3251,Bart,"they're my friends, rightfully. she only got them by copying me!"

5793,Bart,now we gotta send them a basket.
74,Bart,i'll never trust another old person.

5088,Bart,check it out. i'm breaking books at a sixth-grade level.
10128,Bart,backwards one...
5599,Bart,but wouldn't that make us con artists?
430,Bart,"why bother, they'll just get dirty again."
3623,Bart,okay. that one.
8964,Bart,"hey, you guys want a lift in my pedal boat?"
10704,Bart,"um, that's awesome. but i think i'll visit my ex-girlfriends and prove they still like me."
635,Bart,"oh, brotherrr."
1115,Bart,"well, i'll be. the itchy and scratchy movie."
2981,Bart,"mom, my sling shot doesn't fit in these pockets. and these shorts leave nothing to the imagination. these uniforms suck!"

6013,Bart,"dad, the rocket's off course!"
3298,Bart,"sports collectibles! wow, a baseball made out of secretariat!"
9423,Bart,it's dark down here.
11891,Bart,no way.
10302,Bart,i'll tell you my project: a fisteroid hitting the planet nerd.
6633,Bart,"dad, we weren't playing pictionary -- that was an intervention to stop your drinking."
6717,Bart,"hey, boys will be boys."
450,Bart,we'll put them on later. now can you give us the rabbi's address?
11798,Bart,"mom, lisa and i learned we could solve any problem through song. lisa, let's go write something that'll change dad's mind."
6996,Bart,"oh, that does sound fun."
9810,Bart,that blank can be any letter we want!
5462,Bart,the cops found me driving on the sidewalk.
3900,Bart,wow! the tv's coin-operated.
9002,Bart,"dad, that's bashir -- my new friend."
1476,Bart,no problemo. we'll just sweep it all under the rug.
10980,Bart,i sure hope not.
629,Bart,"people of earth, this is bartron, commander of the martian invasion force. your planet is in our hands. resistance is useless."
1067,Bart,i thought dabbling in the black arts would be good for a chuckle. how wrong i was. i should have never read that book.
8002,Bart,you're my mother! how can you say that?
4013,Bart,head her off at the stairs!
5175,Bart,"three, two, one, pull!"
2374,Bart,"dad, the plan!"
10526,Bart,"well, i'll have to discuss it with my partner."
615,Bart,"hey, good to see ya. glad you could make it. toby, have you lost weight? uh-oh, here comes trouble."
13097,Bart,"no, mom dumped you 'cause you blew all our money on this underwater house."
12528,Bart,and now they're talking about holding me back in the fourth grade if i don't shape up.
3436,Bart,"might i add, eat my shorts."
11484,Bart,i gotta find a way to get rid of my art teacher.
5011,Bart,"whoa! hey, phaser, phaser, phaser -- zing!"
10034,Bart,take that back!
12751,Bart,"touchdown, simpson! the boy nobody wanted just won the superbowl!!!"
1931,Bart,"well, once he found out we were going to get ned flanders fired, he insisted on helping."
9650,Bart,"dad, before you jump to conclusions..."
12945,Bart,"batting nine. unky, herbbbb!"
4554,Bart,"guys, is it really true? are you cold-blooded egg-murderers?"
4153,Bart,"thanks for comin' over, jay. krusty really needs help."

7223,Bart,that's congresswoman bella abzug.
6068,Bart,"dad just got a library card in west springfield. he checked out ten books on oil rigging and a book called ""dying for dummies."""
12800,Bart,"hey, man, you can tell me not to do it, but there's no way you can watch me twenty-four hours a day. and the minute your back is turned, i'm grabbing my skateboard and headin' for that gorge."
12418,Bart,"i'll never forgive you for making me say this, but... you're smarter than me."
1049,Bart,"i'd say that the pressure's finally gotten to dad, but what pressure?"
3950,Bart,i unno.
634,Bart,"sorry lady, show's over."
9489,Bart,now how am i supposed to get to soccer practice?
1603,Bart,"you're absolutely right, homer. we don't need a baby-sitter."

5469,Bart,"cowabunga, dude!"
11451,Bart,"stolen bowling shoes, 3-d glasses, krusty standee...and this ""cage"" for my pet."
12750,Bart,"a sellout crowd at the super bowl, simpson down by six with two seconds left! simpson fades back. he's got simpson in the open..."
8949,Bart,"i never thought i'd say this, but i missed you guys. even what's her name, lisa."
12843,Bart,fine.

7642,Bart,"so milhouse walks into the bedroom, and there's his mom and dad going..."
6085,Bart,"ohhh, he'll sleep tonight."
10677,Bart,"what?! without awards shows, how would i know what movie has the ""best beheading,"" or that ""glee"" is a comedy?"
6588,Bart,"look, it's celebrity boy-toy ned flanders and his arm candy, sara sloane."
10993,Bart,why do you still have a thing for nelson?
10979,Bart,"lady, my stomach's full and i wanna go. that's how it works in this country."
5291,Bart,no prob. i'll just mooch some green off my folks.
8134,Bart,all he left me with are these used nicotine patches.
153,Bart,last night i dreamed i held you in my arms.
6035,Bart,"attention everyone, this is gabriel, my personal social worker. he has to be here. i'm just that nuts."
11917,Bart,"oh, yeah."

4300,Bart,ninja death stars?
7766,Bart,i think dad may blow your cover.
1255,Bart,"sorry, mom, the mob has spoken."
1217,Bart,who the hell are you?
7061,Bart,yes.
8970,Bart,maybe we should put a dollar in the jar. prime the pump.
6565,Bart,"don't worry, they're clip-ons."
8203,Bart,"darcy, in fifty years, you might see me walking down the street and you'll wonder, ""is that bart?"" and i'll go and you'll know."
124,Bart,"hm... well, it's practically empty."
6640,Bart,i-am-at-disneyland.
6596,Bart,"aw, all the good ones. hmm, i've never even heard of number nine."

3748,Bart,looks like my years of hard work have finally paid off.
4997,Bart,but who?
1063,Bart,"cullen, rayburn, narz, trebek!"
2000,Bart,"oh well, he's happy. i'm gonna keep this mary worth phone right here. her stern but sensible face will remind me never to do anything so stupid again."
1036,Bart,and the winner is... lisa simpson!
11444,Bart,"hey, i bet you have a great smile."
4148,Bart,sorry.

9828,Bart,just when you think i'm out of ideas!
9666,Bart,what? no! not until you raise my allowance.
1457,Bart,"well, according to this, snakes ""hear"" by sensing vibrations in the ground. so, if we put our stereo speakers on the ground and play something with a lot of bass, those snakes'll be in here like oprah on a baked ham."
6662,Bart,"what's up, cootie breath?"
7606,Bart,you don't seem very jolly.
4589,Bart,"oooh, that is gonna hurt tomorrow."
10510,Bart,"but it's my home now, sir."
1298,Bart,"dad, where are you?"
12834,Bart,um... say... is there anything i can do to avoid coming back here?
5476,Bart,rocks!
12610,Bart,wait a minute. that's a schoolbook.
9454,Bart,"princess, before you marry krusty, there's someone you should meet..."
12125,Bart,"warm... no, cold... colder... ice cold."
7285,Bart,"god, please give your daughter the tooth fairy the strength to carry my cash, and the integrity not to dip her wand in the till."
11262,Bart,what makes you think that?
371,Bart,i guess that's okay.
4613,Bart,"well, why don't you just pull it out?"
9403,Bart,don't worry. me and charlie have one thing you'll never have.
7900,Bart,"so what's your name, newbie?"

3340,Bart,"oh, i can't believe i gotta spend all my free time dustin' doilies in a smelly, run-down dump for a creepy old witch..."
12384,Bart,"come on, mister. can you help me?"
7004,Bart,"since he's been back, milhouse has had three bloody noses and stepped in dog doo. it's always a party with that guy."
3571,Bart,oooh -- oh -- so close!
9639,Bart,no!
11108,Bart,but there's really only one girl whose opinion matters to me. my mom.
6029,Bart,"well, i'd like to trust you, homer. but you've been in jail three times."
11078,Bart,no. even she thought it was crap.
11806,Bart,"good one, dad."
3792,Bart,"i dunno. i was just looking at my shoelaces. look, the point is, you're going to make it, lis. and i'm going to stick by you."
1789,Bart,"yeah, you made us march in that gay rights parade."
12151,Bart,"i am going easy on you, but you're just so old and slow and weak and pathetic."
324,Bart,"hey, lis. change the channel."
11797,Bart,how come dad's not with you?
6370,Bart,"we would, governor bailey! team simpson!"
509,Bart,"duh, look at me, i'm principal skinner."
11673,Bart,"i dunno. but in ten minutes i'm gonna have him kneeling before zod. in this example, i'm zod."
9312,Bart,knock it off! that's my mom you're talkin' about.
2355,Bart,is that the telescope we're gonna be looking through?
1534,Bart,"dad, i'm kinda edgy right now. i'd appreciate you not coming in my room screaming and brandishing a butcher knife."
11861,Bart,"oh, can we keep him dad, please?"
10107,Bart,"he'd say ""i'm a grown man who's scared of my own son."""
1007,Bart,"cool, she can fly!"
3490,Bart,"dad, why did you bring me to a gay steel mill?"
777,Bart,go on.
2343,Bart,"wow, dad. you really threw a tantrum like a little sissy girl?"
7476,Bart,"uh... shoes, butt-back?"
10475,Bart,"ladies and gentlemen, that myth is... cracked!"
12644,Bart,"yeah, let's blow this pop stand and never look back."
8226,Bart,try not to think about it.
1685,Bart,"dad, i think he's oka--"
6767,Bart,"you know, milhouse? i thought i'd love eating only frosting and giving the pope a wedgie..."
11973,Bart,"yeah, dad. / yeah. / we love you."
7217,Bart,learning is cool!
2246,Bart,"i just wanted to let you know that even though this was a difficult experience, i really learned a lot... i'm a little wiser and a little less naïve."
3846,Bart,"hey, she's just giving the public what it wants. bart by the barrel ful."
9344,Bart,lisa got a sister! why can't you have another boy?
7715,Bart,"well, that's really what i need the most. let's go."

10058,Bart,"this is insane! he didn't show up for work, he bad-mouthed the movie on jimmy fallon, and now he's hoggin' all the credit!"
11507,Bart,with them.
2530,Bart,"thank you, sir."
4503,Bart,"she doesn't scare me. i do what i want, when i want. oh god, inchworms!"
6525,Bart,you stole my money!
10573,Bart,why can't you do it?
2664,Bart,yuck. what reeks?
9771,Bart,also wrong.
9285,Bart,yep. i'm at the tennis match.
4262,Bart,"danger, eh?"
4668,Bart,can't we just go to bed?
12224,Bart,it didn't hurt.
9326,Bart,"oh, for cryin' out loud!"
10778,Bart,way over. we gotta save that poor girl. anyone know how we get home?
4891,Bart,i know a web site that shows monkeys doin' it.
8931,Bart,"oh, now i get it."
536,Bart,maybe it's for the best.
7136,Bart,"we're not enough fun for them? well, i know how to find out where they are."
508,Bart,i'd like to open with my impression of principal skinner.
2932,Bart,"well, you lucked out, marge my man, 'cause i'm in a smiling mood today."
13044,Bart,"party's over, serpent!"
2221,Bart,"uh, we should get to class."
524,Bart,"hey, pink hat, when i ordered that blueberry squishee, i meant today."
58136,Marge,"slow down, homer."
59497,Marge,sweet dreams.
65493,Marge,"ned, edna... we just want to apologize for the commotion in your room..."
67031,Marge,huh huh. and i'll bet he doesn't do well in his studies either.
65850,Marge,i hope someone saw our ad.
56208,Marge,and those!
55476,Marge,you're looking at her through a father's eyes.
56231,Marge,"we're all aware of grampa's problems, but compared to mr. burns, he's judge freaking reinhold!"
56229,Marge,"mom, you can't marry mr. burns! he's an evil man!"
61648,Marge,"bart, stop fooling with the remote!"
61820,Marge,why is everyone at this bakeoff such a meanie-bo-beanie?
59440,Marge,"that's it, bart. you're taking this man-of-the-house thing too far."
62894,Marge,you really mean that?
55769,Marge,oh my god. he's dead?
61450,Marge,they paddled up the mississippi from st. louis...
56424,Marge,no answer.
58835,Marge,you cashed in your 401 to buy that stupid canyonero. why can't you drive it?
64564,Marge,thank you.
63448,Marge,really?
63077,Marge,"homer, don't drink and drive!"
62024,Marge,i can't take any more!
56592,Marge,homer! tell the story right.
65538,Marge,quit bageling my english muffins!
57859,Marge,why not?
66751,Marge,okay then!
60965,Marge,here's five dollars. buy yourself a suit and get busy.
65179,Marge,"oh, i'll just have a side salad..."
64625,Marge,"what is it, ned?"
66964,Marge,"bart, what happened?"
64878,Marge,but i...
66176,Marge,"kirk van houten, i hope you're not having a midlife crisis."
67825,Marge,"oh, i don't know, i just dip in and out... i'm only watching today because brandy is coming out of her coma and she knows the phony prince's body is hidden in the boathouse..."
59425,Marge,"glad you made it, ned."
56794,Marge,he looks and acts just like the dealer. i think they're related or at least in cahoots.
60585,Marge,we have to do something to save that marriage. maybe i should just tell manjula. or you could talk to apu...
59868,Marge,i thought you had your own court.
65671,Marge,your father took you to a korean gangster film festival?
55899,Marge,no!
65117,Marge,"homie, it was maggie."
66389,Marge,no kennels!
61749,Marge,"you were right, homie. we shouldn't have rocked the boat. then none of this would have ever happened."
59415,Marge,i don't see why not.
57597,Marge,"don't worry, kids. this is a national park. we can have lots of fun."
59701,Marge,"now honey, let's turn on the news and forget our troubles."
65848,Marge,how about some fatties?
59155,Marge,thank you for stopping the tank.
55984,Marge,"i said, no."
56368,Marge,"no, i've already planned our vacation. we're going to the highway 9 bird sanctuary. i understand they've installed a new bird feeder this year."
64855,Marge,"homie, why don't you study these?"
62611,Marge,really?
60933,Marge,please give the church back.
56578,Marge,"i know, i know."
64754,Marge,mike scioscia! didn't you get radiation poisoning working at the springfield nuclear plant?
57674,Marge,"i hope you all saved room, because i made your favorite dessert: store-bought snack cakes! both kinds!"
60625,Marge,"i am so sick of doing her dirty work. she's taking advantage of us, homer."
66083,Marge,"yeah. alone, i'm sure."
67098,Marge,it's because of your irreverent attitude that bart thinks he can sneak headphones into sunday school.
56848,Marge,"oh, that's it. i'm gonna write you a ticket."
60221,Marge,"look, i don't want to start a whole thing with this."
55448,Marge,"well, maybe just a little."
65541,Marge,not with the camera on.
67572,Marge,mmmmmmmph!
65673,Marge,parenting shouldn't have a style! parenting is about bedtimes and passwords on computers and complicated punishments you never follow through on! are you wearing a wallet chain?! you look like... a barista!
63107,Marge,"homie, i realized that my most enduring creation is the life i've sculpted with you."
59798,Marge,"well, i studied art, and this guy's got a real gift."
62684,Marge,"mr. burns, isn't it more important that you got a child to smile at you?"
58843,Marge,"well, that's a first. i've never been able to fit thirty-two grocery bags into one car before."
57088,Marge,lisa's on the sleepy train / to rest her weary head / her ticket is a candy cane / made out of gingerbread.
56302,Marge,i can hit that one pin all right. but the rest of them don't even wobble.
65490,Marge,homer!
57133,Marge,"homie. as long as you keep the car full of gas, i'm happy."
63776,Marge,"uh, yeah..."
57737,Marge,"oh, bart, you didn't have to do that. oh!"
55281,Marge,was it lurleen?
65454,Marge,"no, honey. you just passed out when you saw the private bedroom in our triple upgrade!"
58827,Marge,what in the world?
59670,Marge,we can't go on fighting with olde springfield. these people are our neighbors. we see them every day.
62148,Marge,you hide food in my hair... you think brushing your teeth is foreplay...
63210,Marge,you should feel lucky. not many boys have parents who can afford to take them to the opera every night.
59810,Marge,"why, thank you, jack."
54747,Marge,oh my. where are we supposed to get a sitter on such short notice?
58242,Marge,"hmm... would you like a tall frosty one, homer?"
64378,Marge,homie?
59198,Marge,"oh, no!"
60233,Marge,a little much.
54602,Marge,uhhh... not exactly.
55630,Marge,dennis... brad... mavis... brad...
64255,Marge,he's the one getting the good reviews! which makes him the next one you've got to kill.
61175,Marge,let's admire nelson's love of nature.
67613,Marge,i didn't know you liked animals.
57539,Marge,you're not listening. you're only hearing what you want to hear.
62725,Marge,maybe he's getting married!
57918,Marge,"look, i knew private school would be expensive but i was hoping we could get a scholarship of some sort."
58572,Marge,"oh, homer, you're not going as a hobo again?"
59875,Marge,"no, it's a smooth motion... you follow through with your racket."
54881,Marge,"homie, please be all right."
58577,Marge,here comes the flying saucer!
61837,Marge,...because you let me down.
56240,Marge,that's nice.
56704,Marge,i don't think you're stupid.
66812,Marge,homer!
66323,Marge,i'm afraid wives don't make passes at husbands in those glasses.
59134,Marge,"""thank you in advance for a world-class meal. you're an inspiration to our entire organization. thank you again, bart."" ohh, what a lovely gesture!"
58544,Marge,drug lab?!
57782,Marge,homer! will you get that crazy box off the dinner table? it came from the dump.
55868,Marge,mr. hutz!
60861,Marge,"it looks like a purse, that's why i bought it, but it's really a--"
59089,Marge,bart!
67439,Marge,"see you after the game, when you're a big star."
64124,Marge,"oh yes, homer! yes!"
64286,Marge,i think you may have put on a little weight.
64267,Marge,henry the fifth... titus andronicus...
62650,Marge,that was yesterday.
60550,Marge,and now i'm guilty of possession! i could go to prison! unless i testify against you...
60150,Marge,"shh. no, we can't play now."
59205,Marge,look! it's jimmy carter!
66228,Marge,what about your own children?
66514,Marge,ooh! game night?
55501,Marge,"don't worry, homie. i'll take care of you."
55665,Marge,here you go.
59791,Marge,somebody help him!
63282,Marge,"well, at least it got made."
63203,Marge,homer...
65956,Marge,it's not what you think!
61614,Marge,this is so sad.
57330,Marge,"oh, finish your fish heads. then we'll talk."
67464,Marge,now i suppose you both have to sign this. i hope blood won't be necessary.
66280,Marge,that one creeps me out from the beginning.
64481,Marge,this is what you're like when you don't drink!
64202,Marge,janey.
66437,Marge,great! now we're raccoons -- the masked bandits of the animal world!
59977,Marge,"homie, did you remember to tip kitenge?"
62523,Marge,and i threw out all your old comics!
62627,Marge,"love always... 'm'."""
61017,Marge,how can you say that?
66613,Marge,no!
57768,Marge,it's crazy!
56184,Marge,"bart, don't throw peas at your sister."
57162,Marge,"didn't everybody have a wonderful time? i thought it was so opulent -- like the playboy mansion, but non-sexual."
66441,Marge,see what your greed has done?
57386,Marge,"yay, mom! all right, mom!"
66215,Marge,where is he?
67021,Marge,"uh-uh, homer. lisa's making these for her teacher."
61128,Marge,i guess i'll have to do all your driving chores. that's what a good wife does -- picks up the slack.
65026,Marge,and i wouldn't blame him. you destroyed our son's self-esteem.
61595,Marge,i hope he didn't have children. did he have children?
62949,Marge,this house is spectacular. you must have had a great view of the riots!
64949,Marge,really?
63383,Marge,i just meant we should split up to get out of this corn maze.
55548,Marge,"hmm, i think you have to keep your job too."
60786,Marge,can you save our house?
63036,Marge,darn these counter-sunk molly clamps!
59125,Marge,tommy lee...
59219,Marge,"oh, honey, give it up."
58541,Marge,"you disobeyed me, snuck over here, and murdered a helpless animal?"
65939,Marge,vodka? is this krusty's?
63871,Marge,"okay, here goes. bart, i have something for you!"
59915,Marge,"none of those girls has had three kids, i can tell you that."
60595,Marge,"manjula, we've got a special guest for you."
59037,Marge,homer! don't you think you're spoiling...
61060,Marge,"well, i love you, of course. but a lot of things you do still drive me crazy."
57284,Marge,this is so exciting. last time i got to go backstage was when bart ripped his pants at the christmas play.
57055,Marge,"lawyers... lawyers. ooh, lionel hutz. ""cases won in 30 minutes or your pizza's free."""
59106,Marge,homer doesn't know anything about making movies.
57366,Marge,thank you.
61472,Marge,"oh, my god! oh, my god!"
65114,Marge,so we're going to let the internet decide. should ned and edna stay together? visit thesimpsons.com and vote.
63856,Marge,oh no! those were for mr. smithers' commitment ceremony!
60784,Marge,your sister getting something nice doesn't hurt you in any way.
60275,Marge,"you know, we've been through some two hundred and eighty adventures together, but our bond has never been stronger."
67788,Marge,"oh for god's sakes, homer, it's an empty threat."
55844,Marge,bart. get dressed for school. i expect you to be in your seat when the bell rings.
62633,Marge,oh god.
61183,Marge,then i guess this means war.
64476,Marge,it's so noisy in here! i can't hear the ad telling everyone to be quiet!
62517,Marge,"ooh, such respect! you could grow up to be a doorman!"
56145,Marge,"homey, i'm very proud of you, but don't you think you're spending too much time with ned? your family needs you too."
61355,Marge,we've got pretzels at home.
56971,Marge,that giant donut.
56516,Marge,"here he is, rex harrison and paul anka rolled into one! that tonic really works! you and grampa should bottle it and go into business together."
57760,Marge,"lisa, you do whatever your conscience tells you."
59590,Marge,"oh, no. the ""brakes cut"" light."
59046,Marge,"hm. well, no one's forcing you to stay."
55048,Marge,there certainly are a lot of stains on the ceiling.
65571,Marge,darn car won't start.
59921,Marge,"lisa, how's your eiffel tower kit?"
59986,Marge,"stay in the boat, homer."
63129,Marge,what is all this?
66810,Marge,we love you!
62127,Marge,"can you help me unload this soup from the car? there was a sale, so i bought four hundred cans."
55248,Marge,"bart, from now on you'll have to get your hair cut for free at springfield barber college."
55916,Marge,"oh, for the love of..."
54620,Marge,"oh no, narcotics!"
58607,Marge,"a cell phone? last thursday's ""variety""?"
65497,Marge,"well, you're all invited, so you can make your snippy comments while you eat my hors d'oeuvres."
59350,Marge,molokai?!
65303,Marge,homie...
59926,Marge,"well, homie, i believe you're telling the truth about the isotopes."
67211,Marge,"you are not a blimp, homer. you're my big cuddly teddy bear."
65520,Marge,"i wish i was one of those young women who could just wave their hands in front of their eyes and not cry, 'cause it doesn't work for me."
56621,Marge,"what did you do today, bart?"
66750,Marge,you can't smoke!
54870,Marge,"bart, your father and i don't want you doing that. homer, say something."
67651,Marge,i'll have one of those.
61882,Marge,can i get you a glass of milk?
58423,Marge,"homie, you got your, your elbow in..."
63781,Marge,"if you ever come near homer again, i'll strangle you with your own hair extensions. that's right, i know."
65129,Marge,apology accepted. now could you teach me a couple little driving tricks?
55689,Marge,well surely you've all noticed the terrible condition main street is in.
60897,Marge,not any more!
66607,Marge,"homie, how much money do we have put aside in case something happens to you?"
61202,Marge,"oh, a rattle!"
54628,Marge,why not?
60740,Marge,"manjula, remember when apu cheated on you?"
56193,Marge,the point is the real simpson family missed you a lot and we're really glad you're home.
61309,Marge,yes.
62994,Marge,just make it happen!
61784,Marge,"relax, we're just looky-loos. we're only here to compare our lifestyle to our neighbors."
56490,Marge,oh really?
56605,Marge,oh yes.
55306,Marge,"that's them. now remember everyone, be understanding and forgiving for the sake of family unity."
67151,Marge,hmmm.
57486,Marge,now i remember why i put
55171,Marge,i missed you too.
66956,Marge,"homer, you're going, too."
66335,Marge,"maggie, he's here!"
63996,Marge,lisa? do you want to be best friends?
64722,Marge,"ooo, i wonder how much that one is. gotta look without looking like i'm looking."
62728,Marge,"homie, i've been thinking. we have been using this tv for a long time. so i entered a contest where the first prize is a plasma screen tv."
63001,Marge,"if we can't find a home for those animals, they'll be put to sleep. your sister's very upset."
63541,Marge,"well, promises mean more to me."
62478,Marge,he still thinks that hobo was a bird.
58089,Marge,it's awfully small.
67168,Marge,yes.
65500,Marge,no weird hookups!
56070,Marge,what?!
58608,Marge,"homer, when did you become a member of p.e.t.a.?"
61933,Marge,"homer, look!"
62364,Marge,"hold on, i'll be off in a minute."
61453,Marge,"and today, lewis' promise has been fulfilled."
61740,Marge,"if there's one way to get the truth out, it's on a cable news channel."
61090,Marge,why don't you just chase the beavers away?
58185,Marge,"well, well, well..."
56018,Marge,are you sure it's safe?
58787,Marge,"tomorrow?! well, that's too bad, mister. i'm not gonna bail you out this time."
55840,Marge,in a minute!
67233,Marge,who is this?
63829,Marge,i thought she gave you her rebellious spirit.
57575,Marge,"oh, no! no! don't do that! you're supposed to be tasting them!"
63913,Marge,"now let me tuck you in, fluff your pillow and sprinkle a little fairy dust to keep the monsters away. it's cinnamon! nightie-night, sweetheart."
60015,Marge,"arrest me?! um, my address, it's, um... 1-2-3... fake street."
61500,Marge,lisa!
62112,Marge,you keep almost dying. just look at our vacation photos.
65268,Marge,"she's coming home for christmas! and bart's bringing the boys! and lisa's coming with zia! for once, the whole family's going to be here for the holidays!"
60494,Marge,"joan, renounce your faith! save yourself!"
64833,Marge,they have a vaccine!
58530,Marge,he's up in his room. bart?
60525,Marge,"bart, what are you watching?"
64051,Marge,"homie, do you know anything about this?"
54624,Marge,"you're right. but i'm worried about what's on the horizon: reality shows, britney spears, the suspicious number of home runs being hit."
56889,Marge,i don't think we'll ever know who did this. everyone in town's a suspect.
61426,Marge,well?
56844,Marge,homer!
64548,Marge,i'm going to find my husband. but don't depress the kids.
55075,Marge,"homer, that's -- ohh!"
56471,Marge,he tripped my boy. i demand vengeance! i want vengeance!
56156,Marge,oh bart. cleaning doesn't have to be a chore. here... work to the music.
63016,Marge,"oh, the floorboard broke my nightstand."
54606,Marge,are the lasers supposed to burn you?
60324,Marge,dessert's on. i steamed some limes!
63787,Marge,"all right, i've got an idea -- but it'll take a lot of sewing."
59051,Marge,"wooh, wooh. look at those silk pillows. it's like the set of some high-class porno film!"
59022,Marge,"you're not flushing those springs down our toilet, are you?"
58105,Marge,"no, no. no tricks. it was salesmanship, that's all."
57065,Marge,-- you never know what --
58590,Marge,"nothing, nothing."
63832,Marge,my son's a good-for-something!
63944,Marge,"we sure did. rekindle, rekindle... okay, let's go."
63497,Marge,"maggie's so clingy! homer, hold her while i pour the milk!"
59777,Marge,"oh, homer, where have you been?"
57378,Marge,"i can't excape lisa, our little walking libary!"
56593,Marge,i don't know if it's such a good idea. can we get by on a pin-monkey salary?
56288,Marge,"honey, if you get too competitive you'll never be happy. no matter how good you are there's always gonna be someone better than you. i always thought i had the tallest hair. but that trip to graceland really opened my eyes."
60717,Marge,"i'm his groupie! am i saying that right, ""groupie?"""
57694,Marge,"oh, that sounds fabulous, homer. stores throw the best parties."
63496,Marge,"all right, i'll make you another bottle."
58384,Marge,my casserole is not filth. eat it.
67356,Marge,he sounds good. hire him.
57341,Marge,it does seem nicer than springfield.
67090,Marge,"oh, bart. now where's your father?"
57301,Marge,that was thoughtful.
62885,Marge,"oh, that's so sad."
65066,Marge,can you read by it?
67006,Marge,"...forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty. eighty-eight dollars and fifty cents."
66092,Marge,not a good time!
59071,Marge,homer!
65785,Marge,"homie, i just had a horrible thought."
56062,Marge,"legalized gambling is a bad idea. you can build a casino over my dead body! blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. blah, blah, blah. blah, blah, blah, blah, blah..."
57160,Marge,"oh, that reminds me of a funny apron i saw..."
61523,Marge,no we didn't.
62203,Marge,"that teddy bear survived three safety recalls, but it couldn't survive you!"
57149,Marge,"yeah. hi, evelyn."
55862,Marge,"uh... no, i-i guess i didn't."
64166,Marge,"wait a second, marge: do you really want to use your baby as a tool to spy on your husband?"
65385,Marge,what's going on?
64368,Marge,"oh, that's wonderful!"
60501,Marge,hamlet! what'd i tell you about running with swords?
60657,Marge,that commercial is very effective.
59943,Marge,stop! stop!
62528,Marge,me neither. oh my god! i took the salesman's pen. i'll be right back.
62106,Marge,"hey, hey, it's krusty the clown! what do you say, krusty?"
65084,Marge,because i have so much to tell you: the mailman did the other side of the street before our side. turns out it was a substitute.
66706,Marge,the one you booked for us at owl haven. the one you have to reserve a year in advance.
56289,Marge,"believe me, honey. she's more scared of you than you are of her."
67480,Marge,just stick it in the refrigerator when you're done. bart. bart?
58380,Marge,"whatever you say, sweetie."
63560,Marge,okay. but i-i'd feel better about it if you got rid of the gun.
57351,Marge,"it's up to you, homer. whatever you decide, that's what we'll do."
66544,Marge,"yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. i'm fine."
64809,Marge,no. just a picture of lisa. who wants to be nothing like me.
58579,Marge,oh my god!
65302,Marge,someone thinks we're leaving. i'll wave them off.
62692,Marge,"...uh, hmm, let's see, uh just a second uhh... oh, yeah sure, i'd be happy to baby-sit for rod and todd."
59490,Marge,"quiet, you two! you know your father's had a breakdown."
56758,Marge,"my, he certainly took that well."
65033,Marge,homer! homer!
57866,Marge,"homer, you're scaring the children."
61591,Marge,you really mean it?
59551,Marge,"see, honey? all you needed was to believe in..."
60670,Marge,hm. time to check in on our little sweetie pie.
59609,Marge,"becky, i want to apologize to you...surper!"
67419,Marge,"lisa, you're learning many lessons tonight and one of them is to always give your mother the benefit of the doubt."
63701,Marge,this is a terrible valentine's day.
59930,Marge,"goodbye, homie. here's dr. hibbert's number if you feel weak."
54632,Marge,"homie, i was so worried about you. i was really mad at you tonight, but you're a good person and that's what i see most of the time. whatever problems we have, we have a lifetime to work them out. together."
56364,Marge,my prom date.
64145,Marge,we are now eleven seconds behind schedule!
63258,Marge,nothing solves everything forever like a wedding.
64557,Marge,we're going to have to be good parents to our son and work twice as hard on our marriage.
66555,Marge,you're not mad anymore?
55850,Marge,oooh! oooooh! oooooooh!
67641,Marge,"what are you saying, homer?"
61223,Marge,this is more violent than the hip hop awards. you've got to stop your father!
57777,Marge,"oh, well, this is... um... the, uh... the listen lady!"
54928,Marge,"don't worry, honey, i'm sure your father is..."
65412,Marge,"well, we're having brunch with my sisters..."
58176,Marge,"oh, ned! i'm so sorry!"
61400,Marge,hmm... what should i write about?
67385,Marge,"let's go, children."
67144,Marge,a little warm and moist.
58628,Marge,"no, no one's ""going catholic."" three children is enough, thank you."
55669,Marge,"oh, homie, i was so frightened."
61769,Marge,"homer, i am so mad at you! i'll bet you blew up the town just to get out of cleaning the garage!"
67602,Marge,"really, why?"
55915,Marge,if you're going for a ride i'd like you to take bart and lisa.
60336,Marge,so your life is ruined.
55340,Marge,"but homer, we're the only family he's got..."
67780,Marge,"homer, my sister is not going out with barney gumbel."
56613,Marge,"homer, you had a head."
63230,Marge,"mr. burns, we're so sorry. the plan was just to use your back yard, and the next thing we know, mr. smithers is tied up in a grandfather clock."
66545,Marge,"right. right, nothing."
59067,Marge,are you going through our garbage?
64465,Marge,"well, i kind of got a clue when i heard that ""ballooning safety"" video."
61438,Marge,"""as temperance watched the two men she had loved and the one whale she admired disappear into the ocean, she realized it was... the end."""
59439,Marge,"i'm sorry, honey. i just thought you..."
67704,Marge,bien.
64240,Marge,four hundred years before kirk gibson would hit his famous home run.
56496,Marge,"you know, the courts might not work anymore, but as long as everybody is videotaping everyone else, justice will be done."
65477,Marge,homie's been working so hard i thought i'd bring him a special lunch.
57217,Marge,simpson! lie down!
65714,Marge,you've been through a traumatic experience. are you sure you wanna go to work today?
65139,Marge,he's not a bad boy.
62469,Marge,you already said that!
55909,Marge,i think this is a great opportunity. you could learn so much.
64140,Marge,"okay, it's go time."
57537,Marge,oh. come. come in.
64859,Marge,"no! for once, a pet ""going to a farm upstate"" really is going to a farm upstate."
66081,Marge,"such great characters, like buxton the scheming larder-keep. why can't lady cavendish see he's pilfering the aspic?"
62017,Marge,i know how to save this park -- i'm gonna organize a charity carnival!
60867,Marge,let's go home. there's nothing dangerous there except for the electrical wiring.
65779,Marge,do you have to do that in front of people?
56172,Marge,homie!
63227,Marge,"oh yes. i'm so proud, i feel my chest might burst. can you edit that? i don't wanna say ""chest"" in a movie."
64359,Marge,i always have.
54899,Marge,"well, thank you for calling. good-bye."
66138,Marge,perfect! perfect!
61308,Marge,"come on, homie. we'll go to the ""make your own sundae"" place."
59305,Marge,homer!
61100,Marge,you're tellin' me.
59314,Marge,"why don't you kick some books, lisa?"
54831,Marge,crazy house!
58597,Marge,"well, it looks like the lake is the place to be, huh?"
55757,Marge,lisa?
65336,Marge,"okay. let's ""esque"" him to dinner."
64863,Marge,"so, lisa. do you want an ostrich feather centerpiece?"
64740,Marge,"well, i learned a valuable lesson about wanting more than i could afford."
61470,Marge,cubic diamondium?
55203,Marge,"homie, come to bed."
59871,Marge,you'll never guess what i heard in the supermarket today. i found out we're the laughingstock of the town.
60277,Marge,"if i had known there were loose women in las vegas, i would never have let you go."
58002,Marge,"i'm talking about his ""personal area."""
63174,Marge,my childhood paradise -- it's a dump!
64958,Marge,there's a woman who's got it all under control.
55393,Marge,"you know, i spend all day alone with maggie... and sometimes it's like i don't even exist."
56438,Marge,"oh that's sweet, homer. our son is growing up, isn't he?"
57541,Marge,"please, let's just go to sleep."
55475,Marge,"homer, lisa's already sensitive about her looks. this is the last thing she needs."
62959,Marge,don't give up on buck. there must be something about him that attracted you in the first place.
61074,Marge,bart! that's not right.
57552,Marge,"well, we're trying to, but you're blocking our way."
60034,Marge,bart!!!
59866,Marge,would you boys like to play tennis?
56413,Marge,"homer, did you remember to lock the front door of the house?"
55267,Marge,"well, since we'll never agree, why don't you kids pick a movie, your dad and i will pick a movie, then we'll all meet in the lobby later. hmm?"
60393,Marge,mm-hmmm!
57884,Marge,"not to us you're not. i mean, how would you feel if you suddenly found out ned flanders was an impostor?"
59245,Marge,well the one sure cure for the blues is to talk it over with your life partner.
66292,Marge,homer! what are you doing out of prison? you have to go back and give yourself up.
55481,Marge,i know two fellas who are gonna get a special dinner tonight.
62957,Marge,"tabitha, what a coincidence -- i was just thinking sad thoughts about you!"
62561,Marge,"homer, please! we're about to have tea!"
61787,Marge,"homie, when i married you, i knew we wouldn't live in luxury."
66988,Marge,here we sit enjoying the shade.
62261,Marge,"this fat camp can save bart's life -- we have to find a way to pay for it. homer, maybe you could ask mr. burns for a raise."
58279,Marge,"homer, did you really steal a car?"
65724,Marge,"homie, i never thought we'd turn our backs on our loved ones at the first hint of trouble."
65446,Marge,there is no mrs. steak. who could stay married to such a man.
62892,Marge,i guess we have to move on.
62299,Marge,the warren harding through-hole never seemed so long.
60477,Marge,let's take a quick gambling break. a little action will really sharpen our senses.
63734,Marge,it's upstairs in my disappointment closet.
64444,Marge,let's call the whole thing off...icially onnnnn!
64496,Marge,well who made you the coach?
67408,Marge,i wonder if he's going to say anything about that horrible fish.
65999,Marge,i am so proud. i would've been happy if bart was just a piano mover.
55293,Marge,"all our money's tied up in this woman. if she fails, we're broke. if she succeeds, i have no husband. i don't know what to root for."
65372,Marge,a bunny! just like the one i had when i was a girl! how did you know?
64275,Marge,her building became one of the wonders of the world.
64494,Marge,my favorite subject. i'll go first. isn't he cute?
61440,Marge,"oh, homie! you're trying to improve yourself, and it's because of my book."
55433,Marge,why can't you be a little more supportive?
56266,Marge,"and i have a special present for you, but i'll give it to you later tonight."
64618,Marge,we can't let lisa get her hopes up.
57259,Marge,why not.
56635,Marge,"hold still, homer. don't squirm."
61635,Marge,shame on you two creeps!
59950,Marge,"no, i got it!"
62592,Marge,excuse me... mister mayor... they say you speak english?
62209,Marge,"well, he better high-five our roof!"
64245,Marge,that's nice.
64404,Marge,"oh, darn, the batteries are dead."
63250,Marge,nothing like un-tossing a leftover salad. it'll be like new!
56084,Marge,and my necklace.
59223,Marge,"well, i'm not crazy about the plutonium or nicotine, but it is very nice to see bart eating his vegetables."
57663,Marge,"mmm, i don't think he's married, homer."
57206,Marge,ye olde toast.
55820,Marge,"grampa, please. he's in a coma."
58063,Marge,i'm not getting back in this car until you drive like a sane person.
61297,Marge,you set out to fight an animal and you ended up saving its life.
67531,Marge,i wonder why bart and lisa are so late getting home from school?
58214,Marge,"i'm so proud of you, homer. you got us our house back."
60860,Marge,that's not a purse. it's a diaper bag.
55712,Marge,"no, he's a scientist."
63083,Marge,my lega-she!
65167,Marge,"come on kids, fun comes from inside -- it isn't about what we actually do."
60310,Marge,"that company's ruining the whole town's health, and i don't know how to stop them."
54874,Marge,how long does it take to deliver a pizza?
67278,Marge,"homer, i'd love a glass of that wine bart brought us."
63635,Marge,"homie, you look good!"
54850,Marge,"wow, the president's bathroom!"
61441,Marge,that's the best review i've gotten. seriously. these reviews are terrible.
64985,Marge,"don't worry, sweetie, this is just the first of way too many awards shows. you'll get your chance to say ridiculous things."
60163,Marge,bart!
61975,Marge,"maybe some cheerier paint would make this place less of a ""dive."""
55498,Marge,"oh hi, homie."
66989,Marge,drink the drink that i have made.
57130,Marge,"well, you can always take the motor out and use it as an ordinary tie rack..."
55619,Marge,bart!
59493,Marge,this looks like a terrible place to relax. we're gonna get you to a--
54645,Marge,just do it already!
58970,Marge,why aren't we ascending into heaven?
60438,Marge,it's only fair. we went to europe when lisa lost her balloon.
57829,Marge,"you know homer, we've all been busy as beavers preparing for our very own show."
60912,Marge,let's do it!
59453,Marge,not half as good as cyberfudge.
67907,Marge,yes.
65389,Marge,that's just not doing it for me.
64510,Marge,absolutely right.
58408,Marge,do it!
57548,Marge,"all right, helen, if i'm not wanted, i'll leave."
58268,Marge,"ooo, diego's not gonna like that."
59474,Marge,"yes, go! just go!"
57142,Marge,90 dollars?!
62682,Marge,"if you all don't drop your guns and behave, no one gets the gold."
65750,Marge,"homer, you do not have to compete with your friends for me."
63278,Marge,sideshow mel is in a custody battle? and it's turning bitter?
65495,Marge,this is my third favorite wedding supply store!
58510,Marge,it could save lives!
62564,Marge,i guess i'm not meant to have friends.
67555,Marge,the answer is all around you.
64756,Marge,i still think it's too violent.
61779,Marge,"although i must admit, they know where to stop."
61000,Marge,nutty fudgkins!
66704,Marge,"well, if he's gonna get a haircut, bart should at least have gotten a balloon with it."
59956,Marge,she's not afraid of bunnies.
55605,Marge,we pretty much went straight home.
63000,Marge,"i'm very happy for you, bart."
67616,Marge,"what do you think, homer?"
64409,Marge,a branch must've knocked out the power lines.
65891,Marge,"uh, i'm thinking of getting maggie swimming lessons."
60768,Marge,"it's for my back spasms. if guys didn't keep pinching my tush, i'd never stand up straight."
55425,Marge,it maght.
56863,Marge,"bart, you've graffito-tagged public property."
58531,Marge,"we need bart to help fold your father's underpants. where is he, anyway?"
64943,Marge,i've got summer squash!
62984,Marge,stop calling her that!
65777,Marge,a whole weekend? i don't know...
58039,Marge,"oh, hello, agnes."
56966,Marge,"sorry, force of habit. lisa, no!"
61122,Marge,my poor boy. will he be all right?
66468,Marge,it's not a punishment. but you can't just eat dinner. you have to be gentlemanly and attentive.
59262,Marge,"knock, knock!"
58972,Marge,"you know, homie, a lot of men use their saturdays to do things around the house, hint, hint."
57589,Marge,"oh, it just sickens me. how could you do this to someone you love?"
60417,Marge,homer was there?
58432,Marge,"when we got married, is this how you thought we'd be spending our saturdays? driving out to the boondocks to trade in a refrigerator motor?"
59660,Marge,"oh honey, i wouldn't say doomed. it's gonna be an adjustment, no question..."
66362,Marge,of course not. it's just duck.
66286,Marge,an illegal download? but hollywood says stealing from hollywood is wrong.
55611,Marge,"oh, homie, didn't that hurt?"
67947,Marge,i thought all the swords and severed heads were kind of gory so i redecorated using the hello kitty expansion pack.
58093,Marge,"ooo, i remember. mrs. astor was very lucky."
59600,Marge,yes.
66065,Marge,tell me more.
60490,Marge,it's never joan van ark.
64030,Marge,i can hardly believe this is real.
67684,Marge,the first step to liberation is to free ourselves from these... male imposed shackles.
55072,Marge,come home soon.
62596,Marge,here's a cute fact. this sausage shop has been grinding the same family of pigs for six hundred years.
56183,Marge,"c'mon, honey."
67911,Marge,yes.
65565,Marge,this says you are the manager.
63933,Marge,"homer simpson, i wish i'd never met you!"
62289,Marge,may eighteenth? that's one week from today!
56521,Marge,you tell bart all the time. you told him this morning.
61481,Marge,"and to remind you of what you've done, i'm going to keep these earrings and wear them at social occasions."
64652,Marge,"homer, no!"
58724,Marge,kids! / i can nag and nag till my hair turns blue...
65197,Marge,"ooo, triple spicy barbequed stingray stuffed with pig organs!"
66154,Marge,what are you doing?
61728,Marge,i kept my heart too.
58859,Marge,c'mon! c'mon! get that corpse off the road! the streets are for the living!
57907,Marge,homer!
57536,Marge,"i-is this about that pen that i took from the post office? i-i swear i didn't know i put it in my purse. then i was going to bring it back, but the dog chewed it up and that just made things worse..."
65404,Marge,"case closed! now, let's return our dream skis."
65078,Marge,"in a good marriage, you never say i told you so."
64125,Marge,"oh, it's beautiful. but that's an awful lot to pay for a dress i'll only wear once."
61831,Marge,"well, it's not my fault! lisa, the people in this bake-off are stinkers, who pushed me and pushed me, like the pushy-wushies they are!"
60840,Marge,orlando? are we going to sea world?
59746,Marge,what are you doing? why are you frosting that old throw pillow?
58501,Marge,"hm. i brought you a tuna sandwich. they say it's brain food. i guess because there's so much dolphin in it, and you know how smart they are."
55751,Marge,lisa.
55121,Marge,"homer, i can't help wondering where you're getting the money from?"
67227,Marge,princess who?
65166,Marge,your saturday surprise mom day is... the x-games!
66837,Marge,how can you follow a leader who won't even get up out of his chair?
62560,Marge,this is my husband homer.
65451,Marge,"yeah... actually, my mom stole it from a woman she cleaned for. it took her years to get the whole set."
57505,Marge,"ooh, look at that adorable spice rack!"
62460,Marge,where's my apology?
59005,Marge,yep.
66954,Marge,homer!
61009,Marge,"homer, we haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks, the dog has eaten all its hair...and the fixtures won't stay in one place."
67146,Marge,oh!
56154,Marge,i think you'll find that escape is impossible. now each one of you take a floor and get started.
56012,Marge,you're right. i am lucky to have him.
54654,Marge,there's no time! i need you for the wedding toast!
62749,Marge,that sounds horrible.
65043,Marge,"we'll do each other's nails, make some brownie sundaes, and watch the four saddest horse movies i could find."
55602,Marge,"bart, it's your bedtime. i laid out your jammy-jams."
64224,Marge,"and i've got a present for you, but you'll have to wait till we're back at the apartment."
62510,Marge,no.
57706,Marge,isn't that clever? it looks like a cadillac drove right into the building.
66450,Marge,"eu gostaria de um... hang on, hang on... placa de... hang on, hang on..."
58107,Marge,"look, just because everyone who lived in that house was hacked to bits, doesn't mean the flanders will be."
58120,Marge,"i couldn't agree more. from now on, it's plastic all the way."
58111,Marge,mm-hmm.
61488,Marge,my baby has no future!
57114,Marge,uh-huh.
57144,Marge,"oh, sure i do. i treated myself to a sanka not three days ago. but this is a real find."
61531,Marge,my husband's going to jail and it's all your fault! do you know why no one likes you?
65792,Marge,homer simpson! did you take maggie to moe's?
54637,Marge,i will!
63728,Marge,what's up?
65786,Marge,what if they are better for the kids than us?
60787,Marge,why do you always hire the cheapest guy?
61327,Marge,"oh, your thoughtfulness tastes so good. and tears are the sweetest sauce."
64631,Marge,i don't see what's so wonderful.
67949,Marge,as best you could.
65182,Marge,then i'll have that!
63390,Marge,it's just flanders. you know him.
59678,Marge,"well, you can't argue with results..."
56236,Marge,that's because you were drunk!
57423,Marge,"no, i had to go rent the bulldozer."
65621,Marge,there's exactly one rita lafleur living in springfield!
65780,Marge,"well, at least we have time to get the pets' christmas presents."
60450,Marge,i'm not sure i approve of selling whiskey to children.
62055,Marge,straight.
55973,Marge,"""mrs. simpson, while we were rescuing your husband, a lumberyard burned down."""
55980,Marge,don't wait up.
64495,Marge,but homer tries his best.
58844,Marge,"hmm, i thought it was sandy duncan."
66249,Marge,"bart, sweetie, this is an opportunity for you to turn things around, yet again. and i believe in you. yet again."
62287,Marge,"homer, you didn't touch your second dinner tonight. and you're reading books! word books! what's going on?"
62915,Marge,"what's wrong, sweetie?"
55285,Marge,i want you to stop seeing her.
61905,Marge,"you know, chloe, some of us stayed in this town and made it a better place."
63588,Marge,hold on -- i still have to caramelize.
67447,Marge,what exactly did he say?
56517,Marge,you could make a lot of money.
66598,Marge,"so, did your sailing adventure help you work out your issues?"
58719,Marge,when was the last time you played citizenship?
65469,Marge,"homer! people are here to see the movie, not listen to you!"
67293,Marge,"hello, i'd like to talk to dr. monroe."
64227,Marge,we can talk about that after brunch with my mother.
56246,Marge,"oh, well that will be..."
67340,Marge,"bart, honey... you're going to miss your bus!"
66884,Marge,actually... my friends and i are using a system to win money to save the church.
63811,Marge,"we know you love us, honey -- even though sometimes you show it in a ""quirky"" way."
64915,Marge,shh!!!
62616,Marge,"i've never noticed that sign before, and i'm a very good noticer."
59939,Marge,you can spit on the bus.
59819,Marge,scary talented. and i'm gonna make sure the parole board knows it.
55243,Marge,"bart, watch your language. oh. you did. sorry."
61170,Marge,"you won't be seeing milhouse for a while. something about that boy just shakes up your soda. ooh, this looks interesting: the pre-teen braves."
66381,Marge,"shut your eyes, they're too bright."
66978,Marge,"well, everything. your dip sign, for instance. now people won't be caught off-guard by that little in the road."
56637,Marge,"oh, for pete's sake, bart! use the plunger!"
58047,Marge,"please, lisa. i don't know exactly what's gonna happen, but i really wish we could make peace before sunset."
61660,Marge,no!
67852,Marge,"now, homer. we've got steamed vegetables and rice cakes for you."
65046,Marge,"actually, we pay them for each peach we take home."
66347,Marge,"okay, so helen lovejoy told me that she made her famous snicker doodle bundt cake for the church sale, and she put in salt instead of sugar!"
60161,Marge,"aw, i'm glad you two are friends again so we can all have thanksgiving dinner together in this bar."
63388,Marge,"i love santa's little helper, but i don't know if we can have him in our home anymore."
63305,Marge,what are you kids doing up so late?
63823,Marge,say something comforting.
67102,Marge,gambling.
59373,Marge,this all seems a little elaborate for sloppy joes.
59386,Marge,"oh, homie, i don't care if you're a billionaire. i love you just because you're..."
55532,Marge,well punish him!
64801,Marge,my whole childhood is in this box! my scrunchies! i never really had the hair for these.
61047,Marge,"turn it over, homer."
56279,Marge,"i'm sorry, but i sacrificed a very expensive camera just to get some quiet time."
55595,Marge,don quixote?
65250,Marge,"yours, homie. i'm always on yours."
63457,Marge,"i understand, homie."
63723,Marge,i'm sorry i'm so emotional.
58711,Marge,no!
64821,Marge,is it a girl?
66229,Marge,three.
55022,Marge,you don't know homer like i do. he's sensitive and sweet.
60526,Marge,bert and ernie left it to your imagination.
61434,Marge,the harpooned heart ii: thunder down under. chapter one. temperance barrows stared at the shrimp on the barbie...
66032,Marge,you don't know where carl is from?
66895,Marge,i'm going to do what i should've done in the first place.
55578,Marge,"homer, mr. burns gave me another raise today."
55287,Marge,your boyhood dream was to eat the world's biggest hoagie. and you did it at the county fair last year. remember?
66740,Marge,bart! hold the ladder still!
57535,Marge,"hello, can i help you?"
59813,Marge,"oh jack, that's so soulful. how did someone so sensitive end up here?"
65849,Marge,"okay, post this under ""men seeking men,"" but what sub-heading... nothing too serious... here we go -- ""casual encounters!"" perfect, no pressure!"
63382,Marge,i was talking about--
56061,Marge,i was for the casino!
59837,Marge,"just till you make it. remember, i believe in you."
64287,Marge,"i'm glad you've got such a stimulating substitute, but i'm worried about mrs. krabappel."
57077,Marge,okay.
65130,Marge,we'll see who gets their pick of pizza pockets!
67383,Marge,"that does it. children, get dressed. we're leaving."
65186,Marge,"so, did all of your cars break down?"
59261,Marge,"yes, dear. from the nuclear plant."
64757,Marge,these classic board games are fun and safe.
65524,Marge,"homer, we can buy scotch tape tomorrow!"
62096,Marge,"thank you, mr. simpson."
66120,Marge,poor guy.
59676,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?!"
58072,Marge,i passed!
58718,Marge,why don't you kids play one of your old board games?
58523,Marge,"that was no accident! shame on you, nelson."
67129,Marge,"well, it's hard for me to judge since i've never bowled in my life."
56961,Marge,what's wrong lisa? didn't you get enough lamb chops?
58263,Marge,perfect. you'll grow into them.
55021,Marge,it's homer!
58826,Marge,homer?
65603,Marge,you were pocket-dialed!
64190,Marge,am i?
67241,Marge,homer! what happened?
57182,Marge,the outlet store.
65126,Marge,"and when there was a map-maker's convention here, they all got lou gehrig's disease."
61163,Marge,what?!
56571,Marge,could you start fixing it pretty soon? the basement is getting awfully flooded. and i think the cat's down there.
58981,Marge,no i'm not. i just can't believe some people are paying hundreds of dollars for something a hillbilly pulled out of the trash.
62812,Marge,what'd you call me?
57516,Marge,"don't ""soul mate"" me!"
64983,Marge,you ate his yogurt in the car.
57654,Marge,"i'm sure she'd be proud that her descendants had piping hot tap water and plenty of warm, dry underwear."
56770,Marge,thank you.
55949,Marge,"lisa, your brother's obviously had a nightmare. don't worry, honey, the scary part's over."
59446,Marge,i don't see the need for razor wire.
60070,Marge,townspeople...
58441,Marge,"oh, knock it off, you perverts."
62599,Marge,"bob, your generosity and abondanza have touched our hearts."
65827,Marge,can you find anything you like in this bed?
60930,Marge,how bad is it?
61902,Marge,well... oh. we finally found out why the dog was scooting around on his butt all day. turns out he had an impacted anal gland.
64975,Marge,"odd, that's what the valet just asked me."
58667,Marge,you can get drunk when we get home.
56638,Marge,oh my.
54633,Marge,fraternity pledges in their beanies...
64203,Marge,ooh! that's bart's class.
62566,Marge,the nationwide social organization for women of a certain age?
56148,Marge,"but, why would the advisory board give us bad advice?"
62802,Marge,marge obedience temperance sexwon't.
60916,Marge,"starting tomorrow, i'm gonna up my glyco-load, use a denser ripping gel..."
56952,Marge,bart!
60073,Marge,this reminds me of our shotgun wedding.
61674,Marge,"homie, the waiter's still here."
67188,Marge,"goodbye, bart. my special little guy."
62752,Marge,"yes, i could really picture him. with curly shoes. and smoke all over the place. you're a born storyteller."
58138,Marge,that was close.
58992,Marge,it's so exciting to do something cultural together.
56221,Marge,"bart! homer, what possible reason could you have against grampa being in love?"
60807,Marge,all of you stink so much.
66208,Marge,why are you saying that?
61993,Marge,"homie, i'm tired. i have to get up early to catch my flight."
63454,Marge,it's marge simpson. i need you to coach like you've never coached before.
57696,Marge,"maybe people don't want an eight-year-old babysitter, honey. parents need to be sure their sitter can handle anything that might happen. that's why they hire teenagers."
66096,Marge,show's over! whoo! that turned ultra-steamy in a jiff!
64272,Marge,"but her teacher, mr. ellsworth toohey, wanted every child to conform."
58252,Marge,what business enterprise?
61165,Marge,"ned, i am so sorry."
59787,Marge,"no, ""smapron."""
66157,Marge,not me!
61843,Marge,"homer, the capital of kentucky is frankfort."
56799,Marge,"uh, i must warn you, um, uh, sometimes ordinary people g-g-get a surge of uh- adrenaline. wee-aah!"
58402,Marge,"can you help him, doctor?"
55575,Marge,"mr. burns, you want to see me?"
63599,Marge,"you really don't know, do you?"
67394,Marge,"well, thank you very much, mr....?"
59105,Marge,"um, will you be reading the cards yourself, mel?"
63112,Marge,i wish i'd married lenny and his friend!
58208,Marge,we can't just give up our home. there's gotta be a way to get those guys out of there.
66062,Marge,good question.
60118,Marge,and unusual.
66000,Marge,bart!
65283,Marge,that's toothpaste!
55363,Marge,"homer, he knows how to work a light switch."
57335,Marge,ow! i don't understand why we have to build a ray gun to aim at a planet i never even heard of.
62805,Marge,oh don't stop -- you're choking him just the way his father used to.
59204,Marge,looks like you were saved by a christmas tree.
61149,Marge,maybe we should see a counselor.
57453,Marge,i feel terrible. the van houtens split up at our party.
58930,Marge,the light's on. all systems are ding-dong!
62999,Marge,"see, lisa. we're making progress."
54992,Marge,"well, duh."
67094,Marge,"c'mon everybody, we're late. bart, i want you to promise me you'll pay attention in sunday school. bart? bart? bart!!"
65741,Marge,"i'm not sure if you gave my son any... extra help. but if you did, thank you."
67315,Marge,"thank you for coming on such short notice, ms. botz."
61499,Marge,"well, then... find a new identity."
67276,Marge,"goodbye, adil. it was a pleasure..."
62303,Marge,"honey, you can be anything you want to be."
66828,Marge,what?!
60612,Marge,"oh, and this kitchen isn't?"
56865,Marge,"oh, homer, would you please help me make a big deal of this?"
57302,Marge,put food in me.
67295,Marge,"well. when we were dating he was sweeter, and more romantic, and forty pounds thinner, and he had hair, and he ate with utensils."
63151,Marge,that photoshopping freak!
66109,Marge,what a wonderful anniversary.
62361,Marge,i guess i'd better tell them i'm coming home.
61340,Marge,"they make the blue man group look like mummenschanz, which is still pretty good. oh. the second one wants custard, too. that's a little repetitive."
63101,Marge,"well, homer, you destroyed my artwork and my dreams. good job. very thorough."
61093,Marge,don't rightly know. i just soaked up the lingo like a biscuit in a bucket full of gopher gravy. i'll stop now.
55261,Marge,not one that i want the public to see.
59749,Marge,"uh, sure looks that way... but at least bart and homer are spending quality time together."
64108,Marge,that's not how a family vacation works. we do things together while your father has fun without us.
66267,Marge,all eggnog is terrible!
65052,Marge,"so, that's why lisa excused herself a few minutes ago."
61368,Marge,"you're my rock, homie."
65821,Marge,now what are you doing?
65662,Marge,maggie's a little hungry.
54961,Marge,"lisa, i hope you realize that your father can't keep this up."
61352,Marge,"then, i guess this means war. with the most powerful weapon at my disposal: a voter-sponsored initiative."
55342,Marge,i wish they had never invented fried cheese!
56671,Marge,"i'm sorry. all we have is nescafe. i'm very, very sorry."
63866,Marge,bart simpson's stolen cell phone -- can i help you?
62518,Marge,uh... she died.
65003,Marge,"um, hello... i'm marge simpson... i think i've given you money a of couple times..."
65832,Marge,the top of your head has a five o'clock shadow.
62619,Marge,what the hello kitty?
67714,Marge,"you knew the city forensics finals are tomorrow. and you kept me here until one a.m. pretending to be stupid. homer j. simpson, i hate you!"
54692,Marge,"oh homer, i didn't want you to find out this way."
55332,Marge,i don't understand this. why can't you stay with your parents?
62222,Marge,"yeah, i bet the old people will be acting like young people, like in those cell phone ads everyone hates."
56583,Marge,"no. the family simpson, which has just five members. and only two of those members have special rings."
61344,Marge,i bake apple pies!
61479,Marge,you're panhandling! i should have known from that panhandling sign! plus that ticket you got for panhandling.
55633,Marge,we're going to have another baby.
63891,Marge,so i can't always be there for bart. he's got to learn to take care of himself.
55791,Marge,"are you sure, doctor?"
60274,Marge,here's the keys.
57703,Marge,"oh, it's so beautiful! this is what i imagine paris must be like!"
62039,Marge,fresh fr-fr-fresh for mommy's baby boy
63591,Marge,"but some of my best friends are... fine, you can stay."
67174,Marge,it's a very challenging hobby.
56340,Marge,"this was a wonderful idea, homie."
65626,Marge,that kind of romance leads to children.
66832,Marge,"homer, you have to choose. and i think the choice is clear."
56330,Marge,you didn't have to drop me off.
64394,Marge,you could wash this iceberg lettuce.
60817,Marge,three minutes forty seconds -- a new personal best!
56615,Marge,you've worked hard at the bowling alley. why don't you ask for a raise?
64464,Marge,"so bart, how's your big school presentation coming along?"
65751,Marge,enough with the singing!
61675,Marge,would you two just shut up!!
60563,Marge,"now before we get there, you have to put this blindfold on."
56771,Marge,ohh...kids have been doing that one since my day.
55452,Marge,come on. we're going to be late.
56588,Marge,"all right, family time begins now."
57788,Marge,"hello, listen lady."
66499,Marge,"well, i don't miss his nonsense. there's a lot of stuff he blamed on raccoons that i'm starting to suspect was him."
62396,Marge,"this is a little too spooky for me. i don't even like watching ""the count"" on sesame street."
56579,Marge,"homer, a man who called himself ""you know who"" just invited you to a secret ""wink wink"" at the ""you know what."" you certainly are popular now that you're a stonecutter."
65911,Marge,he's taken a step. he's really close. all he has to do is not eat a piece before i do.
61184,Marge,those cavalry kids are bigger credit hogs than the red cross.
59855,Marge,so many restaurants...
61704,Marge,i got the idea from a now-discredited book on raising children.
60392,Marge,for the last twenty years!
60772,Marge,eighty-nine percent of americans would rather have a shoehorn than a computer.
57704,Marge,"i'm so honored that springfield has been chosen to host all these upscale chain stores. i guess this makes us ""yuppies,"" huh, homie?"
61982,Marge,"boy, what a night! moe showed me how to give someone the bum's rush. here, watch."
60098,Marge,not a very good one?
58406,Marge,"oh, sorry."
58682,Marge,aren't you going to give him the last rites?
62394,Marge,we have to stop all this construction. the noise is jiggling my grapes to the bottom of the jell-o.
55143,Marge,fruit leather... tree fresh imitation orange drink... krusty brand duck sausage pizza...
63244,Marge,"dr. swanson, i'm bart's mother. i've been saving this money for my husband's breast reduction surgery. but i think this is more important. would you please see bart again?"
60594,Marge,"i keep telling you. off camera, he's a desperately unhappy man. but if we remind apu and manjula of why they fell in love, maybe they can work out their problems."
62116,Marge,i'm not gonna worry just because homer doesn't have insurance. a lot of people don't!
64170,Marge,"okay, no more delays. i've got to watch this."
65727,Marge,"homer simpson! when i fell in love with you, it was because of your big heart and your good looks. but some day those good looks are gonna fade."
60964,Marge,i don't think this is a good place for a ten-year-old boy.
65217,Marge,my dessert!
59737,Marge,yeah?
57471,Marge,"i will. oh homie, of course i will."
64304,Marge,"call me a killjoy, but i think that because this is not to my taste, no one else should be able to enjoy it."
62935,Marge,"for the last time, no!"
54794,Marge,"sixteen permanent, eight baby."
64523,Marge,"i don't know what the big deal is. i mean, it never bothered any of you that my father's french. you know, bouvier?"
56839,Marge,"hello, lisa. help me bite crime. ruff, ruff."
54930,Marge,no.
63747,Marge,chazz busby says you're really making progress! do you need more leg warmers?
58752,Marge,"your character provides the comic relief. like... ohhh... marlon brando in ""apocalypse now."""
67077,Marge,"oh, i don't think they'll be gone long and she's in good hands, lisa."
60878,Marge,"ten, ten, ten, ten..."
60301,Marge,"well, i'm going to have a talk with them. where are their worldwide headquarters located?"
61066,Marge,"homer, let it go. it's not always going to be perfect. we've been married for ten years."
64574,Marge,do you have any safety tips?
66909,Marge,...homer sends his love. happy holidays.
64866,Marge,"wrong holiday, stupid!"
64995,Marge,see?
66001,Marge,"bart, i've never been so proud of you. never, never, never!"
64246,Marge,all i have are some dry-cleaning coupons.
62270,Marge,"lisa, that sounds like a fancier version of the song you're going to sing!"
57196,Marge,"what are you going to spend your money on, kids?"
62983,Marge,someone poisoned these meatballs. homer...?
55882,Marge,i hope you find somebody.
63964,Marge,homie... i'm not sure about this new business of yours. you're making it too easy for couples to break up just because they hit a rough patch.
61134,Marge,to hell with the livery commission!
54938,Marge,"homie, you've got to stop looking for the quick fix. if you keep spending time with lisa, she'll forgive you."
57009,Marge,"that's ridiculous. homer's not dead, he's right out back in the hammock."
65589,Marge,you never told me about that.
63498,Marge,"oh, i don't want to bother the internet with my problem."
65947,Marge,tell her she's wrong!
56292,Marge,"homer, homer!"
55550,Marge,maybe i should apply for that job.
65820,Marge,maybe we should go.
62059,Marge,"so tell, tell. who's the lucky man? what does he do? let me guess: does he work in customer support?"
57755,Marge,"they're not going to close the plant, are they?"
61221,Marge,"homer, it's trash day. will you just take him out to the curb?"
67533,Marge,because i said so.
64385,Marge,"dammit, why won't you touch me?"
66045,Marge,"oh homie, what a wonderful anniversary!"
65357,Marge,that was the last springfield radio station. now we just get shelbyville talk radio.
57885,Marge,my next-door neighbor? religious guy?
56664,Marge,"homer, wake up. there's still a few minutes 'til our usual bedtime."
60429,Marge,"goodnight, homie."
63793,Marge,roger that.
56500,Marge,don't turn on the light! don't turn on the light!
67723,Marge,why are you doing this? why can't you accept that i'm here with someone else?
64562,Marge,you mean... he kissed her?
55381,Marge,"good-bye my special little guy. lisa, watch out for poison ivy. remember, ""leaves of 3, let it be."
56394,Marge,kids?
64448,Marge,you like potato... you like tomato...
60745,Marge,"doctor, before we begin, i have a couple questions."
62085,Marge,he's done good things for you too.
61130,Marge,we'll see.
66784,Marge,you've been working so hard lately. maybe you should take a break.
63830,Marge,homie?
59978,Marge,nobody's a warthog.
61251,Marge,"principal skinner, can't you just reinstate those programs?"
58873,Marge,"outta the way! move it or lose it! get going, you!"
67827,Marge,i don't know.
57511,Marge,you promised you wouldn't drink!
65623,Marge,"homer, she's married to your dad!"
57826,Marge,remember me? my name is marge! / the tv mom whose hair is large!
67547,Marge,"it stands for ""springfieldians"
55318,Marge,"go ahead, patty."
62452,Marge,"hi, sweetie."
66912,Marge,"all right, children. let me have those letters. i'll send them to santa's workshop at the north pole."
54763,Marge,sure.
62330,Marge,where's homer and bart?
67323,Marge,don't muss my hair.
57012,Marge,"oy, yoy yoy yoy yoy."
60697,Marge,"""dear homie, had to buy diapers for maggie. love, marge."""
60180,Marge,absolutely. you're about to get a lesson... in value!
67750,Marge,"well, then maybe you should pay for it."
67018,Marge,"homer, how wonderful. our first pleasant surprise."
55037,Marge,what card?
63503,Marge,"well, maybe i wanted another freezer!"
61605,Marge,"homie, what are you doing?"
54912,Marge,"ugghh, homer. where did you get that ugly thing?"
66458,Marge,"homie, what happened?"
59268,Marge,"oh, look at all that sweet n' low."
60689,Marge,oh well.
64907,Marge,"seven years. a lot of memories. talking, chatting..."
56099,Marge,well...
67893,Marge,"umm... hello. my name is marge simpson and i painted this. maybe you'd like to know what possessed me to do it. well, i guess i wanted to show that beneath mr. burns' fearsome head with its cruel lips, spiteful tongue and evil brain, there was a frail withered body -- perhaps not long for this world -- as vulnerable and beautiful as any of god's creatures."
60248,Marge,"oh. hello, lisa."
54725,Marge,"children, it's time for you to go to bed."
61760,Marge,"i wish we could go back, but i don't think we're welcome there."
64937,Marge,"what's wrong, homie?"
62363,Marge,i love you too...
59756,Marge,they're arresting him right now!
64930,Marge,i think they were never my friends... maybe true friends aren't random people you meet at a mommy and me class. they're random people you meet in a college dorm.
58414,Marge,"hm, i guess we'll have to take the kids with us to dinner."
59007,Marge,"ooh, i don't know. could be. i need some inspiration."
64550,Marge,"till the two of us are back on track, bart can fend for himself."
58982,Marge,"homie, i'm really happy you sold your sculpture -- but don't you think it may have been a fluke?"
66599,Marge,but that's so many sandwiches!
58140,Marge,bart! you're up early.
65410,Marge,your father must be sleeping on his side again.
55437,Marge,my name is blanche dubois.
56879,Marge,i have an idea.
56549,Marge,i don't think so.
66855,Marge,"you're welcome. and if you really want to get your belly button pierced, go see a professional."
62030,Marge,just poke through.
63225,Marge,"bart, you're too young to get married! you still make me check the closet for the boogeyman!"
60405,Marge,are you snoring while you're awake?
59287,Marge,none of you? really? i could have sworn that ramrod...
56735,Marge,"homer, hold on to the wheel!"
62850,Marge,wha--?!
54746,Marge,hello. i'm mrs. simpson.
59271,Marge,it's clever how the names remind you of the fifties and at the same time tell you what there is to eat.
60004,Marge,they're for after dinner.
62909,Marge,"oh, and there's a familiar name. and another one. wait, what-what ever happened to that guy from the network? did he get married?"
65207,Marge,1501 w-- east oak street.
56722,Marge,now throw compost on it!
65556,Marge,"homer, when are you going to fix this faucet?"
60014,Marge,it was an accident!
59196,Marge,homer...
60950,Marge,"your father invested it in a college trust fund, which today must be worth a..."
58075,Marge,for me?
57451,Marge,maybe we should all have a few drinks.
65458,Marge,"any place is fun if you're there with ""super lips."""
55624,Marge,"uh, well..."
59605,Marge,i'm not insane!
63505,Marge,i'm what?!
55537,Marge,"look, you have to help discipline your son."
62178,Marge,he's turned it into a prison!
56341,Marge,"yes, what did happen to her?"
55876,Marge,"homer, i don't think this fish is quite dead yet."
64705,Marge,"aw, you think i forgot you? babies shouldn't jump to conclusions!"
55713,Marge,it's not batman!
67067,Marge,"i don't think we can afford this, homer."
60196,Marge,"congratulations, i feel ridiculous."
66274,Marge,any more questions?
67121,Marge,homer?
67197,Marge,you certainly have a lot of bowling trophies.
61890,Marge,sometimes you have to adopt your son's bully in order to bring your own family temporarily closer.
61292,Marge,that man and his foolish pride! we've gotta go follow him.
57443,Marge,"lisa, quick. screw these back on."
63619,Marge,maybe i'll just hit the showers.
66366,Marge,"but ned, saying nay is your thing."
57734,Marge,"homer, this is yours."
60576,Marge,you mean i shouldn't punish bart at all?
55247,Marge,"no. i'm afraid we're just going to have to make a few sacrifices. homer, you're going to have to give up beer for a while."
57381,Marge,there's not enough room!
63573,Marge,love ya.
58562,Marge,run for it.
66297,Marge,i was just trying to do the right thing! who would have thought the authorities would use a confession against me?
61806,Marge,"in the ovenfresh bakeoff, clever presentation is as important as taste. so i'm entering my dessert dogs!"
64627,Marge,"i don't know... i'm starting to think we're prying too much into people's lives, and this room isn't really the best place for maggie to hang out."
67594,Marge,"hmmm, but that's michelangelo's david. it's a masterpiece!"
62742,Marge,that's wonderful!
54712,Marge,hm... could this show help me with eating cheating?
57045,Marge,"goodnight, dear."
60250,Marge,"lisa, we love you and we're not trying to put any pressure on you."
59891,Marge,"now lisa, you know that's not true."
64319,Marge,listen... i'm late for a p.t.a. meeting.
64151,Marge,i'm just happy you're back. now let's get that chain off you.
56777,Marge,"that's a very nice jig, kearney. now, isn't dancing much more fun than bullying?"
58144,Marge,so you can see why my husband had to lie to you a moment ago.
55699,Marge,"goodnight, homer."
62104,Marge,"plus, we get free apple, orange and grapefruit juice!"
59400,Marge,hmm. should the simpsons get a horse?
59381,Marge,"homer, you've got to stop pretending this is your house. you're not a billionaire."
58134,Marge,people saw our story on the news and they've opened their hearts to us!
57124,Marge,"well, you could hand out these flyers for the neighborhood rummage sale."
62125,Marge,no more directory assistance! it's not free!
66897,Marge,"maybe we got it all wrong praying for things we want and hoping we get them. maybe prayer is just taking a moment to tell yourself that there is good in the universe. and i'm going to sit here and focus on that good, and maybe, just maybe, i'll get my husband back."
62836,Marge,strangers getting married?! i wouldn't miss it for the world!
62614,Marge,"i knew you'd forget, so my gift to you is a gift for you to give me."
65447,Marge,"just try to enjoy your dinner, sweetie."
60401,Marge,what?
57735,Marge,"i'm sorry, honey. here, you can have the junk mail."
66059,Marge,"save that sugar for your coffee, bub."
57819,Marge,"you're afraid to go to work because frank grimes will be there, aren't you?"
67735,Marge,why so glum?
58909,Marge,"well, maybe the animals don't mind, honey. they might enjoy being the center of attention."
56898,Marge,no. we can't start thinking that way about our own family members. suspicion could tear us apart.
58943,Marge,"who cares?! no one could ever get sick of this song. ""suddenly appear..."""
59011,Marge,are you talking to me or the beer?
56092,Marge,"homer, wasn't the whole point to catch the cat burglar?"
57488,Marge,it's dying down!
64103,Marge,maybe we should get out now.
67258,Marge,'bye. we miss you.
57966,Marge,what do you recommend?
60063,Marge,"ooh, what a handsome man!"
62246,Marge,"oh, so i've been replaced by a machine?"
61410,Marge,"oh homie, i've had the most exciting day..."
67759,Marge,"here you go, homie."
55542,Marge,"homer, that's dish washing liquid!"
59508,Marge,"ohhh, it's so cozy."
66925,Marge,where's that bart?
61422,Marge,i suppose i better. your father's a very private person.
62294,Marge,"i'm so proud of you, homie!"
63416,Marge,what can i say? maggie and i share a special bond.
60978,Marge,it's on my apron.
67002,Marge,"are you coming in, homer?"
59177,Marge,no more murders.
67652,Marge,"i'm sorry, homer. have you thought about what you want to tell the kids?"
54796,Marge,"i don't want you wearing rings, it looks cheap, but three."
60398,Marge,"homer, don't talk with your mouth full. i've told you before, it's rude."
67553,Marge,have fun.
61816,Marge,she is not!
61557,Marge,"the best part is, i don't have to ask your father where he was all night, because i was there!"
54955,Marge,"homer, where have you been? i was so worried."
62465,Marge,"oh, homie..."
59375,Marge,"homer, watch your lang... oooooh. that's a lifesaver."
59511,Marge,and y'all hardly ever bicker anymore.
62558,Marge,i read an article about it at the tire store. did you know it's not named after someone named wayne scott?
67782,Marge,"telephone, homer."
65742,Marge,"would you... like to have coffee, or dinner, or just talk?"
65190,Marge,"uh, kids... don't forget about our special plans saturday night."
62141,Marge,what are all these recreational vehicles doing here?
54738,Marge,shhh.
62790,Marge,you're just a sweet guy from springfield who wanted his family to have a better life.
62048,Marge,"excuse me, reverend."
55361,Marge,herb! how have you been?
64479,Marge,"ooh, ice skating."
59484,Marge,i don't know. i'm trying to sleep.
64889,Marge,everyone shush!
63022,Marge,that's right.
67273,Marge,remember to dress warm and try to be as helpful as you can to your adopted parents.
64307,Marge,"pleased to meet you, chett."
63430,Marge,don't you love that clean-mouth feeling?
57237,Marge,sounds like you're really falling for him.
67497,Marge,"homer, this is a terrible thing that's happened, but we can't blame ourselves."
61825,Marge,these other dishes look so pretty. and those cheaters blackened my sugar wieners. i'd like to give those betty crookeds a taste of their own medicine. yes... medicine.
66077,Marge,i want to be very clear. i'm a happily married woman. going on ten years. the aluminum anniversary! nothing turns leftovers into swans like aluminum!
64007,Marge,there are limits to how much two people should be together.
62424,Marge,maggie!
62288,Marge,"three million, one hundred and--"
57223,Marge,"bart, lisa! it's 11 o'clock at night. where do you think you're going?"
57630,Marge,"that shary bobbins is a miracle worker. the kids love her, the house is spotless -- and my hair's grown back. it's so full and thick it can support a beach umbrella!"
62342,Marge,"now bart, isn't this the kind of religion you'd like to be a part of for all eternity?"
64669,Marge,good. that'll give me something to do while you're at the game.
55650,Marge,homie... i think the baby's coming.
63296,Marge,"for amusement only... ""credit card information may be sold to korean gangsters""..."
66765,Marge,i thought i had one of those chirping keys.
67479,Marge,here you go.
59409,Marge,so many horses. i don't know who to vote for. can't i just bet that all the horses will have a fun time?
59266,Marge,maybe you two should get a nanny.
66955,Marge,"nurturing your brilliant brain, so i got tickets to the opera tonight. hurry up, get dressed! it starts at eight."
62154,Marge,"oh my god, there they are!"
61881,Marge,she's still your mother. come inside.
64263,Marge,"oh homie, you were brilliant. i knew you could do it. i knew it..."
55006,Marge,"don't worry. whatever happens, we'll pay the bills somehow."
59267,Marge,ohhhhh.
58448,Marge,"oh, my heart's beating like crazy."
66635,Marge,"gil, i've been meaning to tell you, you're fired."
57798,Marge,of course he did.
62277,Marge,haircuts!
67500,Marge,"oh, my special little guy! we were so worried!"
54878,Marge,principal skinner!
57033,Marge,"kids, everything's going to be okay! don't panic! just don't panic!"
67562,Marge,when do we want it?
55931,Marge,well why can't i be greedy once in awhile?
64584,Marge,you people are so pushy.
56964,Marge,i didn't mean to take sides. i just got caught up in the rhythm.
64595,Marge,"you remember dylan. you were in ""toddle tots"" together."
66916,Marge,you will not be getting a tattoo for christmas.
67798,Marge,now this is spoiling them.
57544,Marge,"oh homie! homie, i'm so sorry i doubted you!"
62218,Marge,and why is the hole in the roof even bigger?
67365,Marge,"homer, are you still awake?"
66222,Marge,that is pretty good.
66716,Marge,"finally. a normal person. thank you, miss... um..."
59447,Marge,when i get home there are gonna be a lot of open pickle jars.
60756,Marge,yes!
66527,Marge,no.
61511,Marge,how do we get out?
62527,Marge,"oh, well, we're off to buy a new tea set. have fun!"
58915,Marge,but what if he chokes?
65201,Marge,"kids, i was thinking... was it really such a great idea to invite your father to that dinner?"
62479,Marge,i should've known something was wrong when we got this week's tv guide.
66543,Marge,"fine, fine! homer! give him a party!"
60515,Marge,you made that call? but you're the good one.
63130,Marge,you have a bigger problem out there.
62535,Marge,really? could we do a duet?
58508,Marge,"i'm not saying you're a bad inventor. i'm just saying these particular inventions are awful, and no one in their right mind would buy them. or accept them as gifts."
56315,Marge,"so i actually went to the bowling alley to spite him, or her..."
61467,Marge,i also found this in your drawer.
60693,Marge,"dr. hibbert, this is a top-notch resort. can you recommend some activities?"
55803,Marge,"doctor, we don't have a dental plan right now. so we'll need something a little more... affordable."
66250,Marge,take a look at this.
66150,Marge,what ring?
55885,Marge,"your teenage son or daughter will think this wishbone necklace is really ""cool."""
55401,Marge,maybe i should have taken a nice calligraphy class.
67213,Marge,"homer, is this some kind of stag party?"
64634,Marge,"you guys should go on that cruise. you'll have a great time, and you kids can spend the day getting to know your father..."
61063,Marge,looks like you had a problem with those scrambled eggs.
60237,Marge,"hey lisa, what are you doing?"
57066,Marge,--- you're gonna get...
62808,Marge,"yes, the weather is fair."
61737,Marge,"stop it, homer!"
62166,Marge,"you know, we should visit shelbyville more often. they have a store that just sells shoes. i feel like i'm in paris!"
55687,Marge,"oooh, it looks like everyone in springfield showed up for this."
67112,Marge,"homer, did you have something to do with this?"
63201,Marge,"ooh, the count of monte cristo! can we go? we haven't been to any parties since that soirée at the bastille."
60692,Marge,"homer, someone's in trouble!"
64862,Marge,"bart, sweetie... would you like to say goodbye?"
67313,Marge,precious? i think i hear the doorbell.
56403,Marge,i knew we should have gone to the bird sanctuary.
64684,Marge,i didn't see you come in.
65675,Marge,made? why didn't you just buy him a toy?
58534,Marge,"oh, yes. and punish lisa for lying to us."
61721,Marge,"homer, when you nurse a hurt for thirty years, it doesn't go away in an instant."
56293,Marge,i want you to forget about guarding this stupid sugar. you're being completely paranoid.
64527,Marge,"bart, pants."
60904,Marge,but aren't there side effects?
55776,Marge,"homie, i'd like you to do something for me."
55811,Marge,bart! lisa! stop that.
61666,Marge,"yeah, i've never sat by a pool this long without having to apologize to someone."
57203,Marge,"yes, dear. in your mind."
60427,Marge,we can't take his money.
62355,Marge,all right.
56804,Marge,"well, it was pretty exciting, but celery soup's pretty exciting too."
65861,Marge,"i don't care if bart is a wrestler, a busboy, or even a stoplight squeegee man... as long as he's a nice person."
60323,Marge,i was just trying to make this a healthier place to live.
58457,Marge,we're trapped!
57504,Marge,"mmm, i suppose i could..."
59434,Marge,you've only been gone two days.
63610,Marge,"i'll krump with you, sweetie pie."
59281,Marge,"i think it's great you've chosen to ""crash"" here, but do you have to be so messy?"
57854,Marge,"...and don't worry, sweetie, it's very common to be homesick when you're so far away from the people who love you."
63353,Marge,is your baby a suckaholic?!
61697,Marge,"now, on a different subject, kiss me hard."
57660,Marge,...pimento nose... and voila! mommy's patented happy-cracker snack platter!
65464,Marge,"excuse me, cruise director priddis. my son has something to tell you."
65788,Marge,"kids, your father and i have decided we're not in such a hurry to get you guardians."
59880,Marge,"uh, there's something i should tell you."
63159,Marge,"even though gil left, i still have to kick him out. i need this, or i'll never be able to say ""no."""
59500,Marge,"i hope he didn't cause too much trouble, sheriff."
55007,Marge,"well, if you can't sleep, why don't you do something constructive?"
67079,Marge,"oh, i'm sure they're just fine. after all, we built a fire and we don't know anything about nature. imagine what your father, an experienced woodsman, has done."
67268,Marge,"well, okay, i will. if you admit you love bart."
61931,Marge,"homer, we've gotta get lisa!"
55496,Marge,"you keep your hands to yourself, mister."
65863,Marge,"oh, that was so sweet."
63177,Marge,"excuse me, skipper -- this island used to be a paradise. what happened?"
66557,Marge,awww.
64293,Marge,"bart, let him go!"
62853,Marge,"i may have lost my memory, but i'm not an idiot."
57106,Marge,"lisa, you have to wait."
54985,Marge,homer! i've always said you were a good father. i've always defended you when people put you down.
55645,Marge,just imagine what we can do with this place.
65572,Marge,"hmm. well, it wouldn't start for me. i think this car's a lemon!"
61556,Marge,"no, it'll have to do."
67261,Marge,"well, i guess for the next few months, yes, i'll be your mother."
62165,Marge,"if you don't want to say it, just think it."
55558,Marge,"lisa, sh! someone may be listening."
64592,Marge,"not air bites, real bites."
59429,Marge,"so, you said on the phone you had something to tell me?"
55477,Marge,"honey, no one's going to force you to do anything... but do you know how your father got the money to enter you in this pageant?"
59027,Marge,forget it. nobody's riding any...
62506,Marge,wanna go inside?
59308,Marge,why are we stopping here?
63395,Marge,the school's having a bake sale today! at three o'clock!
60247,Marge,here she comes! and-a one and-a two and-a...
67880,Marge,"oh, my."
67226,Marge,what is the meaning of this?
66987,Marge,"well, it's a greatness that others can't see, but it's there and if it's not true greatness we have, we're at least average. i don't want to alarm anyone, but i think there's a li'l al-key-hol in this punch."
60355,Marge,"and before he broke his jaw, he never listened, but now he takes to heart everything i say."
63374,Marge,you make them stop -- by doing the right thing.
61710,Marge,i used to walk like this all the time... until my tendon snapped. they heard it in shelbyville!
63295,Marge,earthland realms?
61778,Marge,and white blood cells are attacking my clothes!
56567,Marge,you think those could also have contributed to my fear of flying?
58950,Marge,"uh, i guess."
65581,Marge,"homer, why do you take a three second pause before you answer what i say?"
65632,Marge,don't take grampa's meds!
61672,Marge,"oh my god, homie! look!"
64538,Marge,don't contradict me in front of our son!
57442,Marge,"bart, company's coming. go put doilies under the coasters. hurry! hurry!"
64168,Marge,"all right, homer. let's see what my baby's been up to."
59626,Marge,"i learned something: when people reach for their diaphragm, they don't want to see my picture."
67785,Marge,"any luck, homie?"
67454,Marge,"now, just a minute."
66957,Marge,"bart, i feel so bad for going so many years without... uh... hmmm... what's that word where you encourage something to grow?"
56066,Marge,i'll catch up to you.
64449,Marge,potato... tomato... let's call the whole thing--
57852,Marge,"lisa, if you ever want to quit and come home, i'll be here in half a jiff."
56235,Marge,"... there's that. or, you could take an adult education course."
55929,Marge,"hmm, better sew that eye back on."
57602,Marge,no.
62393,Marge,"well, they just can't start building in our neighborhood without asking us. what ever happened to ""please"" and ""thank you""?"
67406,Marge,"homer, we're a mary bailey family."
62683,Marge,"and why do you really want it, anyway? moe, will the gold bring back edna's love?"
55397,Marge,"i told you several times. it's a musical version of ""a streetcar named..."""
60184,Marge,burly. you're so rugged and manly...
62995,Marge,look! bart's onstage... and he's contributing to the entertainment!
59383,Marge,party? no! no parties.
59987,Marge,look!
54885,Marge,"how are you enjoying your ham, homie?"
67541,Marge,... please try to tone down the psychotic violence...
61942,Marge,"this is marge simpson, reporting from lake placid where the miracle on ice never happened."
56015,Marge,"why do you read that ""free"" column, homer? they never have anything good."
65272,Marge,merry christmas eve! where are the kids?
64755,Marge,this is that videogame reverend lovejoy said you shouldn't play!
64381,Marge,"some lingerie from ""the horny hubby""... and ""snuggle"" dice."
66107,Marge,what the?
64452,Marge,who's there?
57099,Marge,"oh, bart, not again... give it to me."
63522,Marge,homie! you're all right!
54652,Marge,there'll never be a worse president. never.
56787,Marge,"what do you do, follow my husband around?"
56110,Marge,"well, i guess we could go to that new monstromart..."
61678,Marge,and nobody does it better.
65570,Marge,i still smell it!
62113,Marge,"homie, if you die, i'm gonna have three kids to take care of. i want you to buy some life insurance. please?"
55193,Marge,there's maggie!
56133,Marge,"oh, i am so proud of you. and i know it's going to go just fine..."
66593,Marge,it's everywhere.
65065,Marge,i will!
55875,Marge,well... once.
61049,Marge,"homer, no scissors!"
60866,Marge,sorry!
58854,Marge,"oh, i'll come watch you do nothing after i try out my new high-intensity halogen headlights."
64159,Marge,your daughter barely knows who you are!
67843,Marge,"dad, don't you want to know where we're going?"
65783,Marge,that's why they took our kids so quick.
60835,Marge,"honey, the king of mardi gras has to ride around on a float all day. you'll be a sitting duck."
54959,Marge,"well, it's a lot. in fact, your father had to take a second job."
59003,Marge,"well, homer, i have to admit, you created something people really love. you truly are an artist."
56359,Marge,"take me home, artie."
58642,Marge,"oh, sweetie, you look so much better. ready to go back to school?"
61792,Marge,playdude magazines? have you been hiding bosom rags from me?
62731,Marge,"well, that might be interesting... or it could damage many, many lives."
61200,Marge,"wow, she really likes you. maybe the next time i need a sitter, and you're not busy..."
60160,Marge,i thought this was gonna be your bar.
65616,Marge,"there's gotta be a clue in here somewhere. spats, sock garters, the world's hardest hard candy..."
67767,Marge,then you'll also remember that you owe me a favor...
64883,Marge,"so, this stuff will just shampoo out, huh?"
59769,Marge,"oh, stop. your father and i don't get the day off."
58678,Marge,"well... i said i'd do it, so i guess i'll have to."
67316,Marge,"here are the phone numbers of the restaurant where we'll be dining and the motel where we'll be spending the night. you'll have to put maggie to bed now. but bart and lisa can stay up for another hour. until then, they can watch a tape from our video library."
57678,Marge,"i don't, but i loved hearing it!"
55592,Marge,"hm, what about the bread? does that have much fish in it?"
55886,Marge,no one bought a wishbone necklace.
60681,Marge,"homie, i must say you have the energy of twenty men lately."
61341,Marge,"oh no, it's raining! and maggie's diapers are extra-absorbent!"
61650,Marge,"homie, you know i'm usually good for a triple-x throw down, but between those kids and going to uncle tyrone's, we can't be alone."
64186,Marge,that'll be our christmas card this year!
54717,Marge,"man, things sure have turned to crap."
60339,Marge,i am not gonna make you another sparerib smoothie. most people with their jaws wired shut don't gain weight.
55567,Marge,"oh, aren't you nice. gee, this makes me wonder why morale here is so low."
56124,Marge,"honey, you're not going to throw red paint at the executives, are you? the keebler people were very upset..."
57138,Marge,we can't afford to shop at any store that has a philosophy. we just need a tv. we're going to go to the outlet mall in ogdenville.
57153,Marge,"bart, comb your hair. homer, i don't think you should wear a short-sleeved shirt with a tie."
57479,Marge,"he's a whole new person, lisa!"
60771,Marge,did you just drug me?
65453,Marge,"homer! this is bad for you, too!"
55866,Marge,you did?
61078,Marge,"reverend lovejoy, mrs. lovejoy, principal skinner, duffman."
57761,Marge,"you did the right thing, sweetheart."
59228,Marge,i'm with lisa. let's take 'em to the cleaners.
56449,Marge,"uh, i think you all owe my son an apology."
55365,Marge,maybe we should play another game.
64239,Marge,the year was 1588.
60171,Marge,that was amazing. i hope the kids didn't hear us.
55964,Marge,hello?
63637,Marge,what are you hiding from me? is it chocolate?
64832,Marge,stop burning!
66636,Marge,as many as you like...
61174,Marge,"nelson, leggings?"
60668,Marge,"i'm so glad this all worked out. thanks for saving my husband, chief."
58657,Marge,the highest grade.
62962,Marge,all he did was try to help a young couple find their way. does he really deserve to get strung up for that?
63721,Marge,i think he's been sneakering on his diet.
57914,Marge,i think we're going to have to get bart some help.
64437,Marge,who wants fresh donuts?
58736,Marge,"well, what are we waiting for?"
61805,Marge,"bart, can you come in here for a second?"
59972,Marge,"homer, no! those were made in the sixties."
60763,Marge,"keep in mind, they're only temporaries."
58262,Marge,did you hear that kids? brown!
61281,Marge,"""kitchen carnival?"" i love it! thank you, homie."
67337,Marge,"in a second, homer. lisa has some good news."
59401,Marge,"oh, my. ooh-hoo. it's going to cost us $500 a week to keep duncan!"
59742,Marge,no! no! get off me!
62912,Marge,"go ahead, maggie. you're allowed to touch the deadly weapons."
65173,Marge,that newborn has earrings!
59509,Marge,"can i top you off, hon?"
58794,Marge,i didn't turn it on yet.
63331,Marge,you traded our mattress? i had my secret cash in it!
63775,Marge,"lurleen, you're giving your dad too much power over the way you feel about yourself. stop getting your self-esteem from the men in your life."
55275,Marge,you should have called. i was very worried.
65879,Marge,they sure are getting along.
56762,Marge,bart! lisa! what are you two doing home so early?
65876,Marge,"homer, that's you."
58061,Marge,"homer, be careful..."
65855,Marge,thank you.
66363,Marge,"i have to get to the church. helen lovejoy is posting the spring volunteer signup sheet. in five minutes, every good task will be taken! dang it!"
67064,Marge,"we're just browsing, thank you."
56480,Marge,i'm sure it'll turn up. take the baby-sitter home now. she's been sitting in the car for twenty minutes.
58449,Marge,"y'know, the fear of getting caught is kind of a turn-on."
62020,Marge,bart! how do you know these things?
64978,Marge,"but be honest, when i say ""beautiful woman,"" what pops into your head?"
56181,Marge,are you thinking what i'm thinking?
66507,Marge,"here you go. put those in the trash, then you can help me unload the dishwasher."
57579,Marge,"hello? uh, no, pretzel wagon's no longer -- three hundred pretzels?! wait, wait, let me get this down. mmm... mmm... meatpackers union hall... batavia, new york... i'll send them right out! homer, homie, wake up! wake up, i'm back in business!"
60475,Marge,"first he wrecks your car, then he steals mine. your father's out of control."
59879,Marge,"oh, hello, homer."
67765,Marge,well... i'll try.
63443,Marge,"we're all so proud of you, sweetie."
64526,Marge,"then again, there's only one way to get a truly accurate reading."
60762,Marge,"thank you, fellas."
61311,Marge,that's the rich people's mall. let's shop till we droop!
65258,Marge,this is the part where i get the kids out of the room.
64665,Marge,we better go.
56096,Marge,what is it?
57938,Marge,"homie, is that you?"
67584,Marge,well... let's see... oh! couldn't itchy share his pie with scratchy? then they would both have pie.
57057,Marge,but we did win!
66520,Marge,they're always bragging about their trip to rome. it was twelve years ago and it was a layover. i want new friends!
55706,Marge,"mr. kobb, what can we do?"
57609,Marge,what?!
65403,Marge,"that's jennifer aniston's hair on ""friends."""
56742,Marge,"okay, you can go out and play, but... no more you know what in front of the house, all right?"
54875,Marge,"homer, i want you to go down to that club and talk to them. just see what kind of people they are. please, homie?"
55229,Marge,bart's grades are up a little this term. but lisa's are way down.
63114,Marge,now the kids won't bother us during our morning snuggle.
62552,Marge,what's that smell?
63629,Marge,really? but i'm so used to my old one.
60767,Marge,"don't make a fuss over me, boys. just pour me a beer in a clean glass."
64683,Marge,still wanna be at moe's?
59218,Marge,oh.
67747,Marge,yes. i ate two grapes. please charge me for them.
59206,Marge,then why are you driving so fast?
65667,Marge,"maybe we shouldn't rush things with the new neighbors. you know, we might not all be a perfect match."
56980,Marge,just a second!
61839,Marge,i don't deserve to win. i sabotaged all the other entries!
61528,Marge,i thought you were playing catch with artie.
64320,Marge,"""eat, pray, love."""
65075,Marge,"sorry, the occurrence, but to use your lingo, homer and i have to be ""that guy."""
55118,Marge,did you two have fun?
63729,Marge,homer jay simpson!
59469,Marge,"i wrote a poem for barney on this special occasion. ""now that you're one year older, the time flew by so fast..."""
65151,Marge,knitting one sweater for someone costs twenty-seven americans their jobs.
58980,Marge,"hmm, i don't know. i studied art for years, but i just don't get this."
66682,Marge,our water was on fire!
55335,Marge,no.
67353,Marge,"he's much happier at work and, well, just between us girls... well, he hasn't been this frisky in years."
56453,Marge,"well, i think women should be able to play any sport men play, but hockey is so violent and dangerous. look at milhouse's teeth."
55681,Marge,"ohhh... kids, you can come in now."
67682,Marge,"oh, the shop kids are smoking again."
61884,Marge,"bart, have you ever eaten a tootsie pop? you know, there's a tough crunchy shell, but if you lick it, there's a delicious sweetness inside. be nice to nelson and i'll give you a tootsie pop."
56013,Marge,chasm?!
57210,Marge,"boy, it sure would be fun to carpool in one of those, huh, kids? i'd be a real hot-rod mama, wouldn't i? huh? huh?"
66883,Marge,"ok, mel. i'll be at the casino by ten. meet me at the lounge by the j. geils cover band."
60011,Marge,we've just gotta get your thumb to the--
54783,Marge,did you make any money?
66462,Marge,it's for people who haven't had heart problems!
57856,Marge,"well, he's got more confidence!"
64477,Marge,this isn't fair! i want romance!
59374,Marge,"hmm, i know what the other eleven forks are for, but what do you do with this one?"
61586,Marge,"thanks for everything, kyle."
56699,Marge,making out the jury list for the film festival. mayor quimby -- krusty -- jay --
64070,Marge,ned! i think we have a gas leak!
63147,Marge,"gil, listen. we've been very patient, but i want you to..."
60875,Marge,"two, three, two..."
64900,Marge,you were friends with three other boys and i became close with their moms.
56004,Marge,"oh, i don't think they're gonna be that easy to lose. i mean these are professional lawmen and..."
60720,Marge,a year ago you said they were the greatest thing that ever happened to us.
60116,Marge,it's about the only thing we do as a family anymore.
64622,Marge,does he have a cute accent?
56245,Marge,"homer, don't you have to get to class?"
60183,Marge,"ooo, burly, you're insatiable."
61915,Marge,"chloe left town as soon as barney proposed. i would've followed her, but my plans changed when god brought me a wonderful little boy... bart, stop that!"
56763,Marge,"bart, leave that crowbar here. you know i don't like you prying and jimmying."
61777,Marge,"oh my sweet, undigested baby!"
67309,Marge,"goodness, must be a crossed wire."
65119,Marge,thank you! this is my third favorite reality cooking show!
55766,Marge,"well, i got an idea! why don't you run a hamster through a maze?"
64876,Marge,"this tree reminds me of your father. it's round in the middle, thinning on top, and your hands get sticky when you touch it."
56576,Marge,"i'm sure it's nothing personal, homer."
58058,Marge,i don't want a drug boat.
67393,Marge,you... you speak english.
67937,Marge,"wow, moe -- you're a troll!"
58801,Marge,"oh, yeah, homer's a real go-getter."
64348,Marge,"mm, there's something odd about this beer."
66416,Marge,this could be our new living room painting!
61401,Marge,that painting has always sparked my imagination.
67358,Marge,"don't worry, homie. this year you have an excuse for not remembering, what with your job and --"
56914,Marge,"homie, this is so sweet. but i can't possibly go now... the sink is full of dirty dishes, the trash needs to be taken out, the living room is a mess..."
57003,Marge,good. good for you.
59370,Marge,don't worry about a thing. we'll take good care of your house!
60714,Marge,"that was great, homie."
56697,Marge,"oh, i invited my sisters over."
59369,Marge,uh-huh. the fire department.
67491,Marge,"lisa, i'm very sorry about what happened."
64374,Marge,how 'bout a little marge madness?
66319,Marge,what's so funny?
61885,Marge,"bart, eat up or you'll be late for school!"
58476,Marge,with cans of grease?
65978,Marge,"well, dumbo had a magic feather. he thought he needed it to fly, but it turned out the magic was in him the whole time."
57492,Marge,ned! maude! you've got to go back to your house. something incredible has happened!
61980,Marge,"well, i was thinking more like drapes and a paint job, but your idea's good too."
67487,Marge,"now, just wait a minute! i'm sure there's room for both."
54589,Marge,...while you play video games with your neanderthal friends.
63222,Marge,"""dingle's berries"" in provo, utah?"
66660,Marge,"no. you should not be out glugging, shin-slicing, or eye groining! we've got a sweet little toddle to take care of!"
60980,Marge,he's adorable! i'd sure like to tuck that in at night.
62354,Marge,"how could you allow this, in the room where we... do puzzles?!"
61182,Marge,"well, surely there's room in this town for two well-meaning juvenile associations."
55822,Marge,"homer, it's really coming down. could you check on the boys?"
61788,Marge,but seeing that kitchen today made me wish we had something a little better for ourselves.
60030,Marge,shoo!
63260,Marge,i don't think we're doing this right.
61891,Marge,perhaps if you wrap it in a slice of cheese.
62389,Marge,"i'm gonna take you home and fix you up, 'cause you're the real endangered species... a devoted husband."
59778,Marge,really?
57425,Marge,"oh, can you sing it again?"
59785,Marge,"c'mon. you and the kids always wanna do fun stuff, but today we're doing something i like."
58595,Marge,suckers.
67897,Marge,your father does that to me.
58653,Marge,"oh, it just turned up in the course of my daily rummaging. by the way, i oiled the hinge on your diary."
62807,Marge,perhaps thou wouldst make a good father!
62170,Marge,why do you come to these meetings?
55686,Marge,no.
56222,Marge,"hello, mom? fine. you know, abe had a very nice time with you last sunday..."
55579,Marge,you can't fire me just because i'm married. i'm going to sue the pants off you.
61992,Marge,"oh, i'm too tired to talk."
57103,Marge,"oh, sweetie. this is the best present a mother could get."
55042,Marge,"homer, i've been thinking. if the baby's a boy, what do you think of the name larry?"
61919,Marge,chloe has such an amazing life. i wonder what would have happened if i'd stuck with journalism.
59466,Marge,"it's in our mighty rivers, our majestic..."" well, isn't that clever? it's a metaphor."
65422,Marge,which he didn't.
65706,Marge,"homer, i told you, don't call me ""mom."""
54882,Marge,"dear lord, if you spare this town from becoming a smoking hole in the ground, i'll try to be a better christian. i don't know what i can do... ummm, oooh, the next time there's a canned food drive i'll give the poor something they'd actually like instead of old lima beans and pumpkin mix."
58182,Marge,what the? what are you doing inside?
61482,Marge,"well, then maybe you need to buy me a brooch."
65032,Marge,"you'll be fine, you always are."
67507,Marge,"sit down, homer."
63330,Marge,"i'm sorry, homie -- i want to snuggle, but i'm just not feeling it."
56913,Marge,"""good for a three hour getaway at the mingled waters health spa."" mineral bath, facial, massage... how did you afford these?"
62775,Marge,homer do great!
59351,Marge,"oh, thank god you're all right!"
66447,Marge,olá!
66290,Marge,maybe the person that turned your father in thought they were doing the right thing.
61851,Marge,"for our first game, i need everyone to draw a picture of president eisenhower."
61328,Marge,"homie, i'm so proud -- you changed more than i could imagined! you're even covering your mouth when you burp."
61834,Marge,she's already ahead of me.
66105,Marge,leave me alone!
64569,Marge,"well, we will take you up on your offer."
60337,Marge,"oh dear, you can't eat solid foods. those are his favorites."
65025,Marge,"homer! just because everyone else is doing the wave, doesn't mean you have to!"
59545,Marge,"yes, our tiny tapper. what was it you were going to say after ""i wanted to be a dancer, but..."""
59162,Marge,"this is so exciting, homie. your first restaurant review."
57521,Marge,...we had a fight?
58821,Marge,"it's not that monkey card i found in the car, is it?"
56901,Marge,"bart, why are you talking like that?"
56532,Marge,sock puppets.
55208,Marge,"oh, homie. you're good at lots of things."
66421,Marge,oh my god!
54648,Marge,you oppose marriage?
60164,Marge,oh.
62727,Marge,that's just a souvenir from an amusement park.
65088,Marge,"homie, you're making my toes curl. you sure know how to please a woman."
60977,Marge,"really? hmm. well what about in the sentence ""jim nabors is way cool""?"
64500,Marge,yes it will. i'll just sweep harder than anyone's ever swept before. because without homer i'm a broom without a stone. no use for anything.
62110,Marge,"oh, thank god! he's alive!"
62490,Marge,"uh, he's just faking loss of vitality, reverend."
55295,Marge,"just so you know, while you and lurleen were out judging that greased pig contest, maggie cut her first tooth."
56670,Marge,"this has been such a nice, peaceful dinner, it calls for a celebration. i'm going to make the most international coffee in the house, montreal morn."
64455,Marge,lettuce... congratulate the new couple.
57645,Marge,"'morning, roy!"
61366,Marge,three!
66512,Marge,keep it! let's go!
63062,Marge,a phone tree.
62494,Marge,"our tandem bicycle! when i bought it, you said you'd ride with me."
59461,Marge,wait! how do you know this is where lincoln buried the gold? you just started counting from an arbitrary place.
67172,Marge,yes.
56494,Marge,"well, we can dress it up a bit. we can bring a fern... and a folding chair from the garage... and the most decorative thing of all: the truth."
64778,Marge,roger was telling the truth!
60883,Marge,whack him with the hymnal. over.
60179,Marge,watch what happens when i spill this blue liquid.
61423,Marge,"homie, i finished my novel."
59165,Marge,you like shake and bake. you used to put it in your coffee.
56860,Marge,that the pants would rip?...
63885,Marge,pull over -- bart's in this field!
62591,Marge,it doesn't cover mortadella.
64992,Marge,at least no one else has taken this drug.
59829,Marge,"that's right, a job."
66727,Marge,what?
59151,Marge,"oh, my little guy's out there in the hot sun without his sombrero."
66088,Marge,no tattling!
61387,Marge,"my job was to keep lisa's hope alive. but instead, she's really depressed."
62232,Marge,ray's not coming!
56147,Marge,there. i hope the children enjoy my special fruit punch.
58334,Marge,"homer, i painted that for you."
63758,Marge,get in!
65843,Marge,"oh honey, that's just silly! this'll show helen lovejoy, always bragging about her he-she cousin!"
62625,Marge,"lisa, i'm not sure that letter is ""age appropriate"" reading. why can't the government edit our mail like other countries?"
57296,Marge,"we have each other! when i was a lonely little girl, i always dreamed that someday my daughter would be my best friend."
61322,Marge,you can sleep on the couch tonight.
56639,Marge,"bart, did you trick an australian boy into accepting a nine hundred dollar collect call?"
67195,Marge,that doesn't shock me.
65286,Marge,no one's shotgun! now be quiet!
57355,Marge,"no, i don't."
55358,Marge,hands across america...
61687,Marge,"where were you, homie? you missed all the excitement."
57692,Marge,"bart, no!"
64102,Marge,uh-oh. we're starting to attract swingers.
64580,Marge,what's he gonna do now?
67029,Marge,"oh homer, that's ridiculous. bart, instead of fighting, why don't you try a little understanding?"
58239,Marge,"sorry kids, there's no such thing as hoverbikes. they're just a couple of huffys on a fishing line!"
58729,Marge,i guess.
65941,Marge,i don't want a comedian knowing my dress size!
65715,Marge,"i can't find all our cereal, crackers, juice boxes, the butter brush..."
63050,Marge,the cure to any man's problems is a good relationship.
55945,Marge,that's a photo of homer and me at our wedding.
64870,Marge,at least someone around here's got the christmas spirit.
61712,Marge,we were learning to use all thirty-three forks.
66982,Marge,"oh, what an adorable little girl."
58096,Marge,"well, i can too compete. and i'm going to sell a house. end of story."
63254,Marge,i invited selma here to watch grampa watch the kids.
60619,Marge,"that woman is taking advantage of you, and we need you to do things around here. the oven light is out and you never finished filling up the aquarium."
65983,Marge,what did he do in the future?
58553,Marge,oh my goodness! look!
65439,Marge,"homer, for god sakes, i'm trying to put maggie to sleep!"
58199,Marge,the undersea world certainly is full of wonders.
62226,Marge,geez louise...
56219,Marge,"you know, mom, you and abe have a lot in common. umm, you both got swindled by that telemarketing scam."
64289,Marge,"i googled ""girls having fun,"" and after wading through ninety-seven thousand pages of porn, i found ""crazy bowling."""
57072,Marge,"ahh, my teapots are ready."
55189,Marge,uh... that's okay.
58178,Marge,that backyard is a disgrace. now get busy.
66040,Marge,just read the saga and see what it says.
56389,Marge,"it's cute, but i'm sure it's very sharp, and probably dirty."
60870,Marge,"sorry, i can't go outside. i'll call for help."
56345,Marge,of course. remember when... your aunt selma got married?
65881,Marge,i volunteered to wash the egg stains off everyone's clothes. it's one of those things you say and hope nobody takes you up on it.
64034,Marge,don't open this one again.
58224,Marge,i'm not leaving my home!
63754,Marge,and i realize it's wrong to try to live your career dreams through your children.
59394,Marge,"never, but it's my number one concern!"
65631,Marge,"grampa, we will never miss a visit again. and there'll be a lot more of them."
55156,Marge,"homer, can you bring maggie out?"
65007,Marge,"now, we've managed to preoccupy the cat lady for the next few hours."
55403,Marge,"homie, i didn't get the part... you were right, outside interests are stupid."
57532,Marge,have you been drinking?
63287,Marge,"paper towels for sixty-nine cents... sixty-eight cents... sixty-six cents! kids, get in the car! we're going to pennsylvania!"
59519,Marge,"my goodness, what a lovely suit, sheriff. is that seersucker?"
64016,Marge,you probably would.
60235,Marge,"her?! she's just kidding, mr. lord."
58035,Marge,i don't know... there's something very peculiar about this.
60197,Marge,i guess it was a pretty funny prank. i like the ones where nothing catches on fire.
64478,Marge,it's not the same.
56105,Marge,"if he wants to make it up to you so badly, i think you should let him."
58240,Marge,"oh no, no, no, no, no, no! they're due back at the store by six. get off 'em! get off, off! get off!"
62080,Marge,"lisa, you took out a restraining order against your own brother?"
64260,Marge,why did he have to kill everyone in their costumes?
58495,Marge,i didn't tell you to quit your job.
62105,Marge,is there anything more fun than a nice sunday drive?
64872,Marge,but you wanted those toys.
62698,Marge,here's my mask!
54719,Marge,is he making chicken noises?
60065,Marge,"hey, what are you doing?"
54788,Marge,now come on... you can play your little tie-up game inside. i've got some cocoa on the stove. who wants imitation marshmallows?
66713,Marge,but where? i still don't know!
58086,Marge,"oh. well, then you have to ask yourself, is this the right house for you?"
55888,Marge,"homer, you're going to be famous!"
63970,Marge,really? i never knew that.
65586,Marge,"i guess... that's that, then."
58850,Marge,"outta my way, nature!"
61949,Marge,let me wash it off.
60305,Marge,hey!
62043,Marge,"ooh, what a horrible thing to say to a mother."
60147,Marge,get away from that window!
58917,Marge,"no, homer! don't fill up on bread!"
54865,Marge,"so bart, what did you learn in karate school today?"
60571,Marge,"if you ask me, you should give up fatty foods."
60280,Marge,"homer, i don't know if i can ever forgive you. please go away."
59618,Marge,nobody told us how tough it is to raise kids. they almost drove me to fortified wine!
62777,Marge,i remember him.
64945,Marge,homer! we only have five minutes until the school bus comes.
62338,Marge,i just don't think your father's the right person to pick out a religion for you.
57901,Marge,those were the days.
57586,Marge,who are you?
66889,Marge,"homie, homie, i can finally tell you how we really got the money..."
56907,Marge,no they didn't.
56056,Marge,"in honor of legalized gambling, why not go as the state of nevada?"
55732,Marge,you've been eating that thing for a week. i think the mayonnaise is starting to turn.
55930,Marge,i'm sure he'll offer us a fair reward. and then we'll make him double it.
59532,Marge,"that's wonderful, honey. we should ask your father, though. where is he, anyway?"
57452,Marge,lisa! why don't you come sing for us!
65076,Marge,enough!
57648,Marge,yes we can!
60017,Marge,let's just say that bart did it.
57990,Marge,"down here, homer."
65790,Marge,"turn right onto first street, head east. homer, watch the road! not this road, the other road!"
64301,Marge,"nelson, you really have a knack for this."
57353,Marge,well explain to me why it isn't.
64901,Marge,but they were a bad influence on you.
60509,Marge,oh.
64697,Marge,golf it is.
55861,Marge,$24.95!
58203,Marge,what's going on?
56838,Marge,"look, lisa. it's mcgriff the crime dog."
55354,Marge,what in god's name are you talking about?
56469,Marge,no.
59617,Marge,"they told us what to wear, how to dress, which clothes we should put on..."
65547,Marge,it was not love at first sight!
56824,Marge,that's better.
63526,Marge,you have to be there -- you miss way too many precious moments in the children's lives.
67567,Marge,krusty
63691,Marge,"anyway, i was growing to admire my professor more and more..."
59542,Marge,"hey, dig that crazy rhythm."
63421,Marge,we're gonna have to run. there isn't even time to stretch my quads!
55627,Marge,did you girls watch the last episode of mash?
57161,Marge,"i get food through the mail, but in a different way. every month good housekeeping arrives in my mailbox bursting with recipes. sometimes the most satisfying meal is the one you cook yourself."
62461,Marge,homer! i can save you both! just let go of the rock!
55636,Marge,bad baby!
60217,Marge,"sorry, we already solved it."
65884,Marge,interesting. except you missed one thing.
57189,Marge,"no, no, no! not tonight! no vulgarity, no mischief, no politics. just be good."
61768,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
60997,Marge,his answer's not at the bottom of a hedge.
56417,Marge,we're just gonna have to wait and see.
62119,Marge,go easy on that -- it's gotta last 'til you're five.
56149,Marge,"that was a very nice thing you did, homey."
64112,Marge,i want to talk to howard.
56074,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry. i have been spending too much time at the casino. i'll be around more from now on."
64208,Marge,...and because of cutbacks they were combining math with p.e. they were playing dodge book!
57092,Marge,he's not my little baby anymore. maybe i mother him too much.
55540,Marge,"well, it's been two months. you laid down the law and i'm proud of you. but i think we've gotten through to him."
55538,Marge,oh my lord!
67873,Marge,"well, no... just ringo starr."
54777,Marge,"don't gloat, homer. you know, bart, when i was your age, the one thing i wanted more than anything in the world was a child-sized electric lightbulb oven. my parents wouldn't give me the money, so i went to my sisters, patty and selma..."
61167,Marge,"you are so right, ned. there won't be a single minute where bart's not under the watchful eye of myself or... homer, get over here!"
63655,Marge,"i'm honoring america's advertisers. then we're going to buy some toothpaste, lease a new car, and vote ""yes"" on prop eighty-seven."
55034,Marge,"well, that unforgettable night we... joined the castle club..."
64226,Marge,"you don't need a wii now that i'm here. because you and me make ""us."""
59214,Marge,where'd you get that?
67081,Marge,there is?
57715,Marge,all right.
55081,Marge,"bart, your grampa's on the phone. he wants to wish you a happy birthday."
65350,Marge,what's going on? why is there a picture of us? this isn't good.
59311,Marge,what will become of our kids?
67234,Marge,homer! you don't even know why you're apologizing.
55456,Marge,homer! are you actually giving up your faith?
63666,Marge,"stop, homer! please!"
60718,Marge,"why is he performing the duties of a roadie? am i saying that right, ""roadie?"""
55111,Marge,"no, no, no, you have to try it on."
56741,Marge,but won't you miss her loyalty and companionship?
58466,Marge,"wow, a lot of people have pools."
55341,Marge,"well, before you do that, maybe you should take the driving test again."
58377,Marge,"anyway, it's time for the church picnic."
57219,Marge,"is there something wrong, homie?"
60488,Marge,"brave odysseus, it has been twenty long years. regale me with tales of your adventures."
65230,Marge,"homie, what are you doing?"
58897,Marge,"is that somebody you, homer?"
65175,Marge,they're using pancakes as spoons!
60187,Marge,hello?
60538,Marge,there's nothing to be afraid of. they're all grown by the vegetable division of union carbide.
56691,Marge,"""dear mr. sherman. on behalf of the people of springfield, i would like to invite you to judge our film festival."""
62001,Marge,he's right.
58479,Marge,you could raise some emus...
66487,Marge,horses only live thirty years!
61720,Marge,i guess so.
62304,Marge,what language is this? gibby-gabby?
54982,Marge,"oh really? well, maybe you should go out in the garage and see."
61347,Marge,"is that better? to me, ralph wiggum is sir lancelot."
61766,Marge,some anniversary this is.
60848,Marge,you were supposed to get her that stupid diary!
67170,Marge,yes.
57865,Marge,it's wall-to-wall landmarks -- the williamsburg bridge! fourth avenue! governor's island!
67012,Marge,"bart, how could you shock your little sister?"
67600,Marge,david.
62513,Marge,you haven't had any tea.
67807,Marge,"mm hm. two o'clock is fine. thank you, dr. hibbert."
66841,Marge,"it's because everything you love, you love so much."
65018,Marge,"it's so fancy -- sushi bars, a sixty-screen movie theater, museum of tolerance..."
67674,Marge,"and a lot of times we'd stay at home and talk, just like this."
62258,Marge,"don't you mean ""tough love?"""
63817,Marge,clothing?
58685,Marge,"yes. you've shortened your life significantly, so someone else can have a slight extension of theirs."
61814,Marge,"why thank you, billy."
63180,Marge,"i guess in the end, nothing's as good as you remember."
60656,Marge,"if you like protecting people, you could make that your job. you know, start a security company."
63815,Marge,food?
67421,Marge,homer... homer... make them stop.
58662,Marge,hip hip--
65645,Marge,that adult etch-a-sketch certainly has brightened your mood.
60542,Marge,go away! go away!
64741,Marge,"sweetie, you could still go to mcgill -- the harvard of canada."
58040,Marge,"maybe so, but i'd appreciate it if you didn't call them morons."
59776,Marge,forget it.
54647,Marge,"look, a wedding!"
58971,Marge,"oh, right. the sins."
65969,Marge,yes. 'cause every time you wear it you'll know how much we love you. like the one pair of blue pants i bought homer twenty years ago.
67318,Marge,"homer, you look just like a little boy."
58819,Marge,"then the bird sang ""i love the night life""... with clever new lyrics."
55105,Marge,bart!
62888,Marge,"you've been drinking today, haven't you?"
57631,Marge,ooooh.
65184,Marge,holy casserole-y! that's good gloop!
55056,Marge,did you get the job?
56785,Marge,"lisa, it's normal to be sad when a friend dies, and bleeding gums was a good friend to you. but nobody is really gone as long as we remember them."
64965,Marge,"i thought you'd be more supportive. i mean, you went gray yourselves."
66533,Marge,"mm, hm."
65168,Marge,"you're right, you're right, you're right -- let's go."
55053,Marge,what a perfect day.
66863,Marge,"moe, i think we'd both be a lot happier if we quit our new jobs."
58008,Marge,"ooo, he's quite a little dancer."
61136,Marge,what's all that rustling?
62835,Marge,"goodbye, mr. simpson."
61838,Marge,that's clever... and devastating. stop the competition!
57921,Marge,"well, grampa, as long as you're here, we were telling a story that took place when bart was five and lisa was three."
57649,Marge,bart's right -- let's none of us have a cow. all that matters is that the fans of the show liked it.
66560,Marge,lisa! bath time!
61458,Marge,"as a young prodigy, this popular musician wowed audiences across eighteenth-century europe..."
63359,Marge,where's your father with those pacifiers?
54650,Marge,it's statements like that that... are mean!
54618,Marge,he is!
59671,Marge,like the one in berlin?
60845,Marge,"and he's good around the potty, too."
66224,Marge,"well i'm glad you did a good deed, but you shouldn't come here again. i thought that was strange poop on your collar."
55339,Marge,"i know how you feel, but he is good with the kids."
62985,Marge,class all the way.
64407,Marge,oh look how the snow glistens on the tiniest branches!
55151,Marge,i need to unwind.
57059,Marge,bart!
66175,Marge,yolo?
67116,Marge,umm-hmm.
61750,Marge,i don't know why they put the real ones in with the joke ones.
54860,Marge,"hi, ned. homer sends his apologies, but uh... there was some important work at the plant that only he could take care of."
60157,Marge,there's no drugs out there.
54679,Marge,"because we have no way of communicating with the outside world! tell me, has robert fulton invented the steamboat yet?"
60117,Marge,uh-oh.
54641,Marge,"well, i know you'd never say anything that isn't objective..."
64841,Marge,"just because mr. burns was mean to you, that doesn't give you the right to abuse him when he's helpless."
64382,Marge,"this one has an action, and this one has a body part. see?"
54888,Marge,i think that game is too old for her. why don't you go play with milhouse?
62546,Marge,here's a ten. make your own card.
55426,Marge,"that reahlly doesn't help, baht."
55139,Marge,"homer, i'm running late as it is. can't you just use one of the balls at the alley?"
63055,Marge,i think she just answers their phone...
66006,Marge,gulp?! was that a gulp? are you getting a sore throat? let me give you some castor oil.
54805,Marge,but he's your boss. do you have to mail it right this minute?
57515,Marge,"i'm ""cranky"" because my husband got drunk and humiliated me in front of the entire town. you broke your promise, homer."
59367,Marge,"homer, sit down."
55296,Marge,you're not even listening to me!
62925,Marge,"look, homie, i brought you a beer."
58054,Marge,"otherwise, we could wake up one day and realize we've wasted our whole lives."
57134,Marge,"grampa, i know in your day spanking was common, but homer and i just don't believe in that kind of punishment."
58517,Marge,please submit their names along with ninety-five dollars for each handsome volume you wish to order.
61757,Marge,"oh, i've always wanted to go to france. your women don't age -- like catherine deneuve."
58780,Marge,chesty larue?!
62091,Marge,wait till the drambuie and sleeping pills kick in.
55683,Marge,"oh, that's wonderful!"
57089,Marge,"goodnight, sweetheart."
65419,Marge,suzette!
64386,Marge,last night was the making it up to me! the most intimate moment we shared this week was my ironing your shirts!
55217,Marge,"honey, if that's what you want, we'll do anything we can to help."
62430,Marge,"sweetie, i know it itches, but you've gotta stop scratching!"
63716,Marge,searching for evidence. i know your father's cheating on his diet.
60296,Marge,"you kids do eat a lot of sugar. but at least homer can have a nice, healthy grapefruit."
65029,Marge,you can't let this go without using it as a chance to improve your fathering.
65945,Marge,"oh sweetie, it's not for me. i wanted you to wear that dress at your wedding."
58809,Marge,ooo.
61948,Marge,"bart, someone wrote something cynical on your shirt!"
62485,Marge,"lisa, do you think you could check on your father?"
58604,Marge,how's he doing?
60760,Marge,"they do make my neck look thinner... oh, all right, let's do it."
63518,Marge,i'm starting to worry about your father.
60125,Marge,i don't want him to see us expressing our love.
57836,Marge,christian love?
58645,Marge,that's a risk i'm willing to take. so long!
61145,Marge,"gee, everything always works out for you."
66672,Marge,i also set up some mirrors so you could watch hockey fights while you eat.
67700,Marge,yes.
58399,Marge,"a bus? alone? absolutely not. it's just too dangerous for an eight-year- old. in a few years, when you're old enough to drive, then you can take a bus."
67053,Marge,"go on, bart. no time like the present."
65615,Marge,"fine, he'll be around forever."
58329,Marge,are you sure you'll be okay?
66711,Marge,i want so much to believe you.
59640,Marge,... which homer writes himself.
66554,Marge,a mother's greatest fear.
66259,Marge,"well, you seem like a nice pushy stranger."
58374,Marge,i can't believe it's come to this.
55093,Marge,"well, why don't you get it?"
61517,Marge,"honey, i know you're scared. but there's no boogie woogies or wooly bullies out there."
54786,Marge,"homer, it's really coming down. could you check on the boys?"
63565,Marge,dwight? are you okay?! dwight!
67331,Marge,"so, i'm worried. i think we should go home."
66395,Marge,oh... i'll see what i can do.
61951,Marge,"we're big fans, mr. gladwell."
60451,Marge,oh.
61551,Marge,"well, i've been using it for laundry soap, but, okay."
63869,Marge,"of course, you're denis leary!"
55278,Marge,i don't want to. i'm mad at you.
66719,Marge,ooh. are you mr. clean?
56681,Marge,that's a wonderful thing you did for my sisters.
61598,Marge,no! you're not going to take my baby to jail!
62061,Marge,so patty. you're a woman who likes women. i guess that fear i always had of you stealing homer away is unfounded.
62993,Marge,is it in a safe neighborhood?
66537,Marge,nothing. i give up. no more dinner parties. our whole social life will be us watching tv and you going to moe's.
61158,Marge,"ooo, the pretender!"
59927,Marge,"yeah, but what can you do?"
56641,Marge,"no, no, no, no! i'm not gonna have my son go to jail over some silly tiff with australia! you'll just have to find some other country to have relations with."
58196,Marge,"aw, aren't you sweet? hey, my pearls!"
63737,Marge,they came in one at a time.
57701,Marge,"make sure he brushes his teeth, lisa."
62350,Marge,my christmas present to myself this year was leaving that place early.
54718,Marge,"oh no, he yawned -- i'm boring him!"
55271,Marge,"oh, shut up, homer! no one wants to hear what you think!"
66302,Marge,homie...
62443,Marge,stop eating the oatmeal! that's the third tub you've eaten!
63403,Marge,pink frosting fixes everything!
64691,Marge,"well, it's been such a... blessing having you around the house, ""making my life easier,"" as you so put it, so i thought you deserved a reward."
64039,Marge,it's the first day of school!
66387,Marge,"oh, urgent notice."
66076,Marge,no danishes!
59254,Marge,maggie loves baby talk.
67606,Marge,"mr. hutz, this is hardly the time or place to discuss this."
65112,Marge,that was a traffic signal.
60257,Marge,"well, i'm just glad you're back."
59823,Marge,"warden, please. this man is a gentle soul. i know he's made mistakes, but someone with his talent belongs on a boardwalk doing caricatures. not behind bars."
65044,Marge,"""broken-leg beauty,"" ""sorry, silver,"" ""no more mint juleps..."" and the fourth one has a title so sad i can't even say it."
57729,Marge,"wait! wait! you can't do this! all my husband did was violate a law that doesn't make sense. now, i'll admit car crashes and fist fights have been down recently, but prohibition has cost us our freedom. our freedom to drink."
59087,Marge,lisa!
57905,Marge,it's a shame what school can do.
58784,Marge,"he's also thankful for your bounty, lord."
63508,Marge,i guess it's time to let my little girl grow up.
54684,Marge,"side-by-side on my piano keyboard / oh lord, why don't we..."
62864,Marge,it's so great to have my children back.
58806,Marge,"oh, i hope we didn't get apu in too much trouble."
60663,Marge,"homie, please. why don't you just leave town?"
62074,Marge,she's a man! looks like patty's gonna get something she didn't register for.
62930,Marge,she's married to buck mitchell! i bet that's why she's here tonight honoring america!
59389,Marge,"bart, stop that! now, we may not have antique furniture, or priceless art work, but we have everything we need right here."
63671,Marge,my eye!
63195,Marge,"homer, no! revenge never solves anything."
67917,Marge,i am glad he's gone.
66449,Marge,i was just trying to learn the--
66623,Marge,"homie, i'm a little worried. do you know there were no customers between two and four?"
59703,Marge,we have to tell them you're not dead.
55328,Marge,homer!
59949,Marge,i got it!
61548,Marge,"stop it, seinfeld."
56692,Marge,"""you can stay with us, and enjoy the sights and sounds of the country."""
56582,Marge,"homer, you can't just keep hanging out with these colobus monkeys. somebody's gonna get parasites."
62077,Marge,"well, i've learned a lesson. just because you're a lesbian, it doesn't make you less of a bein'."
63413,Marge,elmo!
64483,Marge,if homer can join with me.
59247,Marge,"these swedish furniture designers sure have some far-out ideas. i mean, a green table! i wouldn't have thought of that in my wildest dreams."
57140,Marge,"oh, it's beautiful. can it be real chanel?"
57080,Marge,"oh, homie. look at that watch. i've always wanted a watch like that."
61129,Marge,why can't you use the local dry cleaner?
62474,Marge,you told me he was at culinary school!
67496,Marge,and i said he ruined thanksgiving...
66349,Marge,it got sold.
65921,Marge,"homer, i'm glad that you tried, even though now i can't find the washing machine."
67330,Marge,"homer, wake up. there's no answer at home."
64585,Marge,no one in this family is hurling rotten anything at anyone!
57665,Marge,he prefers the company of men!
65416,Marge,no! irish and long island!
55883,Marge,i didn't expect all this.
65900,Marge,in-ground?
67065,Marge,homer.
63031,Marge,i guess i don't.
63883,Marge,he's circling the shelbyville bird sanctuary.
59448,Marge,"kids, would you like a balloon?"
58401,Marge,that's the kind of faucet i want for your bathroom.
61510,Marge,"oh god, we're in a belly. everyone take off your shoes."
67372,Marge,"well, he certainly must have been motivated. prime location, eighteen bedrooms, moat... we shouldn't be able to afford this."
55521,Marge,and what if we don't?
64571,Marge,"and homer, put on some pants."
61116,Marge,all we have left are the earthquake ham and the condolence ham.
56645,Marge,"""australia was originally founded as a settlement for british convicts."" lisa, watch your camera."
63428,Marge,tell me later!
59702,Marge,"oh my, they made you a shrine!"
65974,Marge,"oh, good. he needs his sleep."
62233,Marge,"homer, i know where ray is."
55852,Marge,i think you might like this... it's about a boy who goes to war... his hand is deformed in an accident...
60854,Marge,but there's no room for you.
60372,Marge,aww...
60880,Marge,"oh my goodness, it looks just like the kwik-e-mart!"
66346,Marge,"oh, i bet my story's more interesting."
62615,Marge,"come on, we're going to that store! before the next commercial makes me do something else."
54596,Marge,i did tell you.
63963,Marge,"another religion? you know, you're just gonna drop the whole thing when you go to college and get a jewish boyfriend."
67007,Marge,"homer, couldn't we pawn my engagement ring instead?"
64082,Marge,"ooo, mommy's little baby is getting big and chubby! who's a chubby baby?"
64174,Marge,"oh, bart, i don't care that this is just an act. you've finally become the boy every mother dreams of: a girl."
65867,Marge,"ned, homie's a little cranky right now. more than his eye, i think you hurt his feelings."
58744,Marge,"oh, mister price, i loved you in the abominable doct..."
59938,Marge,it's only two blocks away!
67344,Marge,bring the television up. bart's got his vision back!
65521,Marge,homer!
66756,Marge,what? i never give up hope.
64068,Marge,"no, no. i'm just happy i can finally serve this cake."
66407,Marge,our boat painting!
55276,Marge,"well, it's nice. but who is this woman?"
57546,Marge,i'm not wild about these high-risk ventures. they sound a little risky.
54812,Marge,"honey, what's done is done. no matter what happens, we'll pull through. we always do."
60534,Marge,everything here is something.
58084,Marge,my pleasure.
65027,Marge,i told you you should've stopped the tickling.
60144,Marge,"we hate her, homer."
57316,Marge,i don't think you should. let lisa be alone with her new friends.
58150,Marge,there's no shame in being a pariah.
55969,Marge,it's almost nine-thirty!
62839,Marge,cleaning up before the housekeeper comes.
60047,Marge,"ned, i'm worried about you. you've been working non-stop for the past week."
54853,Marge,"lisa, what's gotten into you?"
60747,Marge,"that's funny. hm, i don't feel sucked out."
55986,Marge,mayor quimby! what are you doing here?
59848,Marge,"oh, geez..."
55674,Marge,"honey, did you have any luck?"
62950,Marge,"o-kay... tonight we're gonna discuss little ways to keep your romance alive. make time for each other -- an hour, an evening, a mini-vacation..."
55608,Marge,"hi, homie. it's really starting to snow. i think you should come home."
55724,Marge,that's nice.
56379,Marge,"homer, no. you're going to get lost."
67446,Marge,"homie, quit tossing."
63099,Marge,the show starts at three. you promise you'll be here?
67347,Marge,"bart, it's past your bedtime."
65899,Marge,i'm not going to sleep!
64344,Marge,"hold it right there, bub. what kind of civilized people eat the body and blood of their savior?"
55220,Marge,"morning, honey."
58087,Marge,"well, like we say, the right house for the right person!"
59808,Marge,let's let a little sunshine in.
54866,Marge,"bart, don't use the touch of death on your sister."
61898,Marge,evergreen terrace.
64709,Marge,"you didn't see a boy lose his swim trunks, did you?"
65338,Marge,"usually when i say something like that, something extremely embarrassing happens. i'm gonna say goodnight before it does."
57802,Marge,sorry.
64628,Marge,"that's not sesame street, that's a gay bar."
61938,Marge,shut up!
63444,Marge,find out if he has a wife! we could double date!
57261,Marge,"wait -- if i remember my heloise, the trick to getting out gum is peanut butter."
58069,Marge,"so, you're married and you're looking for your first house, mr. and mrs..."
63354,Marge,experts see new links between pacifier overuse and low achievement!
67764,Marge,patty! selma! we're home.
62990,Marge,why couldn't he give up this like he gives up everything else?
61013,Marge,we can't sell the house. we can't live here. what are we going to do?
66182,Marge,"postage, marked in pesetas? who are those letters from?"
66792,Marge,so what do we do?
56600,Marge,so in a few months both of you will have a brand new brother or sister.
57399,Marge,you've already used up your birthday and christmas presents on that peach tree we got you. and you hardly ever play with that anymore.
59793,Marge,"how's your back, homie?"
57143,Marge,"it fits like a dream, too. but we can't afford $90 even if it is a bargain. it wouldn't be right to buy something just for me. if it were a suit we could all wear, maybe, then..."
62026,Marge,"well, i don't like this movie. and i'm going to boycott your financier... mr. burns."
59239,Marge,"he shouldn't have deceived me, but i'm just so relieved lenny's okay."
61234,Marge,"oh, relax. i'm sure it's just your brain going crazy."
62601,Marge,he deserves to be hailed at this wing ding.
58908,Marge,"ooh, i heard about that place on ""the red grocer."""
56380,Marge,such a violent motif.
65661,Marge,great paper.
65767,Marge,"homer! dual incomes, no kids at two o'clock!"
57617,Marge,pleased to meet you.
55027,Marge,you light up my days / and fill my nights / with song.... it can't be wrong / when it feels so goo/right / cause you -- you
64084,Marge,hm. you're not usually this greedy.
65240,Marge,i'm a happily married woman!
59233,Marge,i can't get maggie to eat. maybe if you try...
63904,Marge,"wow, lenny went all out!"
67404,Marge,well leave it to good old mary bailey to finally step in and do something about that hideous genetic mutation.
56002,Marge,didn't you realize all you had to do was report him to the police?
64998,Marge,"homer simpson, that man's albums have given you decades of entertainment -- and seen you through some very square times. help him!"
64377,Marge,maybe this will take your mind off work.
63546,Marge,"oh my, it's five o'clock! i missed visiting hours."
62762,Marge,"i'm sorry, but i love homer."
60911,Marge,"hey, hot stuff. i've got a competition tomorrow. i could use a good-luck snuggle."
59294,Marge,"no, no, i mean the dream of a good job, a loving family, and a home in the suburbs."
58049,Marge,"any time, my angel."
58450,Marge,shh! they'll hear us.
57070,Marge,we're getting our christmas picture taken.
56647,Marge,no. i said coffee.
67431,Marge,a simpson on a t-shirt. i never thought i'd see the day.
57200,Marge,a professional in an ape mask is still a professional.
63458,Marge,we left her last week and she didn't make it home for dinner!
62746,Marge,that's funny.
54688,Marge,my eye!
57041,Marge,"goodnight, lisa."
65569,Marge,well i don't like it.
60699,Marge,"homie, it's five p.m. we're having dinner."
63003,Marge,"empathy means you're looking at lisa, and feeling what she feels. your sister poured her heart into rescuing those animals to forget the pain of being upstaged in jazz. and now..."
62207,Marge,knockers on route 98.
58163,Marge,"now homer, listen, i've had enough! / in our family videos, we have plainly seen / you're a singing, dancing, entertainment machine!"
64971,Marge,"i'm okay, i'm okay."
58246,Marge,omigosh! maybe he was telling the truth about everything.
55264,Marge,"oh, there's a spot, dear."
55879,Marge,amazing!
54591,Marge,"homer, i really don't want to feed you."
64423,Marge,"bart, you've always been a handful, but you've never interfered with my reproductive freedom. why now?"
64107,Marge,while your father and your grandfather have a drink we're going to see sights.
56627,Marge,homer!
56684,Marge,"i think we should call a town meeting. if we don't do something soon, we won't get any tourists at all."
61886,Marge,"nelson, doesn't that hurt your teeth?"
64165,Marge,you've been spending so much time with her.
59083,Marge,you honor us.
62433,Marge,"oh, sugar-booger!"
67900,Marge,hmmm huh.
57910,Marge,"bart, would you like to read a book?"
62629,Marge,"homie, what's wrong? did those pork chops give you a tummy ache?"
61132,Marge,we don't have time for choking!
60190,Marge,"oh, my goodness..."
64097,Marge,"i'm sorry for fibbing. tell you what -- if you don't like it, you can complain all the way home."
60471,Marge,dude sure got his comeuppance.
55057,Marge,"oh, homie. hey, come over here and feel our baby kicking."
60659,Marge,"hold your heads up high, kids."
58320,Marge,"""this is geraldine, and the devil made me miss your call. so, here come de beep. here come de beep."""
59407,Marge,"lisa, you've got to learn that life isn't always fair. try to channel your disappointment into something creative, like a sampler."
59142,Marge,is that lisa?
64879,Marge,auf wiedersehen.
60889,Marge,i can bench twice as much as when i started! and look at my abs!
57920,Marge,and sometimes i feel so smothered by this family i just want to scream till my lungs explode! uh... i'll go start dinner now.
56720,Marge,"homer, don't take this personally, but i've obtained a court order to prevent you from planning this wedding."
60983,Marge,"what is it, sweetie?"
59556,Marge,"ooh, we're ""cordially"" invited... this saturday... to join otto and becky at... 742 evergreen terrace? that's our address!"
56280,Marge,what! what?
66429,Marge,"okay... i see your point. we should sell the painting, keep all the money, and never, ever tell the van houtens."
63688,Marge,"hey, parents are allowed to keep some secrets."
64146,Marge,homie?
63851,Marge,well... okay.
58936,Marge,still no visitors! it's time we opened up a can of whup-tushy on this situation. what's the number for luigi's?
64570,Marge,but we insist on paying our own way.
58234,Marge,"so, you kids really love the leader, huh? even more than your parents?"
55708,Marge,we're too late!
57664,Marge,"homer, didn't john seem a little... festive to you?"
60297,Marge,look at all the empty calories.
58836,Marge,i don't think you're gay. i just have to do my grocery shopping. now please gimme my keys.
55209,Marge,like snuggling...
54941,Marge,that's no reason to buy a pony!
57251,Marge,"with bart gone, and now you and your father, i'm not going to have anyone to--"
55586,Marge,"but i think i'm allergic to seafood. the last time i ate shrimp, my throat closed up and i went into convulsions."
67579,Marge,yes.
57349,Marge,"i knew you'd do well, homer."
65284,Marge,now i have to change the nipple!
56153,Marge,no one's going anywhere. we're going to clean the whole house from top to bottom.
57286,Marge,cannons are designed to hurt. they're designed to hurt.
60328,Marge,"gee, everyone looks so happy."
61371,Marge,i always keep one near the bed for you.
60412,Marge,"get off me, you little... nerd!"
64503,Marge,"i should be, i'm left-handed. i've been using my right hand all these years 'cause i didn't want to seem unusual in any way."
55051,Marge,marge.
62678,Marge,"homer, you brought us to this horrible place on purpose?"
65265,Marge,just look happy!
67187,Marge,"goodbye, lisa. my darling little lisa."
64799,Marge,there are no books in the car.
65846,Marge,your father wasted his whole life being married to your mother and having you. we've got to find him a boyfriend before it's too late!
55722,Marge,"wait a minute. that was ""prince of tides."""
56055,Marge,this could be a whole new beginning for springfield.
64597,Marge,fish theme! that tells me nothing!
67366,Marge,what's wrong?
58616,Marge,"homer, excuse yourself."
58514,Marge,that's me!
56632,Marge,look!
60480,Marge,bill... bill...
66495,Marge,let me just say this once: i'm good.
64796,Marge,everything's just the way i remember it...
62555,Marge,i'd better wash that thing. it's hard to know where the suit ends and you begin.
65212,Marge,"sure, your dad's great, but i'm fun too -- look at me eat, huh! d'oh! d'oh! d'oh!"
60986,Marge,"lisa, honey you spelled the word wrong, but you did the right thing."
64894,Marge,"homie, i know you had a terrible experience, but it's over."
64679,Marge,"lisa, too humble."
60142,Marge,"concentrate, homer."
55202,Marge,"oh, that's sweet."
60139,Marge,"i want goggles, too."
57327,Marge,"i'm afraid we haven't been entirely honest with you, bart. you see... you have a brother."
63631,Marge,i'm going to the successful ladies room!
55059,Marge,oh dear...
59902,Marge,"well, i think it's good for a show to go off the air before it becomes stale and repetitive."
56444,Marge,thirty cents off shake 'n bake. homer!
65239,Marge,"look, i came to talk about my husband, and... how did we get in here?"
64074,Marge,oh my god. we're out on the street!
65890,Marge,so without the kids we can have sophisticated grownup talk.
60379,Marge,nooky in new york?
64116,Marge,"but then you remarried us, and we were as solid as ever."
57980,Marge,you lied to me! you promised to get rid of this gun!
60239,Marge,good. i'm just saying that any boy who doesn't like you is not worth your time.
65865,Marge,it's not chinchilla. i just thought she needed more sleep.
58014,Marge,"homer, please."
62809,Marge,"homer, i can't believe i was thinking of letting you touch my elbow through a cloth!"
57174,Marge,no-no-no-no-nooo!
58085,Marge,do you bowl often?
62205,Marge,homer! i woke up to find an owl eating a mouse on the pillow next to me.
62830,Marge,"yes, unless..."
55214,Marge,"ohh, well, i guess he'll be happy when he comes to."
60256,Marge,so you're just going to pay lip service to our church?
57418,Marge,no. it's a house of ill fame... a house of loose ethics...
60792,Marge,we are not staying at moe's. maggie's already drunk on the fumes. and she's a mean drunk.
66744,Marge,one night. the one night of the year i want homer home with his family and he can't even do that.
64923,Marge,"bart, sweetie..."
57550,Marge,"well, maybe it's all for the best..."
62269,Marge,"don't worry about the competition, sweetie. whenever i enter a contest i tell myself i'm going to win because, sometimes, if you believe hard enough, god cuts you a break. after all, he works for us. our prayers pay his salary."
56009,Marge,"ruth, that's a lot of hooey. it's not over until it's over."
61212,Marge,here's a clue: a discarded orange wedge!
57438,Marge,"well, i pictured cocktail parties and candle-lit dinners. i pictured napkins... homer, i want to throw a dinner party."
57793,Marge,hello. listen lady.
66879,Marge,uh... pop culture and current events.
62282,Marge,"sweetie, don't worry. god wouldn't spring the rapture on us unannounced. he'd send us signs, like, i don't know, all the dogs getting on a spaceship and leaving."
57190,Marge,"come here, maggie."
62375,Marge,what do i do?
59856,Marge,"umm... i guess i'll, i'll have the chicken tandoori."
63513,Marge,"well, no one's disputing that."
57955,Marge,not all of them...
61918,Marge,"well, i just made the bathroom floor smell like lemons. where's the award for that?"
67445,Marge,"now, now, homer. bart's busy working on his science project."
63977,Marge,"so, how did you two meet?"
64509,Marge,"read a little more, honey."
65125,Marge,"well, what brought you to springfield? was it our frito lay distribution center?"
57345,Marge,"mr. scorpio, this house is almost too good for us. i keep expecting to get the bum's rush."
56022,Marge,i can name ten things! i... i made sloppy joes...
55307,Marge,"selma, i've never seen you so happy. giggling like a schoolgirl."
60852,Marge,hello?
64148,Marge,it's all my fault: homer wanted to serve those little cocktail hot dogs. but no. i had to have spring rolls! they taste like nothing!
56207,Marge,and those.
66119,Marge,did you pack everything you need?
57026,Marge,"this year, i'm making earplugs out of biscuit dough!"
66602,Marge,ta-da!
60206,Marge,you found a corpse when you were twelve? no wonder you've been so traumatized.
59501,Marge,"oh, no."
63307,Marge,i played a day and a night!
55927,Marge,"homer! you've got to stop insulting everyone, especially your boss."
56840,Marge,illegal gambling in my house?!
64964,Marge,p?! the a.a.r.p.?! well that tears it. i don't want this milk and i'm not gonna take it back.
56667,Marge,"patty, selma. what are you doing here?"
59138,Marge,and then afterwards...
61655,Marge,what about uncle tyrone?
56353,Marge,"there's that side of it. but there's also... help me out here, lisa."
60661,Marge,dessert is three desserts.
60624,Marge,"freshen your drinks, ladies?"
62011,Marge,who's watching the kids?
65060,Marge,"he's on his best behavior, which is very impressive considering he's mad about a sports result."
60013,Marge,i cut off my husband's thumb!
60105,Marge,"ohhh... ohhh... oh, pierce, that's gooood..."
65040,Marge,"so whatever you did to my husband, it was too effective!"
66152,Marge,"she's a superfreak, superfreak, she's superfreaky, yow!"
56747,Marge,"homer, homer find a place for all these little miracles."
55907,Marge,"bart, run upstairs and get grampa's medicine!"
64676,Marge,"well, whoever moves in, it can't be worse than having a murderer next door."
67581,Marge,well... what's the problem you're having?
58062,Marge,"stop, homer! stop it! let me out!"
61178,Marge,what are we gonna do to that field?
59169,Marge,"i'm having a hard time seeing. homer, did you remember to put the fog lights in?"
62150,Marge,and i'm so sick of that story about finding an onion ring in your french fries. it was twenty years ago!
61800,Marge,thanks for taking the job. i'm sorry my husband is being so difficult.
62062,Marge,"well, i guess i could have seen the signs."
64297,Marge,"okay, i'm going to put a stop to this ""ultimate punching."""
55547,Marge,i could get a job.
57797,Marge,"oh, good morning, maude."
66971,Marge,what?
58326,Marge,"i'm so proud of you, homie."
58360,Marge,and the school nurse says bart has the plague.
63961,Marge,"i know. we had a fight, we were both tempted... we're human. the important thing is, we love each other."
55174,Marge,what? name me one person who's gotten rich by doing yo-yo tricks.
59898,Marge,oopsie!
61592,Marge,"homer, before you get anywhere near the escalator, you've got to tie those shoes. homer!"
58167,Marge,"homie, this whole town runs on a tune! / our churches, our clubs our government too."
66848,Marge,"ooh, i didn't know we could decorate our cars."
62754,Marge,i sure would! let me just get us some iced tea.
67389,Marge,don't talk to her like that.
66685,Marge,homer! turn off that horrible machine!
63186,Marge,my husband meant no harm. there must be some way he can pay for what he did. he's good at opening jars.
61640,Marge,"all right, kids, you don't have to go. but i insist we do something tonight as a family. we'll play board games, put photos in an album, measure how much you've grown..."
60443,Marge,i said you'll be late for school.
58874,Marge,get in! get in!
56564,Marge,they are?
59402,Marge,"at least you don't have to feed any of the stuff i bought at the fair. well, except the mop."
58164,Marge,sure your dad's singing / could make your hair curl / but you too bart / have sung and danced like a girl.
60873,Marge,i do!
67556,Marge,how many of you were hit on the head with mallets last week?
62343,Marge,"what's wrong, bart? you love youth culture!"
57985,Marge,why can't we stay here?
64732,Marge,"you go ahead, i'll stay here. if i get something on this handbag, i won't be able to return it."
64512,Marge,i made it into a sampler!
60333,Marge,wouldn't it be great if that man and woman got together?
59153,Marge,"homer, you're supposed to be hunting for bart!"
59172,Marge,"oh, no!"
59729,Marge,"well, maybe a sip. i don't want to offend our mentalist."
61844,Marge,"yes, it's something, dear."
61062,Marge,you made your own breakfast?
66991,Marge,hey homie. did you try the punch?
65515,Marge,"...and that's how berber carpet got its name, according to some. lisa, how was your day?"
64902,Marge,"the moms and i had a falling out, which was a shame. we had been such good friends."
60260,Marge,and a happy and healthy new year.
61380,Marge,when bad things happen to cute children says that a new pet will pull you out of your sorrow cycle.
66743,Marge,i don't know.
57365,Marge,"listen to me. the instant that homer's in any kind of danger, i want you to throw in this towel and stop the fight."
55815,Marge,bart!
64744,Marge,no it's not!
57298,Marge,"wave bye-bye to our house, maggie. bye-bye, tree."
61629,Marge,i'm afraid this time a coat of whitewash won't cover it.
67761,Marge,"homer, remember you promised you'd try to limit pork to six servings a week?"
55157,Marge,homer! if maggie really doesn't want to leave the house maybe she should just stay with you.
64981,Marge,"oh hello, young man! where's your father?"
64461,Marge,who's ready for panini?
61962,Marge,"now, before we eat, let's remember what we're celebrating today -- after many years of hard work, your father finally paid off the mortgage."
64647,Marge,what do you think?
64768,Marge,that is so sweet!
60820,Marge,anything good?
58740,Marge,nothing! i can't believe vincent price would lend his name to such a shoddy product.
56560,Marge,i want to see daddy fly!
61207,Marge,"now, there'll be no more trouble from that meddlesome bartender."
60575,Marge,"bart, your prank caused ten million dollars in damages."
62973,Marge,"we'd love to! you know, i've never met your wife."
57861,Marge,great! we're all going to new york!
66010,Marge,i'd like to go home now. and to think you'd do this on mother's day.
65554,Marge,hummingbirds! hum and get it!
64646,Marge,i'm still mad at you from last night.
59275,Marge,"wow, a fifties nostalgia cafe!"
54979,Marge,"that's your hero. ""name another dad you talked to about parenting."""
58558,Marge,how vile.
66596,Marge,lakwando's mind won't be on the game. aaaand benched.
61960,Marge,i just don't see why one little pill should cost thirty dollars!
66097,Marge,that's great. i wonder what surprise your father has in store.
54977,Marge,hank?! hank who?
61313,Marge,i think these are my homie's size...
57398,Marge,"honey, we don't need to drive 400 miles to clean animals. you can stay right here and give the dog a bath. or trim the cat's nails."
63608,Marge,no! don't talk like that! there's always hope.
62142,Marge,this is a house!
54958,Marge,"he's just exhausted. lisa, do you know how much it costs to keep a pony?"
58395,Marge,take those silly things off.
57673,Marge,"oh, geez louise, you don't even know what you're worried about anymore. john's a witty, urbane person."
65308,Marge,enough!
58858,Marge,"geez! try the gas pedal, gramma. it's right there, next to the brake. oh, forgodssa-- go back to new jersey..."
59098,Marge,"besides, it's not just his chisled good looks. people magazine says he's a devoted father, goes to church every week, and likes to fix things around the... homer, let's make love!"
62179,Marge,"ooh, a tiffany's box! and the thing inside is from tiffany's! homie, you've never done this before. how'd you afford it?"
55374,Marge,"don't worry, he can't stay mad at you forever. he is your brother."
57846,Marge,"i tell you, chief, i just don't know what we're going to do with him."
61024,Marge,no.
54868,Marge,seventy-five dollars? ned must be desperate!
62834,Marge,i don't know. i'm still frowny with you. do you really think women are mentally inferior?
57818,Marge,"homer, why aren't you at work?"
56301,Marge,it's nine thirty p.m. and you spent your whole saturday drinking beer in maggie's kiddy pool.
59752,Marge,it's ten in the morning!
60461,Marge,last year's mvp. he sweeps up toenails at the beauty parlor.
59571,Marge,"ooo, ooo, i've always wanted to use rosemary in something."
66639,Marge,good everybody. you won't believe it but we actually turned a profit today.
58417,Marge,"look at this little plastic couple. mmm, so full of hopes, potential, dreams for the future..."
60121,Marge,"well, you can tell she's never had kids. look how high and firm her breasts are."
66559,Marge,the city's broke. the fire department has to raise money by delivering pizza.
67456,Marge,i wish this family was as close as the flanders.
58220,Marge,you what?!
57838,Marge,or save the endangered alaskan salmon?
57733,Marge,"bills... bills... oo, a free sample of gasoline... a note from publishers' clearinghouse saying we're out of the running... oh look, lisa! you got something."
62667,Marge,i'm so glad you washed that stupid logo off your head.
55925,Marge,i don't think it's a good idea to humiliate your boss on his birthday.
66773,Marge,homer! you have to stop dropping your pants for everyone who claims they're a doctor!
67722,Marge,homer?
66128,Marge,dear christian god...
57949,Marge,how horrible.
62018,Marge,"god, that junior league burns me up."
63321,Marge,i'm also pleased!
63581,Marge,i get fifty thousand dollars a hit -- how much do you make?
67432,Marge,"homer, i'd be lying if i didn't say that this scares me a little. but we all have a calling, a reason the almighty put us on this earth. and yours might be to dance on dugouts."
59361,Marge,wow! he should have his foot insured by lloyds of london!
55585,Marge,gimme that.
57467,Marge,why? am i pregnant?
55140,Marge,"alright, don't whine. just put it in my left hand."
62647,Marge,uhh... yeah!
59900,Marge,why don't we stop this nonsense. i'm not mad anymore.
58487,Marge,"okay, but you've accomplished a lot. you've made me very happy."
58734,Marge,"okay... oh, leather craft."
57605,Marge,"we're over here, homie!"
66946,Marge,"we could look this ""id"" thing up in the dictionary."
62380,Marge,i've got my groove back!
64243,Marge,"lisa, you are going to look so pretty."
64440,Marge,you like potato...
62638,Marge,upward bound: the toughest behavioral modification camp in northwest oregon.
56851,Marge,you have the right to remain silent...
58295,Marge,"ooo... did you hear that, lisa?"
58206,Marge,over the sink! over the sink!
57720,Marge,beer!
63559,Marge,"oh, that's so sad."
60064,Marge,"ohhh, thank you."
61172,Marge,"yeah, indians don't sit around drinking beer and watching tv."
62543,Marge,i thought it was arm wrestling.
64608,Marge,"hey, that's pretty nifty. let me try."
62563,Marge,i'm going out for some air.
58824,Marge,"oh, isn't that sweet."
64342,Marge,"no! when we get you to the safe zone, we can cure your father!"
62702,Marge,"hmm, well, then maybe i will come by more often. and homer can spend more time with our kids... he's watching them now!"
67512,Marge,"hmmm, well, thank you. gee, everyone's so nice here at the monster truck rally. look, homer, champagne!"
55457,Marge,"i can't believe you're giving up church, homer."
61533,Marge,i never want you in this house again!
66582,Marge,i-- i don't really know that much about--
60888,Marge,ten... e-le-ven... twelve!
61061,Marge,"a little bit, yeah."
56365,Marge,why so glum?
66572,Marge,"yes, lisa?"
63284,Marge,"fine, i'll log onto wahoo or yippy or a-o-k, or pooka-dooka, or whatever it's called."
56938,Marge,"oh, my."
67076,Marge,it is?
54973,Marge,"homer, could you turn off the tv? there's a little test i want you to take."
61922,Marge,how dare you show my daughter a life of fun and possibility?
62160,Marge,my kids are on your boat -- turn back!
66415,Marge,"oh my gosh, that's beautiful! i've never seen a painting with a lighthouse before."
61724,Marge,"no, homer."
55673,Marge,no. don't you have health insurance at work?
64615,Marge,our wedding china's ruined.
63708,Marge,"honey, this is how i save money on ketchup and mustard."
55894,Marge,"bart, i'm going to get you..."
57151,Marge,"ninety percent of the time, if the gas isn't pumping, this is your problem."
59476,Marge,"cheer up, homie. you don't need friends to be happy. i haven't had a friend in years."
57368,Marge,what? what?! what am i missing? what?
66977,Marge,"oh, homer. i am so proud of you."
55785,Marge,you don't have to start drinking right away. i was thinking we could go for a bike ride.
66270,Marge,"for your information, gloria, my ""wassail"" is just gatorade i put in the microwave!"
60502,Marge,"wow, everything is so high-tech."
55244,Marge,no.
66753,Marge,"oh, my poor homie! this is what i was hoping for... for it not to have been completely his fault! thank you, moe."
63906,Marge,"okay, then videogames."
60271,Marge,"food keeps my family happy, so i make a few practice dinners before showtime. 'cause at six o'clock, we go live!"
61785,Marge,"it's so beautiful and modern. ooh, a sub-zero fridge..."
58142,Marge,stop that!
63149,Marge,i'm so sick of gil... he ruins thanksgiving... uses my leg razor to peel his carrots...
56668,Marge,"homer, be careful with my sisters' heads. their necks are brittle."
56464,Marge,i don't care who started it. i don't ever want to see you two fighting like that ever again. we love you both. you're not in competition with each other. repeat. you are not in competition with each other.
56874,Marge,"well, do you have a number where we can reach him?"
65815,Marge,"look, maggie! they have a story lady!"
66550,Marge,no. i think i went too far.
58882,Marge,"c'mon, move your butt! you're blocking traffic!"
59300,Marge,"excellent, ramrod. civilized people solve their disputes with words."
59975,Marge,on the ground?
57097,Marge,there you are! you can help me spray the cookies...
57466,Marge,"only three cavities, bart. your best check-up ever. i'm going to make you my specialty -- butterscotch chicken."
57585,Marge,"yeah, that's it."
65872,Marge,did you tell the teacher?
58958,Marge,"well, it is a sin to waste food..."
66117,Marge,"it's the only way i can get him to take his ""vitamins."""
59276,Marge,will you turn that engine off?
63405,Marge,"excuse me, excuse me, i'm in the sale! i'm in the sale!"
58256,Marge,how about compuglobal hypermeganet?
60061,Marge,"yup, delaware's got it all."
60996,Marge,"today's book is ""bridget jones' diary."" now, let's go around the room and analyze why we didn't read it."
62840,Marge,"don't be so naïve, lisa. those people all talk to each other!"
55965,Marge,"sure, homer. trapped in vending machines. okay."
59166,Marge,"oh, yeah? what's a palate?"
67362,Marge,"homer, why don't you just call the pharmacy and --"
67928,Marge,"it's getting less and less likely you're going to yell ""surprise"" and have all my friends jump out..."
59167,Marge,"homie, my women's intuition's acting up. something bad's going to happen if you go in there."
64099,Marge,what is that soothing sound?
67830,Marge,"my quilt! six generations, gone."
65596,Marge,"well, maybe we should check into a motel."
60358,Marge,"hm, all clean, just the way i left it."
59012,Marge,i'm not thinking that!
65657,Marge,"relax, kids, just be yourselves."
63746,Marge,we accept!
65925,Marge,not gonna say.
61291,Marge,i've got a bad feeling about this. let's check the suit closet.
58706,Marge,now it's marge's time to shine!
65023,Marge,"ooh, the ""fan cam!"""
61138,Marge,stop saying things!
64786,Marge,just sugarplums and buttercups.
54972,Marge,"homie, we're back."
57306,Marge,"lisa, that's not at all like you."
63104,Marge,"they will be! ready, bullies?"
67902,Marge,"homer, please."
61038,Marge,"bart, you can hear us?"
65395,Marge,it's death! i recognize him from fortieth-birthday cards!
63424,Marge,oops.
62673,Marge,"well, we better start looking."
59475,Marge,so how was your ride with barney?
63017,Marge,"i did it! what's that strange feeling? it's ""of accomplishment""!"
66538,Marge,"yes, for us. but not for lisa! never for lisa. we're going to help her make friends."
63408,Marge,well all the other husbands don't come home dirty from fighting.
55620,Marge,he does not.
64236,Marge,my daughter's here for her first mani-pedi.
62362,Marge,"i'm at a rest stop south of springfield. i know, you're sorry now. then you'll buy me some kwik-e-mart flowers, maybe a box of candy where half the pieces mysteriously have ""testing bites,"" and a week later you'll be back to your old thoughtless self."
58640,Marge,you shouldn't be watching the learning channel. you need to take it easy.
67679,Marge,"we were seniors in high school, but we had never even met."
59541,Marge,there's our broadway baby!
57583,Marge,"hey, what's going on?"
58563,Marge,"oh, am i in the way?"
58929,Marge,just do it.
56772,Marge,exhausting. it took the children forty minutes to locate canada on the map.
56867,Marge,now just a darned minute! this town is a part of who you are.
67101,Marge,"homer, you embarrassed us in front of the whole congregation, and today's sermon was one you should have really listened to."
54950,Marge,"hmm, oh dear, we're in serious trouble here. we're just going to have to cut down on luxuries."
65058,Marge,i'm her sister. and you?
64791,Marge,i know where we are! this is the neighborhood where i grew up!
58155,Marge,stop this madness. it's just a washcloth.
61114,Marge,this is where duffman lives now. but i'm not sure we should go in there.
57336,Marge,you took a new job in a strange town without discussing it with your family?
66597,Marge,and now to make my big move.
56714,Marge,"well, it was a lovely festival. the best movie won and mr. burns found there are some awards that can't be bought."
55890,Marge,with your father on the road all the time i tried to compensate for his absence...
67343,Marge,of course. homer!?
65847,Marge,help me out of the closet! wonderful older man seeks life partner before rapidly-encroaching death.
57030,Marge,"well, maybe my headache will go away once the show starts."
54680,Marge,"homie, someone owes me a back scratch."
63620,Marge,i wish there was a gym for us regular ladies.
59801,Marge,a sunset!
64380,Marge,"well, i brought a few items to make our night extra-special. massage oil..."
57031,Marge,do they have to play that rock music?! every note is pounding into my skull!
67894,Marge,i thought i did.
58533,Marge,"nelson?! i explicitly forbade bart from playing with that little monster. ooo, bart is in deep, deep trouble."
56663,Marge,homer!
59315,Marge,"boy, that sounds fun."
56801,Marge,"ah, i think i'm okay. it was scary, but, in a weird way, it was also kind of exhilarating."
61391,Marge,"marge simpson, long-time reader, first-time stander-upper... did you have any special training to become a writer?"
67718,Marge,couldn't we just use rouge for this?
64865,Marge,"more oxycontin candy, sweetie?"
61754,Marge,wait right here for our encore...
67181,Marge,what's brunch?
62035,Marge,"all too well. rap music belongs in the rubbish bin. it encourages punching, boastfulness, and rudeness to ""ho's."""
61115,Marge,"give it a rest, barry."
66243,Marge,"isabel's only eight. as she grows up, surprising things will happen to her body... of beliefs. but she could always use a friend like you."
61260,Marge,"oh, forget it. bart, don't waste your money on me."
60655,Marge,"you said you'd do something, and you followed through on it."
63651,Marge,keith olbermann?!
56626,Marge,turn it off.
61892,Marge,"homer, that was for the dog."
62934,Marge,only if he'll kiss me back.
64018,Marge,let's go get my little girl.
62866,Marge,i don't know. maybe there's something unpleasant blocking my memory of you.
55084,Marge,"y'know bart, i don't think this is such a bad present. maybe you just shouldn't talk into it as loud as your father does."
67752,Marge,no.
63899,Marge,bart simpson! did you just spray water on me?!
66782,Marge,"oh, sweetie..."
60641,Marge,"homie, i'm sorry. i can't. i just keep thinking about everything we're gonna miss. the kids growing up, grandchildren..."
56922,Marge,what are you doing with my children?!
57156,Marge,we're not poor.
57534,Marge,good doggy. good doggy!
58465,Marge,"hang on, homie. i'm gonna try to set her down."
57119,Marge,wow!
63446,Marge,hello?
61201,Marge,"well, i have so much free time now that moe's our babysitter."
56997,Marge,"let's quietly and calmly discuss the pros and cons of your controversial plan, shall we?"
56603,Marge,"homie, i--"
58871,Marge,that's your hat!
64451,Marge,start the joke!
65852,Marge,"don't you want to be happy, abe? admit who you are, a wonderful gay man!"
55309,Marge,"now, about your wedding dress. i'm not sure how to put this..."
57659,Marge,"well, i guess it'll always be a monument to grandma's secret drinking problem..."
59920,Marge,don't you mean blocko shirt?
67405,Marge,"you're late for work, homer."
56766,Marge,"and bart isn't doing very well either. he needs boundaries, and structure. there's something about flying a kite at night that's so unwholesome."
58359,Marge,i heard that! you know the rule.
63709,Marge,"no, i'm kind of embarrassed about it."
61457,Marge,boring? is there anything boring about a bad-ass rocker who lived fast and died young?
60565,Marge,what are you doing here?
62188,Marge,"kids, come down for your prom photo!"
59722,Marge,homie!
63816,Marge,shelter?
57267,Marge,bart's room.
57986,Marge,no you're not. he's really not.
57886,Marge,"no i don't! what i mean is, to me you're just a stranger pretending to be something he's not."
56558,Marge,i was a little girl...
66934,Marge,homer! why are you seven hours late?
57714,Marge,no! no more drinking! i'm tired of looking like the world's worst mother.
66626,Marge,shauna! i saw that! i'm going to have to let you go.
60167,Marge,no! everyone should be paired up.
54820,Marge,"bart, watch maggie while i get the laundry."
67631,Marge,um-hmm.
55192,Marge,where's maggie? where's maggie?
57208,Marge,toast.
66539,Marge,those are past-due bills.
62544,Marge,bart... lisa... we've got to get to the mall before it closes.
55190,Marge,"there was more than enough in the swear jar. and if you look inside the doghouse, there's a little surprise."
61193,Marge,"no, no all that's in there is love and gratitude."
60940,Marge,"homer, send these people home. this housewarming party's been going on for two days."
67614,Marge,goodness!
64718,Marge,dammit.
59193,Marge,"oh my, war is terrible."
66231,Marge,this is the last time you'll see that... elevator baby!
67516,Marge,"oh, my little boy, ."
55126,Marge,homer!
58484,Marge,"but they're counting on you to take tickets. and if you sit there with a brave little smile and a festive bow, why, you could be the belle of the ball."
60990,Marge,"oh, what a magical evening. the moonlight, the music, the water..."
55691,Marge,and those potholes are becoming a real nuisance.
55439,Marge,"come here. i want to kiss you, just once, softly and sweetly on your mouth."
59412,Marge,that's a pretty lousy lesson.
57169,Marge,"all right, all right, but if you win, don't make a scene and dance around with your ""woo-hoos,"" please. we can't afford a single slip-up. they're judging us."
56527,Marge,i think i'll go get a picture of the plane taking off.
59029,Marge,now there's the place you want to buy your buttons.
62162,Marge,"well, if he thinks he's getting a corner piece, forget it."
58045,Marge,what?! she didn't do anything.
60832,Marge,"uh, bob... i know you're enjoying fall preview week, but i was wondering if you made any progress towards finding homer's killer?"
63585,Marge,"great. now they're gonna have tummy aches tomorrow, and where will ""super dad"" be then?"
61582,Marge,"well, i feel a buzz, but i don't feel happier. it's not like when i was drinking with homer."
59624,Marge,we were using fifty-dollar bills as toilet paper. and toilet paper as dog toilet paper.
65888,Marge,"if they can be that rude, the food must be great!"
61220,Marge,"well, i've only read it in books."
58110,Marge,"well, i'm just glad you're okay. and i have something to tell you..."
58403,Marge,what happened? you didn't do anything.
57086,Marge,i know you are...
59449,Marge,"well, i'm gonna keep watching as long as they have shocking story twists and endless pillow talk."
65898,Marge,i'm going to take a cab.
55625,Marge,"you know, i don't think i remember... but the story of lisa's first word is very cute."
61930,Marge,"lisa -- breakfast! i know you're mad at me, but i hope you're not mad at cap'n crunch..."
55735,Marge,you look terrible.
63921,Marge,i don't know...
58179,Marge,you're just going into our backyard. no one will see you.
60590,Marge,is that windex?
56869,Marge,"bart, you have roots in this town and you ought to show respect for it. this town is a part of us all, a part of us all, a part of us all. sorry to repeat myself but it'll help you remember."
63736,Marge,my bosoms came in and ruined my balance.
61567,Marge,are we home yet?
62806,Marge,good times.
63835,Marge,fine.
65193,Marge,what are you doing?
67712,Marge,oui.
54626,Marge,you know what i want to be when i grow up?
65011,Marge,"ooh, a pen from the milwaukee hilton! ...a phone answering machine from the '80s!"
65705,Marge,homie?
60941,Marge,"homer aren't you afraid you might be, i don't know, incurring god's wrath?"
61131,Marge,"kids, hurry up and eat! we have to leave for the dentist five minutes ago!"
55744,Marge,with norman fell as zeus!
56859,Marge,i don't think so.
63075,Marge,see.
58704,Marge,that's it.
55779,Marge,"please, homie, i know you can do this."
67180,Marge,"oh, jacques, i'm a married woman."
60755,Marge,not feeling well. going to bed. dinner and breakfast are on the table.
66707,Marge,i don't remember that!
60268,Marge,i've been prying them apart since before you were born!
58302,Marge,is that normal?
62997,Marge,"look... uh... how 'bout we go to the pound, and get a puppy just for you?"
55226,Marge,"oh, honey, right now you're discouraged. but deep down, you know you love the saxophone. i think you should stay in the band."
55435,Marge,why didn't you tell me you felt this way?
56555,Marge,okay. okay... but you're gonna make a big deal outta this. he was a pilot.
60131,Marge,"homer, no! we're not bad parents."
55415,Marge,i'll twist this bottle in your face...
58458,Marge,we have to get out of here!
61664,Marge,"oh, you know, typical boring dayton weather!"
63740,Marge,"i think you've got a point! homie, i'm gonna be a dancer!"
66926,Marge,cash?
67156,Marge,all right. but i'm not very good.
58416,Marge,"ohhh, look, homie. our wedding cake."
60919,Marge,"oh, my gosh, you're right: steroids have turned me into everything i hate. let's go home, sweetie."
60981,Marge,"congratulations, sweetie. you're in the finals!"
55218,Marge,so you think she has talent?
66148,Marge,"i'm engaged to you, my love."
60926,Marge,that's because you keep passing out on our lawn.
64977,Marge,true beauty isn't about hair color?
58551,Marge,eggs?
62419,Marge,"don't worry, we're not evil spirits."
65089,Marge,what's wrong?
59783,Marge,oh no!
60871,Marge,"oh, my god. isn't there anything i can do?"
63813,Marge,"for once, we'll do what maggie wants."
66253,Marge,"homer, you have to take the halloween decorations down before you put the christmas ones up."
61912,Marge,together we broke the biggest story of the semester -- one of the cafeteria workers was spitting in the soup.
58524,Marge,"oh, no you won't."
66528,Marge,one drink.
62718,Marge,i am not an unfit mother!
56316,Marge,oh!
59890,Marge,did you make that awful effigy?
62473,Marge,david and bart just aren't working out. we have to do something.
60931,Marge,"homer, we can't sue the church. they'll poke fun at us in the church bulletin."
55845,Marge,i bought a bell.
54709,Marge,where is he?! where is he?!
66887,Marge,"but it's okay for you guys to know, because you're finally grown-up enough to be trusted with adult information."
56254,Marge,"you just don't get it, do you, homer? you told personal things about our lives even after you promised you wouldn't. i can't trust you anymore."
61977,Marge,"i had a feeling you'd say that. so i prepared something that might help you ""change your tune."""
63355,Marge,"maggie. honey, this is for your own good. growing up means giving up everything that makes you happy."
65299,Marge,"now, lisa tell your side of the story. and use your big voice."
56087,Marge,you have just been robbed by the springfield cat burglar... cute.
63030,Marge,"homie... i think you're taking a little too much credit for my work. i mean, look at your t-shirt!"
63188,Marge,my husband is out there!
67229,Marge,"bart, go to your room!"
56035,Marge,bart! be quiet!
61855,Marge,it's not just the presents -- the kids don't appreciate me anymore. they'd rather hang out with their friends than with their mom.
64251,Marge,i thought i was marrying a man who could play macbeth.
65866,Marge,"ned flanders, i can't believe you struck my husband."
66606,Marge,ned's letting us use his freezer to store the extra sandwiches.
67696,Marge,i'm sorry.
57580,Marge,are you sure the children will get enough nutrition from these pretzels?
55520,Marge,"well, we try, but he has this way of making us think we've punished him when actually we've completely caved in."
60356,Marge,he did such crazy things -- roll clip.
57034,Marge,we can always get more shoes! movemovemove!
60710,Marge,rock 'n' roll fantasy camp!
56226,Marge,"i love ya! i love ya! i love ya! i love ya, mom! gotta go!"
57850,Marge,"well, he sure sucked the fun out of that poem."
60727,Marge,"well, make sure you don't. and try not to let your brother get under your skin."
61339,Marge,this concert is oversold. it's as if a music promoter acted unscrupulously!
62192,Marge,"homer, just settle down. we just got a postcard from maggie."
56724,Marge,maggie! don't talk with your mouth full.
65311,Marge,"well, it's not just kids using springface -- it's moms like me. marge!"
54929,Marge,maybe.
65048,Marge,"c'mon, people. peaches!"
67813,Marge,"oh yes, you do. you just don't know it. the memory of a million drop-stitches flows in your veins."
59928,Marge,"oh, homie, you couldn't keep up a hunger strike. you eat while you brush your teeth. you're eating a huge sausage right now."
56662,Marge,"i wish you wouldn't put homer down like that. he may not be a big success like you, but i can always count on him to provide for the family."
64798,Marge,this was my bedroom! my bedpost smooshes are still in the carpet!
66517,Marge,why don't we have any couples friends?
65188,Marge,"relax, homie. have some leftover galalalalalalalalah."
55557,Marge,worked for the carter administration?
65885,Marge,it's not a skirt. it's a kilt!
57204,Marge,on the street in your mind.
60507,Marge,"ooh, that's the movie phone guy."
55670,Marge,can't you do something for him?
56963,Marge,you don't win friends with sal-ad / you don't win friends with sal-ad...
60851,Marge,"oh thank you, sweetie."
67387,Marge,shush! shut up! quit trying to push us around. stop saying those horrible things and show some manners.
67662,Marge,homer!
59863,Marge,even bonnets?
60210,Marge,maybe we should come back in the daytime.
60776,Marge,hey cops! check out this all-points bulletin!
60532,Marge,"aw, look at all the stuffed coatimundi."
58121,Marge,bart! put down that yellow sweater! nobody's going near their presents until 7 o'clock tomorrow morning.
56203,Marge,hmm?
59933,Marge,"i don't do things that way, lisa."
59328,Marge,i think that's an arm rest.
63527,Marge,"homer, you cannot miss lisa's big day. and you have to come sober!"
58424,Marge,mmm.
65098,Marge,"well, maggie, one key left for us!"
61857,Marge,"i'll be right here at three to pick you up, then i'll take you to the zoo! we can eat fries out of a safari hat!"
58581,Marge,"it's probably nothing, but we just wanted to be sure."
64609,Marge,"oh my gosh, that's adorable! this one's going on the christmas tree."
65774,Marge,homie... it's been a wonderful day... but do you think maybe we're moving a little too quickly?
64953,Marge,a completely new hairstyle!
61545,Marge,"we should do more together. you're my best friend, homie."
63695,Marge,homer really did need those injections.
66907,Marge,hello.
59599,Marge,"this isn't over, becky. i know where you live: my house!"
58902,Marge,"ooh, talk to me, baby."
65498,Marge,thank you! everyone's having a great time.
63711,Marge,"come and get me, you syrupy stack of man-cakes."
61572,Marge,i'm not a drunk!
60839,Marge,"hey, they have latin grammys."
63510,Marge,"maggie, what can i get you for breakfas-- oh. you did everything yourself."
58849,Marge,let's do it.
60937,Marge,i really enjoyed your sermon. particularly the part about the pin in the gutter on lane fifteen.
55741,Marge,"oh my god, you're delirious."
63167,Marge,no!!!
61926,Marge,no one's fighting over you!
64305,Marge,"we need to take this into the belly of the beast. mr. scalper, give me a ticket."
55503,Marge,"now kids, instead of candy, i thought i'd serve an array of healthy fresh fruits."
64178,Marge,almost there...
59821,Marge,not till you finish your sundae.
66269,Marge,"enough! stop! christmas carols only have one verse! well they may have more, but the second verse is where they get all weird and religiousy."
61596,Marge,that doesn't look so big.
57456,Marge,"i must say, luann, you're really handling this splendidly."
58593,Marge,i can't believe it. jerry springer didn't solve our conflict.
57668,Marge,you're being ridiculous.
63357,Marge,"okay, okay, you can have it back!"
57331,Marge,lisa! breakfast! we're having waffles!
55693,Marge,i still think we should have spent the money to fix main street.
64123,Marge,"homer, what's going on? the violin, pants with a crease, why?"
58697,Marge,homer!
56644,Marge,"homer, that's enough."
65423,Marge,barney?
61859,Marge,they grow up so fast.
64912,Marge,"go out on a tuesday? who am i, charlie sheen?"
64457,Marge,oh thank god you're okay!
60783,Marge,they've already told the skybox fans who's gonna win.
60825,Marge,you have to do something to protect my husband.
66677,Marge,you know what? i trust them not to smoke.
65802,Marge,i threw that away because studies show it doesn't do any good!
66404,Marge,maybe.
64765,Marge,poor man. you've been through so much.
64604,Marge,"bart? bart, are you here?"
64364,Marge,fine. i'll take off one glove.
59574,Marge,"well, nobody's perfect. let me just pick those out."
66519,Marge,not the van houtens.
63045,Marge,that almost tore my head off!
57154,Marge,"if detective sipowicz jumped off a cliff, would you do that, too?"
66027,Marge,that's it -- tomorrow we're doing something educational! we're going to the science museum!
55755,Marge,"lisa, the only way you'll lick this is one day at a time. if you can make it till midnight without calling the corey line, you'll know you've beaten it forever."
58398,Marge,"i know, honey. but this is a very unusual situation... at least it would be for most families."
55185,Marge,"no, you're not. when my father got out of the navy, he used to curse a blue streak. it almost cost him his job as a baby photographer. so, my mom put a swear jar in the kitchen. every time he said a bad word, he put in a quarter. what do you think?"
65002,Marge,got a better idea?
57528,Marge,bad dog!
64142,Marge,cue the band.
59353,Marge,"well, it all sounds lovely, but..."
61565,Marge,have you ever walked on stilts? it's not that great.
63060,Marge,it's not giant and it's not in the distance! it's small and it's in our room!
61276,Marge,"it's partly my fault. i've been nagging you so much on this trip, you couldn't know which nags to focus on."
56218,Marge,that's not my mother.
59170,Marge,i better pull over and play it safe.
65352,Marge,why would an entire town go to all this fuss to get rid of one family? what have we done that's so terrible?
58186,Marge,looks like somebody's gonna have to do some yard --
62712,Marge,i didn't say that.
55394,Marge,la-la-la-la-la-la-la.
56534,Marge,i just realized we never had a wedding for the cat and the dog. they've been living in sin.
59397,Marge,"yeah, right, that's what i meant, lisa. state un-fair."
66873,Marge,and it's not even against the rules.
56351,Marge,"but in the end, just when things looked worse, true love triumphed."
66968,Marge,"are you all right, homer?"
63624,Marge,when is straightman gonna pop the question?
64517,Marge,"oooh, a cookbook!"
61762,Marge,you don't sell roadside corn.
62943,Marge,"buck, tabitha, welcome. we'll start your first marriage counseling session as soon as homer gets here."
58223,Marge,homer!
65973,Marge,"every time i call grampa's phone, i get no answer."
64482,Marge,i've been training all my life. i once swept red wine off a white carpet.
60422,Marge,i really appreciate you helping me find homer.
66433,Marge,see what happens when we get greedy?
57457,Marge,"actually, luann, i don't really know anything about yo--"
60956,Marge,"bart, you're suing us?!"
55967,Marge,hey wait!
66184,Marge,"homie, i thought a visit from your old pen pal would cheer you up."
59000,Marge,"homer, what have you done?"
63675,Marge,aren't you going to drink?
63381,Marge,"no, no, i didn't mean--"
61964,Marge,stop making a scene!
59195,Marge,"thanks, homer."
64328,Marge,"really? oh, thank you."
59992,Marge,"well, now i've heard everything."
60728,Marge,"hello, principal skinner."
66057,Marge,"hi, homie! a crazy thing happened when i was ordering your anniversary gift."
64032,Marge,"well, that's what's missing. our lives would be horrible without the kids."
66534,Marge,that's good.
62786,Marge,"homie, i got you something to read on the plane."
61683,Marge,more alive than any of you squares!
62858,Marge,i know what the sun is.
63131,Marge,i'll tell you why: christian charity.
55944,Marge,"wait! before you send him to hell, there's something you should see."
63504,Marge,"did you hear that, maggie-wags? you're a queen!"
61722,Marge,"no, homer."
58519,Marge,are you sure? i can usually smell a scam from two towns over.
62760,Marge,that song was very nice. how'd you think up so many rhyming words?
58038,Marge,what are you doing with that?
58694,Marge,that's not the point. and another thing. i asked you to take out the garbage three days ago and you still haven't--
60483,Marge,it's been so many years since i've seen your father. i hope he's still the magnificent physical specimen he was when he left.
62144,Marge,"can't turn off the power, eh?"
64220,Marge,"you know what a girl likes, mister. so, can i see you again?"
62791,Marge,it's may!
61343,Marge,and i'm an american!
66981,Marge,"oh, homer, mr. burns just said he liked it. once."
62482,Marge,and i am glad you're okay.
63117,Marge,i'll whack you with the whole salad set if you don't start thinking about others! you are going to that party.
67209,Marge,does this girl like him?
63465,Marge,and you can cut your own meat!
66048,Marge,"well, thanks for watching maggie. i just ordered homer's anniversary gift."
64668,Marge,is your room clean?
63274,Marge,"well, it's just about what we need to pay for our fire damage."
56781,Marge,you just don't want to take that test.
61708,Marge,you're not gonna be kissing anybody for a while.
58289,Marge,"homer, your daughter is pouring her heart out!"
54978,Marge,"homer, you made that up. question two: ""who is your son's hero?"""
60953,Marge,"bart, stop that!"
64748,Marge,why do you say such ridiculous things?
66931,Marge,"but i think it does have something to do with your christmas bonus. i keep asking for it, but..."
57982,Marge,"until you decide what's more important - your gun or your family - we can't live in the same house. come on, kids."
59554,Marge,"ooh, and such delicate tissue paper. zig-zag!?"
56842,Marge,"i'm still all those things. only now i'm cleaning up the city, sewing together the social fabric, and unplugging the clogs of our legal system."
56479,Marge,oooh... how'd they get there?
60079,Marge,no.
55016,Marge,pink.
58675,Marge,"oh, i know you're scared, homie. but remember why you're doing this. it's for your father. the man who raised you and nurtured you."
64708,Marge,no time! i don't wanna get stuck behind the joggers from the fat camp.
57481,Marge,"it's true, but he shouldn't say it."
58928,Marge,"yes, that's it! lisa, you oughta be a doorbell salesman!"
67913,Marge,"and this dialogue has none of the wit and sparkle of ""murphy brown."""
58886,Marge,homer...
54744,Marge,we're going to this retreat to give our marriage a tune-up and that's all. no fishing.
65476,Marge,i have to take maggie for her checkup. and a guy's coming to see what the smell is under the house.
67634,Marge,some celery with cream cheese on it?
60730,Marge,my poor babies!
61995,Marge,"me too, moe. what a nice surprise that we've become friends."
57212,Marge,"you know, homer, assisting mr. burns could give your career a real shot in the arm."
64935,Marge,"moe, do these guys think you're one of them?"
61215,Marge,"thanks, moe. i'm sorry we thought you were a baby-napper."
60731,Marge,the plastic casing from the tip of bart's shoelace! a mother knows!
65931,Marge,they had to! it came from corporate!
66580,Marge,oh it!
58332,Marge,i put the tax forms on top of your to do pile a month ago!
63576,Marge,how was your night?
57447,Marge,the only thing i asked you to do for this party was put on clothes. and you didn't do it.
55147,Marge,okay.
54593,Marge,tonight i learned the two of us can't work.
60703,Marge,"oh, you big fooler. pretending not to remember so you could surprise us."
60230,Marge,these new pews are so comfy.
57176,Marge,i need a formal dress for tonight!
55546,Marge,we have to do something...
61842,Marge,that coulda been me.
60639,Marge,how can you have such an appetite at a time like this?
59372,Marge,seems a little wasteful.
67877,Marge,"now, homer, don't worry. all i need to do is find mr. burns' inner beauty."
65578,Marge,"homie, i want another baby."
59226,Marge,don't forget your mincemeat pie!
63617,Marge,"ooh, l.a.! this could be the gym for me."
62374,Marge,"okay, water monsters. be friendly. but not too friendly."
59525,Marge,you should get your eyes checked. i'm taking bart to the mall to buy camping supplies -- why don't you come along?
65658,Marge,"""scientists prove cat heaven real, human heaven not"" that's so sad..."
64058,Marge,ned! you bought our house? why?
65759,Marge,"except for the face full of glass when the door finally collapsed, he did a pretty good job."
66823,Marge,"i'm sorry but i can't. i'm tired of you saying planes have gotten smaller, and two presidents were fatter than you, and..."
54697,Marge,my sisters are nuts. i'm happy being married to homer. most of the time.
65429,Marge,"you're using your expensive new treadmill just to watch a show that went off the air five years ago? and when i wanted to watch it with you then, you said it was pretentious and repetitive!"
56540,Marge,but i...
67109,Marge,"go on, lisa. we've all got to be brave just like jebediah when he killed that bear."
64207,Marge,i want my kids in a decent school!
64009,Marge,"bart simpson, age three."
59332,Marge,skiing fanny-first into a crevasse isn't my idea of fun. the only risk i'm taking is running out of marshmallows!
61883,Marge,uh-huh.
55728,Marge,"a hundred and one frozen pops. a nobel prize winner... an nba all-star... ooh, one of the ""sweathogs!"""
61239,Marge,"homer, it's two in the morning."
57434,Marge,school. school.
59697,Marge,"yeah, that was the boy lisa likes."
59788,Marge,"c'mon, it'll be fun."
62398,Marge,"oh sure you can, sweetie. just don't make a habit of it."
67675,Marge,whoa--
61791,Marge,don't demolish along the way!
59295,Marge,"no, you don't have to kill anyone. not if you have jobs."
60326,Marge,you'll be condemning this town to a life of obesity and diabetes!
58631,Marge,"oh, we've got to get you home to a warm blanket and a cold compress."
65297,Marge,no strangling on school days!
65896,Marge,"that usually works, but not today."
57623,Marge,"well, i'd like to hear your suggestions."
59725,Marge,"oh, homie!"
63653,Marge,of course.
59270,Marge,"it's not a real car, grampa."
66574,Marge,the doctor gave us this machine to help him breathe in his sleep. go to bed. i'll take care of him.
61624,Marge,"let's just say in an emergency, i wouldn't count on either one."
58070,Marge,"well, this neighborhood is zoned r-3, which allows dogs, cats, phone-answering monkeys, and, oh... oh i'll never memorize all this."
59899,Marge,"oh. oh, i'd do anything."
60918,Marge,maybe death will stop your yammering!
54883,Marge,"homer, did you go out and buy a twenty pound ham? and what's all this?"
62405,Marge,isn't this lenny's house?
56197,Marge,i just think they're neat.
61092,Marge,"shucks, lisa. you sure have taken a shine to that cowpoke."
61283,Marge,"homie, it's time you got rid of that thing. all that candy is rotting your brain."
57042,Marge,don't let the bedbugs bite.
66024,Marge,stop it! no karate monsters at the dinner table!
57738,Marge,"bart, where did you get all this stuff?"
58074,Marge,a headset telephone?! i thought those only existed in the movies!
65467,Marge,whoa. /
57543,Marge,"these shirts are a hundred per cent cotton! and look at the fine stitching on ""dope!"""
65056,Marge,excuse me. we can't find our seats. marge and homer simpson.
57383,Marge,careful of the apple pie on the seat.
57436,Marge,hello marge. how's the family? i don't want to talk about it. mind your own business.
59945,Marge,i did it! i caught the school bus. now hurry up and get on.
55954,Marge,"no, i'm the head vampire!"
56935,Marge,we've never been separated from the kids for so long. i don't know how much more i can take.
57936,Marge,you're a good father.
63778,Marge,"no, no, that's just our old christmas decorations."
65669,Marge,"well sweetie, if it's that important to you, i guess we can try."
57810,Marge,they started it!
55472,Marge,that is so sweet.
66313,Marge,"homer simpson, this was your doing. and i want you to fix it!"
65543,Marge,"i don't know, i don't know! i'm sure i don't know!"
65795,Marge,"bart, would you go to your room while your father and i finish our little talk?"
55782,Marge,i don't know if i like you experimenting on your brother.
56618,Marge,my contractions started an hour ago.
62425,Marge,that's not what you do with a hymnal. homer!
65642,Marge,you're coming with us to the school fundraiser.
65583,Marge,my husband and i have been snuggling six ways from sunday...
65926,Marge,d.
62580,Marge,"okay, okay, okay, i'm in!"
54785,Marge,i thought you boys might like some milk and microwave s'mores.
61088,Marge,i really don't want to do a lot of flip-de-loops.
55085,Marge,"testing... testing... one, two, three... oh, my. do i sound like that?"
58388,Marge,"don't worry, kids. your father'll be okay, as long as he's with those sherpas."
57576,Marge,"i was wrong to have a dream. wrong as usual. i mean, if you're nothing special, why kid yourself?"
64164,Marge,"come on, maggie. have some grapefruit."
67297,Marge,"oh. okay, well thank you."
62454,Marge,"really? well, just for that i'm gonna erase all the saved games on your playstation."
67571,Marge,so much needless brutality. i don't know if i'm having any impact at all.
62339,Marge,"hello, homer."
64909,Marge,"huh? oh, myself, i guess."
63376,Marge,this winning cornucopia is magnificent.
60433,Marge,"mmmm. all this food is so frou-frou! ooo, faberge egg salad."
65289,Marge,"no, we're out."
63726,Marge,it's four o'clock on a saturday.
62657,Marge,"well, tell your regular bully. he won't like it one bit."
57474,Marge,"an automatic dialer? is that legal? i don't want you getting arrested, homer..."
65953,Marge,fine. i'll just get rid of these itchy and mitchys.
66463,Marge,quit comparing me to ben chapman!
55900,Marge,i don't think this is such a good idea.
63544,Marge,"all right, this time i'm going. i'm really going to visit a bank robber. a man who held a gun on me. going to see him in prison, where guards will frisk me, paw through my purse, and... oooh, there's apple picking just up the road!"
67797,Marge,i really hope we're not spoiling them.
67281,Marge,patty and selma are coming over to show us slides from their trip to the yucatan.
63929,Marge,we'll stay for one hand roll or two nigiri -- then we have to get back to the kids!
58839,Marge,"ooh! oh, i guess i can drive it for a little while."
63752,Marge,"homie, lisa's dancing has made me really, really, happy."
65526,Marge,"bart, that's sweet, but we'd need airplane money, hotel money..."
62857,Marge,why is that drug addict driving a school bus?
54915,Marge,"ooh, a new pacifier."
57998,Marge,i'm talking about treating serious injuries.
60295,Marge,i don't know how this town got so fat.
61590,Marge,really? even zima?
59430,Marge,missionary work?
61879,Marge,"go home to your son, mrs. muntz. and try not to have intercourse on the way!"
61466,Marge,"homie, i'd like to know what you've been doing after work."
59597,Marge,"shut up, becky! there. i finally said it."
65733,Marge,i'm afraid not.
57014,Marge,homer?
65533,Marge,"our search for culture is thus concluded / for the bard of avon is well-suited / to a crowd with ev'ry cell phone muted / jeez, i can't stop talking like this."
61803,Marge,"great stuff, ned."
66197,Marge,"it's me, talking in your earphone!"
59337,Marge,i couldn't sleep knowing that window had a smudge on it.
62661,Marge,"that's not a pan, it's a colander!"
64558,Marge,"mister, you are grounded!"
63836,Marge,this was such a pleasant st. patrick's day till the irish people showed up.
66163,Marge,must find way... to blame myself.
56892,Marge,i think you're a little young to be investigating an attempted murder. why don't you try to solve the mystery of who put that mud in the freezer?
58543,Marge,mmm. what do you think he's doing up there?
63725,Marge,that quick talking is never a good sign.
55730,Marge,are you sure you've thought this through? a child can really change your life.
57638,Marge,thanks for everything!
55359,Marge,"this chair is $2,000. we could buy a whole living room set for that."
60504,Marge,our phone bill is four hundred dollars! they charged us for a call to brazil.
55783,Marge,you've never looked better.
57420,Marge,"oh, geez -- it's what's inside the house that's disgraceful -- drinking, gambling, and debauchery! it's right under our noses -- a secret house of burlesque!"
67435,Marge,look! the crosstown bridge!
66643,Marge,"i understand, honey. did you get someone to cover?"
60290,Marge,"well, what about this? ""the duff book of world records."""
67837,Marge,aww.
62757,Marge,i thought life preservers only came in orange. because wouldn't it be hard to see blue in the ocean?
60346,Marge,that donkey is such a bad influence on you.
58991,Marge,"the point is, great artists are always trying new things, like michelangelo or shaquille o'neal. you just need some inspiration."
58512,Marge,"oh, i just mopped that driveway."
64211,Marge,the what?
65270,Marge,"not since they passed ""homer's law."" oh honey, why don't you just relax and bake something?"
59115,Marge,"homer, what are you doing here?"
64081,Marge,"homie, i haven't held maggie all day. can you hand her to me?"
61944,Marge,lousy drawer... potato masher stuck in small spoon slot... what kind of madman would do that?
67569,Marge,please stop. please. be quiet.
62329,Marge,i guess it's good that they're taking an interest in spirituality.
66922,Marge,"oh, i have my secrets. turn around."
63489,Marge,chief wiggums! the maestro is the killer!
66594,Marge,the wi-fi! the wi-fi! i've got to take out the wi-fi!
57894,Marge,because the streets of capitol city are no place for three unescorted ladies.
57440,Marge,"it's just not a dinner party without a melon baller. and we'll need a citrus zester... a ravioli crimper... ooh, an oyster mallet! ""made in u.s.a.""? eh, no thank you!"
62391,Marge,don't you have to be back at work?
59110,Marge,"look, they're making a movie! robert downey, jr. is shooting it out with the police!"
57924,Marge,"uhh... you keep 'em. now listen. if we can't afford private school, maybe there's some other way to encourage lisa. umm, an art class... ballet lessons... they have some fun things you could do at the museum on saturday..."
55183,Marge,"well, you know, maybe he's right."
61295,Marge,"it's homer, don't shoot!"
58315,Marge,"oh, you mean like the ""a"" students?"
58522,Marge,"easy, easy. stick with the plan."
67472,Marge,"well, okay. let's see... can you do the cranberry sauce?"
60137,Marge,"i just can't do that, homer. it's a matter of principle. and i need you to support me in this."
56727,Marge,"oh, milhouse doesn't count."
67738,Marge,"""myth: it's only fair to pay for quality first-run movies. fact: most movies shown on cable get two stars or less and are repeated ad nauseam."" hmm, well, i don't know."
67017,Marge,"gee, i thought we were making real progress."
60813,Marge,"no, homer, no! that's our only way home!"
65257,Marge,"so, what was everyone's favorite moment at the museum?"
65137,Marge,"that's great, homie! come have some ice cream on a brownie!"
59768,Marge,"it's hauntingly beautiful, isn't it?"
58737,Marge,"oh, honey. that is egg-ceptional."
65111,Marge,"well, there's ned out on his power walk. maybe you should talk to him."
63094,Marge,well no one's gonna be lonely tonight.
66131,Marge,"couldn't agree more! now, to celebrate... ta-da! pork chops crusted with cheeto dust!"
65309,Marge,"i think it just froze. oh no. no, that bird just moved."
63628,Marge,i sure am!
65544,Marge,"come here, you. /"
61271,Marge,"turn, turn, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning..."
67701,Marge,just those who need help with french.
64810,Marge,stupid pan.
65104,Marge,that wisenheimer windup toy could be anywhere.
58379,Marge,me? i'm not the one who puts butter in your coffee.
67463,Marge,the father of the boy who doesn't win has to mow the lawn in his wife's sunday dress.
58174,Marge,hmf. why don't you want to go out there?
65977,Marge,"the suit wasn't magic, moe. don't you know the story of dumbo the elephant?"
64158,Marge,"here's the score, mister:"
65718,Marge,i thought the basement looked cleaner.
66376,Marge,"uh-oh. it's horndog hank. well, nancy knows how to keep him away."
60049,Marge,you could give the money to the orphanage. i hear they need a new wall.
55463,Marge,"let's go, kids."
62328,Marge,"all right! i admit it -- they're both at the catholic church! reverend, what should i do?"
60421,Marge,unless...
64367,Marge,whoops!
65244,Marge,"homer, i want you to come with me and the kids on a family vacation."
61917,Marge,that's better.
65873,Marge,a teacher can't be a bully.
67058,Marge,"ah, that's my girl."
66007,Marge,i signed you up for the ten-and-below talent show next week!
55103,Marge,well... do you ever take an interest in anything he does?
57571,Marge,you see? a little persistence and patience paid off. that'll be 300 dollars.
56990,Marge,"hi. ah, er, there's something i've been meaning to ask you. did you put on a little weight this week?"
64766,Marge,"oh, roger! you really know what you're doing!"
55333,Marge,"i know we didn't ask for this, homer, but doesn't the bible say, ""whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me...?"""
54775,Marge,ohhh.
62573,Marge,"tammy, i'd never have had the courage to skydive if it weren't for you girls."
54735,Marge,"hmmm. thank you. i will, dr. hibbert. thanks for coming."
63020,Marge,perfect!
65364,Marge,"homie, these disguises won't fool anyone."
66516,Marge,i don't know... we have church the next morning... starts at eleven...
56653,Marge,we have them in america. they're called bullfrogs.
67636,Marge,sure.
61282,Marge,"homer, are you spooning that snack?"
61793,Marge,these magazines are from before we were married. maybe you should throw them away.
60885,Marge,goodbye kids.
54613,Marge,have you really read all these books?
62707,Marge,"well, maybe we can take your mind off things by studying for the s.a.t.: ""snuggles and tickles."""
61547,Marge,"mmm, it goes great with the jolly rancher i'm sucking on!"
55901,Marge,"oh, what a cute convertible. you guys at the bureau thought of everything."
61043,Marge,"this is even better than our screensaver. and i love our screensaver. nicely done, lisa."
65856,Marge,"homer, do something! they're killing each other!"
55656,Marge,"i'm sorry, bart, you're too little."
61148,Marge,"that's ridiculous. i don't like you. i mean hate you, hate you, hate you! i hate you!"
55792,Marge,bart!
67867,Marge,really? you're so supportive. i wish every teacher was like you.
64294,Marge,god didn't give you legs so you could use them as scissors!
55400,Marge,"hi, ned. i didn't know you were an actor."
67536,Marge,what kind of warped human being would find that funny?
62501,Marge,"well, i heard neil young sing about her..."
59078,Marge,"honey, i know you want to see japan, but we're down to our last million yen."
55418,Marge,"i'm sorry, llewellyn. i just... i just don't see why blanche should shove a broken bottle in stanley's face. couldn't she just take his abuse with gentle, good humor?"
55552,Marge,"well, lisa, i finished my resume."
61389,Marge,"well, i could use a muffin."
59077,Marge,maybe we should just head back to the hotel.
58716,Marge,sure you do. you have the right to remain silent.
58712,Marge,"good hustle, kid."
67448,Marge,"well, how did he say it?"
67715,Marge,bringing up a son -- even a blind one -- isn't a lifetime occupation. now the more you help him--
63423,Marge,my quads! every stride is a nightmare!
67460,Marge,"well, i'm worried that you're making too big a deal of this silly little kiddie golf tournament."
67119,Marge,"well, homer and i had a lovely dining experience at chez pierre... or the rusty barnacle is nice..."
60228,Marge,where's bart?
57873,Marge,"bart, no fireworks! put that back!"
60240,Marge,you're gonna get a bath tonight.
61019,Marge,those jets keep going lower and lower.
65256,Marge,"oh ralph, fred, archie, king of queens, i mean homer."
58355,Marge,"it's the same basic bear, homey."
59707,Marge,"well, we couldn't be prouder."
67052,Marge,"okay, bart, you don't have to say it, but you do have to have a loving attitude. be nice to your sister."
57743,Marge,"oh, it's against the house rule... oh, i guess just this once."
65437,Marge,"bart's not home yet, but i'm always looking to encourage non-milhouse play-dates. stick around!"
61719,Marge,it was years before i could trust a boy again.
64649,Marge,"homie, slow down!"
63084,Marge,i'm glad someone in this house feels their life has meaning.
60041,Marge,"oh, don't you worry. we'll make all the hard decisions so you don't have to."
54913,Marge,"homer, there's something i don't like about that severed hand."
64086,Marge,"good night, lisa. good ni-ight!"
59014,Marge,sounds good to me!
62944,Marge,"uh, i-i think what homer means is, why don't you tell us what each of you feels is the problem."
64471,Marge,you like tomato...
66356,Marge,homer!
58375,Marge,moving the whole town five miles down the road! it's crazy!
64515,Marge,what happened next?
56125,Marge,"i'm sorry, homie."
60929,Marge,"you know, most people pray silently."
63783,Marge,"you two have been bombarded with enough commercial images! lisa, i've got a big bunch of black bananas. you know what that means..."
56259,Marge,why don't you come inside for a drink of water?
66664,Marge,homie... i think we're not alone.
67132,Marge,you never intended for me to use that ball.
61705,Marge,your father's first kiss was in high school -- with me.
62107,Marge,always nice to see him.
57540,Marge,"homer, please! i try to be supportive, but this has gone too far. please just let it be."
65858,Marge,it's so sad that grampa has to cheat instead of relying on his god-given wrestling skills. what kind of person revels in disapproval?!
66496,Marge,"after thirty-five years of wifely obedience, i'm married to a face on a screen."
57753,Marge,"homer, you didn't tell me mr. burns went broke and lost the nuclear power plant."
60338,Marge,"stop it, homer!"
62254,Marge,"okay, now we know you're allergic to cauliflower. but i made a special platter of vegetables that are good for you."
61558,Marge,"oh, my head!"
55274,Marge,where were you all night?
62569,Marge,"for your information, i am now a junior member of the cheery red tomatoes."
63806,Marge,"thank you, dear."
57098,Marge,are you hiding something? what do you have under your jacket?
55125,Marge,"i promise i will get mad, because i always do when you make me promise i won't."
54784,Marge,"well, i think what you're doing for mrs. glick is very nice. the poor old thing doesn't have anybody."
59470,Marge,bart!
59973,Marge,and these musical garment bags aren't bad either.
55898,Marge,you awful man. stay away from my son.
65889,Marge,it's as yummy as your poorly-produced local commercial said.
62819,Marge,"homer, the ship's upside down and hundreds of people are dead!"
55302,Marge,i do.
64910,Marge,who's kicking?
65877,Marge,power.
59806,Marge,"okay. now, i wanted to paint fresh fruit, but the prison cafeteria would only give me sauerkraut."
62966,Marge,"i hope you're happy, bart. thanks to your hi-jinx, i have to drive you and your friends to school."
62101,Marge,"okay, one quick snuggle."
65054,Marge,"i'm sorry, fat tony. my husband doesn't realize what he's saying, then, five seconds later:"
58966,Marge,"god, you have every right to flick me out too. but before you..."
67412,Marge,huh uh. i'm going to be ringing doorbells for mary bailey that night.
55227,Marge,"lisa, there are a lot of people in the world who like to tell you what you can't do. but they don't always know what they're talking about."
65924,Marge,actually i'm cool with one of them.
57173,Marge,"lisa, please!!"
63238,Marge,nothing like reading a well-plotted mystery on the beach. it's amazing how they always solve the crime just before they run out of pages.
60307,Marge,i'll play it later.
55865,Marge,is that bad?
62000,Marge,homer! how'd you get in here?
55921,Marge,"and i learned that in order for you to set a good example for your son, you're gonna take that course over again without cheating."
67850,Marge,"now homer, you do have big bones."
66106,Marge,i'm gonna do what i've done at every key point of my life: suck it in and smile.
62843,Marge,that's her! don't answer it yet! i don't want that judgmental bitch in my house!
60032,Marge,bart!!!
57931,Marge,"and so, just as things looked their worst..."
59695,Marge,"oh, how cute! kids, look who's on the roof!"
65431,Marge,on the tv!
55145,Marge,noooooooo!!
57691,Marge,how can you even think of releasing sideshow bob?
65835,Marge,we spent a thousand dollars on a bunch of old boxes?
67325,Marge,this is fun!
59887,Marge,it's for charity -- it benefits victims of balcony collapse.
62685,Marge,i can see there's only one way to turn you into human beings again.
62963,Marge,cut that out!
62040,Marge,that little sneak disobeyed us and went to that hip-hop festival!
63311,Marge,my son is an evil knight! the most successful evil knight in all the earthland realms! not bad.
56561,Marge,"daddy?! daddy, where are you, da..."
61794,Marge,"the articles, eh? so you wouldn't mind if i cut out all the erotic nudes?"
59661,Marge,"the phone company ran out of numbers, so they split the city into two area codes. half the town keeps the old 636 area code and our half gets 939."
64470,Marge,you like potato...
62449,Marge,you don't trust me? after i salved every chicken pock on your ungrateful body! how dare you!
67866,Marge,"well, thank you, professor lombardo."
55860,Marge,"and a bottle of aspirin, please."
54662,Marge,let go of him! what kind of jerk strangles a little boy?
58619,Marge,"that ain't gonna happen, bub."
63245,Marge,"bart, honey, this is all we can afford for now. if it doesn't work, maybe when you're an adult you can pay some lady to make you happy for an hour."
62002,Marge,moe! no i don't love you. and i'm certainly not going to leave my husband.
60000,Marge,what happened to president muntu?
58024,Marge,"how was your day, sweetheart?"
57166,Marge,"homer, please. i have to alter this suit so it looks different for tomorrow."
65162,Marge,"how come they never call me ""fun mom?"""
66426,Marge,well how would you feel if we sold them something that turned out to be valuable?
56441,Marge,i guess we could get more involved in bart's activities. but then i'd be afraid of smothering him.
56144,Marge,"honey, i'm so glad you're home--"
61418,Marge,"i'm finished! and it's so suggestive. but like they say, ""snuggling sells."" now, do i dare push ""print?"""
67466,Marge,"here you go, bart. a lumberjack's breakfast for my little golfer."
62493,Marge,i'll take it! i can't believe i own a tandem bike!
67826,Marge,"ohh, that dog!"
56331,Marge,"oh, jacques, i'm a married woman."
65420,Marge,it's no fun to live in a town with a ninety-nine percent unemployment rate.
62317,Marge,"bart, this could be a good new school... oakwood academy! huh?"
61709,Marge,"i'll start from the beginning. the girls' camp was focused on teaching etiquette and deportment. now that i've captured your interest, let me continue..."
55887,Marge,look what i got. now people will stop intentionally ramming our car.
66862,Marge,whatever you want.
66633,Marge,"i said wash! and bart, go work the deep fryer."
60020,Marge,isn't there anything you can do?
62735,Marge,"i'll do it! wait, i wasn't happy with that."
65641,Marge,"while you were out there daydreaming, this rain has ruined the house."
59995,Marge,ho-mer.
65646,Marge,i always thought the pringles man had the kindest eyes.
66808,Marge,maybe he's giving those little baby birds some food.
61963,Marge,"stow it, you two!"
65326,Marge,i just think we should do things every day to show our love for each other.
60868,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry. i'll come right out and help you."
63154,Marge,marge simpson is gonna say no!
62646,Marge,a dollar.
61656,Marge,we're ditching our kids and taking a second honeymoon!
61956,Marge,"homer, these are people you work with. show some restraint."
60709,Marge,"get out of the car, homer."
56275,Marge,i wish you'd stop spreading bad rumors about people. remember how you got grampa tarred and feathered?
60169,Marge,"new underpants? homer, what are you up to?"
60712,Marge,you work a job you don't like so i'm able to be home with the kids.
65369,Marge,what are you doing here?
57226,Marge,oh dear.
56915,Marge,what about maggie?
61691,Marge,listen... i'm married.
56118,Marge,that sounds like a good movie.
56654,Marge,"i can't believe our government would set up bart like that. i must say, i'm very angry at the state department right now."
58171,Marge,all right! all right! sorry!
58769,Marge,"oh, my lord! i feel like cinderella."
59462,Marge,your plan makes no sense.
56171,Marge,"get a rope, bart!"
57379,Marge,no! what if he's crazy?
56041,Marge,"homer, i have to go out to pick up something for dinner."
62201,Marge,"homer, do something about this leak!"
61554,Marge,"well, you talk like marge, sorry i set the bed on fire."
56978,Marge,it all started on the thirteenth hour of the thirteenth day of the thirteenth month. we were there to discuss the misprinted calendars the school had purchased.
66641,Marge,they're opening another mother hubbard -- across the street?! how could they? how could they?!
59391,Marge,i can't wait to do some shopping -- look at all these innovative products. miracle shears...
64867,Marge,i could use some help!
66352,Marge,"i'm sorry, honey. i'm all out. i spent all i had lighting that candle for great aunt betty."
57136,Marge,"well homer, too. they're so much alike."
65664,Marge,it sure is! there's nothing more natural than... that. it's just that maggie's already... milked me today!
58127,Marge,how could somebody...?
64911,Marge,"sorry, i'm just not used to everyone behaving."
56669,Marge,what's that supposed to mean?
63777,Marge,there's only one person in the world who can tell you what to do. and that person is right here!
62870,Marge,"mr. simpson, i don't even know you -- i'm not making love with you!"
65720,Marge,it's reassuring to see you're aware of the future. but this is all a little... creepy.
57227,Marge,that does it. one of them has to go.
65853,Marge,is this true?
64028,Marge,oh my god. he's talking to me.
58962,Marge,i'm toiling! what does it look like?
60370,Marge,"oh homer, save me, save me!"
56006,Marge,yeah. everything before the high-speed chase was just lovely.
55045,Marge,luke?
55432,Marge,"i'm sure you won't enjoy it. there's nothing about bowling in the play... oh wait, there is."
56934,Marge,you mean maggie?
62386,Marge,i've found a place where i'm needed.
63256,Marge,"yeah, and the great prices at that new rib joint were the surprise of the evening."
55239,Marge,"hmm, how much will it cost?"
66052,Marge,so many unhappy men. how sad.
61508,Marge,"oh my god, what?"
60734,Marge,"that's good satire -- it doesn't hurt anyone. what do you think, maggie?"
62314,Marge,that's coming from next door!
63879,Marge,"honey, keeping track of someone because you love them is not wrong."
59457,Marge,don't you think we should wait for lisa? she is the president.
55130,Marge,you're a very selfish man.
60341,Marge,"well, let's see... i was in the kitchen, counting the corncobs on the curtains..."
60215,Marge,"homer, shouldn't we give that skull to mr. smithers?"
55390,Marge,"kids, i won't be home tonight, so i'm leaving you some low-cal microwavable tv dinners."
55723,Marge,what are you kids playing?
65830,Marge,"homie, do you see anything?"
55651,Marge,"according to this magazine, bart might be jealous of her."
56313,Marge,"that's not the idea at all. okay, well this story isn't ideal, i've never told it to you before."
55938,Marge,"bart! you should warn people this episode is very frightening and maybe they'd rather listen to that old war of the worlds broadcast on npr, hmmm?"
55065,Marge,homer!
64216,Marge,"ooh, i'm doing it!"
60316,Marge,i'm filing a class action lawsuit against big sugar. would you like to give a deposition?
61459,Marge,and that's the life of mozart. thank god he died young. i've gotta get dinner on the stove.
62538,Marge,"well, now i'm not so sure about the bells on the painter's pants."
58525,Marge,you stay away from nelson muntz.
58816,Marge,i can't believe it. he covered your whole bed with wildflowers?
61393,Marge,then i'll do it!
64021,Marge,your father's just jealous because vance was our class president in high school.
67885,Marge,"mr. burns, i've had enough of your... posing. i can finish the portrait myself."
64835,Marge,this isn't the line for a movie. why are you wearing that costume?
63142,Marge,"please, just a few more days."
57427,Marge,don't make up your mind until you hear both songs! morals and ethics and carnal forbearance...
67741,Marge,"so, what did you children learn about today?"
65800,Marge,a completed chore list!
66114,Marge,and love conquered all / with a train from the mall
56244,Marge,"homer, don't ever tell them personal stuff about me again."
67125,Marge,"oh, perfume."
56940,Marge,we missed you so much!
67008,Marge,"all our money, the college funds, the tv. homer, you're driving a stake through the hearts of those who love you."
55155,Marge,thanks again for taking the children while i'm away.
64339,Marge,that was so noble of apu to give his life for us.
58187,Marge,but when we ask you to do yardwork...
66435,Marge,five figures!
65034,Marge,the school called and said bart is out of control. i think we may need some therapy for him.
57415,Marge,you're about to learn the two most dangerous words in the english language are marge simpson!
63035,Marge,"you're gonna have to fix that roller coaster yourself, 'cause i quit... and i'm taking this with me!"
59709,Marge,maybe we should talk to a financial planner.
58674,Marge,"oh, homer, that was just a beer can with a whistle glued to it."
57875,Marge,"stay where i can see you, honey..."
64787,Marge,dinner is served. i tried to make what homer said you liked.
67589,Marge,so what did you kids do today?
58016,Marge,"homer, mr. burns can't see you winking."
65348,Marge,why are all those cars parked at city hall?
61395,Marge,tonight? but i was hoping you could watch the kids while i work on my novel.
58924,Marge,a musical doorbell!
61392,Marge,"anyone? if i write a book, will they tell me when it comes out?"
59197,Marge,"oh, homer, i bet that southern colonel doesn't even show up."
66242,Marge,people's views change. bobby kennedy worked for joe mccarthy. larry david was on fridays.
60390,Marge,"you can't use the word ""sex"" on the internet."
63209,Marge,weren't you listening? i just told you a whole story about revenge.
63019,Marge,i could start my own carpentry business. i'm already arranging the clip art for the letterhead in my mind.
58216,Marge,i've never heard of these movementarians. are they some kind of church?
56262,Marge,"oh, here, let me help you."
54634,Marge,i think i'm gonna like it here.
64793,Marge,there's my old house!
54642,Marge,when is it due?
60107,Marge,that sounds like a lie.
56522,Marge,what if you pretended that this couch were a bar? then you could spend more nights at home with us. huh?
66123,Marge,please. i need people here who are helpful and sensitive.
61976,Marge,"well... as fabulous as your regulars are, a remodel might bring in a higher class of lush."
64126,Marge,uh... a princess?
58799,Marge,and what's in this?
60819,Marge,no one will ever know.
56708,Marge,second.
63687,Marge,no!!! that's my memory box!
63804,Marge,i didn't.
60631,Marge,go away!
61613,Marge,"principal skinner, i feel so bad for you."
58257,Marge,"homer, bill gates is here."
55799,Marge,lisa needs braces.
67868,Marge,i can't believe it.
59256,Marge,"i enjoyed a brief but memorable stint as ""sideshow marge."""
57731,Marge,"oh, my goodness."
58092,Marge,that's a beauty.
56574,Marge,i don't want you stalking anyone tonight.
65300,Marge,homie! stop watching the movie in the other people's car!
61487,Marge,"oh no no, she says lots of words. like when she wants something, she says"
57413,Marge,get out of my town!
61516,Marge,"homer, this is a rare lapse in judgment for you."
57209,Marge,"lisa, honey, when my family first came to this state, they had a choice of living in springfield or stenchburg. you know why they chose springfield? because everyone knows jebediah springfield was a true american hero. end of story."
62918,Marge,well then i choose... uh...
67644,Marge,i love you too!
63047,Marge,"homer! you won't eat my stuffed peppers, but you'll eat our son?"
55736,Marge,your lips are turning blue. i think you'd better stay home.
64041,Marge,free at last! free at last!
61331,Marge,"ou-ay ow-knay, i-ay as-way oung-yay unce-way oo-tay."
56308,Marge,that's not true. romance is all around us. in our neighborhoods...
66969,Marge,"well, i've been thinking, too. you know, homer, you've always been such a good provider, but when we got married, mr. berger promised i could come back to my old job anytime i wanted."
58692,Marge,"i know you're excited about starting your new job, but could you just relax for now?"
62337,Marge,they weren't following us.
62219,Marge,it's after six -- he's not coming back. he's a lousy roofer and a flake!
60653,Marge,"yes, and she's crying."
59667,Marge,"ooh, why didn't you say so? hey, is there a bathroom here?"
67858,Marge,i never got any. and i never painted again.
59572,Marge,thanks to our own spice girl: becky.
60209,Marge,thanks for understanding.
54956,Marge,"homie, how long do you plan to do this?"
60092,Marge,murder-suicides.
65432,Marge,on the ground!
65203,Marge,d'artagnan wasn't a musketeer! he only had a letter of introduction to the captain of the guards -- which he lost!
63126,Marge,why don't you have dinner with us tonight?
62067,Marge,no surprises there.
60971,Marge,"well this is very impressive, lisa. i'm kicking this right onto the mantle."
54597,Marge,i can't believe i got in. it's like a dream come true. an expensive dream.
61159,Marge,"i love you, too."
58658,Marge,who left these muddy claw prints on my clean floor?
63409,Marge,here's five more dollars.
60143,Marge,"no. no, there it is!"
55810,Marge,"bart, how could you shock your little sister?"
63285,Marge,sunny?
57010,Marge,a tombstone?!
67070,Marge,what are you two doing back there?
59141,Marge,i heard about a new bar where men dance with men. doesn't that sound adorable?
57867,Marge,the bus station is just one of the sights we came to see. we'll meet you in central park at five o'clock.
63156,Marge,gil?!
59458,Marge,here she is. and look how big she's gotten.
56473,Marge,"oh, well thank you homer. but take one of the kids."
66669,Marge,homer simpson!
66779,Marge,thank god it's just like her busy box.
60485,Marge,"okay, it has been twenty years, and you suitors have been very patient."
66103,Marge,get out of my head!
58655,Marge,no! we're not sending the lobster away to some snobby boarding school.
61052,Marge,mock...
55760,Marge,"ah, thank you, dear."
66819,Marge,"oh, thank you, homie!"
55536,Marge,earl warren wasn't a stripper.
56209,Marge,"homer, you didn't do a very good job frosting maggie's birthday cake."
58389,Marge,"oh no, he fell! i can't look!"
58005,Marge,"milhouse, stop that!"
58259,Marge,"ooo, look! this is a perfect chance to get you kids some nice church shoes."
64057,Marge,"i know i shouldn't get too attached to a building, but... that's where lisa took her first step... the kids' height...homer's weight..."
59504,Marge,homer no. you'll kill us all.
58354,Marge,"for you, homie."
66523,Marge,"you're not going to eat too much, and we're not going to stay too late."
64839,Marge,"i hope they use that spit for a good cause, like sealing wedding envelopes."
58036,Marge,"ooo, there's that new mega-mall they're building! they say the air conditioner will be more powerful than a million hydrogen bombs."
55941,Marge,homer! are you all right?
61192,Marge,"moe, i'm glad you're here! i wanted to thank you so much for saving my baby, so i knitted you a nice warm sweater."
59721,Marge,"oh, that's a darling name for a dog."
58103,Marge,"i'm sorry, mr. hutz, but i just can't lie to people."
56439,Marge,have you noticed any change in bart?
64895,Marge,you never took me to that bar on the beach.
54664,Marge,you're an idiot.
65080,Marge,one hundred.
60174,Marge,putting away groceries -- it's like unwrapping presents from yourself. fruit roll-ups for bart... beer roll-ups for homer...
59668,Marge,"i don't know why, but i just didn't feel comfortable until i was back here in new springfield, with my own kind."
64533,Marge,never mind what he said. you just listen to me.
64077,Marge,i can't miss out! just one little peek.
61968,Marge,you gave the money to moe? how's he gonna pay us back?
62889,Marge,i think he's a male gay.
55571,Marge,"homie, what's wrong?"
54993,Marge,"bart, are you going to moe the lawn today?"
66451,Marge,"""selecionar conta..."" ooh, ""select account""!"
63418,Marge,it won't start!
55912,Marge,"homer, that isn't very nice."
62758,Marge,where's ben?
55710,Marge,homer? homer?
60523,Marge,but homer...
57932,Marge,"grampa, what are you talking about?"
60667,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so glad you're alive!"
65105,Marge,chief wiggum! stop that train!
62693,Marge,no rudner.
58651,Marge,"well, lobster or no lobster, this is still a very special dinner. ba-da da-da da-daaa!"
66193,Marge,that's not helping.
60318,Marge,what are you talking about? is that dinner?
66929,Marge,"i get the feeling there's something you haven't told me, homer."
60695,Marge,i think i'm going to do a little sleuthing.
56752,Marge,"yeeesch! this house stinks! you're not just putting the new newspapers over the old ones, are you?"
67790,Marge,thank you.
65842,Marge,"oh homie, you're so... enlightened."
67796,Marge,"ohh, dear."
67225,Marge,what are we laughing at?
59687,Marge,"oh, krusty. i'm sure she just needs time to get used to you."
60262,Marge,we don't need tv to have family fun. why don't we play monopoly?
58823,Marge,you just don't get it.
67066,Marge,i'm not sure that we can afford...
61571,Marge,just take me home.
61497,Marge,"sweetie, you seem so blue. did the last of something die?"
65517,Marge,"now sweetie, don't make a big deal out of this. i stopped reading after ""top student""."
62844,Marge,"maple syrup, mixed with baby spit-up and shoe scuff! this is going to take my whole arsenal at once!"
56075,Marge,"sure, honey. i promise."
65486,Marge,"so, how many more weeks do you have off?"
62738,Marge,"so, charles, what do you do for a living?"
66735,Marge,you sound great! your licks are really... juicy.
65590,Marge,awww... eww... homie! we still have a chance!
62923,Marge,"honey, i appreciate the thought, but just leave everything to me."
63441,Marge,"homie, what's wrong?"
56780,Marge,"bart, you said you were going to study."
55384,Marge,whoa!!
61999,Marge,that sounds like homer.
63223,Marge,then that must be it.
65747,Marge,"all right, but i'm coming with you to make sure no one does anything stupid."
56936,Marge,there's bart's ring!
66811,Marge,"so what brings you to springfield, mr. musk?"
57669,Marge,"i'm very sorry you feel that way. because john invited us all out for a drive today, and we're going."
55813,Marge,i have no idea. unless it was that time he kept falling down the cliff.
60650,Marge,no beer!
66025,Marge,no karate monsters in the bathtub!
64356,Marge,i guess it is time to move on...
61156,Marge,"oh homie, you got everyone in springfield here for me!"
58767,Marge,"oh look, it's woody harrelson."
59222,Marge,"that's odd. the outside looks like a tomato, but the inside is brown."
58275,Marge,"so, renee, it looks like you've taken quite a shine to moe. do you mind if i ask why?"
54699,Marge,maybe not this time...
62947,Marge,"hmmm... try to frame criticisms of your spouse in a positive way."""
61484,Marge,that's a lot of pressure to put on a baby. all they should be worried about is the raspberry monster.
64441,Marge,you like tomato...
64334,Marge,bart ate a tainted burger!
66446,Marge,"to try to avoid any misunderstandings in brazil, like we had the last time, i'm learning the language."
67789,Marge,hello.
60808,Marge,"bart, honey, would you like some more cod liver oil?"
65028,Marge,what?
58050,Marge,"it's wednesday, homer."
57403,Marge,"uh, you know, i think i'll take maggie with us."
65710,Marge,bart and lisa.
58665,Marge,"oh, thank heaven."
62659,Marge,"aw, homie."
56531,Marge,"well, everybody's got a fear of something."
63051,Marge,cylinders?!
66671,Marge,huh. might as well clean this while i'm killing myself.
61713,Marge,i told my friends i had a date...
63592,Marge,i guess you should judge a book by its cover.
64976,Marge,get your hands off my husband!
65552,Marge,"well, cardinal or cannibal, i wish that twenty years ago i had chosen love."
57255,Marge,"hello? oh, hello, principal skinner... no, bart has never been to hong kong... goodnight."
62549,Marge,she's not going to get over this quickly -- i know women.
67449,Marge,was he angry?
65773,Marge,just for standing on a thing?
55010,Marge,"hmmm, you shouldn't do that."
64922,Marge,"yes, you may."
63361,Marge,"last night, someone ate all the food in the fridge."
65304,Marge,"ooo, condos!"
63674,Marge,"because i didn't want him finding out about the party. i mean, he's okay, but you know he'd bring sarah, and i just don't care for that woman."
57484,Marge,my main finger?
63128,Marge,"you can't go home tonight! it's cold, it's late..."
60243,Marge,time to begin operation xmas-remind of-how good is.
60304,Marge,don't you have any sense of corporate responsibility?
66309,Marge,"kumiko, for you we chose the coolest restaurant in town."
64715,Marge,"lisa, look!"
58204,Marge,i found some food for breakfast. i hope everyone likes the red things that grow on this tree.
65462,Marge,"bart, glad you're here. we're all gonna watch a movie together."
54990,Marge,"so, mr. hutz, does my husband have a case?"
63548,Marge,"look, lisa. i put new filaments in all our burned-out light bulbs. your father the millionaire thought we should throw these away."
67167,Marge,"yes, very."
58260,Marge,"look, homer. there's that bird you like to argue with."
61580,Marge,i am so cheesed off. i need a drink!
58010,Marge,you shouldn't pressure bart like that.
64316,Marge,"if i'm gonna open a can of whup-tushy, i'd better get in shape, with some rhythmic gymnastics!"
60855,Marge,"bart, don't say it like that. you'll hurt her feelings-- jeez louise! how did you turn cinnamon applesauce into that?"
65608,Marge,"homie, maybe we should wait."
61544,Marge,"enjoy your tour, and take it easy on mr. curtis. your father and i will be across the street at the lush valley winery."
63096,Marge,my own art show?! i'm so happy... do you mind?
65680,Marge,"play along! ooh, this couldn't feel more natural. glug, glug, glug. that's a good little mammal."
63044,Marge,look! a shooting star!
58753,Marge,but her forehead's on fire.
57325,Marge,you went into the attic? i'm very disappointed and terrified.
56887,Marge,that's odd. where's homer? and bart? and lisa? and grampa?
56715,Marge,oh really? did you see the loom? i took loom in high school.
64716,Marge,first we're visiting grampa.
63480,Marge,"sir, thank you for saving us. do you want to come in for coffee?"
62521,Marge,so... is that standing water?
55249,Marge,"i'm going to give up buying my weekly lottery ticket, and i found a way to stretch the food budget. fried chicken night will now be organ meat night. ham night will be spam night. and porkchop night..."
59621,Marge,i haven't done the laundry yet.
62624,Marge,hoo boy.
65558,Marge,"""i'll get to it, marge..."" ""i'll get to it..."" when we first got married, he'd only take six months to do things..."
54826,Marge,"homer, please. no one's going to notice if you wear a pink shirt to work."
60212,Marge,"water, eh?"
61731,Marge,"oh, elvis."
62134,Marge,did you spend our savings on a motor home?
62331,Marge,i wish my family was with me.
60473,Marge,he used to be such an angel. maybe you should give him another chance.
63021,Marge,i'm here to fix your bookcase. you answered my flyer.
67230,Marge,"homer, i don't even want to look at you right now."
64468,Marge,so we're right back where we used to be.
55334,Marge,"otto, you can't just sit there watching tv all day."
60322,Marge,professor frink?
64827,Marge,why not?
60496,Marge,"""just then, sir lancelot rode up on a white horse and saved joan of arc. they got married and lived in a spaceship. the end."""
56529,Marge,let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off! let me off!
63459,Marge,"well, where should we go for brunch?"
64069,Marge,our house is up to code.
61064,Marge,i'll fix you something.
61329,Marge,"look, maggie. a show for babies."
61733,Marge,who's ready for a kitten?
55052,Marge,i do.
60165,Marge,every house has a bathroom.
64917,Marge,you wanna stay up and talk a while? i'm not sleepy.
63363,Marge,it was you.
55642,Marge,what's that stench?
61775,Marge,"bart, what are you doing?"
63396,Marge,i promised them a cake!
64899,Marge,"when it's closed it's a chair! when you were little, i used to take you to a mommy-and-me toddler gym."
57079,Marge,"what's wrong, honey?"
58666,Marge,that's a keeper!
61255,Marge,"oh no, they heard me."
60812,Marge,that's my homie!
67314,Marge,you must be the babysitter.
64541,Marge,"well, you always miss when you throw your underpants at the hamper!"
65651,Marge,"hm, i guess you're right. i guess i'll have to scratch that off the list of things i say."
54726,Marge,"homie, did you straighten everything out...?"
59961,Marge,"oh, that's ridiculous."
58797,Marge,deal!
63005,Marge,ooh! a j.c. penney's...used to be here.
63012,Marge,"the letter doesn't say. but from now on, no peanut products are allowed on school property."
55219,Marge,do you think she could be a professional some day?
67905,Marge,sure.
59818,Marge,"oh, and guess who's up for parole? my diamond-in-the-rough."
60434,Marge,i make mine with m&ms.
56580,Marge,"you're not a god, homer."
56339,Marge,"okay, homer."
57207,Marge,what kind of apprentice?
64698,Marge,"have fun, homie."
60672,Marge,"but this is your chance to contact your late wife, maude."
63476,Marge,"you are out of control! the late nights, the eating! you've actually outgrown your cape!"
54836,Marge,"no, it is not the truth, homer. it's well documented that women are safer drivers than men."
60182,Marge,spill it...
54886,Marge,"hmm, it's actually more of a honey glaze --"
59805,Marge,"welcome to ""freeing the artist within."" not literally, of course."
65310,Marge,"uh oh, a draggy backpack."
63007,Marge,"well, if you're through, let's check out that discount book warehouse."
67127,Marge,uh... i-i'm saving it... for a special occasion.
55563,Marge,i'll just be a minute. i have to finish this paperwork.
59615,Marge,no they didn't.
64767,Marge,that's crazy talk!
58183,Marge,what?!
65170,Marge,"why do old squirrels always crawl into my engine to die? guess we'll be making an unscheduled pit stop, gang."
65398,Marge,"relax, everyone knows that if you die in a dream, you just wake up!"
61550,Marge,"homie, to store the extra wine we bought, i made a little wine cellar."
65722,Marge,the end of the world as we know it?
61439,Marge,"please homie, don't hurt him!"
57260,Marge,are you sure? maybe it's just shampoo. that washes right out.
63248,Marge,this basement is a wonderful gift to the family. but how could you afford it?
57313,Marge,"okay, bart, your turn, your turn."
64222,Marge,homie?
61991,Marge,"homer, can you hold my wedding ring for a second? my finger's itchy."
66980,Marge,homer!
56001,Marge,mmm hmm.
55516,Marge,oh...
65649,Marge,"homie, you want to read to maggie before she goes to sleep?"
57794,Marge,"now, ned, troubled boys need rules and discipline. they crave it! you just lay down the law."
56557,Marge,wait. i'm remembering something...
59045,Marge,"lisa, did anyone force you to come here today?"
58528,Marge,"while i deal with this, why don't you start on that basket?"
64836,Marge,"bart, who are you talking to?"
61587,Marge,"homie, i want you to promise me you'll cut down on the drinking."
57268,Marge,"well, things were bad everywhere."
61786,Marge,"this is the kitchen i've always wanted. ooh, a bread maker-maker!"
60159,Marge,running a bar is a full-time job and you don't even do your full-time job.
63840,Marge,"marge simpson. well, mr. farrelly, the least i could do is offer you a cupcake."
59757,Marge,"after we got maggie to a safe house, of course."
58937,Marge,"this is it, honey. we did it."
61893,Marge,what's that rumble?
65766,Marge,uh oh. i wonder if word has gotten out that we're looking for guardians.
54682,Marge,"choose me because i'm not bitter yet, i can stay up later, and you're on my mind all the time."
65914,Marge,mmm... new cushion smell!
61353,Marge,i've already drawn up the petition.
63365,Marge,that's the fire siren!
55391,Marge,"i'm auditioning for a play! it's a musical version of ""a streetcar named desire."" isn't that exciting?"
67638,Marge,my name is marge.
56206,Marge,give me those...
60352,Marge,this has been one of the most magical evenings of my life.
63934,Marge,they have a pe-dal car.
63132,Marge,"i promise you, he'll leave after today."
54996,Marge,bart! bart! turn to the financial channel! aunt patty says our stock is skyrocketing!
67033,Marge,"so tomorrow, instead of bickering with this boy, talk to him. you'll be surprised how far a little understanding will go."
55759,Marge,and this is for my huggy bug in honor of this special day.
58467,Marge,"okay, okay. here we go."
62095,Marge,do it for me.
58717,Marge,yeah.
60263,Marge,oh. we'd better stay inside. at least until the squirrels stop melting.
60934,Marge,that is gonna drive me nuts.
60796,Marge,ooh... please be a melon-baller. please be a melon-baller.
67927,Marge,that's where you're wrong! get out on that stage!
59674,Marge,my experiment? you're the one who came up with this whole idea...
66149,Marge,really? how?
60054,Marge,"that's not my uncle lou, and this man's not dead."
56604,Marge,"i've got to tell homer about this baby in just the right way and at just the right time. until then please, keep this to yourselves."
60266,Marge,"lisa, it was probably an accident."
60354,Marge,"well, he would eat all the time. we'd be making love, and he'd have a mouth full of hershey's miniatures."
64232,Marge,"i got it halfway-- oh, it went back."
59708,Marge,when did this happen? when did we become the bottom rung of society?
66565,Marge,"no, no, it's a big thing."
56949,Marge,street signs? indoors?! whatever.
56916,Marge,don't do that!
57503,Marge,"okay, we'll go to the chili cook-off. but i want you to promise me you won't have any beer."
63919,Marge,aw... young love.
63069,Marge,"kids, grab a fold."
56049,Marge,"hi, hober. dote kiss be, i'b all stuffed up."
57953,Marge,"that's right, i'm a witch! and i'm the one who withered your livestock, soured your sheeps' milk and made your shirts itchy."
61046,Marge,the first step is the funnest -- turning all the pieces face up.
67554,Marge,and what happens when a child grows up with insanely violent role models like these?
67009,Marge,"now, doctor, that's not true."
56792,Marge,"ah, c'mon, homer, there's lasers. you like lasers."
65086,Marge,you can start with the rinse!
55807,Marge,"oh, honey, you can hardly see your new braces."
60097,Marge,"pierce, that was delicious. can we help you with the dishes?"
57773,Marge,"reverend, i hate to say this, but it sounded like that poor man was reaching out to you. i'm not sure your advice was all that helpful."
62191,Marge,"homer, we're separated now. you can't just walk in without knocking."
59053,Marge,it looks so elegant. and all it takes are some lace curtains and a beaded lampshade. you've got to show me exactly what you did.
62036,Marge,"well, you are not going to any concert that promulgates stink talk."
65527,Marge,"homer, that sounds like ""the sweet smell of success""."
57414,Marge,"is that so? well, sleazy entertainment and raunchy jokes will never be as popular as sobriety and self-denial!"
65798,Marge,mmm! cursive!
66378,Marge,"another seminar tomorrow. i just wish i could connect with those teenagers, since it seems like we'll never have any."
56832,Marge,"so, how are you, mrs. krabappel?"
56323,Marge,never.
62974,Marge,"oh, you're a widower."
63124,Marge,"come on, homer, let's get the kids out of here. homer?"
62291,Marge,the stars are falling to the earth!
67935,Marge,all i see is that rock.
58934,Marge,yess!!
66742,Marge,hello?
64111,Marge,"they say if you kiss the blarney stone, you get ""the gift of gab."" which is great, but i'm not sure i like the idea of getting a gift in return for kissing. what kind of a message is that for lisa and maggie? those are my daughters. but on the other hand, america doesn't have any stones worth kissing -- except for stone phillips. do you have one of him here? if so, he's our your him."
56788,Marge,"hm, maybe you can get the local jazz station to do a tribute to him."
58896,Marge,"what is it, honey?"
57744,Marge,"homer, are you wearing a tie to impress laddie?"
55080,Marge,yes!
55828,Marge,"gee, that's odd. they didn't send one to you."
56904,Marge,"oh, lisa, honey, i tracked down those old newspapers for your history project."
64938,Marge,there's nothing sexier than a man being a good dad. whoa!
57388,Marge,what are you doing in the basement? it's like you're hiding out down here.
60638,Marge,"we appreciate your coming to comfort us, but we're not catholic."
56912,Marge,shoo! get outta here!
63328,Marge,don't you have to get to your job as a mattress salesman?
54623,Marge,"homie, i got so caught up in the world of college that i forgot how important your love was. can you find it in your heart to take me back?"
58702,Marge,"wow, you can't find this stuff anywhere! seals and crofts, pablo cruise, air supply, ohhhh, loggins and oates! and it's free!"
54897,Marge,"oh hello, mrs. pennycandy."
57606,Marge,can't you get it yourself?
64815,Marge,"homer, lisa, could you please step outside? i have a few choice words for this gentleman."
63965,Marge,that's one of your breakup lines!
60325,Marge,"no, homer!"
55647,Marge,"oh, honey... honey... honey... honey. could you please be quiet?"
60982,Marge,"don't worry, honey. you can win without him."
64484,Marge,"so we'd just thrown a biter, and homer said to kick harder off the hack. so i did... and i almost fouled the hog line!"
61464,Marge,"you know, i think your sister could use a little help washing the car."
61761,Marge,"i think i'm going to like this ""america."""
56152,Marge,bowling ball... more underpants...
61536,Marge,daddy's not on fire.
63293,Marge,"i sent everyone i know an e-card for st. patrick's day... but not one person wrote me back! maybe if i hit ""refresh""..."
63488,Marge,"well, arthur fiedler used to, but i'd better take a look."
60319,Marge,why didn't you just turn off the oven?
66627,Marge,i'm sorry.
56986,Marge,"bart, what happened?!"
65951,Marge,we can have the reception at wong lee's!
57256,Marge,"hello? tennessee state police? no, my son's car was not crushed in knoxville. i don't know where to begin telling you what's wrong with that."
66775,Marge,"you're the last vote, homie."
56536,Marge,"no, no honey, it's all right. really. i'm fine. i'm all right. mother always said ""don't complain. be good. behave, behave. be nice, smile be polite, don't make waves."""
65902,Marge,what are you doing home from work?
58968,Marge,"oh, how embarrassing. oh, we slept right through church."
67444,Marge,now stop it you two. and don't look too down. i'm sure this is hard enough for your father.
55017,Marge,"""if ye test should fail, to a doctor set sail"". well, i guess i'd better go see dr. hibbert."
66882,Marge,disguises? i'm worried that our scam is becoming dishonest.
67128,Marge,"but this occasion is already so special if we made it any more special, we might end up making it less special."
66684,Marge,is one of the side effects of fracking earthquakes?
59565,Marge,"well, it doesn't have to be. otto's just going to have to decide what's more important, his heavy metal or you."
60399,Marge,homie!
56294,Marge,"homer, when are you gonna give up this crazy sugar scheme?"
60818,Marge,maggie?
57913,Marge,homer stop! would you please look at the drawing?
55095,Marge,homer!
64425,Marge,remember those hamsters you were going to take care of?
58221,Marge,we what?
57554,Marge,"oh, i don't want to own my own business. i don't know why i came here in the first place."
65368,Marge,"don't even bother shooting us. we've found a new place that we love. a place that may not have indoor plumbing, but it's got something we treasure more..."
55715,Marge,"kids, i have some bad news. your great aunt gladys has... passed on."
59881,Marge,"well, actually, the name of bart's partner is..."
54849,Marge,"homer, look! they give you a shower cap, and body gel and bathrobes... ooh, and a welcoming mint on your pillow."
55716,Marge,"no honey, gladys looked more like your aunt patty."
58391,Marge,is that your wallet?
57563,Marge,when can i start? what's my territory?
66127,Marge,well... i guess all that matters is everything's back to normal.
67024,Marge,"that's better, homer. be brave. bye bye, bart. you were always my special little guy."
58976,Marge,how's your father's project coming along?
59962,Marge,i'm a horrible mother.
62307,Marge,"you've got a big house, ned. if you need extra money, why don't you rent out a room?"
58830,Marge,"oh, i'm gonna snuggle your brains out."
57291,Marge,"well, how the hell do you be cool? i feel like we've tried everything here."
63158,Marge,"gil's gone? but i have a ""no"" inside me that has to come out."
59760,Marge,squibs!
59909,Marge,"hey, grampa's running!"
56768,Marge,"hello class. hi bart. over here, sweetie. it's me, mom. hi. hey. hello."
65782,Marge,it all makes sense now.
56652,Marge,"it's clever, just like you. huh? huh?"
65012,Marge,"all of j.d. salinger's books, except ""catcher in the rye!"" used pizza protectors!"
62073,Marge,but that wouldn't happen unless...
56325,Marge,"oh, i don't want to trouble you."
63844,Marge,i'll do it!
59999,Marge,"hm, quite a promotion."
59951,Marge,springfield baby-proofing?
61581,Marge,pour me another.
57483,Marge,why don't we do something to take our minds off the storm?
58237,Marge,and who do you love now?
61044,Marge,"here it is, this week's family activity."
65753,Marge,and here comes santa's little helper!
59607,Marge,i really should read the whole headline before i react.
59994,Marge,i-i love what you've done with these poles.
61638,Marge,it's got wright-patterson airforce base and a zipper museum! they have a zipper from every james bond!
64014,Marge,"a ""castle""... i know where they are!"
63320,Marge,"homer, what took you so long? the game's almost over."
59739,Marge,you talk too much. abra-ca-blab-ra! am i right?
55004,Marge,look at all those worried faces -- except for lenny. he looks great.
61520,Marge,"how about a little ""interrogation?"""
61755,Marge,does everyone remember their swimming lessons?
65459,Marge,purple!
65912,Marge,okay. but every man deserves a second chance. as long as he doesn't...
64948,Marge,"very romantic. homer had the basketball game muted the whole time. oh, and then i found a gray hair. no big deal."
55032,Marge,what if we get caught?
56596,Marge,"i love you too, homie."
59157,Marge,how about getting out of the tank... huh maybe stopping your rampage? huh? we could go to krusty burger...
58041,Marge,"well... your mother, for one."
64772,Marge,"please! homer, i am so sick of this unmotivated, jealous..."
61230,Marge,no thanks. i'm wearing my cure for depression.
57294,Marge,"well, did you call one of your friends?"
63960,Marge,"me neither, homie."
58927,Marge,i'm trying to find a particular tune. it's the one that goes like dah-da-dahhh dah-da-dahhh.
63024,Marge,i guess people just expect their carpenter to be some fat guy with his butt crack showing.
62266,Marge,i was hoping we'd miss the three o'clock hold-up. i don't know what to do for dinner now.
62608,Marge,where's reverend lovejoy? he's never been late for christmas service.
59079,Marge,be careful. we need that money to get home.
57912,Marge,"homer, i want you to look at this drawing bart did."
60419,Marge,this campus is so lush and verdant.
57424,Marge,what about the sleaze and the depravity?!
58300,Marge,wait there.
56299,Marge,"homie, do you think that the romance has gone out of our lives?"
60524,Marge,it says here we can get anywhere we want by taking a conga line.
57871,Marge,only in new york!
59217,Marge,"yeah, but didn't grasshopperus kill chad everett?"
59647,Marge,but i thought broccoli was--
54952,Marge,then i'm afraid there's no choice but to give up the pony back.
63641,Marge,i appreciate you trying to become more attractive for me. but the truth is... i'm way too successful for you now. i'm gettin' me a trophy husband!
62276,Marge,"hey, kids! i scream, you scream, we all scream for..."
56944,Marge,"so, what was it like at the flanders' house?"
65457,Marge,woo-woo-woo-woo!
61087,Marge,"watch it, mr. byrne! you'll slip on the simonize!"
54698,Marge,should i forgive him?...
57671,Marge,"homer, at least come out and say hello."
64480,Marge,a sport that encourages hand-holding.
66721,Marge,"you always save me, trombone elephant."
54859,Marge,"oh, homer."
67936,Marge,how did you get in my game? are you a virus?
66700,Marge,"how was your first day at school, bart?"
63942,Marge,my husband!
65757,Marge,hey! hello!
60724,Marge,"kids, look what i got you for your third grade field trip -- matching fanny packs!"
59148,Marge,i think we should take him off the drug.
58791,Marge,"well, i'm glad you're always here, but isn't it a little rough on your marriage?"
58634,Marge,"oh, homie, you made breakfast."
67202,Marge,like two fragile bowling pins...
60298,Marge,"ooo, sugar free donuts."
59654,Marge,"but husband, without your weekly pittance, how shall we feed our children?"
65219,Marge,this is nice -- a family fun day!
59520,Marge,"well, the fabric really brings out the red in your neck."
62530,Marge,aren't they jazzy? they match the new curtains we hung in your treehouse!
55168,Marge,"homer, that's awful!"
65456,Marge,homie... we actually have the cabin all to ourselves.
64052,Marge,i think we should go see our mortgage broker.
65035,Marge,dr. zander? kareem abdul jabbar? anyone?
57233,Marge,you kids must be so happy. your cute little cartoon friends are back on the air.
58165,Marge,i think you move like a young baryshnikov!
65118,Marge,just vote! it's your duty as a citizen of tv.
67352,Marge,"you know, some women find bald men quite virile."
62323,Marge,"let's just change the subject. bart, would you like to say grace?"
66374,Marge,and that's why nancy no is the most popular girl in promiseville high.
66277,Marge,"listen, i just wanted to say i'm sorry i overreacted. thank you all for coming."
65678,Marge,holy areole...
56607,Marge,"baby shower?! you know i haven't told homer yet, and he'll be home any minute."
55158,Marge,"goodbye, homie."
57047,Marge,fresh chocolate chip cookies.
60069,Marge,"you can do it, paul."
62014,Marge,i said stop
65296,Marge,"it wasn't just her, homie. it was all of us."
62164,Marge,"which came first, turkey the bird or turkey the you guys?"
59318,Marge,"this box? oh, nothing."
55362,Marge,can't complain.
67284,Marge,mmm-hmm.
57919,Marge,"come on, honey. i guess this is a world you'll never know."
59852,Marge,i'd better put on the silencer.
64621,Marge,tonight let's all draw pictures of what your father just said.
67083,Marge,his name isn't bigfoot. his name is homer.
66899,Marge,i want my husband back!
58118,Marge,homer! look at this mob! the good toys are probably all gone.
60363,Marge,it's seven-thirty!
57464,Marge,none! they would have more sense than that.
61998,Marge,i don't know what to say.
59922,Marge,what kind of a thing is that to tell your children?
57376,Marge,"that's what i said, foilage . it doesn't take a nucular scientist to pronounce foilage."
57629,Marge,"oh, i can see myself!"
59097,Marge,were you or lenny ever named sexiest man alive?
59794,Marge,"try to focus on something else. umm... you like jimi hendrix, right?"
63878,Marge,what are you doing at this construction site?!
65081,Marge,"i'd rather call you by your normal name, if that's okay. but i never knew you were so good with hair."
65893,Marge,i think i'm interesting!
56482,Marge,"at any rate, i believe you and i think you should go outside and straighten this out. some of their chants are very catchy and memorable."
66745,Marge,homer simpson!
64020,Marge,"you got a letter all the way from new york city, and that's something!"
66494,Marge,"oh, moe. are we doing this again?"
58699,Marge,dust!!!
55232,Marge,but we never ever...
57211,Marge,i wish i'd pay more attention.
67304,Marge,"oh, homer."
59941,Marge,"chew, chew, chew! swallow, swallow, swallow!"
64450,Marge,"okay, who's ready for a wedding-theme knock-knock joke?"
56642,Marge,bart!
56955,Marge,"that's it, honey. get into the spirit."
62833,Marge,you never take our kids to the movies.
61729,Marge,"no, as a reminder of the hurtful things men can do."
55614,Marge,"this might sound silly, but just for a change, would you mind..."
60493,Marge,don't burn her! she's just an innocent child!
58611,Marge,"ankle? ""foccacia""? what are you talking about?"
62554,Marge,have you cleaned that suit once since you got it?
56606,Marge,"wait a minute, wait, i know that look. now promise you won't tell homer."
58293,Marge,better. come look.
64302,Marge,maybe someday you can do lisa's wedding!
65822,Marge,"homer, that's for children!"
59877,Marge,get 'em off! get 'em off!
62628,Marge,"homer, that means your dad might not be your dad!"
60091,Marge,that voice could use a little personality.
63846,Marge,"well, um, thanks, but i've been wondering... why do you only have me make spheres, rods, and half-moon shapes?"
54983,Marge,"now, don't pout."
61321,Marge,"you just don't get it, do you? christmas is a time to think of others, but today you showed you only care about yourself."
55761,Marge,"well, honey, i--"
58331,Marge,a dishonorable discharge! it's the best we could've hoped for.
64626,Marge,should we inform the chief?
61427,Marge,did you read the book?
56899,Marge,"well, i'm just relieved that homer's safe and you've recovered and we can all get back to normal. if maggie could talk i'm sure she'd apologize for shooting you."
55417,Marge,it'll just take a sec.
58945,Marge,"oh, your father traded our tools for m&m's again. ah, the heck with it."
61569,Marge,i can't believe i drove drunk.
63439,Marge,"homer, you smell like chicago. did you fly there on a commercial airline?"
66206,Marge,"homie? aw, you're shopping ahead for maggie."
67050,Marge,"you do love her, don't you?"
63212,Marge,hoo-boy.
61196,Marge,"no, you'll be fine. i'll be right back."
57367,Marge,"celebrities at ringside tonight: star of the ""mcbain"" action films and featured player in the hollywood prostitution scandal, rainier wolfcastle; tv anchorman and springfield institution, mr. kent brockman."
58274,Marge,what on earth -- ?!
60075,Marge,"oh well, this is our stop."
63517,Marge,bart?
63242,Marge,the family can't start the day without me!
56503,Marge,we need to talk about the... marital difficulties we've been having lately.
67186,Marge,"hm, yes, i am, as a matter of fact. here's more treats. but don't worry, your dad will take care of dinner."
64892,Marge,"dear lord, watch over my sweet homie while he's in the hoosegow."
65363,Marge,"he's no ned flanders. and i miss the springfield sign and how every street is a dead end. god help me, i even miss helen lovejoy criticizing my brownies."
63693,Marge,"whatever, homer and i had the wrenching task of dividing up a shared life..."
65811,Marge,"fine, no tv for twenty-four hours."
67779,Marge,"well, don't worry. there are still plenty of fish in the sea. right, homer?"
61849,Marge,he's got the measles. but we've got him on speakerphone!
66589,Marge,ohh.
62240,Marge,i see ray too.
66871,Marge,but you don't go to our church.
67754,Marge,"no, homer, not over this. no, no."
61563,Marge,"well, i don't want to be a ""gloom-hilda."" i guess one beer won't hurt."
60777,Marge,"i finally feel like me again. you're not disappointed, are you?"
55684,Marge,"ohh, there's going to be a town meeting to decide how to spend mr. burns' money."
67326,Marge,maybe i'll go slip into something a little more comfortable.
58497,Marge,oh?
59243,Marge,are you comparing yourself to our lord?
54935,Marge,yes.
64296,Marge,"otto, don't you have a sack to hacky?"
57187,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
66090,Marge,hmm... maybe i can help.
63980,Marge,"homer, i'm sure you didn't see anything. go to sleep."
64358,Marge,homer?! does this mean you still love me?
61631,Marge,"oh, it's very sweet, but i don't need..."
57422,Marge,"here i come, everybody!"
62824,Marge,all this hoo-haw about girls and math is silly. women are as smart as men.
62739,Marge,really? you manage a whole office?
66004,Marge,mopped myself into a corner...
59960,Marge,"isn't that a little excessive? i mean, how are the buttons dangerous?"
64454,Marge,lettuce who?
61005,Marge,we've already been to room 915. we've already filled out form 1790.
65095,Marge,"homer, stop him!"
67123,Marge,and the kids.
61974,Marge,"come on, go home."
66865,Marge,yup. and i know a place that could use this smile.
66396,Marge,"well, thanks for the chicken dinner. how did you know i wanted one?"
61083,Marge,"another cover? my god, let it die."
65749,Marge,aw.
60491,Marge,"bartrand, where is your sister joan? morning bells are ringing. morning bells are ringing!"
67744,Marge,what's gotten into lisa?
61315,Marge,perfect! i'll take it.
66063,Marge,i thought i was buying snack cakes!
64690,Marge,hyper!
56113,Marge,"apu, you've been so helpful. if it weren't for him, we'd still be in line at the monstromart."
56384,Marge,homer! we just got here and already i'm mortified beyond belief by your embarrassing behavior.
55412,Marge,that sounds awfully harsh.
64420,Marge,mm-hmm... and swivel that till you hear a grinding noise...
59297,Marge,"and when you get a job interview, try not to call your employer a ""punk"" or a ""skank."""
65176,Marge,"ooo, let's see what else they do wrong!"
66780,Marge,we're receiving a transmission from an unknown source!
65647,Marge,are you doing an app behind my back?
58248,Marge,"oh, all right. you can stay up late tonight. but tomorrow everyone's going to bed at five o'clock."
54599,Marge,"homie, my mind has been opened in so many ways! did you know that every u.s. president has been a straight white man?"
66013,Marge,"well, i'm glad your side of the deal worked out."
55413,Marge,"oh, well. be a good girl, maggie."
61593,Marge,no.
62511,Marge,no.
66506,Marge,oh it's amazing how many cheerios maggie drops in the back seat.
67251,Marge,but bart doesn't speak french.
62251,Marge,i talked to dr. hibbert today. he gave me a list of heart-smart foods.
67143,Marge,thank you.
64317,Marge,"""beat, slay, shove."""
63622,Marge,we have a family.
56598,Marge,"oh no, no. n-not exactly. it's just that i haven't told homer yet; and with his new job, i don't know how we're going to be able to afford this."
54965,Marge,"homer, be nice."
63370,Marge,"well, i guess every boy should see his father as a hero."
56882,Marge,"i must say mr. burns is being awfully inconsiderate. selfish, even."
67920,Marge,what are you doing?
62414,Marge,"lisa, honey. any chance you can stop reading soon?"
62708,Marge,"ned, i know you like to worry, but these boys are never going to get self-confidence unless you let them try things for themselves."
61031,Marge,what's that ruckus?
64707,Marge,perestroika?
61333,Marge,backed up by solar power.
59771,Marge,this is terrible. how will the kids get home?
65106,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry, homie."
58618,Marge,and that poncho is filthy! let me dry-clean it for you.
60026,Marge,not right now. your father's in there and --
67055,Marge,"now, lisa, listen to me. this is important. i want you to smile today."
67519,Marge,"homer, you're his father. you've got to try and reason with him."
61822,Marge,"you're right. if i can feed a family of five on twelve dollars a week, i can do anything."
57004,Marge,i'm going out. i run errands during the day.
58782,Marge,"goodnight, homer."
54803,Marge,"homer, you don't do things like that to be rewarded. you do them because a fellow human being needs a helping hand."
60924,Marge,"bart, you're a little young to be growling at seven foot chinese ladies."
59529,Marge,"fine, you win. i'll do your shopping for you."
65016,Marge,i'm not a hoarder! do the yankees hoard pennants? does marrakesh hoard intrigue?
67161,Marge,no.
64300,Marge,what else?
66586,Marge,there's only one thing left to try.
61027,Marge,this is so romantic.
63053,Marge,what?! homer! our son joined the army!
55486,Marge,where'd you get all the money?
55906,Marge,it's so good to be home again.
61555,Marge,"moe's tavern? that's your fun place, like me and the lamp store."
65588,Marge,"no, s'okay. we can share this with you... homer can't make a baby because he nuked his swimmers."
66853,Marge,yes.
66998,Marge,maybe we should move to a larger community.
61425,Marge,it's double-spaced.
60195,Marge,barney? w-w-where's chad--
57462,Marge,"homie, i appreciate this, but i'd really like to get some sleep."
64763,Marge,he's nothing but hard bronze muscle.
62136,Marge,"kids, come back in the house!"
61703,Marge,"stop it, homer! there's only one way to settle this -- in simpson family court."
59726,Marge,"the dog thinks so, too."
65409,Marge,is that hail coming down?
65996,Marge,stop making putin jokes!
65136,Marge,ooh! we can wear those to the nice mall!
56776,Marge,"ah, here you go, precious. now go off with your friends."
63010,Marge,"bart, here's a letter from your school!"
66296,Marge,it was me! i was the one who told the fbi.
62771,Marge,"yeah, whatever."
66071,Marge,he's in the market! we might've squeezed the same tomatoes!
67954,Marge,hold that thought.
56509,Marge,sane planning: sensible tomorrow.
54721,Marge,chip!
59348,Marge,"hansen's disease. you know, like that horrible cream soda?"
55180,Marge,"how was detention today, dear?"
65942,Marge,what about my dress?
57027,Marge,they're ready.
61125,Marge,is my husband there?
60154,Marge,what's that noise?
58603,Marge,"stay there, honey. we'll come back for you."
57112,Marge,for what?
61923,Marge,"for your information, our electric dishwasher is on the fritz."
65862,Marge,"but if he gets too much attention for acting bad, he might turn bad on the inside..."
61895,Marge,she's from springfield! i knew her in high school.
56738,Marge,uh-oh...
65362,Marge,is it iraqi journalists being murdered?
67494,Marge,"everyone, lisa wants to read us a poem she's written."
63034,Marge,"homer, it's time people knew the truth: i'm doing the work and i want the credit."
60378,Marge,i'll get it!
57796,Marge,hmmm. oh well.
67354,Marge,"homie, my sisters are here."
64008,Marge,i'm bart simpson's mother. you think you've got any tricks i haven't seen?
65514,Marge,"bart, just tell us the problem!"
55778,Marge,did you say beer or deer?
67194,Marge,"goodbye, helen."
56175,Marge,then why is he attacking all those other elephants?
64430,Marge,that's us!
64877,Marge,right before christmas?
66442,Marge,"oh, homer simpson, that painting has torn the town apart, destroyed kirk and luann's marriage, and everyone's very worried about milhouse."
63298,Marge,whoa! look at those bazooms!
63514,Marge,maggie's completely independent.
67452,Marge,"well, he's not perfect, but he is very..."
64321,Marge,is there someone in there?
60050,Marge,one more and i get a free hysterectomy.
64054,Marge,and what will i cook that soup on?
62392,Marge,homer! do something about the noise!
61377,Marge,"looks like everything's back the way it was, which is the only way it should ever be."
62540,Marge,"bart, you are a wild heck-raiser. and i don't want to see you turn into that."
61001,Marge,what?
58925,Marge,so many doorbells... i'm in way over my head.
66679,Marge,"if someone was fracking in our neighborhood, wouldn't we know it?"
55504,Marge,fruit is nature's candy!
64727,Marge,"oh, i didn't realize..."
65509,Marge,where on the internet?
56205,Marge,"good for you, homie. you know, a lot of things happened around here while you were gone."
55590,Marge,you could see our house in that photo.
66002,Marge,"you'll need your voice to say ""thanks, mom"" after your next recital!"
63662,Marge,"homer, your behavior is heinous."
66115,Marge,find love on the net
60634,Marge,"this is ridiculous. you've been through my delicates, my silkies, my dainties, and my unmentionables."
60969,Marge,"school's starting, bart. aren't you excited? this year you learn about local history!"
54964,Marge,"homer, can you get the door? it's my sisters."
55574,Marge,here's your money.
59309,Marge,why are you doing that?
67791,Marge,"would you like to hold the baby, herb?"
57405,Marge,i've got rocks that need washing at home.
59135,Marge,can you believe it? and he's even tutoring a little navajo boy.
60765,Marge,"homie, i could use a little more excitement in my life."
64844,Marge,you were given six weeks to live. and you've outlived it! i think what kept you alive was that for once in your life you were helping other people.
56383,Marge,bart!
56126,Marge,"well, we respect you."
61512,Marge,lisa! you're all right!
60053,Marge,"you shoo, barney gumbel!"
63067,Marge,"all right, but no combat."
57359,Marge,a competent doctor!
55298,Marge,"you've got a wonderful family, homer. please don't forget it when you walk out that door tonight."
60553,Marge,hello?
63140,Marge,i guess you can stay a little longer.
67810,Marge,i knew it.
63530,Marge,deal.
55566,Marge,mr. burns!
58906,Marge,mmm.
59026,Marge,"we're walking, homer."
61853,Marge,"here's lisa! she'll save the party! honey, sit down... have a big slice of cake!"
59190,Marge,"oh, thank you, homie. a lady remington."
54722,Marge,"lisa, tell your father."
65288,Marge,how can you refer to your audience that way?
60168,Marge,it wasn't meant to be.
62581,Marge,oh... uh... uh... bird watching.
56726,Marge,"lisa, i can't believe it's your wedding day already."
60679,Marge,"homie, you've been such a sweetheart today. let's go upstairs and..."
67762,Marge,saturday night? i'm not even sure my sisters will be available.
64704,Marge,did you really think i'd forget? now have a great time!
62117,Marge,"oh, this is only based on a story. a true story!"
59282,Marge,stop that! if you want some food i'll be happy to make you some breakfast.
59538,Marge,"ah, little vicki, i really think she had her heart set on..."
60113,Marge,that's not good for the clock.
64632,Marge,"ever hear of the expression ""not in my backyard?"" well, that!"
63214,Marge,hm...
62174,Marge,i wrote that letter.
67884,Marge,"that's wonderful homer, i'm so proud of..."
54986,Marge,but i guess i was wrong. you are a bad father.
58317,Marge,"okay, great. you kids have fun."
55510,Marge,"thank you, dear. now be good for grampa while we're at the parent/ teacher meeting. we'll bring back dinner."
67609,Marge,oh!
61856,Marge,"no! no, i've got a lot more mothering left in me!"
56395,Marge,"hey, the bartender even looks like john travolta."
56491,Marge,i hope you kept the homie fires burning...
56023,Marge,kids. tell me the truth. am i no fun? do i just nag all the time?
58266,Marge,oh good lord.
59076,Marge,"oh my goodness, homer, those are a hundred and fifty dollars."
60793,Marge,"hey, if tv can give mike o'malley a home, it can give us one."
55373,Marge,"homer, every mother in the country is going to want one of these."
66620,Marge,i'm too nervous to sleep.
66804,Marge,"well, here's what happened..."
66573,Marge,"sweetie, you shouldn't have to worry about such things."
57287,Marge,there might be one in this cooler.
65433,Marge,this is the stupidest fight ever!
58429,Marge,"oh, yeah. he's really special."
64175,Marge,"jenny, it's amazing what you've done with my son."
57311,Marge,you'll be my friend. i'm never gonna let you get away.
56117,Marge,"oh, that'll work out great. we're out of lucky charms."
61077,Marge,"goodbye, homer! i try to save our marriage, and you just get drunk and spend the whole night with your homosexual boyfriends!"
58435,Marge,hope that farmhouse has a phone.
61639,Marge,"we're staying at the dayton arms hotel. it got three diamonds from ""five diamond"" magazine!"
58614,Marge,you're joining the screen actor's guild?
62849,Marge,"oh, you're sweet. i'm lucky to have such a kind... uncle?"
58316,Marge,"he's just a misunderstood little boy who needs a friend. and, if he hangs around with you, well, everyone will think he's cool."
56233,Marge,"we don't think you're slow. but, on the other hand, it's not like you go to museums or read books or anything."
59913,Marge,"oh, okay."
65585,Marge,what do you mean?
67784,Marge,bart!
66350,Marge,dr. hibbert.
59280,Marge,"okay, meathook, i think he learned his lesson."
59438,Marge,guess who i saw at the supermarket today!
58301,Marge,you poor little boy.
58285,Marge,no snacks! dinner will be ready in three minutes!
66831,Marge,"thank you. although, i think the worst thing that ever happened to my husband was joining your group."
61010,Marge,"i never thought i would say this, but i think we have to move."
63301,Marge,face: other.
57702,Marge,"uh, i don't think we should be driving here. the mayor's yelling at us."
58990,Marge,"homer, i know you worked hard, but all of your... things were kind of the same."
67173,Marge,homer... homer.
55122,Marge,"hmm, i guess so."
62582,Marge,that's my special skill?
66835,Marge,"homer, i want to say something extremely important the way a woman does: subtly through someone else. kids?"
63535,Marge,"goodbye, my love!"
60500,Marge,sit down.
64790,Marge,"oh homie, maybe we should call it a day."
60604,Marge,"look lisa, there's an opening."
55366,Marge,that was your idea.
67084,Marge,"i don't understand. what's this all about? well, i suppose pork chops are his favorite."
60315,Marge,don't worry. i'll do the legwork.
62813,Marge,who else has a story?
67543,Marge,... and the horse i rode in on!?
60511,Marge,homer!
66418,Marge,"oh, it looks great!"
60779,Marge,"oh, homie."
60802,Marge,twenty-three skidoo!
59911,Marge,my bart?
64567,Marge,"homer, i can hear your sarcasm from inside the house -- and the dishwasher's on! what's going on here?"
65668,Marge,but i always thought you were cool.
58918,Marge,"oh no. oh, no..."
61577,Marge,homer?
64803,Marge,you kids play nice up there!
55926,Marge,come on dear. it's time to go.
60416,Marge,"marge, if you're watching this, then it means i've figured out how to work the camera. last night i crashed a certain fake prom. that's right, artie ziff's fake prom."
58947,Marge,"oh my. gracias, señor."
64513,Marge,"it's like when your father and i left the movie ""carrie"" right after she was crowned prom queen! she was so happy -- she'd had a lot of problems, but they were all behind her!"
56163,Marge,"well, they will."
55351,Marge,how cute.
55329,Marge,"bart, what's going on?"
58560,Marge,"bart, i'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do. your lizards are banned by federal law."
61651,Marge,it's their hub.
56826,Marge,um-hmmm. who called the police?
56094,Marge,"bart, i've asked you not to whistle that annoying tune."
57934,Marge,"what ""origin""? we get 'em for a dollar ninety-five down at the safeway."
55789,Marge,la la la la la la... la...
67263,Marge,oh. okay.
62721,Marge,"while you were living the glamorous life of a tv chimp, i was raising my son. you have no right to take him away from me now. please, please, give me back my boy."
66518,Marge,i want friends. any friends.
61155,Marge,oh my god. it's so beautiful.
67872,Marge,mr. burns. would you like to come in?
59183,Marge,i better pull over and play it safe.
57184,Marge,a dollar. let's go.
60308,Marge,"if you looked up meanie-beanie-fo-feanie in the dictionary, you'd see his picture."
56677,Marge,"not too good, lisa. frankly, he's underneath the table."
67279,Marge,all this senseless violence. i don't understand its appeal.
54975,Marge,"question one: ""name one of your child's friends..."""
59892,Marge,"oh, you little-- come on, bart."
63135,Marge,"wait, you don't have a place to live?"
63900,Marge,"dang that bart! thanks to him, i have to wear my backup dress which makes my arms look fat."
58877,Marge,"it's okay, homie. you can come out now."
60925,Marge,what are you doing?
66307,Marge,no woman will be able to resist you dressed like this.
54945,Marge,what was that? was that a yes or a no?
67871,Marge,kids. remember what i told you about showing a little support.
55676,Marge,how?
57690,Marge,which is impossible!
54857,Marge,"he's trying to be friendly. you know, if you gave ned flanders a chance --"
61261,Marge,"a subscription to ""bartforum"" magazine, , and bart will say ""eat my shorts"" on your home answering machine."
66261,Marge,"this is a great thing! we're helping people celebrate christmas, and we'll be able to afford christmas!"
56324,Marge,no.
60302,Marge,that's lucky.
67493,Marge,"bart, you can come down to dinner as soon as you're ready to apologize to your sister. and it's going to be a real apology in front of everybody, and you have to mean it."
57328,Marge,i think i'll bottle-feed that one.
67544,Marge,"well, that's what we want them to do, homer."
60261,Marge,"happy, happy new year!"
60394,Marge,for you. for you.
64469,Marge,oh my god!
66476,Marge,"all right, you've made your point."
58559,Marge,i'm sure we can work this out. he's just a child. let me talk to him.
63892,Marge,i think it's time for us to go home.
57389,Marge,and what's that hitchhiker doing here? is every drifter we meet going to move in with us?
57890,Marge,and have ten items or less.
62023,Marge,oh my. ned's next movie seems even bloodier than the last one.
63202,Marge,"homer, you're back!"
59968,Marge,"i don't know if it matters, but it was a time magazine. does that matter?"
56538,Marge,can't talk. keeping myself in a state of cat-like readiness.
65743,Marge,"""in this exciting strategy game, you amass resources -- timber, salt fish, and wax -- to fund a syndicate to gain influence with the doges of venice."
61809,Marge,"well, open it, open it, open it!"
64117,Marge,and i think apu got lucky with my sister.
62296,Marge,"we're not going anywhere, except to bed!"
67821,Marge,homer!
61363,Marge,mr. burns? you care about children?
54923,Marge,please?
54659,Marge,well i do.
61097,Marge,"homie, i'm worried about how fast our kids are growing up."
56334,Marge,he seemed to know a lot about brunch. but it turned out he wasn't interested in brunch at all.
56745,Marge,"well, i'm going to write the dictionary people and have that checked. it feels like a mistake to me."
67861,Marge,apu! what are you doing here?
66631,Marge,you are working two jobs!
58175,Marge,the kids were supposed to be keeping this yard clean.
64413,Marge,maybe we could do both.
67869,Marge,"okay, shoot."
58583,Marge,"oh, lord. i was hoping this day would never come."
62052,Marge,jesus' teachings stressed inclusiveness and compassion...
64092,Marge,"maggie, you're coming home with me!"
67727,Marge,"oh, artie!"
67509,Marge,"ooo, i think there's one over there."
55179,Marge,"oh, i don't know..."
65390,Marge,"professor frink, are you all right?"
61408,Marge,"perfect! now, let's see if lightning strikes twice!"
60769,Marge,i'm afraid all that attention is from the wrong kind of people.
60614,Marge,"homer, cathy is a woman."
57775,Marge,me?
62559,Marge,tea? in the parlor?
66141,Marge,"just rest on the sofa, i'll be home by ten."
61698,Marge,i don't care.
66110,Marge,i'm marge simpson.
55758,Marge,"aw, lisa. you tried your best."
61451,Marge,"when winter came, lewis and clark tried to set up camp, but encountered much hardship."
59234,Marge,homer!
65073,Marge,"goomar?! that's mob talk for ""mistress."" fat tony has a mistress!"
58715,Marge,what the dilly-yo?
64842,Marge,it's not up to you. we're going to take him to our moral and civic leaders. they'll know the right thing to do.
65147,Marge,"homer, have you noticed how many of your enemies have died lately? mr. burns, sideshow bob..."
59575,Marge,stop kicking my baby!
65220,Marge,it's so cute that all these children are excited to see their favorite dinosaurs!
56545,Marge,the kids at school were even worse.
66961,Marge,shush.
61946,Marge,no harm done.
61056,Marge,"oh, is this about that billboard my sisters put up?"
55069,Marge,would you mind if i took it off now? the oil is burning my finger.
57433,Marge,"at least let's have a civilized conversation, shall we? lisa, how was school?"
57417,Marge,"i'm here to share my moral outrage, but this time it's not about that giant, inflatable dos equis bottle. it's about a certain house in our town..."
66911,Marge,"oh, for heavens sakes, homer. it's in the utility drawer."
64250,Marge,i wouldn't be stuck washing costumes if my husband had a better role.
61335,Marge,it makes her happy.
65413,Marge,and you and i were going to study the municipal voter's guide.
64888,Marge,"what's wrong, homie?"
65993,Marge,"okay, let's try again."
67482,Marge,you knew that i was cooking a turkey.
65414,Marge,"homie, what are you drinking?"
57926,Marge,"well, there's that two hundred dollars we've been saving for the new air conditioner."
58470,Marge,"kids, i want to explain about the stadium. y'see, sometimes moms and dads get a little... well, accustomed to each other."
54603,Marge,"professor, do you think white male scientists have marginalized the contributions of the third world?"
66571,Marge,i don't know. uh... how about... that's a lot worse!
62335,Marge,"homer, you're physically an adult, and what you do in the privacy of your own soul is your business. but i didn't change bart's diapers for five years to see him become a catholic."
57851,Marge,"lisa, no! this place is just a jail for children."
64507,Marge,see. all good.
66217,Marge,"if he's not in there, where is he?"
54686,Marge,it was my fault! i... i walked into a door.
59491,Marge,"okay honey, we're almost to palm corners. there'll be nothing to do but lie on the beach and relax."
58205,Marge,homer!
62084,Marge,"lisa, don't you think your brother's suffered enough?"
58701,Marge,"you listen to your friends, but you never listen to me."
63750,Marge,"oh homie, i've been so happy lately. i'm completely fulfilled, both as a mother and a fan of youth ballet! now what did you want to say to me?"
64747,Marge,what about bart's feelings?
64577,Marge,"oh homie, you're alive!"
60474,Marge,he is your dad.
59598,Marge,i thought you said the law was powerless.
58798,Marge,"mmm, oh, this is delicious. what's in it?"
60424,Marge,does that work on anyone?
57091,Marge,"i always thought i understood my special little guy. but somewhere along the road, his hand slipped away from mine."
57943,Marge,"oh, well, he may be a horrible freak, but he's still my son. i'm sure we'll grow to accept him in time."
61584,Marge,"well, i love my husband and i'm glad i do. my name is marge s. and i'm a homer-holic!"
58837,Marge,good lord. how am i supposed to get in this beast?
64806,Marge,she doesn't want to end up like me?!
67721,Marge,i also said i hated you and we haven't even talked since then.
63453,Marge,there's only one man who could help us now.
58573,Marge,"well, we're leaving. and remember, no itchy and scratchy. i better take these batteries just to be sure."
66226,Marge,"it's true, i never specified the home."
60828,Marge,i don't think this was a great place to bring the children.
62877,Marge,know what?
67794,Marge,"actually, i just told you pretty much everything."
66192,Marge,i feel kind of... melancholy...
62022,Marge,who wants to help me clear the table?
55003,Marge,you spent fifty-two hundred dollars on beer?
59107,Marge,"oh, you poor thing..."
64492,Marge,homie! we're going to vancouver!
56718,Marge,"oh, don't worry, honey. i guarantee your father will behave."
64700,Marge,you can't even show it in the bar?
63594,Marge,there's a bee on maggie!
58654,Marge,don't look at me! i wanted to eat him!
61413,Marge,...she had married a brute.
58190,Marge,but it doesn't look safe. and the guy running it looks a little seedy. no offense.
57946,Marge,"mm! shoo! shoo, fly!"
62607,Marge,"oh, homie, isn't venice romantic? this gondola ride was a wonderful idea."
56476,Marge,well there's also a baby somewhere upstairs!
65844,Marge,abe... we found your storage locker.
67193,Marge,hmm-hmm.
55216,Marge,"that's nice, bart. you know your father wanted to be a policeman for a little while. but they said he was too heavy."
55763,Marge,"homer, i want you to encourage lisa with her science fair project."
62768,Marge,"let's go home, sweetie. i'm sure there's a hamper full of homer waiting for me."
58571,Marge,why don't you kids come trick-or-treating with maggie and me?
67155,Marge,"oh, i don't want to trouble you."
65772,Marge,"so, surfing is really your job?"
66408,Marge,"lisa, your father and i are very concerned about all this hinting."
63882,Marge,"oh my god, he's out of frame! zoom out! zoom out!"
56020,Marge,i told you this was a bad idea!
62951,Marge,or take the same limo.
63989,Marge,"listen lisa, i was trying to think of a way to help your bees and i remembered this abandoned greenhouse outside of town."
57557,Marge,uh... oh...
64565,Marge,and it means the world to me.
63814,Marge,none of you kids ever remember any of the nice things we do for you.
62753,Marge,no.
57688,Marge,but he's safely locked away!
59619,Marge,"""the malarkeys,"" ""dumbin' it down""..."
63697,Marge,you don't have to tell the kids everything!
56717,Marge,"all right!!! lisa, that's wonderful. if only your father was still with us... but he left for work a few minutes ago."
64346,Marge,"what is it, moe?"
55299,Marge,i'll love you for the rest of my life.
66466,Marge,"oh, there's my magazine. why, look at this! ""what every father should do for his daughter."""
56238,Marge,whatever do you mean? i don't dye my hair...
57957,Marge,as for the rest of you...
62298,Marge,the worst part is i'll never see my homie again!
67041,Marge,"lisa, honey, why don't we go upstairs and i'll draw you a nice hot bath? that helps me when i feel sad."
67171,Marge,hmmm.
59040,Marge,run!
56284,Marge,but the grocery store sells sugar for thirty-five cents a pound.
65237,Marge,i don't suppose you'd consider taking your old job back so homie can go back to his old job?
56871,Marge,"where you going, bart?"
56239,Marge,i don't know what you're talking about.
61142,Marge,"that's okay. i can handle it. homie, why don't you just relax and have a little soup?"
67746,Marge,"oh, of course. it's thou shalt not... uh... covet... graven images... something about covet..."
65206,Marge,"yeah, you always do. well, here's where to meet us..."
56675,Marge,"homer, is this projection accurate? did you borrow money from my sisters?"
64854,Marge,no he doesn't!
57570,Marge,very well. there must be dozens of great locations in this town. don't you worry about me.
60791,Marge,thanks for letting us stay with you.
67499,Marge,bart? you're home!
63456,Marge,"homer, you did it! you landed a jet!"
56437,Marge,"i don't want you playing with something that has such bizarre hair. awful, awful hair."
55618,Marge,"maggie, can you say ba-ba? can you say ma-ma?"
54789,Marge,"what are you doing, honey?"
59954,Marge,why don't you try reaching out to this new girl? see if you two have a common interest.
55635,Marge,who did this?
62381,Marge,i can't believe how many manatees we saved today.
64197,Marge,ooh. the label is all in lowercase.
54631,Marge,"i don't want a life of watching you get drunk, then holding back your long, beautiful hair while you vomit. i have my own dreams and i can't live them with you."
62903,Marge,"oh, and her."
63364,Marge,"sweetheart, come to dinner."
54696,Marge,"freeze him out. it's cold in marge's doghouse, baby."
62348,Marge,and i'd also like to know why your hand is in that cast.
67537,Marge,this is the kind of entertainment they think is suitable for younger and more impressionable viewers?
59260,Marge,apu told me all eight babies have colic. although he thinks one or two might just be going along with the crowd.
55138,Marge,"videos to return, grocery list, flea dip for the cat, homer's dry-cleaning -- i think that's everything."
66733,Marge,"oh, sweetie. this band has brought out the best in you."
61738,Marge,i think you should stay home from school tomorrow.
61798,Marge,i never stopped telling you.
66018,Marge,"you are unique, you are special, and at some point that's gonna come together and work for you. i know it."
56008,Marge,my god! that must be every policeman in springfield!
56000,Marge,"ruth, is there something you want to tell me?"
65161,Marge,the kids sure had a good time with you.
64906,Marge,it's all yours.
60470,Marge,why don't we double date? then the restaurant will have to give us that booth.
67178,Marge,"oh, jacques! it fits. you got it in my size and it has my name on it. it's really for me."
65938,Marge,where is it? my wedding dress!
66910,Marge,the simpsons.
60128,Marge,she's such a butthole.
63868,Marge,"i don't think i could. mr. leary, i'm so sorry. i'll send you your phone back right away."
58807,Marge,oh dear.
67023,Marge,homer!
64172,Marge,"lisa is a little young to be taking ""happy pills."""
59547,Marge,awww...
59019,Marge,i want you to get rid of these springs.
63389,Marge,homer!
67814,Marge,you try it.
65854,Marge,i so wanted him to be gay.
67206,Marge,"goodbye, homer."
56263,Marge,"homer, that's not a good thing."
61824,Marge,i guess i was the last one.
56157,Marge,you're not done. i want you to throw away these old calendars and tv guides.
65633,Marge,sh! here comes lisa's solo!
59924,Marge,they wouldn't honor my coupon for two free streaks.
64823,Marge,"well, if he's got you cornered, and milhouse isn't there to help you, there's only one way out: make him feel good about himself."
66122,Marge,you're talking about my husband!
57508,Marge,"thank you for your concern, helen. homer isn't drinking today."
65189,Marge,"""three?"" you mean, one, two... me?"
66136,Marge,for the better! and men don't change that way!
58540,Marge,bart! did you kill that poor bird?
60800,Marge,i'll just take these tampons.
65347,Marge,that's odd.
60385,Marge,"artie, get off of me."
60021,Marge,hibbert's really losing it. we're going to dr. nick's.
58059,Marge,you bought a car?! without consulting me?!
55833,Marge,time to go to the reunion.
61987,Marge,"ooh, that's a great idea."
65122,Marge,did you have a hard day too?
57246,Marge,"oh, but he so wanted to see women in the workplace..."
61888,Marge,no! i want to hear what happened at the store!
57864,Marge,wow! i feel like such a nobody.
62378,Marge,i've bonded with him!
63928,Marge,can we use your phone?
67934,Marge,yes!
56024,Marge,i didn't realize people saw me that way.
66314,Marge,now!
63630,Marge,what's gotten into you?
59884,Marge,"i was thinking mantle, too! talk about being on the same wavelength."
60158,Marge,"bart, this is dr. kaufman. he's a special kind of ""talking doctor."""
65291,Marge,"speaking for lisa and me, we're not really a hundred and ten percent behind you anymore."
62480,Marge,done and done!
57996,Marge,how did you know we were being robbed?
55091,Marge,bart! what's wrong with you?
65995,Marge,what are you doing?!
65910,Marge,how many times do i have to tell you to quit comparing our relationship to the special olympics?
62468,Marge,i thought he was in a coma!
60607,Marge,i knew it was serious when he said he didn't want ice cream.
62577,Marge,you're not joking. any other surprises?
62181,Marge,the prison snitch is killed! and that could be you! because you're the prison snitch!
65812,Marge,"we can do without tv for a day! we're taking maggie to a children's bookstore, where she can learn the old-fashioned way -- the way children did from nineteen-ten to two thousand and two."
59758,Marge,they always say they're innocent. it's such a turn-off.
57011,Marge,"get out of here, you ghouls!"
59919,Marge,squaresville sounds pretty cool.
58131,Marge,no. my husband is... at church.
57725,Marge,what on earth happened down there?
63310,Marge,"ew, i can't watch this."
64954,Marge,"so, what do you think?"
67303,Marge,yeah.
56599,Marge,what?
58609,Marge,but that's not what p.e.t.a. stands--
65816,Marge,have you seen lisa and maggie?
56050,Marge,oh that's sweet. guess what. there's a new place at the mall - they'll put your picture on a t-shirt. i got two dollars off because mine got smeared.
55061,Marge,homer ?!
66305,Marge,/
56760,Marge,"dinner's on, dogs!"
60503,Marge,no way i'm cleaning up this mess.
67088,Marge,"kids, we're late for church. get your butts down here right now."
63901,Marge,why can't our son just behave?
57023,Marge,"so, mother simpson, where did your new-found sense of irresponsibility take you?"
66479,Marge,we need to have a conversation in loud whispers.
55024,Marge,"no, i mean how you plan to earn a living. i can't imagine that job of yours is very stimulating."
67823,Marge,"well, homer. there seems to be a lot of good obedience schools here."
61269,Marge,bart! stop saying macbeth!
59680,Marge,mmmm.
61085,Marge,why don't we take a vacation and get away from that song for a while?
54837,Marge,you've certainly taken a shine to that magazine.
67019,Marge,"excuse me, dear. shouldn't we be heading down to the pawn shop to get our tv back?"
66034,Marge,you're going so far away. i'll miss you.
64694,Marge,in the mood for another round?
57228,Marge,no. the b-u-m.
64135,Marge,i can't believe you told lenny and carl they could bring dates! 'cause they're not even coming to the wedding!
64530,Marge,thanks for doing the dishes.
63412,Marge,kitty cat!
62604,Marge,"boy, that sideshow bob goes from zero to murder awfully fast."
62953,Marge,that's it! we're outta here.
56021,Marge,that's not true.
54943,Marge,let's be realistic. a pony is very expensive and we have enough trouble paying bills as it is.
56894,Marge,i was just asking if you'd seen it. there's no need to be a prickly pear.
62773,Marge,"homie, snagging a pro football franchise is a big project, requiring a lot of follow-through..."
58901,Marge,"c'mon, c'mon, i need some gossip, here! where is everybody? does this town shut down at 5 o'clock?"
56793,Marge,"homie, these games are fixed."
55129,Marge,"well, i just don't know."
60613,Marge,"i put those ""cathys"" on the fridge for you. i don't even like them. they've gotten so smutty."
62668,Marge,i'd like to get into some blue pants right now.
62575,Marge,i feel a happiness i've never felt. i not only have friends... i have a hat to prove it.
66036,Marge,how am i going to sleep if someone isn't pushing me all the way to the very edge of the bed?
64982,Marge,"bart's been alone for twenty-three minutes! let's get this yo on the road, people!"
58333,Marge,"homer, you know we don't have..."
65729,Marge,good boy.
58688,Marge,"homer, i don't think you were listening to what he just--"
61773,Marge,why is my swimsuit so revealing?
55338,Marge,so get that piece of paper!
64751,Marge,"actually, i'm taking you on a ""special little guy super happy fun"" day!"
64742,Marge,"homie, maybe you could do it."
67013,Marge,bart! lisa! stop that.
61099,Marge,"homer, those are elk."
60711,Marge,"we had a family meeting and decided that even though what you said about us was incredibly thoughtless and hurtful, you had a point."
55478,Marge,he sold his ride on the duff blimp.
61448,Marge,"in 1804, president jefferson..."
57509,Marge,it looks so complicated... do you know how?
66016,Marge,"listen, sweetie... it was wrong of me to force my dreams on you."
61357,Marge,i wish to announce the formation of ppassccatag: proud parents against singles seniors childless couples and teens and gays.
57461,Marge,fine. i'll go without you.
66821,Marge,our kids just did something amazing!
58324,Marge,homer!
57500,Marge,"well, i just felt like filling the house with the rich, satisfying smell of tobacco."
64800,Marge,my memorables!
66281,Marge,"oh, the happy sound of a blender."
65356,Marge,thank you.
59251,Marge,"how about this ""pöpli""?"
56090,Marge,and don't take candy from strangers.
64950,Marge,she doesn't seem so worried about her gray hair.
58765,Marge,you are invited to a garden party this saturday!
59158,Marge,major league baseball?
64311,Marge,really?
59213,Marge,you got that from a movie poster!
59649,Marge,"homer, it's you!! i thought i'd never see you again."
56868,Marge,"this is a springfield isotopes cap. when you wear it, you're wearing springfield. when you eat a fish from our river, you're eating springfield. when you make lemonade from our trees you're drinking springfield."
66156,Marge,poor chip. such a big part of everyone's life.
60881,Marge,i'm gonna sleep down here tonight.
55458,Marge,"lord, my husband is by no means perfect, but he's a kind, decent man. please show him the error of his ways."
60522,Marge,"well done bart, but in brazil they speak portuguese."
55679,Marge,i don't know if i like you reading all those cardiology books.
66339,Marge,"well, he's down to two beers in the shower..."
60723,Marge,would you like some ice cream with that?
58180,Marge,get to work!
65489,Marge,"congratulations, you two! we're so, so happy for you!"
64936,Marge,now it's ready for garbage!
65223,Marge,"oh honey, i'm sorry your book lady turned out to be a dinosaur. but you liked the stories when you read them, so what does it matter?"
63887,Marge,"bart! where are you, bart?"
61513,Marge,just tell her which friggin' button to push!
59047,Marge,"oh! you're not going anywhere, missy."
60095,Marge,"well, hello pierce!"
62952,Marge,i always say that.
61110,Marge,"stop it, homer, that's inhumane! use the choke chain!"
62070,Marge,of course. everyone should do whatever they want. take a bear to church! read a book with your feet! change your name to gooble-glop!
56346,Marge,"oh, wait, wait, that's no good. i know, your grandfather."
57172,Marge,"...i've already altered this so many times, it's nearly impossible to..."
62487,Marge,"i'm so glad we came to paradise pier. ever since i was a little girl, i've wanted to ride that ferris wheel!"
62129,Marge,"don't you think you've had enough ""fun?"""
60567,Marge,"i like ""little dot."" could you rip that off? i mean, who's gonna know?"
65216,Marge,i've got to save him!
65979,Marge,don't stand up!
57598,Marge,"okay, but when you start getting apple-cheeked, it's time to come in."
67333,Marge,i can't tell you how chagrinned we are about all of this.
61984,Marge,"i know, i used to think of moe as a scabby, dead-eyed hunchback. but now that i've gotten to know him, we kind of bonded."
56155,Marge,fine.
56977,Marge,"kids, it's time we told you the true story and put your fears to rest. it's a story of murder and revenge from beyond the grave."
60995,Marge,"lisa, springfield isn't a cultural wasteland. part of ""stroker ace"" was filmed at our airport. and, um, oh! there's our ladies' book club. sara, you're more than welcome to come."
65685,Marge,"see, see what i'm dealing with here, ned? we invited them here, and they repay us with insults and judgments."
55913,Marge,"homer, we have a perfectly good bookcase."
63417,Marge,"""school bus..."" ""bart and lisa?"" bart and lisa are almost home from school! and we have a dentist's appointment at three o'clock! thanks, maggie!"
66541,Marge,i don't know! i invited everyone that lisa's ever met.
56672,Marge,you are?
64487,Marge,"what's up, seymour?"
61700,Marge,"no, it was clearly you in that suit. you'd have to be an idiot not to see it from the start."
65438,Marge,now you be careful with bart's undies.
62434,Marge,"homer, don't touch her! you've never had chicken pox."
56514,Marge,this isn't very erotic. i think it's an actual utility room.
67141,Marge,never you mind.
66271,Marge,"it's not mistletoe, just cherries and lettuce!"
60781,Marge,"wow, it's so fancy. it's like moby's house on ""cribs""!"
61521,Marge,good. can you play with him for half an hour?
67228,Marge,why you big...
55466,Marge,"homer, please. don't make me choose between my man and my god, because you just can't win."
55117,Marge,"oh bart, you could use some new underwear too."
61127,Marge,"well from now on, you need to get a cell phone so i can reach you."
57708,Marge,just stand still and i'll get someone!
63025,Marge,"homer, your butt just gave me a brilliant idea!"
61375,Marge,"they say ""yes no two forty-two"". and it's the night before the election and you haven't handed them out!"
61515,Marge,"you took little children to ""the re-deadening""?!"
67459,Marge,"homer, i couldn't help overhearing you warp bart's mind."
62696,Marge,"okay, game over -- it's a tie!"
65968,Marge,thatta boy.
64276,Marge,and on the very top floor was a daycare center...
67730,Marge,"yeah, right."
64699,Marge,well you can take another -- in forty years!
62167,Marge,"let's see. there's ""equus"" starring sideshow mel... ""the three dollar bills in 'gay, gay, gay!'""... ooh, ""song of shelbyville""!"
56337,Marge,thank goodness i drove down an ironic street.
64183,Marge,i can't wait to tell everyone!
64607,Marge,"well, can you explain what you were doing in the basement with milhouse?"
62168,Marge,this is the worst crisis the springfield cultural activities board has ever faced.
64886,Marge,you have a magic wand?
64435,Marge,time to try out my new deep fryer.
57661,Marge,not really. they just had corn on them. kitchen -- corn.
67486,Marge,lisa! my goodness! that's very impressive!
66569,Marge,yes. and i can tell how hard it was to lose your father. but at least you were there to share his final thoughts.
65079,Marge,"homer, thanks to your unlicensed barbery, patty and selma have been getting compliments all day at the dmv."
58601,Marge,this is such a secluded area. i wonder who lives in that house?
56187,Marge,you know we should really stop hiring him.
60551,Marge,hello?
61996,Marge,"moe, your upper lip is trembling."
55062,Marge,i heard a noise outside and thought it might be homer.
57533,Marge,more sausage?
61603,Marge,"we're having ""make your own taco"" night."
59016,Marge,to who?
67302,Marge,yeah.
57393,Marge,you know how i feel about hoaxes!
62243,Marge,"wait, there's still one last thing that doesn't make sense. why did you start fixing our roof and then just disappear?"
58453,Marge,"oh, this is so naughty. coming back to our old love nest..."
59689,Marge,"here's a headline for jay. ""ketchup truck hits hamburger stand."""
57578,Marge,"dinner's in the oven. if you want some butter, it's under my face."
56378,Marge,we'd better find a motel and stop for the night.
56740,Marge,but she's not our dog.
56942,Marge,where we going? where we going?
57437,Marge,"homer, is this the way you pictured married life?"
60129,Marge,don't be mad at homer. i was the one who cut the rope.
59322,Marge,you guys never use any of this stuff.
65624,Marge,you never looked up to him.
58733,Marge,"oooh, how about paint-by-numbers?"
56314,Marge,i got a very thoughtless birthday present from someone who shall remain nameless.
54846,Marge,"i don't know, i thought maybe bikes weren't cool anymore. do kids still use that word, ""cool""?"
58238,Marge,close enough.
64343,Marge,let us in. we have the chosen one!
57404,Marge,"and if anything happens, just use your best judgm... just do what i would do."
63316,Marge,who cares? i'm dead.
57155,Marge,"i've told you, i don't like you using the word hotbed. please, lisa, we so rarely get to do things like this. and everybody -- everybody, please -- be on your best behavior. bart, no grifting."
67769,Marge,not to me.
63951,Marge,"homer, those are our wedding bungees!"
55993,Marge,"beautiful, huh? homer and i used to come up here on dates."
57472,Marge,it's the most perfect wedding i could ever ask for. you even got a hip rock 'n' roll combo.
65806,Marge,i'm afraid so.
57739,Marge,a frying pan radio. wow!
64804,Marge,"but it's not good enough, is it?"
67253,Marge,"bart, how would you like to spend the next three months living in france?"
66579,Marge,"here's what i would do... in the middle of the night, clean bart's room for him, then in the morning thank him for cleaning his room."
66771,Marge,"homer, please! that's creeping me out!"
64187,Marge,try these beets. i boiled all the red out.
66423,Marge,kirk and luann didn't know what the painting was worth when they sold it.
59602,Marge,oh... i was just praying to god that you'll find me sane.
55660,Marge,bart! don't write on the rug!
63435,Marge,where's the hammer?!
57590,Marge,"oh, homer, i know you were trying to shield me from failure, but this is my business, and the mafia's not getting one cent of my money!"
58722,Marge,"i'm tired of that show. but i've been hearing good things about ""talk to the hand."" tom shales says the writing ""snaps, crackles and pops."""
62341,Marge,"well, i'm gonna show bart that protestants can be hip too. how do you like those croutons?"
58978,Marge,is everything okay? i got worried when i didn't hear any shots.
62609,Marge,get him outta here!
61415,Marge,"ned, that's so considerate."
54936,Marge,"did you hear that, homer?"
65185,Marge,"oh this, it's just a little zelzel minchet aletcha wat. it's all i ever eat here."
65687,Marge,"c'mere, little buddy."
58529,Marge,that's your underwear.
61055,Marge,"homie, what's wrong?"
66311,Marge,apparently including tying the knots on the hammock.
59591,Marge,why would i do that?
63163,Marge,"i don't care how successful gil is, he's still a mooch, and i need to tell him off!"
60082,Marge,morning!
55385,Marge,"oh, that's wonderful."
56322,Marge,sure.
67692,Marge,hello.
63801,Marge,"ooo, ""regularsville."" sounds like my kind of place!"
67890,Marge,i can't make that man beautiful. i'm just not good enough. i guess i'm no artist.
58742,Marge,"well, we'll just see. murray hill 5-9232..."
59366,Marge,"i can't help it if i donated the most blood. oh, i'm feeling kinda woozy."
61037,Marge,"well, if you don't know the right path to take, you have to be very quiet and listen for that little voice inside that tells you what to do."
56297,Marge,"this romance is so full of heartfelt passion. i can really identify with this corn-fed heroine. homer. are you awake? this is important, give me some sign you're awake."
60774,Marge,"wait, wait! my son, my husband and the van houten boy are in there!"
59354,Marge,"there's a homecoming parade, a cocktail party..."
60823,Marge,"ooh, these turtles know just where the knots are. it just shows you god has a plan for every creature."
63896,Marge,"hmmm, all the groceries seem to have been balled up in anger."
63303,Marge,okay... activate my level seven power stones... wield the orb of oblivion... and zap!
64660,Marge,bart?!
67859,Marge,"i think it's a very nice idea. don't you, homer?"
63660,Marge,"bart, i know this is nuts, but try to look sad."
57805,Marge,donny!
65627,Marge,"so, this was after homer's mother left?"
56095,Marge,just a minute! don't hang up!
56019,Marge,"homer, this is terrible!"
60942,Marge,"see, i don't know that he is. in the bible he's always smiting and turning people into salt."
62484,Marge,my spine is not a scratching post!
63713,Marge,it's your new diet!
63219,Marge,"i just found this note in bart's room! ""dear mom and dad: me and my girlfriend darcy have gone to utah to get married. f.y.i., she's pregnant""!"
60391,Marge,"anti-trust suit... anti-trust suit... a note from marge simpson? well, isn't that a coincidence? i was just thinking about her..."
61386,Marge,it's the only way to talk to bullies.
66432,Marge,"luann, i hope we're still on thursday for collecting used cellphones for the troops."
65584,Marge,"...but we aren't making a baby. i thought we should check, to make sure homer has... you know, working stunt-men in his cannon."
63712,Marge,jeez louise. are you okay?
61772,Marge,marge!
55893,Marge,hmm. this one's done in different handwriting.
61734,Marge,"oh, you children are too suspicious. it's go time."
63264,Marge,now we have nothing to worry about in the event of a fire except our lives.
56646,Marge,i'll just have a cup of coffee.
56176,Marge,"bart, this isn't the kind of thing i normally would think was a good idea, but you wouldn't have to live with mr. burns, you'd just get all of his money someday. this could provide for your entire future."
65918,Marge,why would you think i'd like this?
66650,Marge,i don't understand you.
66399,Marge,are you wearing sock garters?
66185,Marge,ooh!
65528,Marge,"so, this is basically what we can afford."
58856,Marge,i'm almost done. and tell bart to get out of my purse.
59659,Marge,"geez, so many dolphins..."
66268,Marge,why did i do this for money? why did i do this for money?
55167,Marge,"hello, room service? this is marge simpson. i'd like a hot fudge sundae. with whipped cream. and some chocolate chip cheesecake. and a bottle of tequila."
55957,Marge,marge simpson.
64090,Marge,give me my baby back!
64746,Marge,"lisa, can't you let your brother back on the team? fly balls and fungoes come and go, but family is forever."
55867,Marge,will you excuse me while i go and freshen up?
62229,Marge,"i'm so sick of hearing about that stupid, unreliable ray! who, by the way, i've never even met!"
67637,Marge,my woman's intuition is telling me something... i wonder what... oh my god.
62606,Marge,that's sideshow bob!
59795,Marge,"well, look at that painting."
55768,Marge,hello.
61643,Marge,the sweet love story that is older than the sea...
67286,Marge,"hmmm, very... thorough."
54861,Marge,"bart, how many hours a day do you watch tv?"
67624,Marge,"...but, well, i guess he did miss three days of school --"
67734,Marge,my prom date.
58758,Marge,and what about the tattoo on my you-know-what?
60292,Marge,i never agreed to that rule!
58272,Marge,here's $42 -- it's everything i have. run home and bury it in the yard.
66054,Marge,i'm a fan of animation.
64536,Marge,there's no such thing as prayer blocks!
59744,Marge,"could you cut it out, you two? mommy needs some quiet right now."
57833,Marge,bart!
56659,Marge,"i'm glad you're okay honey, but i wish you'd chosen a more tasteful way to be patriotic."
65492,Marge,"enough with the voting. ned, edna, why didn't you tell us?"
66137,Marge,"do you know what we're doing on sunday? brunch with the hibberts, then the tile store! he's like a husband in a widow's memory -- perfect!"
67355,Marge,"hello, homie. how's my big important executive?"
56737,Marge,"""she's the fastest..."" homer, i don't think that means necessarily..."
55709,Marge,how fast are they going?
65700,Marge,and he didn't pee on the floor!
55956,Marge,"well, i do have a life outside this house, you know."
54903,Marge,yes.
55609,Marge,i can't believe you bought that plow. we can't afford it.
67545,Marge,"well, i've never changed the world before, so i don't know how long it takes exactly. but if enough people take an interest..."
62311,Marge,"c'mon. you tell him right now. ned, homer has something to tell you."
58364,Marge,go! go! go!
66710,Marge,my biggest sin is that i dare to hope.
62654,Marge,"oh. chief wiggum. uh, are you still with the police department?"
59731,Marge,you don't know what i'm missing.
58346,Marge,no!
56169,Marge,oh my lord!
64726,Marge,"hey, my husband makes good money, and we can certainly afford..."
65557,Marge,are you going to fix the faucet or not?
66043,Marge,wish i could get a little of that attention.
55628,Marge,then the prince and the princess got married and lived happily ever after.
56142,Marge,are you planning to hit ned flanders with that pipe and take his tickets?
61874,Marge,that's how we got our kaypro!
61730,Marge,but now it can have a second meaning.
57435,Marge,i know it's not! i'm going into the dining room to have a conversation. anyone who wants to join me is welcome.
62924,Marge,"don't worry lisa, i've got the answer to your problems right here."
63741,Marge,boring!
61689,Marge,"ooh, i'll bet he's ned flanders."
57100,Marge,"you can't hide from me in this house, bart! i spend 23 hours a day here!"
60558,Marge,"homie, you don't need drugs anymore. your eyes are all better."
60549,Marge,"homer, you're doing drugs!"
67345,Marge,"there, there, bart. you're just a late bloomer."
60038,Marge,"boy, this sure was one crazy day...right, mr. teeny?"
62796,Marge,"finally, we shall bid goodbye to england and its drunken, decadent sinners."
59594,Marge,do i have to be dead before you'll help me?
55851,Marge,"bart, i'd like you to read this copy of ""johnny tremain."" it's a book i read as a girl."
60381,Marge,please. we went out once.
63179,Marge,much better.
60998,Marge,"i'm very happy for you, ned."
58828,Marge,"just when i think i have you figured out, you fall from the sky with roses."
55136,Marge,that's enough!
61123,Marge,my husband has our card...
60389,Marge,congratulations on your recent tv appearance.
63438,Marge,we have to take in mr. brockman -- he wouldn't be in this mess if you hadn't dumped coffee on his lap.
61876,Marge,"well, maybe not. but you did a great job on the lawn."
58148,Marge,unless...
67914,Marge,"yes, she is. and who are you?"
64424,Marge,"oh, barty, i'm sorry. but your father and i think that three kids is just perfect."
64777,Marge,dear god. we just killed a man.
63317,Marge,wait'll i tell the other moms you gave two-thirds of your life force to save me. what a good boy.
61693,Marge,"that was so exciting, yet familiar. like coke with lemon."
57432,Marge,you're talking about a trough! we're not going to eat from a trough! and another thing -- it's only 5:15. why are you in your underwear?
57862,Marge,"wake up, everyone. we're almost there."
63819,Marge,i'd stay away from poodles. they give the dog... ideas.
61067,Marge,well this morning isn't a barrel of laughs.
67549,Marge,i've started a crusade against cartoon violence.
59672,Marge,homer...
60599,Marge,they miss their father. are you sure you don't want to take him back?
66959,Marge,shhh!
66843,Marge,homie! are you dressed? you have soccer setup in twenty minutes! homie?!
60973,Marge,"oh, our little girl's got her own cheering section!"
63160,Marge,i'll tell you what. we're going to scottsdale!
60552,Marge,"honey, i like it when you call, but we just talked five minutes ago. hang on, i've got call waiting."
60850,Marge,"oh, i can't stop worrying about homer and lisa."
59273,Marge,"okay, daddy-o."
55990,Marge,no. i couldn't.
63467,Marge,"oh homer, you've gotta try this roast beef au jus."
66336,Marge,thank you.
58229,Marge,"i'm leaving this place, and you'd better step aside!"
56556,Marge,you see.
66325,Marge,here's your breakfast.
62147,Marge,"well, you're not perfect either!"
63342,Marge,we should stop now.
64087,Marge,"oooo, jazz!"
55863,Marge,mr. hutz --
57056,Marge,bart! stop pestering satan!
59627,Marge,"hey, you've been riding me all day. why don't you poop in your hat?"
66251,Marge,"this has gone far enough. i'm starting to think this ""school project"" is more than meets the eye."
55483,Marge,who's watching the kwik-e-mart?
61602,Marge,"oh bart, my troubled little lamb. you'll be in jail for so long. but i'll keep your room just the way it was: a pigsty."
57942,Marge,what's going on down there? what's all this mist?
61841,Marge,"b.f.d. i've had your scrambled eggs, homer. the secret ingredient is whiskey."
63085,Marge,"i just wish i could do something to be remembered by... something that says ""marge was here!"" after i'm gone."
62313,Marge,"well, homer, you've driven away the best neighbor a family could ever want. but at least we have a chance to start fresh -- so let's be on our best behavior, okay?"
63679,Marge,but it comes from a true place...
66469,Marge,not fake attentive. real attentive.
65287,Marge,"homie, you can win this argument! just rant and rave like you do to the tv during sports!"
58090,Marge,that's dilapidated.
66260,Marge,these are our new boarders!
67272,Marge,"everyone here in the united states is fine. we think maggie may say her first word any day now. lisa got an a in math, which i'm only mentioning as news -- i'm not putting you down. and your father, well... last night he went to sleep talking about how much he loves you."
57370,Marge,somebody stop the fight! where's the doctor?!
63308,Marge,i should get some sleep...
59059,Marge,we were saving that money for our family vacation. now we're gonna have to start all over again.
56754,Marge,"all right, we'll give the dogs one more chance. as long as the puppies don't do anything else wrong, they stay. on a completely unrelated topic, i'm having a very, very important dinner party tonight."
56320,Marge,jacques.
60060,Marge,i can't believe it. we won another contest!
56620,Marge,there's a stuffed pepper in the trash from last night. just rinse it good...
58865,Marge,"oh, for crying out loud... i--"
58396,Marge,"""in case of accidental ingestion, consult a mortician."" oh my goodness!"
60127,Marge,i'm sleeping in the bathtub.
58761,Marge,when did you start liking thai food?
64372,Marge,no!
58282,Marge,"mm, if you'd just apologize to louie, you could get your hair cut the way you want."
54674,Marge,"this is all your fault, homer, for wanting somebody new!"
62656,Marge,"sweetie, if someone's bullying you, you should tell your teacher."
66316,Marge,what did i say about pointing out the meaninglessness of things?
63455,Marge,"now you listen here, bub. we paid you all the savings we had in the world. you could at least tell my husband something encouraging."
60560,Marge,why are you keeping that thing?
55376,Marge,"homie, you do remember your promise to the children?"
56025,Marge,no. i'm fine. i'm going to my sisters' now.
65561,Marge,but my car is down there!
57062,Marge,all aboard the sleepy train / to visit mother goose / barty's stop is snoozy lane / to rest his sweet caboose.
59885,Marge,"oh, homey, i'm sorry i hurt your feelings."
55402,Marge,love...
62255,Marge,it's graffiti you can eatie!
62334,Marge,first communion?!
57800,Marge,"reverend, i gave ned flanders some bad advice. now he could be in real trouble."
55703,Marge,nothing incriminating.
56713,Marge,"well, jay, i hope you tell your new york friends that people in small towns aren't quite as dumb as they think."
67291,Marge,now just a darn...
61020,Marge,"krusty, we're desperate here. we need you to turn your campaign around."
55213,Marge,"oh, dear."
61216,Marge,"i don't think maggie wants you out of her life, moe."
64961,Marge,what kind of card?
61268,Marge,"oh, look at all these classy british plays."
58339,Marge,"oh, let your brother do sports."
64182,Marge,it is a sauna in here. must've been put in by a previous owner. this house is full of surprises. but this is the first good one.
64199,Marge,"excuse me, i'm feeling a little... over-hydrated."
66326,Marge,"well, i'm not happy with you."
65692,Marge,milhouse?!
56779,Marge,ok. who was george washington carver?
58460,Marge,but think of the scandal.
65719,Marge,survive what?
63493,Marge,"goodnight, teddy bear. goodnight, justin timberwolf. goodnight, bedtime krusty."
60059,Marge,the teamsters said they'd pick it up by five.
62872,Marge,why can i remember everyone in town except my husband?
63068,Marge,"hustle your bustles, gang! we're going to the senior olympics to root for grampa!"
59715,Marge,what's going on?
55963,Marge,you promised. you can't back out like when you volunteered for that army experiment to avoid dinner at my sisters'.
56242,Marge,today at the kwik-e-mart everybody knew i dyed my hair.
61478,Marge,homer!
62244,Marge,that's right -- you're all crooks!
57898,Marge,and you knew where you were then...
56373,Marge,"well, there was our trip to the amish country..."
64156,Marge,you're supposed to be spending time with your daughter.
58781,Marge,i don't want to be chesty larue or busty st. claire!
61627,Marge,"they're all too old to be dressed up like super-people. homer, let's just hurry up and go home so i can yell at you."
63063,Marge,"hello, helen? i'm calling about the recent destruction of our town. well, i have a little plan to fix their wagon."
55835,Marge,"hello, principal dondelinger."
63912,Marge,"bart, honey, i saw you didn't like your dinner, so i thought you might like pepperoni pizza with the crust cut off."
64180,Marge,huh? a mysterious door!
55265,Marge,"that spot says ""compact only""."
61277,Marge,"homer, you couldn't be in more trouble. they're going to put your head on a pike. they're practicing with melons."
64813,Marge,would it be so bad to turn out like me?
65160,Marge,you kids have had a big day. head up to the tub while i deflate your toys.
64623,Marge,"oooh, he sounds just like paddington bear!"
60892,Marge,i'm stronger than i've ever been! i don't have to go back inside. i'm not afraid!
61437,Marge,it was only my imagination.
64017,Marge,just go!
67255,Marge,"mmm-hmm. well, bart seems very enthusiastic about the idea."
64929,Marge,"i remember why i left this group seven years ago, and it's why i'm leaving now! good day, ladies."
67335,Marge,oh my goodness.
63079,Marge,that's so wasteful.
61266,Marge,do you understand any part of what you just said?
57555,Marge,"hello, helen."
59252,Marge,how ingenious. the forks are made out of lego.
61909,Marge,did you just swallow another bone?
66877,Marge,"yeah, so, uh, i'm going out to rehearse... the revue."
57118,Marge,i can't believe otto picked up a 7-10 split. he's phenomenal!
66173,Marge,feels like this play date's gone on forever.
61247,Marge,"you're like geraldine ferraro, except you won, where she failed miserably."
57340,Marge,homer! you're trying to talk us into moving to this place.
67142,Marge,thirteen. double a.
64434,Marge,maybe you're not really mad at grampa. maybe you're mad at yourself for taking him for granted all these years.
58311,Marge,i scheduled a play date.
62390,Marge,and i always will.
58447,Marge,"heyyy, look at that."
63520,Marge,"well, i guess he told me not to worry."
55308,Marge,bart!
64582,Marge,no thanks.
63672,Marge,"homie, this is your party!"
64431,Marge,"grampa, no stories! you can come with us, or sit here on the shark bench."
55079,Marge,"homer, i'm not pregnant."
56343,Marge,"lisa, not all romances turn out that way. bart, do you have a love story that doesn't end in heartbreak?"
59483,Marge,"homie, for god's sakes, it's two a.m."
59650,Marge,do you have to talk like that?
56939,Marge,"the only thing i'm high on is love. love for my son and daughters. yes, a little ""l.s.d."" is all i need."
57632,Marge,"oh, thank you."
57604,Marge,"all right, kids. we'll meet you at the top. just be careful!"
57021,Marge,let's find out.
56440,Marge,no. he looks like something might be disturbing him.
54729,Marge,oh! they're here! how does everything look?
59342,Marge,"leg? oh, oh, that. it's pretty great. how are things at home?"
61154,Marge,wha...?!
61071,Marge,"yes, homie?"
58537,Marge,killer? why did he call you killer?
57965,Marge,"oh my god, homer! they're right next door!"
62286,Marge,okay then. let's get the rest of this hair back in the freezer.
57652,Marge,"oh, then i guess this is goodbye, roy. maybe we'll see you in a few years..."
64502,Marge,"i'm not horny, i'm mad."
64672,Marge,"you have to admit, ""bart simpson will die"" was kind of open to interpretation."
67484,Marge,"dinner! dinner time, everybody! dinner!"
61081,Marge,"homie, what are you thinking?"
61863,Marge,"here, take this. my daughter didn't want the lunch i made."
58770,Marge,"eh, maybe later."
56866,Marge,"well, i am just shocked by this whole family. whatever happened to good old-fashioned town pride?"
61169,Marge,they had to admit homosexuals.
60094,Marge,"all right, but i'm doing this because he was remington steele. he was remington steele, wasn't he?"
55396,Marge,i'm auditioning for a play.
64169,Marge,"she's beautiful, moe."
66941,Marge,"yes, something to share our love --"
55524,Marge,now this is exactly what bart's teacher was talking about. our son did something wrong and you look the other way.
64080,Marge,"goodnight, bart."
61771,Marge,that sounds like maggie. but she's right here...
63366,Marge,"just come back alive, okay?"
67384,Marge,"i don't care what i said. this family has had its differences, and we've squabbled, but we never had knife fights before... and i blame this house."
67048,Marge,i'm upset about lisa.
57253,Marge,"aw, aw, there, there, oh, maggie... there..."
62143,Marge,i know another place you can go -- to sleep!
62794,Marge,"hurry, my little puritans -- we must flee england and its insufficiently puritanical ways."
64306,Marge,i'm marge simpson and i will not rest until you tear down this septagon!
64130,Marge,"okay, i want white roses at the altar, red roses along the aisle, and blue roses in the centerpieces."
55570,Marge,"oh, and how about piping in some tom jones music? that always cheers me up."
66500,Marge,it's only natural to miss a man you buried a hundred and twenty-seven times.
61706,Marge,"homer, that girl was me!"
58652,Marge,lisa broke her own record -- by two whole plusses!
59807,Marge,that's depressing.
64137,Marge,bridezilla? a combination of bride and godzilla? how could you say that? more like you're a... king wrong!
59102,Marge,shh!
55018,Marge,"well, i have the same nausea and craving for pancake mix i did with the other kids."
64528,Marge,yup. one-oh-three on the dot. you're stayin' home.
61607,Marge,i'm gonna sleep on the couch.
60514,Marge,that's it. we're just going to have to pay for that call to brazil.
63547,Marge,perfect!
65243,Marge,luann?
64497,Marge,"well, homer's my soul mate! and you don't dump a soul mate!"
55601,Marge,are you sure...?
56059,Marge,"your lifelong dream was to be a contestant on ""the gong show."" and you did it in 1977, remember?"
65594,Marge,i think that shiva used to be paul bunyan.
67904,Marge,sure.
55698,Marge,no.
65934,Marge,"everyone, please! calm down! reverend lovejoy is here!"
55482,Marge,oh grampa!
67580,Marge,yes?
59382,Marge,all i'm saying is don't get too comfortable. mr. burns will be back tomorrow.
65071,Marge,"oh, my poor homie."
57559,Marge,look at them. they've jumped on the one franchise i might possibly have considered thinking about becoming interested in. i'm not cut out for the world of business.
63327,Marge,was there even a baseball game yesterday? i don't remember!
66420,Marge,we should have it appraised!
65701,Marge,focus!
67078,Marge,the boys certainly are taking a long time. i hope maggie isn't slowing them up too much.
59616,Marge,"oh, i've got too much to do to take a nap right now. lisa, get maggie out of that cage. and homer, since you're dressed for it, i got some s & m for ya: scrubbing and mopping."
64011,Marge,"oh hiya, martin! how's the model u.n.?"
56054,Marge,"actually, i think it might really help our economy."
66818,Marge,oh lord.
59487,Marge,"oh, honey, don't panic. if you just made a few lifestyle changes..."
60976,Marge,"okay, champ. i before e, except after c."
57285,Marge,now this i like.
56546,Marge,they do so!
61872,Marge,"nelson, how'd you like to earn some extra money around our house? i have some odd jobs my kids won't do."
65770,Marge,"maybe we should just give up for now, have some fried clams and collect sea glass."
63314,Marge,how could you kill your own mother?
62025,Marge,"ned, there's more to the bible than blood and gore."
62968,Marge,carpool!
58154,Marge,we still have each other. and isn't that the best gift of all?
59090,Marge,"well, that shut me up."
64002,Marge,homer!
65306,Marge,"actually, we just came to do some shopping... as a family."
61564,Marge,isn't that a little big?
62420,Marge,the cemetery? and you're just sitting here?
59435,Marge,i just don't think it's funny!
61973,Marge,quit playing dumb.
65536,Marge,"okay, that's it! i'm putting a baby-gate across the black hole, and don't throw anything more into it! uh-oh, yes, homer."
62327,Marge,"well, homer and bart are well, they're under the weather."
58157,Marge,i'm over here!
64095,Marge,i'm sorry. but i know god would never ask a mother to sacrifice her child for the good of the world... again.
65327,Marge,"it's okay, homie. go. have a good time. take bart with you!"
63081,Marge,all those women are so impressive.
62300,Marge,but we don't have a sitter for maggie.
65482,Marge,head injury?! why didn't you tell me?
67085,Marge,is this going to be on tv?
66357,Marge,lisa!
60993,Marge,"ms. sloane, i loved you in ""sleeping with pinocchio"" and ""honey, i scotchguarded the kids""."
57145,Marge,"alright, i will buy it. it'll be good for the economy."
59963,Marge,"that's quite an act to follow, lisa."
63042,Marge,"as for you, young man: the next time you save your principal, try not to risk your own life."
65704,Marge,just hug already!
59966,Marge,so that's where that went.
60303,Marge,"i want you to stop putting so much sugar in everything, or at least warn people that it's so unhealthy."
56047,Marge,still no help.
56628,Marge,"get in the shelter, homer."
65069,Marge,"well, you married someone whose first name is ""fat""!"
60674,Marge,i've got a whole list of things for you to do today.
55895,Marge,"... some ice cream at the store, since i'm saving so much money on diet cola."
59601,Marge,it was healthy. he reciprocated. he reciprocated!
66272,Marge,i've opened up my house to you. and all you do is fill this joyous season with petty complaints.
61526,Marge,we had one date. and you were not a gentleman.
60806,Marge,almost done.
57000,Marge,con: you're running the air conditioner non-stop. it's freezing in here.
58511,Marge,i'd buy one.
59408,Marge,furious d?
64242,Marge,every eligible bachelor in europe wanted her hand in marriage.
64067,Marge,genie.
64241,Marge,queen elizabeth ruled over all of england.
56968,Marge,"tell him yourself. you're ignoring lisa, not bart."
62498,Marge,i'd love to! i'll be right... wait... are you sure you're not just trying to get me to make pizza for breakfast?
65573,Marge,"...the wipers wipe backwards, and the defroster lines on the back window are too close together! excuse me."
59984,Marge,this song has been going on for hours.
66509,Marge,"cheesesteak, a little advice from a mother of three: they'll turn out the same whether you gallop or trot."
67597,Marge,hmmm... yes and no.
57941,Marge,"homer, no!"
58998,Marge,oh lord. what now?
55096,Marge,"bart? honey, i made you an extra-warm sweater you can wear while you're down in the well."
55946,Marge,well... homer ate the entire wedding cake by himself... before the wedding.
56748,Marge,"oh, my. i've never seen anything like this."
56982,Marge,"do you see towels? if you see towels, you're probably in the linen closet again."
62821,Marge,"oh, homie, you did it!"
57766,Marge,the dump?
60569,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
65894,Marge,can you chew with your mouth closed? it's like looking into a garbage disposal.
63521,Marge,"where are you, homie?"
62122,Marge,"oh, we're just saving for... a very rainy day."
65208,Marge,uhh... yes! yes! east oak street. that's where you should go. see ya there!
58218,Marge,you bought four of them. thank god the check bounced.
54895,Marge,you be good.
56795,Marge,"homer, he cheated you."
64383,Marge,nuzzle... neck. with pleasure!
56972,Marge,"homer! just give him the donut. once he has it, that will be the end of all this horror."
60076,Marge,would you like to come sightseeing with us?
61102,Marge,"you, homie."
62956,Marge,"crossed arms mean ""no."""
60584,Marge,"no, no, no, let's just keep playing. what's the score?"
59710,Marge,"homie, where did you get that ball of money?"
62248,Marge,"oh, fine."
65247,Marge,and maybe when we get home we can ride down something else.
64230,Marge,without me?
56657,Marge,he wants to talk to you.
57991,Marge,come down here.
58228,Marge,"no-o-o-o-o-o-o!!! all righty, time for bed."
61101,Marge,"lisa, welcome to love. it's full of doubt and pain and uncertainty. but then one day you find a man you love so much it hurts."
66443,Marge,that picture has brought out the worst in everyone! please... just let it go!
61398,Marge,i'm writing a novel!
65817,Marge,"homie, help me find them."
65455,Marge,you'll never guess how many bath towels they gave us... enough!
67436,Marge,"look, it's tony bennett!"
57684,Marge,someone should really go up there and talk to him.
60966,Marge,"well, that's great, honey."
63289,Marge,it's our house! but what's that thing?
65781,Marge,oh god! they want to steal our kids!
61462,Marge,"well, i'm sure he'll be happy you came."
55408,Marge,"i'm marge simpson, i'll be playing blanche. i made some peanut butter brownies for everyone."
58382,Marge,and your shirt!
62589,Marge,"gee, i wish we could explore a little more of italy."
67540,Marge,... but i believe that the cartoons you show to our children are influencing their behavior in a negative way...
67332,Marge,how come all the lights are on?
58345,Marge,you already have a monkey.
56230,Marge,what about abe simpson? don't you have any feelings for him?
54834,Marge,"oh, homie."
65124,Marge,"well, if anyone saves my homie's life, they get a free meal. which actually comes up about once a week."
63638,Marge,whoa! those buns are poppin' fresh!
67147,Marge,i'm awfully sorry.
57076,Marge,uh-oh. almost forgot to lock the doors.
67378,Marge,"children, get your coats. we're leaving this house right now."
64610,Marge,homer? you have visitors.
61018,Marge,don't you see? he's pointing out how sexist men can be.
59526,Marge,we need something quick. my husband's eyes are really shot.
60770,Marge,"kiki, i'm tired of trade show modeling. my back really hurts."
58212,Marge,there must be a way to outsmart them.
67027,Marge,"well, bart, i hope you're going straight to the principal about this."
54963,Marge,"no, bart. no one's going to make her. this is something lisa has to decide for herself."
54778,Marge,"for months, i worked and worked, while my sisters smoked and smoked..."
58101,Marge,"but small. really, really small."
67607,Marge,"is he well enough for me to start mothering him unbearably, doctor?"
58353,Marge,"happy love day, everyone!"
63927,Marge,you haven't said you're sorry.
61225,Marge,"lisa, that's a filthy habit."
67262,Marge,"well, now that that's settled, i'll just clear the dishes."
65808,Marge,i wish i knew what happened...
58549,Marge,how's this for later?!
63703,Marge,"so that's the end of the story, huh?"
66535,Marge,"it's okay. i mean, those people didn't even want us at that party in the first place. i think it's time we learned to live with being ostracized."
63193,Marge,"i say ""cool waves."""
60469,Marge,grampa's here to get his driver's license.
55626,Marge,"well, this story begins in this unforgettable spring of 1983: ms. pac-man struck a blow for women's rights... a young joe piscopo taught us how to laugh. before lisa was born, we lived in a tiny apartment on the lower east side of springfield."
63367,Marge,"oooh, leather arms! people just give you this stuff?"
67874,Marge,i don't think that will be a problem.
54827,Marge,"homer, this is an intimate psychological profile. i can't fill this out for you."
55561,Marge,"we need the money, and my life is pretty boring. last week some jehovah's witnesses came to the door and i wouldn't let them leave. they snuck away when i went in the kitchen to get more lemonade."
64022,Marge,"don't feel bad, homie. i married you! and you're a million times better than-- here comes vance!!!"
67844,Marge,hello.
63646,Marge,"ooo, opal!"
59066,Marge,there is for a mega-savings vacation. chuck garabedian says you can fly mega-cheap if you don't care where you go.
64789,Marge,"yes, but they sold a bunch off to that frozen yogurt chain."
58648,Marge,come on! chuck him in!
62722,Marge,ned... rod needs to know you believe he can be okay on his own.
62720,Marge,"excuse me, mrs. toot, i need to talk to you mother to mother."
60218,Marge,"let's see what you have, moe."
67207,Marge,of course.
61319,Marge,what's that?
57334,Marge,move us?
65717,Marge,you can't have secrets from your wife!
60278,Marge,this is the worst thing you've ever done.
64516,Marge,"cheer up, sweetie. maybe we can find the answer in the library!"
63948,Marge,homie?
66471,Marge,"no! homer, you can't just do the things you want to do. you have to act like someone you'd want lisa to marry. if you just act like yourself, she might just... oh, you know?"
57460,Marge,you said you'd do it as a favor to me.
55797,Marge,lisa needs braces.
60499,Marge,"no, last week they became vertiqual."
63847,Marge,oh my god! this is an erotic bakery!
63982,Marge,uh-huh...
61243,Marge,deal! hit me! hit me! hit me! busted!
58866,Marge,"oh, oh, okay, calm down. just think: what would curtis e. bear do?"
59774,Marge,"well, maybe if you ate some meat you'd have a natural lubricant! you lost all our money?"
57005,Marge,i'm so proud. that's my husband wedged in that hatch.
66939,Marge,good bless him.
61916,Marge,why would homer write his name in grime?
62537,Marge,i'm singing a song with bart tonight.
61324,Marge,that last one looked kinda good.
66638,Marge,good baby.
62431,Marge,no!
56474,Marge,"homer, are all these pockets necessary?"
66752,Marge,"moe szyslak. you didn't climb down our chimney just to say ""merry christmas."""
57868,Marge,"wow, governor's island looks so insignificant from up here."
58340,Marge,"that ""mom"" stuff doesn't work on me."
54723,Marge,"homer, you are not allowed to have hurt feelings right now. there's a little girl upstairs who needs you. her confidence in her father is shaken, and no little girl can be happy unless she has faith in her daddy."
62640,Marge,"you know, your father saved every book report he ever wrote. and every one was stuart little!"
61310,Marge,they're not getting married!
63291,Marge,just put on a towel!
54911,Marge,look everybody! my purse exploded!
56016,Marge,please don't bring home anymore old crutches!
56128,Marge,pride?
55469,Marge,"yes, the lesson is..."
56640,Marge,undersecretary for international protocol. brat and punk division.
65378,Marge,"well, at least you remembered i like her."
56455,Marge,i can't even watch. i don't know how you two can sit here laughing at poor lisa while she's out there probably scared to death.
60805,Marge,no!
60402,Marge,"no way, no how! i'll get used to the snoring, just like i got used to saying ""courtney cox-arquette""."
64988,Marge,"homer, i told you he wouldn't sleep through it."
62450,Marge,get out of this house!
67939,Marge,"hi, bart! it's your mom! i'm in your videogame with you!"
57372,Marge,"oh, that's all right. we'll just wait until everyone else leaves."
59131,Marge,bart! get those oranges out of there.
65091,Marge,we've gotta get her out of there! babies aren't supposed to sleep on their stomach on a cake!
56828,Marge,i just want to relax and forget that i'm part of that thin blue line which stands between civilization and chaos .
62717,Marge,"i'm sorry, ned. i never thought this would happen."
58335,Marge,"you really had a lot of talent, kid."
64410,Marge,that runs on electricity also.
57121,Marge,homer! watch your mouth!
56835,Marge,whoa!
56166,Marge,i really think this is a bad idea.
58526,Marge,"nelson's a troubled, lonely, sad little boy. he needs to be isolated from everyone."
55554,Marge,chauffeur... seamstress...
64219,Marge,we don't need a bed. we're not gonna be sleeping.
64119,Marge,it's not a big deal. we'll just go to city hall and get married there.
56612,Marge,homer! let your father tell the story.
58672,Marge,"oh, no!"
65654,Marge,"don't call satan! so what if the message wasn't a miracle? the answer isn't in syrup from god or a computer tablet, the answer is that the hope you felt was real."
65321,Marge,no tv on a smart phone!
61492,Marge,"maggie, i can't believe how much stuff your new school sent over!"
62153,Marge,"""dear mom and dad: we don't want you guys to split up, so we're driving the rv back to the dealer."" we've got to stop them."
55711,Marge,"homer, there's a man here who thinks he can help you."
63139,Marge,really?
59310,Marge,"sorry, how long will he take to recover?"
55678,Marge,homer!
55421,Marge,i just don't see what's so bad about stanley.
62854,Marge,"ooh, i can't wait to see what kind of home we live in."
57646,Marge,i'm so glad you could join us for homer's big premiere.
57373,Marge,"thank you, moe. i know you gave up your dreams for homer."
60482,Marge,"homer, you got a letter. hm. it's from the library."
59820,Marge,i might grease the wheels of justice with some cookies.
66422,Marge,"wow, the van houtens owned this for years and never knew how much it was worth. think how happy they'll be when we sell it and split the money with them."
66540,Marge,and lisa will get a friend.
65907,Marge,"homie, what are you doing?"
67299,Marge,leave homer?
63095,Marge,you're from texas?
67818,Marge,"i didn't know then, and i don't know now."
57582,Marge,"well, here i am -- 11905 dead weasel road, but i don't see any apartment building, i just --"
58503,Marge,that's every woman's nightmare.
54932,Marge,bingo.
60044,Marge,"wow, three pairs of shoes. someone had a fetish."
58585,Marge,it all happened about two years ago...
64847,Marge,"sweetie, everyone has an animal they can't stand. indiana jones had snakes, the grizzly man had grizzlies, and... you know, i'm not crazy about opossums."
59464,Marge,"""dear countryman: you have come in search of my gold, and i will not disappoint you."""
57458,Marge,"homer, get ready!"
59289,Marge,and you still don't...
58012,Marge,"so like i said, i've never had a tick burrow in so deep. little guy's just got a mind of his own."
63749,Marge,of course -- you're lisa. lisa the dancing marge girl.
55743,Marge,"you know, i rented another tape... in case you felt better."
57279,Marge,"record stores have always seemed crazy to me, but it doesn't upset me. music is none of my business."
63097,Marge,yee-hah!
59587,Marge,it is?
66364,Marge,jasper beardley! you'll never make it!
63731,Marge,"aw marge, if there was a reality show called ""fat guys who really love their wives"", not only would it be an enormous ratings success, but i'd be the first one on it."
67713,Marge,maybe i'll wear my hair... up.
60879,Marge,twelve... fifteen... seven hundred and three...
57787,Marge,"come right this way, mel. i... tim, hold my calls."
63281,Marge,"say, rainier, you're in show business. would you mind taking a look at this screenplay i wrote?"
57947,Marge,they're like this every rainy day.
59996,Marge,even on the soles of her shoes.
64968,Marge,"sorry, but i'm fighting for my man!"
65470,Marge,"there was enough talking during the movie! this date night was even worse than the date night we saw ""date night."""
55517,Marge,i really don't see how this helps bart.
56456,Marge,"absolutely, honey. by blocking the net i really think you helped your team."
65516,Marge,"whoever this ""truth teller"" is, i'm a fan. it takes a lot of courage to post nice things anonymously."
61753,Marge,"okay, kids show off your pipes..."
66051,Marge,i just put all my personal information on their website!
55562,Marge,but... what do i do?
55610,Marge,good.
64590,Marge,bon appétit!
63665,Marge,"well, this time i think sideshow bob is finally locked up for good."
64887,Marge,i guess i'll never have a perfect christmas.
61795,Marge,i'm not wearing any clothes. so why don't i just splay myself on a pool table!
63113,Marge,don't you spit sunflower seeds at me!
58411,Marge,you mean frank grimes?
67223,Marge,bart! quit fooling around and eat your dinner.
57280,Marge,"well, good. try to include bart and lisa."
62716,Marge,"ned, are you checking up on me?"
60742,Marge,"oh my god, is that me?!"
63949,Marge,"homer simpson, you devil!"
67802,Marge,"hmmm, lisa, you don't look well."
57880,Marge,bart? why are you doing that?
60621,Marge,"...homer's family needs him too, and that's that."
60487,Marge,"oh, i can't stay mad at you."
61641,Marge,"well, i-i... let's just rent a movie."
60173,Marge,uh-oh.
58956,Marge,but he said it was forbidden.
56900,Marge,"besides, she didn't mean it. it was an accident."
64363,Marge,"i am! the female tiger woods of the nineteen-thirties, babe didrikson zaharias."
61256,Marge,which means someone lost it. you'll have to put up flyers and see if anyone claims it.
67951,Marge,the biggest change for me over the last eight years? that's gotta be homer!
58494,Marge,whatever.
56420,Marge,this is less encouraging.
66703,Marge,i'm going to go to that school and talk to that teacher.
65736,Marge,"you've been in public education a long time, haven't you?"
55621,Marge,"kit-ty? ""kit-ty""?"
57036,Marge,i feel so helpless. what if something happens to them?
63808,Marge,"sweetie, i'm usually your number one fan. but, call me old-fashioned, i usually don't like movies that humiliate my family in front of the world."
57120,Marge,bart! where do you pick up words like that?
57275,Marge,"but apu, the vote on proposition 24 is tuesday. you'll have to pass the test before then."
64036,Marge,"sweetheart, i think you'll feel better after we take a little walk..."
62945,Marge,"homer, please!"
64979,Marge,but you said going from blue to gray was empowering.
64752,Marge,you're not going to the dentist!
67563,Marge,what do we want?
65975,Marge,moe? what are you doing?
57428,Marge,uh... sorry.
61153,Marge,lousy homer... i'll show him... tonight his beloved mock apple pie will have real apples.
64635,Marge,and i can spend my mother's day taking care of something i've been putting off for a long time.
66078,Marge,"what the heck am i saying? homer's probably at that bar right now, getting hammered."
57167,Marge,"why thank you, roberta."
60009,Marge,i'm sorry! i'm so sorry!
65851,Marge,someone's coming!
58202,Marge,"hey, someone's boarded up our windows!"
63974,Marge,"okay, remember our deal: everyone gets to return one christmas present with no hurt feelings. i'm returning this kitten calendar."
65560,Marge,no one stays in the sinkhole!
64436,Marge,i don't like this -- real humor comes from people being nice to each other.
56367,Marge,"see kids, that's what i meant by romance."
63116,Marge,"bartholomew j. simpson, how can you be so mean?"
55772,Marge,no.
67749,Marge,"well, you know, bart was looking at that racy movie today, and lisa's losing a little respect for you... maybe we should think about unhooking the cable."
61632,Marge,where's that coming from?
58832,Marge,"oopsie. mm, this could take a minute."
61560,Marge,maybe we should put this booze cruise in dry dock for a while.
57310,Marge,oh... okay.
54772,Marge,"kids, could you lighten up a little?"
61205,Marge,"no, it's your turn."
58145,Marge,"oh, homer. i'm so ashamed."
63451,Marge,what was that?
62371,Marge,maybe you could just put a hat on him and say it's a trick.
67063,Marge,"oh, calm down, homer. lisa has an idea that she thinks would be fun for the whole family."
59129,Marge,"good morning, honey. how's my special little guy?"
65540,Marge,wonderful stuff! enjoy it!
64662,Marge,it's probably a de-boner.
58451,Marge,it's okay when you're in love. and married. to the sweetest guy in the world.
58598,Marge,"homer, your spine!"
67238,Marge,do it!
65355,Marge,we're not monsters. we're just people. people who love each other and love this town. the only place we've ever called home. thank you.
66279,Marge,no second verses! they creep me out.
55110,Marge,"now bart, i think you'd look very sharp in this shirt."
65874,Marge,we're here because our daughter is being bullied by your teacher.
58052,Marge,"you know, homer, i'm starting to realize life is short."
56951,Marge,"ooo, tres bien."
58235,Marge,"all right, already! but do you love the leader more than having your very own, brand new -- hoverbikes?"
56458,Marge,"don't have a stereotypical view of me just because i'm your mother. i know. how about we play the basketball? i'm no harvey globetrotter, but..."
61332,Marge,it's on batteries.
66386,Marge,"well, that's one of them!"
57666,Marge,"homer, listen carefully: john is a ho-mo--"
67418,Marge,"i'm sorry, dear. it will all be over soon."
64545,Marge,"i don't mind if you pee in the shower, but only if you're taking a shower!"
61663,Marge,yup. it's really boring. you kids would have hated it.
59116,Marge,it's true. he does.
63932,Marge,well then she can have you all to herself!
56541,Marge,thirty dollars will be fine.
66111,Marge,drama! drama!
60439,Marge,it's so clean and bland. i'm home!
67942,Marge,"if they think less of you because of me, then they're not really your minions."
59188,Marge,i don't want you looting!
59904,Marge,"where have you been, young man? it's nearly bedtime."
57988,Marge,"honey, it'll be morning soon. try and get some sleep."
64370,Marge,i've been pin-upped!
66086,Marge,is it me or did this house just get classy?
64295,Marge,"ultimate punching?! ""ultimate"" makes everything worse!"
55937,Marge,"it's an ending, that's enough."
64261,Marge,"no, it was homer!"
55405,Marge,i play an aging southern beauty who's driven to insanity by her brutish brother-in-law stanley.
67382,Marge,what's going on out here? homer! bart! lisa! maggie! stop it!
64522,Marge,"""anyway, i was very proud of eliza, but my husband hiram had not quite caught abolition fever..."""
57439,Marge,"i don't care if the sink shoots sludge, we're having a party."
56661,Marge,"i'm sorry. homer doesn't mean to be rude, he's just a very complicated man."
57779,Marge,"oh, that's ridiculous, moe. you've got lots to live for."
63566,Marge,"dwight, that was the most unselfish thing i've ever seen. i'm sorry i didn't visit you before."
62855,Marge,you strangle your child?
55025,Marge,"i think about you, too."
57756,Marge,"wow, he went from stinking rich to just plain stinking."
55985,Marge,"ooh, i've never been to an underground club."
61608,Marge,"ooo, sexy drinks, adult board games..."
59589,Marge,"why do i always think of the perfect thing to say when it's too late: ""shut up, becky!"" ooh, that would've been sweet."
54732,Marge,children! go!
63967,Marge,homie?
64552,Marge,i'm gonna go paste your heads back into the family photos. i've got them right here.
67400,Marge,"lisa, see what we mean when we say you're too smart for your own good?"
58979,Marge,"you, an artist?"
67420,Marge,"can i have your plate, mr. burns?"
54917,Marge,"oh homer, this is awful."
56617,Marge,"well, actually -"
59293,Marge,haven't any of you ever had a dream?
66718,Marge,suddenly this place doesn't seem so bad.
57837,Marge,but don't you want to end world famine?
65077,Marge,this doesn't make any sense. there was a wedding. you exchanged vows.
59816,Marge,titles are hard.
55827,Marge,an invitation to our high school reunion.
65241,Marge,i know! and i don't want him to stray from anything except his diet. and i don't really want him to do that.
56103,Marge,"i saved these for you, bart. you'll always have them to remind you of the time when you were the whole world's special little guy."
61815,Marge,"well... stuart, i'm making a dessert that looks like a hot dog, but it isn't."
59970,Marge,most of it was sent by relatives who couldn't see very well.
63100,Marge,"homer, where are you?"
63356,Marge,"maggie, i'm sorry you miss your pacifier. but when a mother makes a decision, she has to stick by it."
63909,Marge,"i made it with cheetos, just like you like it. if the sauce is too thick, i can add more root beer."
61911,Marge,"back then, we were both stars - in the thrill-a-minute world of high school journalism."
67839,Marge,"say goodbye to grampa, everyone."
57612,Marge,all right... but don't be shocked.
56108,Marge,"apu, we usually store our cans in the cupboard."
66732,Marge,you don't know what a per diem is.
55569,Marge,"hmm, actually, i was thinking of ""funny hat day."""
66675,Marge,you ate the food and looked in the mirrors! they're staying.
55729,Marge,oh. are you sure you wanna have a baby this way?
64613,Marge,my smoothie is a lumpy!
65187,Marge,"""when you stick a pancake into a friend's mouth, it's a 'goorsha.'"" everybody goorsha!"
55837,Marge,"oh my god, it's my old boyfriend, artie ziff."
67766,Marge,"homer? do you remember our last family vacation when you made us go to the bowler's hall of fame in st. louis, missouri so you could see that car shaped like a giant bowling pin?"
65684,Marge,"when you're old, your tattoos will be saggy and illegible!"
62917,Marge,"lisa, lots of times two incompatible things can both be true. my son's a brat but he's a special little guy. your father says he's at work, but there he is jumping on a trampoline."
65611,Marge,another way is don't drink.
59809,Marge,question?
67886,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?!"
61925,Marge,i'm so sick of names!
55675,Marge,"wait, this might be the answer we're looking for."
66264,Marge,where is the end?
67010,Marge,i don't know...
56975,Marge,"homer, stop looking!"
65070,Marge,which is our room again...
63574,Marge,you just can't get russian gangster blood out. must be something they eat.
62227,Marge,"how you feeling, sweetie?"
55631,Marge,"guess what, homie... there's going to be twice as much love in this house as there is now."
56992,Marge,"oh please, i would love you if you weighed 1,000 pounds but--"
59001,Marge,i think some people are going to be upset.
61346,Marge,"then how would we ever get to see ""camelot""?"
62441,Marge,"oh homie, you got chicken pox. but how?"
56271,Marge,bart...? are all these children friends of yours?
60601,Marge,"oh. well, when homer does something wrong, i write a list of ways he can make it up to me. then i shred the list and put it in his food."
56798,Marge,he's getting away!! c'mon! c'mon!
60803,Marge,"well, okay. blow out that lamp and i'll take off my victorian undergarments."
63765,Marge,...but still no sign of lurleen's dad!
58298,Marge,...and the floor was donated by american superball.
58357,Marge,kiss it and make it boogie!
58838,Marge,"well, that's a nice feature. not much headroom, though..."
56354,Marge,"well, kids, i tried. maybe you're right."
55819,Marge,of course.
66505,Marge,maggie! why'd you do that?
60134,Marge,"i don't mean to be disrespectful, judge harm, but we are not bad parents. and there isn't a tether in this world with enough fiber optics to make me say we are."
56305,Marge,how many times can you laugh at that cat getting hit by the moon?
61446,Marge,"finally, henry's daughter elizabeth became queen. england's power was never greater, and british actresses always had a role to play when they got to a certain age."
58861,Marge,this better be important.
63738,Marge,"no, i'm pretty sure you'll have your dad's boobs."
58249,Marge,oh my goodness! that was a long movie! it's time for school! let's go! let's go!
61058,Marge,"oh my god, i forgot all about this. where did you find it?"
56388,Marge,"tortureland, explosion land, searing gas pain land, unnecessary surgery land..."
54612,Marge,i sure am! i want your knowledge inside me!
58986,Marge,"no, homer, being an artist was my dream. but now, without even trying, you've accomplished more in a week than i have in my whole life."
65142,Marge,"okay handsome, that's enough primping!"
57274,Marge,"oh, homer. are you rounding up immigrants?"
59159,Marge,"oh honey, i'm so sorry we sent you on that psychotropic hayride."
59612,Marge,"oh. well, then, i guess there's a reasonable explanation for everything. except you cutting my brakes!"
65273,Marge,"people learn from their mistakes and your father made so many mistakes. and now, patty and selma are here to help us decorate with their new love-bots."
58582,Marge,"oh, that's your cure for everything."
60211,Marge,chief wiggum!
64795,Marge,"oh, i'd love to, if it's not an imposition."
63026,Marge,"a dash of glue, a turn of screw, and a gazebo's built that's perfect for two -- or more!"
56352,Marge,i give up. did anybody learn anything about love tonight?
65253,Marge,"no more tv! we're gonna get some fresh air, and visit the museum... of television."
63644,Marge,"well, maybe i could. but every time i look at you, i see the same adorable boy i fell in love with."
66728,Marge,the bass guitar? this doesn't really seem like... you.
65591,Marge,now i'm thinking alex if it's a girl and xander if it's a boy.
58188,Marge,you can't go on that. you have a heart condition.
56711,Marge,"well, homer."
63197,Marge,"no, france."
66678,Marge,what happened?
55058,Marge,"""fourth notice""... ""90 days overdue""... ""we break thumbs""... homer, what are we going to do?"
61181,Marge,"oh for god's sake, i can see why he left. now all of you, get cleaning."
58306,Marge,"well, thank you, ralph. you're such a fine young gentleman."
57588,Marge,"homer, did you tell the mafia they could eliminate my competitors with savage beatings and attempted murder?"
59728,Marge,"oh. they ought to call that a ""large island iced tea."" no, ""long"" is better."
55923,Marge,what's wrong?
66674,Marge,...so they need a place to stay. here.
64785,Marge,i can't live with the guilt.
59784,Marge,"sorry, homie, but you promised to take me to the apron expo today."
57051,Marge,go on maggie.
59976,Marge,ohhhhhhhhh.
67776,Marge,he's here.
61871,Marge,"and uh, where's your dad in all this?"
58773,Marge,i don't know. remember that new year's eve at lenny's... he didn't even have a clock!
63528,Marge,point zero eight sober.
55225,Marge,"lisa, why aren't you at band practice?"
61188,Marge,all i wanted was to glue feathers on felt and teach the boys good citizenship. and now it's a donnybrook!
62092,Marge,"go, go, go!"
67648,Marge,there's that new sushi restaurant on elm street.
55379,Marge,"it's our last family dinner for six weeks, but i promised myself i wouldn't cry."
59101,Marge,it's not boring. he's passionate about government.
62666,Marge,"wow, it glows in the dark."
63999,Marge,"great! here are a few ""best friend"" tips: compliment her hair and shoes. if her dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it... and--"
60577,Marge,okay.
62613,Marge,"merry christmas, homie. i think you're really gonna like this."
63910,Marge,maybe he's going through... certain changes.
64327,Marge,tap out! don't make me break your arm!
63606,Marge,then go to moe's!
62005,Marge,"homer, i made a vow on our wedding day, to stay by you -- for better or worse. and besides... i love you. you're my homie-womie-romie-domie..."
64214,Marge,please just stay there till bart graduates high school.
58485,Marge,"i have to, honey. or... you can stay here and we'll have our own dance. ""every simpson dance now! bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp bomp!"""
56399,Marge,"stay away from me, homer!"
65568,Marge,and what's that smell?
66953,Marge,"bart, this is a big day for you. why don't you eat something a little more nutritious?"
66994,Marge,"ohhh, homie. i think i'm going to be sick."
57817,Marge,homer...
54640,Marge,but homer's so supportive. he's paying for me to go to college.
56594,Marge,homer...
56570,Marge,lowenstein.
61542,Marge,"kids, why don't you write a complaint letter? that's how i got the channel six weather girl to start wearing a bra."
67811,Marge,"well, lisa, here it is; the bouvier family quilt."
65967,Marge,"so what do you say, moe? will you give me a smile?"
65946,Marge,"homer, your daughter doesn't want to get married."
60132,Marge,"no, i won't. and frankly, judge, i think you're a bully."
63136,Marge,i guess you don't have to leave till the holiday's over...
56402,Marge,"oh for gosh sakes, what now?"
61940,Marge,don't worry. we've got two hours before it burns down to my head.
59432,Marge,hello? is there anybody in there?
67425,Marge,"well, he's a fine role model. bart, give me that ball!"
66930,Marge,"homer, you tell me that all the time."
55641,Marge,oh dear.
55667,Marge,no there isn't.
67774,Marge,and not just any man.
64944,Marge,"well, maybe you shouldn't listen to a thirty-year-old tv show that only got on the air because the network had evidence that the president ran over a guy."
64820,Marge,are you sure? he's having a growth spurt.
55288,Marge,fine. see if i care.
64055,Marge,i worked so hard to make this house into a home. and now somebody else is just going to take it.
57911,Marge,would you like to color something?
55206,Marge,that's all right dear. i can do it.
65442,Marge,"homie, come in the bedroom."
60741,Marge,i'm worried homer might do the same thing. what would make a husband lose interest like that?
67038,Marge,homer?
62029,Marge,billions!
64519,Marge,"this one doesn't sound roadkill-y. and, it comes with a story. ""many years ago, my daughter, eliza, brought a runaway slave, virgil, to the house..."""
67341,Marge,"yes, dear?"
60293,Marge,"ow, my hairstyle!"
66709,Marge,why do i ever put you in charge of the littlest thing?
57352,Marge,i think owning the denver broncos is pretty good.
66248,Marge,don't listen to them. they're the ding dongs.
60112,Marge,kids it's eight o'clock! you're gonna miss the bus to wizard school!
61539,Marge,bart!
61541,Marge,"kids, you'd better take your last look at uncle artie."
57319,Marge,"hey, kids, there's a carnival tonight!"
66353,Marge,"homer, quit badgering the boy."
54926,Marge,he's been gone for two days.
54921,Marge,bart!
59479,Marge,"kids, the new phone books are here. and your picture's on the cover!"
62190,Marge,"oh it's so great. we can do anything now that scientists have invented magic. i'm so proud of you. lisa, graduating two years early, and bart... graduating."
62567,Marge,what are you doing today?
65504,Marge,no video... party over... caaaake!
56905,Marge,"oh, it was no trouble. the hobos at the dump were very helpful. except one man who seemed to have mental problems."
64504,Marge,no surrender!
56814,Marge,"oh, homie, of course i will."
57828,Marge,i said we were having a special guest tonight -- mr. tim conway.
60644,Marge,it's the man with the braces!
55770,Marge,"have a good day at work, honey."
55223,Marge,bad dog! very bad dog.
62422,Marge,homer!
61383,Marge,"coltrane? lisa, i'm glad you're ready to love again. but a kitty needs a proper name, like whiskers. or paws scaggs."
63957,Marge,take my hand!
65472,Marge,not in the mood.
64837,Marge,what's all that noise?
60479,Marge,betcha they're not! three to one. how much you got?
55637,Marge,i'm afraid we're going to need a bigger place.
55891,Marge,"lisa, you got a letter."
55800,Marge,lisa needs braces.
55337,Marge,"otto, i think you should get a job."
63324,Marge,not at all!
66332,Marge,"ooo... so many choices, maggie."
63384,Marge,now there must be a way out!
59038,Marge,"oh, how awful."
63229,Marge,"oh... well, yeah, the ointments, um..."
64856,Marge,i bought it because catherine zeta jones told me to. what a fool i was.
67510,Marge,homer.
58146,Marge,"""...you'll all get yours in hell, you lying, thieving, blanking blankers. sincerely, moe."""
59340,Marge,"oh, i don't think i need any... oh, wow..."
59238,Marge,"kids, turn off the tv. i have some bad news about lenny."
60100,Marge,uh-huh. absolutely. / yep. /
54815,Marge,"whatever it does, it's doing it now."
63821,Marge,"homie, what's going on?"
57127,Marge,"i don't care who's consolidating their power. well, we don't need this."
55076,Marge,"homer, for god's sakes, let him deliver the baby!"
55577,Marge,my husband will be so excited.
60380,Marge,"if i'm not having sex by the end of this goat-cheese quesadilla, i'm gonna scream."
58955,Marge,"really? well, what do you call that thing on the branch?"
65449,Marge,"no. we saw how much this cruise means to you, so we all sold something special. and we made just enough for an economy cabin!"
65957,Marge,homer simpson!
56981,Marge,homer? where are you?
67590,Marge,that's nice dear.
67328,Marge,"oh, homer."
57888,Marge,i'd sure hate to get a dozen crapweeds for valentine's day. i'd rather have candy.
63252,Marge,grampa's driving me crazy!
64529,Marge,one month? that's a heavy workload for a fourth grader.
61932,Marge,i don't see lisa in any of the seminars!
66118,Marge,eat up.
62187,Marge,"governor, i think the only fair solution is to pardon all these thugs and murderers."
57230,Marge,"what are you going to do with all your money, mr. lampwick?"
58129,Marge,looks like the flanders are having a nice christmas.
62977,Marge,homer!
65869,Marge,i never made that noise in my life!
62021,Marge,"lisa, could you pass the salad?"
60343,Marge,it seems he wants to ban culottes in the schools.
54833,Marge,"doctor, if you just talked to him for five minutes without mentioning our son, bart, you'd see how sane he is."
66102,Marge,i have three kids.
60943,Marge,it's reverend lovejoy!
60974,Marge,"lisa, i'm so impressed you're state champ."
55902,Marge,"homer, where's the dog?"
57614,Marge,i was just with dr. hibbert. he said i was under a lot of stress and should get some help.
63876,Marge,that's a hard hat zone!
59531,Marge,"ooh, ""tango de la muerte."" i've been dying to see that movie!"
55490,Marge,"your doll is trying to kill my husband!... yes, i'll hold."
66774,Marge,there's only one fair solution: we have to put it to a vote.
60887,Marge,why did homer buy those? no one's ever gonna use 'em.
54949,Marge,that's illegal.
58421,Marge,"oh. oh, did you want me to...?"
57333,Marge,that's slick willie for you. always with the smooth talk.
62769,Marge,me too.
64905,Marge,you can't buy white wine!
65200,Marge,it's my dream!
65791,Marge,"on main street, turn right now... / our sunday drive is ruined! hands at ten and two!"
67395,Marge,ewww.
57191,Marge,"oh, homie, i like your in-your-face humanity. i like the way lisa speaks her mind. i like bart's... i like bart. and i like my old green dress. i didn't have to spend our savings on this stupid gown."
54828,Marge,oh my god! mother was right.
62803,Marge,we're not engaged.
60045,Marge,"are you okay, ned?"
65210,Marge,"eh, save it for the sitter!"
59124,Marge,"homer, we agreed we'd discuss the medication with bart."
62822,Marge,they're coming down the aisles! what if they want to interact with me!?
63600,Marge,no.
64403,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry, kids. we lost the batteries for that."
57450,Marge,so who wants to play a game? hmm? hmm? hmm?
66691,Marge,i am so pleased to meet you.
55112,Marge,"oooh, and this one's fifty percent off."
64696,Marge,what is it?
67139,Marge,"no, thanks. i'm just here out of spite."
63686,Marge,we wouldn't be in this trouble if you'd just paid the heating bill!
61997,Marge,"moe, did you see something troubling on the tarmac?"
56679,Marge,"""tested,"" homer, god tested moses. and try to be nice to my sisters. it's very hard on me to have you fighting all the time."
58842,Marge,no one has ever asked me that before in my life.
67896,Marge,"hmmm, i notice little things about your father, too."
56168,Marge,stampy's food bill today was three hundred dollars.
60194,Marge,oh my god!
61337,Marge,i got them fair and square and i kept my dignity. not like janey's mom.
55593,Marge,"well, i have some tic tacs in my purse..."
61075,Marge,"homie, i tried to tell you how i feel, but i can't find the right words. maybe he can."
58025,Marge,hello. so... what brings you to america?
67529,Marge,so television's responsible.
63681,Marge,"that's what you said about yellow fever, and that was no fun."
55131,Marge,"homer, i think that chip's got enough dip on it."
58475,Marge,"homer, that side of bacon was for my bridge game tonight."
57925,Marge,i guess it doesn't matter. all these things cost money and we just don't have it. unless...
54639,Marge,"oh, thanks. it's just a note from my boyfriend."
57695,Marge,you didn't remember that. you just saw it on tv.
57238,Marge,"patty! go on, selma, tell me more."
57395,Marge,no excuses! just do it!
57751,Marge,"well, i think it's a great idea."
57951,Marge,this is crazy! i'm not a witch!
64282,Marge,"there's less of you to love, but i love you even more."
60102,Marge,"sorry, sometimes i forget."
62960,Marge,let's go.
57662,Marge,he is quite a charmer. your father's certainly taken a shine to him...
56252,Marge,"you, too."
63633,Marge,you remembered i like romance!
57224,Marge,"i won't have my children sitting alone on a cold, dangerous street all night. homer, you go, too."
59331,Marge,"hi, pumpkins!"
60975,Marge,"well, why don't we celebrate by going to a movie?"
56807,Marge,death sports.
55301,Marge,always has been.
65218,Marge,eat deconstructed apple pie!
61921,Marge,"that's a sweet thought, homie."
56134,Marge,"don't worry, kids, i'm sure your father's all right."
66195,Marge,i'm a little tired. could we just snuggle again?
62964,Marge,weren't you just tied up in the blimp?
65564,Marge,"well, that's odd, because the consumer website says the rx-12 2-cylinder has a dealer's invoice of fourteen seven."
54616,Marge,"oh, evolve yourself, professor jerk -- or should i say, associate professor jerk!"
60630,Marge,"oh dear, now everyone will think homer and i did it. the real killer is the man with the braces."
56918,Marge,"this is so relaxing. homie, this was a wonderful idea."
58786,Marge,"of course, honey."
64693,Marge,"well, i am glad you're spending more time with us, but maybe you should get a plumber to help you with that."
55258,Marge,"homie, did you close the gate?"
62886,Marge,hello there.
55672,Marge,seventy dollars.
66370,Marge,don't you think the parts that aren't evil are a little pretentious?
66945,Marge,"two points. your turn, dear."
67653,Marge,"well, have you decided what you want to do tomorrow?"
67588,Marge,aren't you going to watch the rest of your cute cartoons?
56371,Marge,oooh. recipe-related bumper cars.
58115,Marge,"still, it would have been nice to bring home at least one paycheck."
66680,Marge,i guess i do.
56673,Marge,what's going on in here?
65549,Marge,"i'll tell you what i'm doing, i'm realizing that i married the wrong man. oh, you poor, sweet, simple homers."
59853,Marge,i don't know. it came with the house.
56433,Marge,"no buts. you march right back to that school, look them straight in the eye and say ""don't eat me."""
64650,Marge,"now that it's empty, who's gonna buy their house? what if someone moves in with two barts? or four teenage barts?"
59698,Marge,they've undergone terrible hardships.
58564,Marge,sorry. i didn't realize i was in the way.
56333,Marge,you didn't have to drop me off.
62411,Marge,"homer, we're not really playing."
58236,Marge,what do you have to say about the leader now? hunh? hunh?
61338,Marge,whatever.
64024,Marge,"homie, you're barely eating."
64947,Marge,"homie, you always mean to say the nicest things."
67849,Marge,"no, maggie! stay in the shallow end."
55922,Marge,what? homie!
56481,Marge,"well why don't we give it to some needy children, then?"
63877,Marge,bartholomew j. simpson!
65837,Marge,makeup and baby oil!
58940,Marge,"no, but if you'll just ring the--"
61011,Marge,but this is the east side.
55153,Marge,"no homie, no. i still love you. a lot of couples take separate vacations."
57028,Marge,sweet dreams.
57560,Marge,mmm... hmm... that's not bad.
67716,Marge,"congratulations, artie."
67290,Marge,you forgot the special lunches i made.
57308,Marge,"ohhhh, how about this adorable sun-suit. it has a starfish on the fanny and it comes with its own pail!"
62515,Marge,"well, we could bike to the tea shop and have some cake."
56731,Marge,i think there's really something wrong with santa's little helper. he was up barking all night and dug up the back yard worse than ever.
57214,Marge,"homie, it's 4:30 in the morning. ""little rascals"" isn't on 'til 6."
56965,Marge,"bart, no!"
61908,Marge,"gee, with all that travel, you probably haven't had much time to find that special someone."
63033,Marge,"switch, switch, switch."
67205,Marge,sure.
56651,Marge,that seems very noisy and expensive for a souvenir. why don't you get this nice cap?
61961,Marge,"well, the drug company won't do anything to help us."
59075,Marge,i'd like to see the japanese take on the club sandwich. i bet it's smaller and more efficient!
57265,Marge,it's grampa. and it sounds like he's gotten into the horseradish again.
60773,Marge,i've heard about you vendors!
58574,Marge,"lisa, look out! a skeleton!"
57292,Marge,"... and you're sure the flanderses won't be there? well, it sounds great!"
67832,Marge,"no, i'm afraid i agree with your father."
63875,Marge,bullies!
59269,Marge,a fifties-style restaurant.
60383,Marge,...but then he turned into an octopus!
65913,Marge,i'm not hungry. goodnight.
55234,Marge,"homer, we're on a tight budget here. promise me you won't get carried away."
67781,Marge,"very nicely said, homer."
65886,Marge,"why'd you do it, willie?"
63014,Marge,"homie, don't you want to build something with your new fix-it books?"
59058,Marge,we were robbed?!
64736,Marge,"stay cool, marge. stay cool..."
55120,Marge,look at these prices. we could finally get rid of those termites for the cost of this meal.
56243,Marge,"mm-hmm. i'm happy about that. but, i think you can be a good teacher and still respect our privacy."
65813,Marge,"homer, a little help?"
55277,Marge,i don't like you hanging around with some cocktail waitress!
67424,Marge,"well, last year you got a little rambunctious and mooned the poor umpire."
61579,Marge,i can't believe you did that to me.
62586,Marge,i'll really miss you guys. i'll never forget the three activities we did together.
54841,Marge,"thank you, homie."
62198,Marge,the one what?
65630,Marge,"abe, we were so worried."
63748,Marge,"well, the important thing is, someday i'll be watching my little marge dancing at lincoln center."
58883,Marge,"come on, let's get you inside and scrape the gum out of your hair."
62585,Marge,don't be so sure.
56602,Marge,"hey, i'm just hangin'."
61039,Marge,"homie, i know you've got a lot of work to do. but this really isn't the same as eating dinner with your family."
56483,Marge,they seem to be building some sort of a shantytown.
62471,Marge,"oh, he knows how to push all my buttons."
59104,Marge,will you stop acting so jealous?
64233,Marge,hurry! get out the kids' stuff!
57038,Marge,sleep tight.
62231,Marge,"homer, come down for dinner."
56492,Marge,homer.
57122,Marge,"homer, maybe mr. burns will bowl a great game and you will win your championship."
60151,Marge,she's gonna find us!
61546,Marge,"the doctor said if you tried running again, your ankles would shatter."
55256,Marge,"oh no! those are my numbers! if it wasn't for that dog, i would've won!"
60546,Marge,i'm sleeping on the couch.
59524,Marge,"homer, sitting that close to the tv can't be good for you."
57278,Marge,"what's wrong, homie?"
57964,Marge,homer. we gotta get out of here.
66789,Marge,no woman uses one of these by choice.
65522,Marge,lisa snuck out.
59403,Marge,"what are you doing, lisa?"
57129,Marge,"are you interested in that motorized tie rack, principal skinner?"
60067,Marge,soon. i just need a few more yoga classes.
65061,Marge,i was never sure about this marriage.
62936,Marge,"hey, that was my iced tea. i just sweetened it to my liking!"
57881,Marge,"uh huh, that explains the flags. what about the dog food?"
66225,Marge,you know what? i think it's fine if homer spends a few hours now and then with... homer junior.
57249,Marge,"oh, honey, you've had your glory. now it's bart's turn."
58504,Marge,"homer, you've got it set on ""whore."""
61217,Marge,will everyone please stop fighting and burning!
60208,Marge,maybe.
55529,Marge,we're home.
66492,Marge,yes.
56282,Marge,lisa! i am nice.
54864,Marge,"that sounds fine, bart."
65233,Marge,i'm your wife.
67478,Marge,"i don't think that it's broken, honey. here, let me try."
64181,Marge,it's like a sauna in here!
67895,Marge,"hmmm, i feel that way about your father."
60957,Marge,i wanted a sewing room. but not like this. not like this!
57978,Marge,i'm a lucky woman.
64617,Marge,"homie, i happened to read about beached whales in springfield geographic. it usually does not end well."
55273,Marge,"homie, aren't you coming inside?"
57807,Marge,"swipe at the dominant male! c'mon, ned, knock that monkey down!"
54988,Marge,"honey, what's wrong?"
57984,Marge,so we need a place to spend the night.
64731,Marge,well at least it's a good place to see celebrities.
58578,Marge,she's teething. look... her very first baby tooth.
59849,Marge,you crumb-bum. you looked me right in the eye and lied to me.
61124,Marge,"well, it's eleven a.m. on a workday, so he must be at that stupid bar."
61790,Marge,maybe you should turn off the power.
64549,Marge,i'm sorry we ever fought.
66410,Marge,"ooo, that could be the one."
62099,Marge,"selma, she's beautiful!"
58913,Marge,how clever! the kids' menu's on the beak.
56376,Marge,"...and remember, every morning give one bowl of kibble to santa's little helper. do you want me to write any of this down?"
66548,Marge,i wouldn't say i paid someone to be your friend. i just gave her money for records and ice cream.
60109,Marge,no!
65992,Marge,"okay, check your mirrors. hands at ten and two. slowly back out of the driveway--"
60555,Marge,"look, i'm really starting to worry. there's half-eaten cupcakes everywhere, we're all out of paperclips, and the curtains smell like doob!"
63323,Marge,"well, he's done very well for someone who came out blue and backwards."
58079,Marge,"excuse me, mr. szyslak, have you ever considered selling your home?"
58867,Marge,get out of the way!
60676,Marge,those were for the church breakfast.
65408,Marge,sounds like a plan!
62034,Marge,baggy britches? loose-laced gym shoes? are you going to a rap performance?
67941,Marge,"bart, are you drinking?!"
67169,Marge,smooth.
56190,Marge,"homer, that's hans moleman."
65269,Marge,"don't open it, homie! it's a virus!"
55584,Marge,that medicine's not for you.
54608,Marge,"homie, go home. we'll talk about this later."
63292,Marge,"that internet has it all. today i found i had the same birthday as randy quaid, i mapquested a great new route to the armory, and i got a list of local houses where i'm not letting you kids trick or treat anymore!"
56813,Marge,"they didn't have my size shirt, but you get the idea."
60814,Marge,"oh, it sure is good to be home."
56825,Marge,i got a report on a domestic disturbance at this address.
63627,Marge,that's okay. i don't care that you don't care. go watch your thing.
55952,Marge,"homer, we gotta do something! today he's drinking people's blood, tomorrow he could be smoking!"
67760,Marge,one. and two. and three. and reach. and five. and six. and seven..
64489,Marge,he usually stays out like this for about thirty seconds. want some coffee?
66401,Marge,they're not coming for another twenty-nine years! did your earlobes get longer?
65379,Marge,i think that's enough birthday fun.
57832,Marge,stakes!
63621,Marge,"""rules: no men, no cell phones, no mirrors, no shame""."
62046,Marge,please give me back my boy! i just want to tell him i love him one more time.
66692,Marge,well that's better.
67215,Marge,didn't he used to be your assistant?
67471,Marge,"honey, please. you're in the way."
60732,Marge,"oh my special little guys. you're okay, you're okay!"
60708,Marge,a place where you'll never be bothered by your family again.
66646,Marge,"now i know why homie comes here so much. no matter how sad you are inside, what you see looks worse."
65178,Marge,back to the car.
62826,Marge,"well, a woman also invented the windshield wiper."
54892,Marge,"well, i can't defend everything he does. but let's face it, all bart and milhouse have is each other. they're too young for girls. and they're a popular target for bullies. and in the christmas pageant, they're always sheep. please, please, let them be friends!"
61004,Marge,how much longer is this going to go on?
58021,Marge,"wellll, look who's the ladies' man..."
67430,Marge,"did the team ask you to dress like that, homer?"
59480,Marge,isn't it adorable? i guess some baby pictures were on that old roll of film.
62817,Marge,what a fascinating cross-section of humanity! you've got the lonely but loveable loser...
55506,Marge,"homer, did you barricade the door?"
58393,Marge,"whoops! there goes carlsbad caverns. oh, well."
66657,Marge,"i couldn't help noticing this school is located in... i'm not one to judge, but... um..."
57992,Marge,what about the gun?
55869,Marge,now you kids be good while mother's in prison.
61465,Marge,you'll be like an owl saying milhouse who? milhouse who? milhouse whooo?
65659,Marge,oh... satire.
60018,Marge,doodlebugs!
60744,Marge,"now, i need some liposuction -- just enough to make me attractive to this man."
57060,Marge,"i'm sorry, honey, but those games cost up to and including seventy dollars. and they're violent and they distract you from your schoolwork."
60090,Marge,"hi, ultrahouse."
65506,Marge,"here's your lunches. with some cake. you'll be having cake for a long, long, time."
55970,Marge,thank you. why?
59120,Marge,"a drug? i know bart can be rambunctious, but he's not some hyperactive monster."
56614,Marge,and your bottom was a little bigger.
64750,Marge,"brother bear said ""sister bear is inconsiderate."""
63626,Marge,"well, the first inspirational speech of the day was by the woman who climbed mount everest and got everyone else killed."
55543,Marge,oooh! they're having a retirement party for someone at the plant.
58055,Marge,friends of the library is holding an historic manuscript viewing.
55464,Marge,"i have a responsibility to raise these children right and unless you change, i'll have to tell them their father is... well, wicked."
63772,Marge,my body wash is estée lauder...
61016,Marge,that's ccr!
56478,Marge,no. i won't make a spectacle out of myself any further.
67427,Marge,homer... homer... x.y.z.
64729,Marge,is that the cat in there?!
58656,Marge,"oh, honey, i'm so proud of you. you got the highest grade in the class."
61889,Marge,"well, i'm glad everything worked out so well."
61477,Marge,"listen, mr. hobo. you may not have laundry to wash, but i do. now what do you want to show me?"
56196,Marge,why don't you bring this potato? it's pretty big.
59850,Marge,"i just saw you! get him outta here, chief!"
65278,Marge,"everyone, it's a girl!"
59152,Marge,i don't think he has diarrhea.
63744,Marge,uh-oh.
55041,Marge,yes.
56683,Marge,"no, homer."
64046,Marge,"we can discuss it later. right now, while you're here, you can help host my book club."
67334,Marge,"oh, homer, don't say that. the way i see it, if you raise three children who can knock out and hog-tie a perfect stranger, you must be doing something right."
65555,Marge,"homie, the faucet is dripping."
55137,Marge,"there you go, lisa. no pimentos. bart, your hat's where you left it, behind the toilet. homer, i'll sew your pants but i'm out of bologna."
60999,Marge,not the swear jar! it's the only thing holding back the filth!
55336,Marge,no.
55195,Marge,"homer! bart, you did a very cruel thing."
59931,Marge,there's still more meatloaf.
59122,Marge,that's amazing! ...and darling.
61509,Marge,lisa... lisa...
67763,Marge,well if you have other plans...
63952,Marge,i can't believe one of the most beautiful moments in our marriage is based on lies!
67264,Marge,homer!
59948,Marge,yeah. the uh... the milk really takes the edge off.
54776,Marge,homer!
61307,Marge,"oh, homie, you may have lost your show, but you went out in the classiest way possible. i'm proud of you."
61072,Marge,just go. and take your stupid lhasa apso with you.
60586,Marge,what would that accomplish?
57168,Marge,"oh, that would be a dream come true. i'll be there with bells on!"
66556,Marge,try to forget that.
62027,Marge,solar.
63780,Marge,"well, you're very welcome, lurleen. of all the women who've hit on homer over the years, you're my favorite."
63411,Marge,"oh, my special little guy. i'm so glad you're okay."
60411,Marge,"oh, that's very sweet, artie."
55559,Marge,what?
67883,Marge,"mr. burns, it's hard to discover your inner beauty while you're shouting at an eight-year-old girl."
59611,Marge,shot? wha?
58627,Marge,"doctor, will he be all right?"
64724,Marge,"i'd like this bag, please!"
65116,Marge,homer! stop teasing!
65930,Marge,but they let me take fabric samples!
66830,Marge,that's worse than what i thought!
55291,Marge,hmmm. i thought you said she was overweight!
59991,Marge,"oh, isn't that sweet? he named it after his wife."
54934,Marge,"look homer, lisa's taking her first steps."
62825,Marge,"why, a woman invented liquid paper."
54989,Marge,"homie, why don't you just go down to moe's and talk to him? i bet he'd be willing to share some of his success with you."
60146,Marge,let's go.
62744,Marge,i don't get it. are you saying you're the tree?
55108,Marge,oh really?
60869,Marge,no! it'll tangle!
64653,Marge,"credenza, credenza, lowboy, sideboard, portmanteau..."
58053,Marge,we have to make the most of the time we have.
58290,Marge,simpson gene? that's just foolishness.
56201,Marge,it says freddy quimby beat a waiter half to death. those quimby children are so wild and rich. i hope he finally gets what's coming to him.
57496,Marge,the man who lived next door until his house blew down.
57963,Marge,it's hard to believe this used to be an internment camp.
62841,Marge,untidy! untidy! untidy!
65008,Marge,"haul away, driver man!"
65094,Marge,at some point we should try to return these keys to their rightful owners.
64472,Marge,"so if you go for oysters and i go for ersters, i'll order oysters and cancel the ersters / for we know we need each other so we / better call the calling off off, / let's call the whole thing ooooofff!"
59513,Marge,we'd be much better rock breakers if we weren't all chained together.
58680,Marge,no.
58065,Marge,helping people find homes... that must be really rewarding.
61068,Marge,maybe if you didn't throw 'em on the floor...
62171,Marge,"there must be something else. think marge, think. culture... vulture... birds of prey... pray in a church... the father, son and holy ghost... ghosts are scary, scary rhymes with gehry! that's it -- architect frank gehry! he could build us a concert hall like he did in los angeles."
60242,Marge,you think we can bribe her back with christmas?
61506,Marge,i hope this typeface catches people's eye. it sure didn't move our old fondue set!
62931,Marge,homer? homer? now we have to kiss. the big tv is telling us to!
65681,Marge,"fine! i admit it, you... nipple nazis! i give my baby formula!"
58247,Marge,"ooh, it's so late. you kids have to go to bed."
63755,Marge,"i'm taking you to your home, before you wreck mine!"
61126,Marge,"homie, where have you been? i've been calling all over for you!"
55388,Marge,"she complains now, but when we go to pick her up, she won't want to leave."
59569,Marge,"now, lisa's going through this phase where she doesn't eat any meat. so i usually sneak a little meat juice into her vegetables."
56064,Marge,"oh my god, barney, thank you. i would never have forgiven myself."
66139,Marge,who are you talking to?
56177,Marge,"uh, sure."
66749,Marge,"lisa, sweetie, i'm tired of being a pushover."
54782,Marge,i don't think so.
65950,Marge,"thank you for finding it, sweetie. and seeing someone else get married in it is better than having it myself."
56052,Marge,"this was a wonderful idea, homie."
63404,Marge,my cake!
67875,Marge,"well, maybe not, but i have the gift of being able to see inner beauty."
66724,Marge,when will this tea get out of my system?
61702,Marge,"while you two are up on the roof, why don't you take the leaves out of the gutter!"
63037,Marge,your father's finally gonna get exposed as the credit-stealing fraud he is!
64882,Marge,but i was gonna-- oooh!
62670,Marge,he'll sleep tonight.
63683,Marge,stop all this pandering!
58538,Marge,what are you hiding there?
57050,Marge,"did you eat the cookies, maggie."
67032,Marge,that's why he lashes out at the world.
57053,Marge,"well, duh."
55739,Marge,"well, to cheer you up i rented a couple of videos. ""boxing's greatest weigh-ins"" and ""yentl""."
64283,Marge,what was that?!
63863,Marge,whose phone is this?
65618,Marge,spiro's...
55370,Marge,whoooa!!
56917,Marge,"well, all right, but i'm taking some of the ironing with me in the car."
58141,Marge,what's wrong?
67305,Marge,"i love you, too."
61417,Marge,what do you know? it is!
63756,Marge,you live here?
65402,Marge,"mona, you're alive?!"
61428,Marge,did you like it?
58312,Marge,not hang out. play date!
57624,Marge,homer!
54781,Marge,the poor boy is so desperate. he wants to earn money to buy a comic book.
54823,Marge,i washed it.
63647,Marge,"here's a message for you: ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop!"
63770,Marge,i made that hug happen!
62319,Marge,what if there's a fire?
60764,Marge,"homer, how come you never sang a song like that to me before?"
54847,Marge,"oooh, look, homer. the irs."
66199,Marge,what's going on?
55073,Marge,"homer, does this mean --"
63743,Marge,it won't go down!
63018,Marge,"aww, what a sweet blasphemy."
55246,Marge,i've found a way we can pay for the operation.
59558,Marge,"all right, otto can get married here. but homer, you have to get rid of that elephant."
62766,Marge,"he's loved me ever since the first moment he saw me and he's never stopped. and whatever it takes to make me happy, he'll do it even if it kills him."
62012,Marge,love love will keep us together
56098,Marge,"i don't know, bart. you're only ten."
59317,Marge,"okay, here goes..."
58347,Marge,"oh my, look at all these letters from people who want to be bart's people, bart."
60759,Marge,"now, don't get too used to these. that awful doctor said he'd take them out in a couple of days."
58226,Marge,"this is ridiculous, we're already married!"
58044,Marge,"hey, she's gonna smash the angel!"
61994,Marge,moe and i are going to the tavern and restaurant owners convention in aruba this weekend. don't you ever listen to me? i told you ten times.
64987,Marge,"okay, we're gonna take turns having grampa as a roommate. who wants to go first?"
65313,Marge,homer! watch the road!
60516,Marge,why did you do it?
59585,Marge,that was a movie.
65530,Marge,just once i'd like your father to be on a jumbotron for something good.
54731,Marge,homer! homer! put a record on!
57385,Marge,he sexually harassed me.
61141,Marge,i don't know what happened. i saw you and i went for the brake but i hit the accelerator!
55191,Marge,"no, behind her."
55808,Marge,p.u.
67068,Marge,it all seems so expensive...
67298,Marge,really?
55002,Marge,what do you mean?
65713,Marge,see? all you need to get through a crisis is a little friendly conversation. betcha the dads are doing the same thing!
67535,Marge,i'm cataloguing the violence in these cartoons. i don't think adults have ever actually sat down and watched them before.
65102,Marge,"i'll call you back! come back, pooter toot! people might be offended by your mild tastelessness!"
55442,Marge,almost everybody.
63148,Marge,"well, just let 'em finish this one song..."
61214,Marge,maggie's right in the middle of that italian-american-mexican standoff!
66673,Marge,"well, i do have a favor. patty and selma came home early from their vacation, but the cleaners still haven't gotten all the black mold out of their apartment..."
56808,Marge,excuse me...
55910,Marge,"homie, here are the responses from the colleges you applied to."
57843,Marge,we're like this all the time!
67557,Marge,no.
66304,Marge,ask body spray!
55436,Marge,"i'm looking for my sister, stella."
65895,Marge,the most romantic part of this was the hold music when i made the reservation.
62861,Marge,lisa! my little know-it-all!
57892,Marge,did you ever tell him that?
61758,Marge,the food is so delicious here. and these chanel suits are five for a dollar! i'm using a jacket as a napkin.
66755,Marge,no answer. let's go find your father.
66923,Marge,you can look now.
61237,Marge,you stole this entire room from ned flanders' house!
61180,Marge,"let's go, boys. make sure you use pine sol on those pine trees, for that pine fresh smell."
58637,Marge,lisa!
59967,Marge,"oh, honey, we're so proud of you."
55077,Marge,"homie, isn't he beautiful?"
57199,Marge,you'll feel better knowing your money's in the hands of professionals.
56818,Marge,"well, thank you, honey."
59498,Marge,is he a maneater?
61783,Marge,simpson.
60153,Marge,"all right, we got lucky that time, but i want everyone in this family to raise your hand and promise not to break the law for one full year."
63941,Marge,"alberto, i'm not sure if this is such a good idea."
62089,Marge,"selma, i never realized you wanted a child so badly."
62981,Marge,"homer, helen lovejoy never returned my casserole dish from the church potluck. could you pick it up?"
66965,Marge,what's going on up there?
56258,Marge,"oh my. i'm very flattered, but i'm not really interested."
67163,Marge,"oh, dear, i didn't realize there was so much to this game. what do you charge for lessons?"
60570,Marge,"no, you're angry. look, you're punching the cat right now."
64946,Marge,my first gray hair!
60431,Marge,every four years.
63945,Marge,fine. but i don't want to sleep in the same room with that chest.
66511,Marge,i was making that cake for the block party today! now there's no choice but to go... store-bought!
67451,Marge,"homer, i'm your best friend, but i've gotta say, i've never seen him be anything but a perfect neighbor."
67862,Marge,clever title.
58739,Marge,"hmm, lisa, i don't want to alarm you, but i'm not finding any."
56989,Marge,"oh, you're such a vigorous young go-getter. when's your next coffee break?"
60108,Marge,hello police? i think my house killed my husband.
63979,Marge,"well, i want you to go over to their house and apologize!"
59229,Marge,"give them the plant, homer!"
66298,Marge,i never wanted to say funny vows!
63205,Marge,we were together for five years! now who's gonna take care of the triplets?
56398,Marge,i'm so embarrassed. i wish there was a hole i could just crawl into and die.
58853,Marge,so?
57354,Marge,weren't there three indians last year?
65688,Marge,stop your trendy arguing! i'm trying to call the fire department!
59187,Marge,there goes the clothesline.
62486,Marge,"don't listen to them, maggie. maggie?"
58689,Marge,"oh, for pete's sake."
60035,Marge,you leave those boys alone!
65194,Marge,"homie, i don't want you to feel excluded. would you like to come with us to dinner at el chemistri?"
58338,Marge,"oh, honey, i'm so proud of you. all your hard work and grade grubbing have finally paid off!"
65917,Marge,this is not putting me in the mood!
59132,Marge,back in the lunches you go.
56077,Marge,think before you say each word.
60172,Marge,devil beard?
57171,Marge,"i really need to concentrate on this, lisa, would you mind--"
56857,Marge,freeze!
56695,Marge,"hello, i'm marge simpson and this is my husband, homer."
64185,Marge,"no it won't -- if he wants me to do something, he'll just write it down!"
56034,Marge,brad goodman is coming to town!
57962,Marge,i just wish we hadn't filled up on all those kids before we got to the flanders'.
57299,Marge,"it's called little pwagmattasquarmsettport. it's known as ""america's scrod-basket."""
66246,Marge,"sweetie, about the submarine... what's your favorite food to eat when you're disappointed? i'm going shopping tomorrow."
65604,Marge,shush!
60464,Marge,"homer, your father's dead!"
60040,Marge,"rachel jordan? isn't that the woman you had a crush on, ned?"
65030,Marge,that's great. then you won't mind me enrolling you in a fathering class.
63352,Marge,the deadly truth about oxygen...
63853,Marge,a sterling silver picture frame -- with pictures of our kids in it.
64259,Marge,all i heard was more names of actors you haven't killed. unless you're not man enough.
62183,Marge,as president of the cultural board i was given a key to the concert hall.
67817,Marge,this one's mine.
62451,Marge,"why did i marry that selfish jerk? i've asked him to flip the mattress a thousand times, and he never does!"
56131,Marge,"homer, you already dialed."
56173,Marge,this is just what happened at the caramel factory.
59989,Marge,"oh, no! it's eating us!"
55749,Marge,"homer, do you have an explanation for this bill?"
56956,Marge,you're supposed to feed them pellets from the machine over there.
64848,Marge,those creepy little claws...
67369,Marge,"come here. ""you are so beautiful to me / you are so beautiful to me / can't you see? / you're everything that i hoped for /"
59646,Marge,no dessert until you eat your broccoli.
57485,Marge,one at a time.
64957,Marge,"need some coolin' down, hot stuff?"
54906,Marge,"well, look at the time. almost midnight."
57887,Marge,"i'm sorry, but that's just how i feel."
56623,Marge,"""a young springfieldianite has discovered a new comet to be known as 'the bart simpson comet.'"" oh honey, i'm so proud of you."
59352,Marge,"well, then let's get out of here."
61864,Marge,you don't have to impress me by making fun of others. i already like you.
65637,Marge,lisa... would you like some shrimp?
63360,Marge,you make her stop! i've had her all day!
58624,Marge,"uh, it's that pair of dockers you wanted. 48 waist with the balloon seat, right?"
60120,Marge,i can't take it anymore!
58677,Marge,"ohh, anything, sweetheart."
64056,Marge,why are you here? you already own a home.
57002,Marge,there's no cake.
57277,Marge,"""dear parents. due to yesterday's unscheduled field trip to the auto wrecking yard, the school bus will be out of commission for two weeks. by reading this letter out loud, you have waived any legal responsibility on our part in perpetuity, throughout the universe."""
60666,Marge,somebody does care!
62832,Marge,he's one of bart's friends.
57506,Marge,"eight spices! oh, some must be doubles. ""or-uh-gahn-o?"" what the hell...?"
66029,Marge,finally! actual science!
54604,Marge,professor august says the situation comedy is a doomed genre.
66833,Marge,who's he giving a piggyback ride to?
66614,Marge,"you seem to have had, and lost, a lot of jobs."
60088,Marge,"oh, no. a salesbot!"
64004,Marge,"who is this ""mom"" of which you speak?"
66940,Marge,"this is the best gift of all, homer."
59546,Marge,the furnace?
66999,Marge,"look, napkins."
62210,Marge,"come on, kids! we're gonna visit grampa. then we're gonna take the dog to the v-e-t..."
58420,Marge,"yeah, we probably should... you know... rock the casbah."
58031,Marge,"oh apu, give it up."
58846,Marge,"kids, cut it out!"
62829,Marge,since then i haven't been able to do any of the calculus i've encountered in my daily life. but that's not going to happen to you.
67834,Marge,"oh, all right. if he passes obedience school, we can keep him."
59015,Marge,but we lost the olympics to shelbyville.
59985,Marge,wonder where this river goes.
58492,Marge,"all right, already! everyone knows the man accomplished a lot. maybe because he didn't spend every waking moment talking about thomas edison!"
57406,Marge,"oh, lisa, i know it's frustrating. but we made a commitment and we have to see it through, no matter how unpleasant."
62385,Marge,but i'm not coming back yet.
55409,Marge,"well, i guess a few weeks wouldn't hurt her."
64531,Marge,"y'know -- i think bart might have too much homework. if they keep overwhelming him, he might be turned off school forever."
58878,Marge,"thanks for asking. well, i was watching dateline and stone philips said s.u.v.'s always roll over when you turn sharply, and the gas tanks explode at the drop of a hat."
63556,Marge,"okay... they're so buggy, i can't!"
57523,Marge,"homer, don't you see? our differences are only skin-deep..."
66803,Marge,yes.
60052,Marge,"oh, homer won't be able to play for a long time."
64426,Marge,"and even if we did have another baby, it might not be a boy. it might be another sister."
61345,Marge,and i love baseball!
61673,Marge,"that boy failed show and tell, but he's on our ass like sherlock holmes."
55221,Marge,"lisa, i know you're down on homemaking, but it can really let you be creative. see, this morning i turned bacon, eggs and toast into a nice smiley face for bart and homer."
55740,Marge,it deals with a bookish young woman's efforts to enter rabbinical school.
57893,Marge,i came up with the idea.
57816,Marge,hello.
67046,Marge,"come on, come on. we were worried about you. nothing personal. i just fear the unfamiliar."
65679,Marge,"i'd love to, but maggie's a little shy..."
59588,Marge,be right back.
63420,Marge,american applesauce association?!
67380,Marge,all right. but if anything happens...
63224,Marge,stop the wedding!
66053,Marge,"selma, cheating is a sin. as much a sin as not replying to an instant message. so, if you'll excuse me, i've got a lot of sleazy gentlemen to let down gently!"
59323,Marge,"look at these. you bought them after the nagano olympics, and never skied once. if you would just stop being so impulsive, maybe..."
62556,Marge,no!
64366,Marge,"well, it seems real to me."
56528,Marge,"homer, i've never told you this before, but i'm not a good flyer. i have to get off the plane. let me off the plane. i'm asking you nicely to open the doors."
58668,Marge,what is it with you and robots?
66438,Marge,give back the painting! the whole town's turned against us!
67635,Marge,"bart, please."
58632,Marge,"ohh, you don't sound so good. we'd better get you some cold medicine."
59230,Marge,i've never been so glad to be home.
61035,Marge,so my husband goes to a bar every night. whoop de doo. who gives a bibble? gabba gabba hey!
58029,Marge,right. how much longer is she gonna be here? homer was a little sketchy on the details.
55787,Marge,you've saved more than a hundred dollars. i found it in your pants.
55319,Marge,"well, he fooled almost everyone. but there was one little boy who never lost his mistrust."
55731,Marge,have you been eating that sandwich again?
62933,Marge,"give me a kiss, homie."
66448,Marge,eu amo o brasil!
59971,Marge,"hey, the dog smells something!"
67259,Marge,the life jacket is under the seat.
60130,Marge,no!
63246,Marge,you redid the basement!
65758,Marge,just cut the glass!
62954,Marge,"listen, bub. we are out of the marriage counseling business. and the only one you should be giving chicken grease neck rubs to is me. but not me, 'cause i think they're disgusting."
56227,Marge,mom's almost ready for her date. she sure seems taken by this new beau. i feel so bad for grampa.
56974,Marge,these monsters are destroying everything and everyone we hold dear! and you kids should have jackets on.
67490,Marge,"honey, your food is getting cold."
55173,Marge,"well, i could use a little more. and sometimes i want a little time to myself, and i expect you to help --"
64775,Marge,"oh roger, would you hand me the suntan oil?"
62064,Marge,because she's bringing over someone very special. her fiancée.
56071,Marge,no.
62265,Marge,no you didn't.
57035,Marge,wait!! wait! my children are in there!
64776,Marge,now!
55977,Marge,i don't know.
57900,Marge,michael jackson still was black...
55871,Marge,i'll miss you too homie.
58566,Marge,i can't believe it. that's horrible! who'll run the kwik-e-mart?
58491,Marge,"that doesn't sound like me. well, i suppose if this doesn't work out you can always go back to the plant."
64373,Marge,"homie, everyone loved my calendar... but only you get to flip the pages."
58751,Marge,no dating.
60578,Marge,are you sure you can get your deposit back? it's in pretty bad shape.
66708,Marge,"don't tell me you didn't reserve a campsite! labor day is next weekend, there'll be nothing left!"
63890,Marge,oh my god. you've taught me a valuable lesson!
55262,Marge,"homer get a-hold of yourself. even if he has passed on, there's no reason to cry. remember doggie heaven."
59750,Marge,"oh, this? hmm. i think it is."
55317,Marge,i guess you're just too young to understand.
67731,Marge,homer.
61025,Marge,"no, let's hear him out. he looks a little like walter mondale."
65152,Marge,don't touch the scab!
64612,Marge,it's making our meter run backwards!
57343,Marge,all right.
62121,Marge,we saved fifty cents on that purchase!
60587,Marge,"homie, it's eleven at night. have you told him yet?"
63542,Marge,"okay, you gave your word, you're going to visit him, no excuses."
55530,Marge,"bart, are you pulling up the carpet?"
63088,Marge,i made it myself.
61835,Marge,"well, i didn't come this far not to cheat."
63410,Marge,yes there is!
61848,Marge,it's the best i could do on such short notice.
59201,Marge,"hello, my husband will be right with you. we're just taking this old christmas tree to the dump."
65909,Marge,this list is from six years ago.
66622,Marge,"no! no, no, no! it was me that couldn't get to--"
57128,Marge,"who's ""disco stu?"""
60910,Marge,"bye, kids! bye, bye!"
61376,Marge,i need to be alone right now.
56959,Marge,"well, it could be a good chance to get to know our neighbors outside of a courtroom setting."
60518,Marge,how come you talked for four hundred dollars?
56336,Marge,is thursday okay?
66915,Marge,a tattoo!
60642,Marge,my love. you saved my life.
59185,Marge,and eleven with robert urich.
55184,Marge,"actually, homer, you brought up ned flanders. i never said a word --"
56665,Marge,"money problems? homer, are we in some sort of fiduciary trouble?"
63779,Marge,"yes! it's time for you to take control of your own destiny. you're not a doormat, you're a door prize!"
62743,Marge,he's a very impressive boy.
55884,Marge,"uh, it's beautiful."
66781,Marge,how was your day?
65546,Marge,i brought this on us all. it began when i was a girl...
63427,Marge,we're gonna make it!
56568,Marge,"oh well, thank you, doctor, you've changed my life!"
60309,Marge,"there was one in a cage, but he wasn't moving."
65294,Marge,i listen to him.
64695,Marge,at least in hell the heat still works.
60721,Marge,"get back, honky cat! those systems are too expensive."
65525,Marge,"all right, who took the microwave?"
61151,Marge,i'm really touched by how much you care.
54848,Marge,"here we are, kids! the watergate."
67848,Marge,"homer, that suit doesn't leave much to the imagination."
62057,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so proud of you. you stood up for people's right to express love in its most perfect form, a binding legal contract."
58916,Marge,"yeah, c'mon homie!"
62492,Marge,"homie, if i buy a bicycle built for two, will you ride with me?"
65639,Marge,homer! the roof is leaking!
58606,Marge,"homie, are you okay?"
62967,Marge,"one more crack out of you, young man, and i'm showing everyone your baby pictures."
61549,Marge,"don't tell mama what mama don't like. come here, you big lug!"
60152,Marge,"homer, no!"
59734,Marge,marge.
66701,Marge,"stop that, all of you. it's not bart's fault that his haircut looks so stupid."
58197,Marge,"good one, spud."
62800,Marge,constance prudence chastity goodfaith.
59085,Marge,"we'll go with ""ow, that hurts,"" skip!"
59494,Marge,this is terrible. the whole point of coming down here was for you to get some rest.
58409,Marge,"stop it, lisa!"
67910,Marge,no.
58638,Marge,you don't have anything i want.
66720,Marge,it's like someone ironed out all the wrinkles in my brain.
66066,Marge,"homie, i bet you're wondering why i stayed on the computer until four a.m."
65635,Marge,please say it's the vegetarianism!
66245,Marge,"either way for forty-five minutes you're not my problem, sweetie."
56401,Marge,how were you a political prisoner?
64535,Marge,"dear lord, please give my stubborn husband the wisdom to see that i am right as usual."
55159,Marge,check the dryer!
63299,Marge,who designed this character? probably a man...
54644,Marge,"consent, of course."
55067,Marge,any ring is fine as long as it's from you.
65444,Marge,"i'm sorry, sweetie. maybe we could afford a vacation if some big shot didn't pick up the tab for his buddies at ""mr. steak."""
64213,Marge,you just have to stay there until that psychopathic school inspector makes a surprise visit. you can come home when the heat's off.
59094,Marge,perfect.
60947,Marge,i can't believe you talked me into this.
59761,Marge,"he's doing ""dreamcoat"" at the dinner theater."
60548,Marge,uh-oh.
64880,Marge,i've always believed in you even when others didn't. can you help save our family christmas? marge simpson.
65971,Marge,no husband of mine is wearing a tent!
61597,Marge,six feet by eight?
60859,Marge,oh god! oh god! oh god!
64546,Marge,well then there won't be any sex!
67786,Marge,"well, you want to try that h. powell?"
59164,Marge,you always liked my pork chops.
66273,Marge,not now. take out that pillow and put it in room three.
62976,Marge,must have cost a fortune.
65606,Marge,homer? how many samples did you sell?
64062,Marge,"ned please, you're our guest."
58766,Marge,"wow, look at this place. the house number is spelled out with letters!"
57620,Marge,i heard that!
58255,Marge,what exactly is it your company does again?
60025,Marge,i stole it from mcbain after i cut off your father's thumb.
57967,Marge,wouldn't we all suffocate?
63334,Marge,but they make me look dowdy...
64616,Marge,"homie, can i talk to you for a second?"
63834,Marge,"yeah, well, we're adding clowns."
64506,Marge,"oh stop -- it's the journal of a sweet little girl! keep reading, honey."
67514,Marge,"yes, well, we saw a daredevil last night and, well, you know, monkey see, monkey do."
59690,Marge,"oh, i might be able to help you..."
56349,Marge,that's not my mother.
66153,Marge,"moe, whatever small time together we have will be wonderful."
58565,Marge,"ooooh-woo! wow. if your fly weren't open, you'd look just like roger moore."
64703,Marge,whoops -- didn't time that quite right.
65857,Marge,"your grandfather is not psycho! the only thing he's ""straight-up"" is loves you."
65341,Marge,"you're going with me! but lisa, after this, i don't want you to spend any more time with this boy. if you do, it'll mean you're a separate person from me."
67621,Marge,"i'm sorry, but my mother always said, ""if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all."""
60203,Marge,how do we un-repress it?
57642,Marge,i do.
55266,Marge,"so, what are we going to see?"
57656,Marge,"yes, i have something that i'd like to sell."
57825,Marge,"hello, dear. how was work at the plant?"
67946,Marge,what a fun quest! aren't you glad i made you take that nap in the middle?
63387,Marge,he just needs it for walking upstairs.
55035,Marge,so you've ruined your life.
60932,Marge,"homer, for the last time..."
58959,Marge,this could really spice up those pies i've been making...
60191,Marge,oh my god! dinner with burly!
58922,Marge,wish you were her. how many of these is he going to send me?
55671,Marge,"doctor, we'll do whatever it takes to get my homie well."
57619,Marge,"i'm sorry, young man, you're not what we're looking for."
54802,Marge,the meaning of what?
57577,Marge,"listen to your mother, kids: aim low. aim so low, no one will even care if you succeed."
54752,Marge,"all right. all right. goodbye, children. and behave yourselves."
58833,Marge,"i don't know... i, i hate to change lanes once i get going... that's really for race car drivers."
66147,Marge,"never give up hope, my friends."
55078,Marge,how could he? he's only ten minutes old.
64131,Marge,"well, did he take all the blue roses with him?"
63993,Marge,...so lisa asked if her new friend could stay for dinner! she's finally doing something the book said she would!
55549,Marge,we're here for the retirement party.
67175,Marge,umm-hmm. but i think i'll do much better tomorrow night.
67118,Marge,i'm sure he doesn't do it deliberately.
66436,Marge,i could write a check with... today's date on it.
63213,Marge,shut up!
64229,Marge,without me? how'd you get there?
63764,Marge,"i've talked to over five hundred men named lumpkin... everyone at lumpkin, lumpkin and rosenthal associates, an asian or pacific islander named cho lum kin..."
56595,Marge,me too. let's go home.
67224,Marge,"okay, but don't dawdle. your food will get cold."
65367,Marge,wanna make out over the foul line?
54745,Marge,"oh, that must be the babysitter."
59255,Marge,oh. sorry. so have you two thought about kids?
60149,Marge,let's get out of here.
57300,Marge,"no, springfield is ""america's crud-bucket."" at least according to newsweek."
63419,Marge,i'll just use homer's triple a card.
57429,Marge,i'm so sorry. how can i ever make this up to you?
58949,Marge,"uh, aren't you hurt?"
55347,Marge,"homer, has the weight-loss tape reduced your appetite?"
55411,Marge,ba-ba?
62496,Marge,"bart, how'd you like to go on a tandem bike ride with your mom?"
54753,Marge,call this number if grampa falls in the bathtub.
66082,Marge,he says shows set during world war one are too sad. particularly how everyone's always climbing stairs.
65295,Marge,"homie, wake up."
61726,Marge,i wish there was some way i could believe that.
56335,Marge,that doesn't shock me.
61147,Marge,what? that's crazy.
56472,Marge,i've never been so proud of them.
58892,Marge,ooh...
55313,Marge,"there, there..."
64129,Marge,we'll take lemon.
55814,Marge,you look familiar. have we met before?
62908,Marge,"oh, i always liked that guy!"
54804,Marge,we got exactly what we wanted out of this: we gave an old man a second chance.
59437,Marge,"homer, i'm so impressed. everything you're doing sounds so rewarding."
65479,Marge,what?! i knew there was a reason he was leaving on time!
59333,Marge,owww!!
67906,Marge,no.
58987,Marge,"that's sweet, but, well, how would you like it if i, i don't know, entered a belching contest?"
57639,Marge,kids? kids?
57784,Marge,"oh, lenny, i'm sure he'll like your wife no matter what she looks like."
59265,Marge,uh... no thanks.
62658,Marge,that was your last pair! how did it happen?
57314,Marge,"you got ""the dud!"""
65801,Marge,don't watch that dvd!
56011,Marge,homer?!
59723,Marge,you're not my husband.
62691,Marge,"ned, that's so generous. but there must be something i could do in return."
61168,Marge,"here are some supervised activities we can all do together. future veterans of foreign wars, the 5-h club..."
57309,Marge,so where do you want to show off your new hip togs? the sherbet shoppe? the candle district? big sue's tap water taffy?
56080,Marge,"you know, you're right, homer. maybe i should get some professional help."
60649,Marge,"finally, some repression."
61194,Marge,"oh, lord. why do they keep changing his medication?"
56993,Marge,normally your father's crackpot schemes fizzle out as soon as he finds something good on tv. but this season...
58172,Marge,come onnn. you have to go outside to do your... business.
58997,Marge,homer... homer...
66411,Marge,"well, they all have their charms..."
56170,Marge,a female deer.
54701,Marge,i should say something reassuring yet noncommittal.
67506,Marge,"well, lisa's recital starts at five o'clock. we could go to both."
66702,Marge,i didn't know that a teacher could cut kids' hair.
56338,Marge,"i made the right decision to stay with my homie, and there was no harm done. so if you kind of mentally snip out the part where i already had a husband, that's my idea of romance."
60513,Marge,"homer, what are you going to do?"
66318,Marge,"bart, your school requires you to give everyone a valentine card in an envelope with a fun sticker. your teacher put out an email alert... with a video attachment."
61576,Marge,get away from me!
62623,Marge,no!
64941,Marge,um... well... of course you did!
56800,Marge,see?...
60074,Marge,"grampa, we've been married for years. when are you gonna put down that gun?"
66618,Marge,"professor... could you say ""welcome to mother hubbard's sandwich cupboard"" without making any other noises?"
66038,Marge,"hi, homie! did you get the money? the kids have been stocking up on pool noodles!"
55488,Marge,"homer, what's wrong?"
65640,Marge,"water's coming in the house, and we've got carpet mushrooms!"
57297,Marge,"honey, you'll make plenty of friends. all you have to do is be yourself."
59570,Marge,nobody's ever called my gravy yummers before!
66844,Marge,you're already drinking at eight o'clock in the morning? how much have you had?
55493,Marge,am i going too?
62097,Marge,"homer, no stop! you're thinking of buckingham palace!"
61685,Marge,how about a bite of the world's biggest brussels sprout?
65196,Marge,why?
63881,Marge,look at bart go! he must be running away!
63057,Marge,"homie, don't do this -- you have a wife and three young children at home."
64253,Marge,"wouldst thou live a coward in thine own esteem, letting ""i dare not"" wait upon ""i would?"""
63402,Marge,now to make the folded index card that goes in front of the cake.
57020,Marge,"oh, homie. c'mon, you're a sweet, kind, loving man. i'm sure you were a wonderful son."
62533,Marge,no!
58727,Marge,"you really should have voted, homer."
63685,Marge,"lisa, i'm sure this wiggum-arole will blow over -- you have to have faith in the wisdom of the average voter."
55311,Marge,"okay, we've got cocktail wienies and swedish meatballs."
66266,Marge,setting it up!
66640,Marge,"kids, we're taking some shredded lettuce, pre-sliced cheese, and cold cuts and turning them into the american dream."
64089,Marge,skee-biddy-bob-boo! dot-doobiddy-dum-doo!
64490,Marge,you love your son. how can you be so hard on him?
57392,Marge,kidnapped?!
59990,Marge,a chimp!
62516,Marge,"you know, honey, i've really started to look forward to our little bike rides."
58392,Marge,"just let me put some film in the camera, and then we'll hop in the car. you can get a picture of your mommy with a mummy."
64547,Marge,"i just think when two people disagree, the big jerk ought to apologize."
58254,Marge,is that my good butter?
55204,Marge,"homer, go back to the garage."
57220,Marge,except...
60701,Marge,but you did have violent diarrhea. nobody open the hallway closet until i say it's okay.
66583,Marge,this has got to stop! if you don't go to work you're going to get fired!
66653,Marge,"really? but the franchise agreement says mother hubbard inc. would provide adequate training for all employees, which they didn't. clause twenty-seven c-3."
58151,Marge,"they've forgiven us. it's a miracle! you know, deep down, people are pretty g-- hey, wait a minute! they're taking our stuff!"
60713,Marge,"so to say thank you for all your sacrifices, we spent our family vacation fund on something that's just for you. do you like it?"
67931,Marge,this is really annoying.
65503,Marge,why does that make him right?
61684,Marge,"get ready, skanks -- here comes the truth train!"
67398,Marge,will we be invited?
63623,Marge,switch stations!
58124,Marge,homer! i think i heard a noise.
66984,Marge,ummm... maybe i will take you up on that punch.
56212,Marge,uh-oh.
62669,Marge,what are those doing there?
64194,Marge,"no, i gave that to the homeless shelter."
59006,Marge,that's us.
66705,Marge,"well, anyway bart, you'll cheer up on our camping trip this weekend."
56356,Marge,"artie, please!"
67733,Marge,"you know homer, when i got home, i realized who i should have gone to the prom with."
63722,Marge,"i didn't use to mind it when he'd lock the bathroom door and snack off, but when he's getting it regular, night after night after night..."
59428,Marge,"from now on, one of us always stays home."
55568,Marge,"well, you could give them healthier snacks... theme days..."
59673,Marge,"to be honest, it's a little chilly."
65868,Marge,my what?
60561,Marge,"don't worry, homer. you don't need mary jane to laugh at mr. burns' jokes. just picture him naked."
57863,Marge,"homer! homer, those legs belong to the man behind you."
65976,Marge,thank god the kids aren't here.
66722,Marge,"homie, you promised me an incredible camping trip and i got one."
54681,Marge,she doesn't know what a good thing she's got. i like a man who can relax. not like grumpy-lumpy there.
57188,Marge,we can't drive this up there. they'll see the dent. they'll see the coat hanger antenna. stop the car. we're walking.
54867,Marge,"homer, this is the flanders' entire living room set. how much did you pay for this?"
65628,Marge,but i thought you still loved him.
63696,Marge,"homer, stop!"
59858,Marge,stop that! and get ready! we're going to the old folks' talent show. now get washed up.
60348,Marge,"hmm, i'd better polish those jaw wires for tomorrow."
64006,Marge,lisa has been seeing an awful lot of her new friend.
63537,Marge,"okay. i'll visit you, dwight."
60716,Marge,"i'm so proud of you, homie. it's like you're kid rock and i'm pamela anderson lee rock."
62438,Marge,"chief, don't you think you've had enough?"
56485,Marge,homer--
58961,Marge,"adam, say something."
61150,Marge,i've been married to my husband for ten years and part of me wants to kill him.
66050,Marge,"trust me, homer doesn't care where the cupcakes come from."
55228,Marge,"so you see, my sisters were wrong. except about the cities on the moon. i was wrong about that. so... well, you can see how anyone can be wrong."
55936,Marge,gimme that.
65222,Marge,what? they've got a point.
67887,Marge,don't you listen to him. he's just a mean little s.o.b.
57304,Marge,"isn't this fun, honey?"
63492,Marge,"okay maggie, say your goodnights."
63482,Marge,"that's a great idea! to celebrate, i'll go whip us up some chex mix pie."
66235,Marge,"thank you, mr. bergstrom. i'll tell lisa you dropped by."
60939,Marge,"i'm sorry, ned. looks like god has packed up and left springfield."
57387,Marge,i think we heard enough about larry burns for one evening.
63649,Marge,"oh tivo remote, you've changed my life."
62163,Marge,"hey, it's only money. and it did make a cool splash."
62688,Marge,"oh, that's the new ""femac"" ! the computer designed just for women! the ""you've got mail"" voice is susan sarandon!"
65927,Marge,sixteen.
66754,Marge,i've gotta call homer.
65370,Marge,stop! stop! this is everything we put behind us!
65708,Marge,where do they go?
67196,Marge,sure.
60766,Marge,maybe i'll just keep these.
66303,Marge,"homie, do you really think you should be--"
56678,Marge,but i like to make you breakfast.
58639,Marge,lisa?
62593,Marge,"hello. i'm marge. this is my husband homer, my daughters lisa and maggie and my son -- bart simpson."
64760,Marge,"whew, sure is hot out here..."
66216,Marge,"oh, i'm so sorry."
56999,Marge,con: you're setting a bad example for the children.
54872,Marge,"i know it's good for a boy to have a part-time job, but i'm not sure about the people bart's working for. i thinks they're criminals."
63888,Marge,no. all i care about is finding my boy. and then i'm never letting him out of my sight again...
67237,Marge,"well, i think you should take bart to meet this exotic belly-person. i want him to see that she's a real human being with real thoughts and real feelings. i want bart to see you apologize for the way you treated her."
63790,Marge,"i'm sorry, bart. but sometimes your mom knows best."
55974,Marge,"i'm disappointed in you, but it turns out i had a wonderful time with ruth powers. in fact, we're going out again tomorrow night."
66240,Marge,"it was a crazy time, the eighties."
56833,Marge,"moe, i've never seen you here before."
62466,Marge,"bart, wake up. i got that bike you wanted!"
66058,Marge,yes. and it's a big one. remember?
67154,Marge,no.
67218,Marge,go take some wildlife pictures or something.
64970,Marge,"look out, chicks! the silver fox is coming to the hen house!"
59906,Marge,"okay, everybody. say ""funny."""
58437,Marge,safe at last.
59683,Marge,"well, let me know when you get back to horror."
62906,Marge,"oh, i know all them!"
66551,Marge,"hm. well, that makes me feel better."
56950,Marge,oooh. these look good. guilt-free steakfish filets.
66201,Marge,come on! just pick one!
59832,Marge,"well, jack here will do great work for you."
55872,Marge,"knock, knock."
61817,Marge,fish scales?
60270,Marge,"sir, we know you're not an angel. my husband sees too many movies."
62641,Marge,not to mention this power point demonstration he did just last week.
66801,Marge,"homer, come here."
55497,Marge,i think you're making him angry.
66497,Marge,"how are you, milhouse?"
58953,Marge,"oh, thanks."
58555,Marge,"actually, it took fifty-three hours."
60544,Marge,"yeah! i did it! marge is in the house! or, i will be soon. 'cause it needs some cleaning!"
59557,Marge,"you should have asked first, bart. weddings are hard work and cost thousands of dollars."
65468,Marge,stop saying what you call things! i'm trying to watch the movie!
55033,Marge,"i need you to drive me to the doctor, homer."
67072,Marge,shouldn't we stop somewhere and ask for directions?
62715,Marge,"lookin' good, rod!"
66361,Marge,"bart, if this is what i think it is, it's not a place we should ever, ever take a little boy."
56256,Marge,"but, isn't that a sin?"
59869,Marge,"will you get serious, homer? i'd like to win at least once."
55070,Marge,"homer, do you know why i married you?"
67803,Marge,"ohhh.. my, you're burning up, and your cheeks are so swollen. i think you have the mumps. i'm calling doctor hibbert."
56566,Marge,"wait, some other stuff's coming back to me."
55604,Marge,"yes, but it was..."
59910,Marge,thank you so much for saving our son from that murderous mob.
65787,Marge,"look, before anyone says anything else, how could you possibly think you could get our kids?"
58650,Marge,he looks like an ordinary... ow! son of a--!
62194,Marge,"lisa, your date's here!"
63564,Marge,"dwight, do something!"
54795,Marge,xl.
55300,Marge,homer?
63234,Marge,"wait just a cotton-swabbing minute! a good man went to a lot of trouble just to impress you! and i went along with it, because i love him to pieces! and you made him look like a fool. well, i don't want you anywhere near my house!"
63796,Marge,"lisa, honey, just because you're a girl doesn't mean you can't join in the fun. maggie and i are washing the soiled foam fingers."
59065,Marge,"homer, you could've just unscrewed the bottom."
66947,Marge,i think it's under the short leg of the couch.
55364,Marge,i got the recipe from the utility grade beef counsel.
57444,Marge,"oh, good. that will give me time to add another coat of glaze to the ham."
63226,Marge,homer is so amazing! he can chug a beer and pitch woo at the same time.
55181,Marge,of course i saved them.
56283,Marge,"homer, i really appreciate you making dinner, but this food tastes a little strange."
67528,Marge,"no, maggie! bad baby!"
55440,Marge,"whoever you are, i have always depended on the kindness of strangers."
66482,Marge,"remember that sewing machine you say i never use? well, i sold it and bought this dress!"
63699,Marge,i can't wait to see my valentine's day surprise!
60680,Marge,"kids, your father made us breakfast."
54829,Marge,i told you kids you were going to send your father to the crazy house.
62772,Marge,"well, it's a cinch springfield won't be that lucky city."
63262,Marge,this disasterette was a real wake up call. we need to find a way to protect our irreplaceables!
64605,Marge,"that's drug talk! but i could be mistaken. let me just listen to a little more, out of context."
62801,Marge,"my friends call me ""marge""."
56174,Marge,"gosh, i thought he'd be happier in his true habitat."
65789,Marge,"homer, listen to the g.p.s."
54947,Marge,i am very upset with you.
65072,Marge,that was a mirror!
62579,Marge,"when i joined, i never thought we'd be robbing people."
59983,Marge,"bart, i told you not to get your lip disked."
63375,Marge,"that's it, buster -- you just bought yourself ten minutes watching that man make a wagon wheel."
62975,Marge,flowers every week! i wish i was dead.
54655,Marge,my hair!
55849,Marge,oooh!
60824,Marge,what position is this?
62347,Marge,"homer, before i take the kids, i want you to swear you're not up to something."
67392,Marge,"homer, all these flies."
65191,Marge,"don't be so jealous, homie, just because the kids are finally having fun doing something with me."
59685,Marge,"look, maggie. christopher walken's reading ""goodnight moon!"""
60826,Marge,paris?
58493,Marge,"well, you're not thomas edison."
58686,Marge,look out! behind you!
55502,Marge,"oh, homer."
58790,Marge,"you're a lifesaver, apu. all the other stores are closed."
63471,Marge,that doesn't sound like homer's usual annoyed grunt.
65010,Marge,a perfectly-good hot lather dispenser. i can't count the number of times homie's cried in anguish over his lukewarm lather.
63939,Marge,i'm just happy you're talking again. you didn't say a word for forty-five minutes.
61483,Marge,what's all that racket?!
56585,Marge,"all right, all right. it's lisa's turn."
66797,Marge,"fine, you can go to school!"
65042,Marge,"while your father and brother are doing some manly bonding in the woods, i thought we could do a little bonding of our own."
65864,Marge,"i thought you might be cold, honey, so i put this chinchilla coat on you."
60632,Marge,"wait, wait! that's a suggestion, not a threat!"
66073,Marge,"wait, wait, wait! let me get the stain out. but not here..."
65576,Marge,"homer, the reason i hate this car is... i think i want another baby!"
67587,Marge,i think it conveys a very nice message of sharing.
57476,Marge,but you're going to annoy thousands of people just to make a few measly dollars. it's nothing but panhandling!
58920,Marge,"oh, all right. good-bye, sweetheart, have a nice trip."
59666,Marge,"all right, but this better be the best toilet paper i've ever had."
66880,Marge,both.
59181,Marge,who could be calling at this hour?
66949,Marge,"he's a good boy now, and he's getting better, and sometimes even the best sheep stray from the flock and need to be hugged extra hard."
67847,Marge,"homer, this thing with your dad has had you moping around the house for days. i think it's time for you to talk to someone who understands."
63677,Marge,it's the first of the month. the day you promised to start your new diet.
63175,Marge,"this was my favorite seahorse. i called him mr. funnygoodfeeling... oh god, someone carved swastikas on your eyes!"
58152,Marge,good lord!
65562,Marge,"no, i'm here to buy one myself."
65960,Marge,that poor man. we've got to do something to change his life.
57242,Marge,selma! troy doesn't love you at all! he's only using you to squelch the rumors about his bizarre personal life and further his career!
64532,Marge,"it's okay, bart. just do a couple vocabulary words, then come have some milk and cookies."
56309,Marge,even on our jobs...
63704,Marge,"all right! this is a story of two dogs with a love so strong, no hose could separate them. i call it shady and the vamp..."
55066,Marge,homer... come home with me.
55150,Marge,i need a vacation.
63414,Marge,um... um...
65282,Marge,that's toothpaste!
54740,Marge,"homer, do you remember the way you acted at the party last night?"
62748,Marge,"oh, how nice for her!"
65215,Marge,a wife needs to tell her husband she was wrong!
56462,Marge,"hm, i better go check that out. now homer, don't you eat this pie."
57147,Marge,what about the symphony -- or the theater?
62495,Marge,i was really looking forward to it.
61443,Marge,"there, there, i can help you kids."
67688,Marge,i'm a political prisoner. last time i ever take a stand.
59248,Marge,"excuse me, where are your hamper lids?"
64443,Marge,tomato!
67909,Marge,yes.
64277,Marge,where every child was free to follow their dream. because nothing is... maggie! get away from there!
56648,Marge,coff - ee!
62584,Marge,all i wanted to do was join a group of women who wore the same outfits.
62351,Marge,"look, i know this wasn't the greatest outing, but your father meant well, so don't let him know that we didn't ."
57872,Marge,"no. no lisa, they're just... sleeping. upside down. and inside out."
59653,Marge,"what?! oh, why are the oafs always the first to go?"
65474,Marge,"homer, i'm a single mother trying to raise a family here."
59889,Marge,lisa!
62156,Marge,"we'll stop fighting, we promise!"
64606,Marge,"bart simpson, are you a drug-o?"
60512,Marge,"we're not paying our bill, so the phone company shut off our service."
56864,Marge,"i can't believe you vandalized your own home town, bart. what would jebediah springfield say?"
56577,Marge,kids can be so cruel.
67361,Marge,"homer, between your hair care products and new wardrobe, we're not saving anything for a rainy day?"
58921,Marge,"lisa, we got another postcard from your father!"
66211,Marge,on a friday afternoon?! i bet he's playing poker again!
66717,Marge,is that tea... adulterated?
57364,Marge,"moe, i'm so glad i found you. please promise me you won't let homer get hurt."
59738,Marge,ohhhh.
60371,Marge,"this family needs a live wire, but it's just not me."
61373,Marge,"it says ""yes on two thirty-two"". we want no on two thirty-two, yes on two forty-two."
67122,Marge,"homer, we're having dinner tonight at the singing sirloin."
65908,Marge,homer...
57801,Marge,"no, he's disappeared. oh, i'm in way over my head. i mean, where do the helpers turn when they need help?"
58507,Marge,they're terrible.
60222,Marge,"oh, he's leaving her with five babies."
67351,Marge,"hitler, north dakota?"
63582,Marge,"all those nights i thought you were out getting drunk, you were out killing people?!"
64904,Marge,maybe we could get back together...
66542,Marge,"oh! oh no, you're right, homer! abort! abort!"
58114,Marge,but i...
57470,Marge,we never will.
63562,Marge,"well this mom is not going to say bug-eye. i mean, goodbye."
67835,Marge,"homer, can't we place this ad after the dog fails his test?"
66588,Marge,lenny used the uck-word!
64537,Marge,i said he could take a break.
59606,Marge,"now, let's find out who this becky really is."
55594,Marge,"oh, please don't. for me?"
57995,Marge,homer! you said you got rid of the gun. you lied to me! again!
60057,Marge,"homer, this man is from the ""good guy"" awards."
58082,Marge,"why, yes it is..."
62729,Marge,now i really hope we win that contest.
61907,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
62512,Marge,yes.
60066,Marge,ohhh!
58567,Marge,it's almost as if he's killing from beyond the grave.
59716,Marge,"homer, bring that back in the house."
66439,Marge,we don't even get this many christmas cards.
57812,Marge,"how about...""mitzi""?"
55960,Marge,you like ballet?
62868,Marge,"i'm sorry. you seem like... a colorful character, but i just don't remember you."
62598,Marge,no wine for her -- she's only eight!
61819,Marge,you did it on purpose?
66419,Marge,i've got to get rid of this ugly chrome frame from kirk's bachelor bad. i hate to think of the things this mirror has reflected.
66129,Marge,sorry. dear god... you know which one i mean... thank you for returning our homie. he's still got a lot of unfinished business down here.
61113,Marge,that guy exploits his pets worse than bob guccione.
55312,Marge,"ah, that's sweet."
67473,Marge,the can is in the cupboard on the bottom shelf.
65920,Marge,i'm glad you're okay.
63700,Marge,a carnival? what's so romantic about this?
60452,Marge,"well, i think westerns are due for a comeback."
64043,Marge,homie! what are you doing home so early?
61474,Marge,hostess twinkies?
64566,Marge,"that's not bart, it's principal skinner. bart's sitting right next to you."
66391,Marge,you're both coming home with us!
63563,Marge,"boy, i really feel like a viking in this thing."
66563,Marge,sometimes the language on these gets a little b-l-u-e.
57776,Marge,"no, i... i... wait, i can't... i-- hello...?"
61054,Marge,bird...
60961,Marge,he should have done that with the real bart when he had the chance.
57740,Marge,"oh, he's so smart!"
65764,Marge,maybe we'd better go.
66634,Marge,"guys, this is gonna be hard for a while, but we'll get through this... as a family."
58363,Marge,"three, two, one..."
64248,Marge,macbeth!
62360,Marge,can he swim?
65665,Marge,"homer, i think we should go. we're not like these people."
67548,Marge,"for nonviolence, understanding and helping."""
65660,Marge,"and these fake movie reviews are so mean, it's hilarious."
62133,Marge,my scrimpings!
63490,Marge,"i'm sorry you got hurt, but you learned an important lesson. no one comes between me and my homie."
58764,Marge,"well, i guess your new name is really opening doors for you."
64416,Marge,which position should we try?
57245,Marge,"""parent's occupation... please note: homemaker is not allowed, as it is not real work. that's why you don't get paid for it."""
55847,Marge,i'm your new teacher. my name is mrs. simpson.
67324,Marge,wheeeee!
58803,Marge,"well, pretty much. except weekends."
59595,Marge,usurper! usurper! usurper!
54780,Marge,so maybe a part-time job is the answer.
60368,Marge,go around! go around!
54998,Marge,it's the miracle we've been waiting for.
66113,Marge,"well, i was trying to buy you snack cakes..."
64345,Marge,there must be another way...
56658,Marge,"no deal! this is my son we're talking about. sure he's not perfect, but who is in this work-a-day world?"
59657,Marge,"well, we're still poor, but thanks to your father, we'll never go hungry."
58931,Marge,"uhp. it's not a toy, lisa. we'll just have to wait until someone comes."
61718,Marge,"so we arranged to meet again at ""second date rock."""
55560,Marge,yeah...
63473,Marge,"homer, can't we please be alone? it's our anniversary."
58700,Marge,we'd better stop and get the car washed.
58863,Marge,no thanks. but thanks.
62442,Marge,"you sit in this oatmeal awhile, and it'll send your itchies packing! homer!"
56029,Marge,"exactly! so from now on, i'm going to quit nagging and have more fun."
62603,Marge,vendetta means... vendetta!
62869,Marge,what's snuggling?
60901,Marge,i don't have those kind of muscles.
67306,Marge,"but, homer, it's so expensive."
60884,Marge,i'm sending the cat up with your lunches.
55141,Marge,kids! hurry up or you're going to miss your bus!
67879,Marge,"mr. burns, she's just a baby."
62140,Marge,homer!
65756,Marge,i don't know if we're gonna be able to get out. what are you writing?
62075,Marge,no! i can't let this happen!
67476,Marge,it's in the second drawer from the right.
60882,Marge,amen. over.
59789,Marge,i'm a little disappointed. there were too many aprons.
63501,Marge,"ooo, edu-loving!"
60979,Marge,it's so exciting! it's like living in a dictionary.
57762,Marge,oh my goodness. kids! homer! we're late for church! i'm glad i dressed last night.
56831,Marge,"don't stop talking on account of me. i may be a cop, but i'm still your friend."
62856,Marge,who are those freaks?
60557,Marge,"good night, homer."
60592,Marge,"i just wish there was something we could do... oh. oh, homer, are you thinking what i'm thinking?"
65928,Marge,it sure has taken a beating over the years. might be time to get a new one...
62831,Marge,there. you're the perfect little he-she.
54991,Marge,"well homer, maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy."
63369,Marge,just let the chemicals deal with it.
57721,Marge,"you're the one the papers have been talking about. that mysterious ""beer baron"" who's been supplying springfield with alcohol! how have you been getting away with this?"
58400,Marge,"see, bart? there's another boy who played with glue."
58330,Marge,oh my god!
57937,Marge,"homer, you know how unpredictable the french are. one minute they're kissing a woman's hand, the next they're chopping off her head. what if they start a war?"
61098,Marge,but they're already acting like teenagers. lisa's with that boy... and look at maggie!
54916,Marge,"homer, maybe fame and fortune aren't as bad as they say."
59296,Marge,and the first step is an eye-catching resumé.
63170,Marge,"ooh, this is one of our trips to barnacle bay! we used to rent a beach house there every summer."
61623,Marge,"i won't let edna throw her life away for some passionless marriage where two people lie in bed together with no contact, whittling away the batteries until they die."
65323,Marge,"""my darling husband. this valentine's day, i have a present for you..."""
62765,Marge,well...
55441,Marge,now here's a tip from blanche you won't regret...
66866,Marge,"lenny said you were babysitting. and if you are babysitting, why can't you do some at home? i could use a night out."
63261,Marge,"it's okay, homie. you're probably just tired from not doing anything all day."
55700,Marge,"homer, there's a family of opossums in here!"
56757,Marge,"she's right, homer. there's something about his face i don't trust."
58191,Marge,it was wearing a hat!
55484,Marge,oh dear. it would be a shame if that pretty dress got wet.
64414,Marge,no... we could not.
60039,Marge,could i have a swirl of chocolate and vanilla?
59522,Marge,"well, we're still welcome in north dakota and arizona."
66167,Marge,it's bart!
67097,Marge,homer! were you planning on sitting in the car till the game was over?
60497,Marge,"well, it's easier to chew than that bambi video."
59496,Marge,"i trust you, honey."
55451,Marge,i'm tired of having this argument every sunday. get dressed.
65539,Marge,now what?
56633,Marge,i think i'll have some wine.
67502,Marge,"no, no, no! that won't do at all!"
60016,Marge,"we've gotta get to the hospital, homer!"
66481,Marge,"i know, homie. i know you well enough to know you're not ready to forgive me yet. but i also know you well enough to know that this will work."
61570,Marge,i don't know what to believe anymore.
56924,Marge,parents are not to communicate with children and must stay at least 100 feet away at all times...
60425,Marge,climb up!
55315,Marge,"oooh, there's krusty the clown! krusty, krusty, say something funny."
54893,Marge,"well, i knew his mother would come to her senses.."
65485,Marge,the guy from the movie?
62828,Marge,"when i was in school, i loved math. until..."
65318,Marge,"well, that's not true! everyone in this family is your friend."
61195,Marge,"moe, i gotta handle this. can you keep an eye on maggie?"
60101,Marge,oh my!
66308,Marge,"now remember, don't be the way you normally are, and sustain that for the rest of your life."
65887,Marge,this is the coolest sushi restaurant in town! it got three-and-a-half stars in the springfield tire guide!
61252,Marge,"lisa, what are you doing? this is the kind of troublemaking i expect from your brother."
62570,Marge,"oh, you guys make everything fun."
62432,Marge,"no!!! here, here play with your teddy bear."
63183,Marge,can i go again?
57572,Marge,"i should've said ""limit -- one per customer."""
57407,Marge,"""maison derriere""?! i can't believe there's a place like that in our wholesome little town. homer, did you know it was a burlesque house when you sent bart to work there?"
58673,Marge,"well, doctor hibbert said you have to build up your strength."
59320,Marge,go! go!
67575,Marge,excuse me. there is! i think that it's a bad influence on children.
64657,Marge,"a lot of people sound like sideshow bob, like frasier on ""cheers."""
64779,Marge,soy sauce!
58872,Marge,"now if you'll excuse me, i've got some dust that needs busting."
63013,Marge,"let's see what you've got... peanut butter and jelly sandwich, trail mix -- starring peanuts, good grief! more peanuts!"
64534,Marge,bart! put down those books and go play this instant!
55737,Marge,... we really appreciate your taking the children on such short notice.
63190,Marge,bart was on the boat?!
58305,Marge,"hello, ralph. when i was little, i used to play by myself, too."
62063,Marge,"oh no. oh no. why would it be? i love you and i love gay marriage, so i'd be a super-hypocrite if i didn't love your gay marriage. right?"
60508,Marge,"we've met you many times, ms. naegle. why do you keep changing jobs?"
58864,Marge,"well, somebody go first."
65574,Marge,what are you talking about?
60447,Marge,"aw, homie, you'll always be my western hero."
65015,Marge,what are you talking about?
60344,Marge,"pardon my french, but sometimes that man's a goofy-doofy."
62620,Marge,tire spikes?
67603,Marge,"aw, well isn't that nice."
67561,Marge,what do we want?
55892,Marge,"you got a letter too, bart."
64153,Marge,"homer, one thing i've learned is that you don't need a fancy wedding when you're marrying the man you love."
56511,Marge,so am i.
63346,Marge,"reverend lovejoy, our marriage needs this bed."
63043,Marge,i'm gonna go look at the new babies.
60382,Marge,artie made mega-bucks with a revolutionary invention -- a converter that changes that horrible modem noise into easy-listening music.
63447,Marge,"it's bad news, isn't it? i should never get my hopes up. nothing ever works out for us."
66039,Marge,"i know carl did you wrong, but is destroying something he cares that much about really going to make you feel good?"
57039,Marge,"oh, my little sugar-bug... i'm so glad you're safe..."
64830,Marge,homer? how did you get...?
62961,Marge,leave him alone!
56539,Marge,"mm, no, i don't need therapy, i'm fine. and it's too expensive."
62208,Marge,"i'm psychic. look, i don't know if i want a roofer who hangs out in bars."
60608,Marge,"well, your father ate it all."
57815,Marge,"calm down, homer. calm down. answer the door."
59356,Marge,does anybody need that much porno?
58964,Marge,"oooh, that's a tight squeeze."
65351,Marge,"moe, it's me, marge! i'm your friend!"
62083,Marge,"bart, lisa went over to janey's. quick, run inside and go potty!"
54817,Marge,"well then, i guess the moral is, ""no good deed goes unrewarded."""
60588,Marge,tell that woman it's over between you and her.
65083,Marge,"homie, are you even listening to me?"
59592,Marge,that's crazy.
61033,Marge,i didn't know mr. burns had an electric eel pond.
63038,Marge,perfect.
66022,Marge,confidence is so attractive in a man.
58869,Marge,"no, your father drives like an old lady."
64784,Marge,we'll know.
56328,Marge,but...
61752,Marge,"homer, we've got to get outta here."
55210,Marge,"children, that's not very nice."
67878,Marge,"what were you like as a boy, mr. burns? did you have a dog that you loved."
67453,Marge,i think it's terrible. a man opens his heart and you make fun of him.
61219,Marge,"bart, run like the wind!"
56253,Marge,get out!
60648,Marge,homer!
62197,Marge,"kids... i want you to know i've started seeing someone. he's from springfield, i think you know him..."
67751,Marge,"but homer, i'm afraid that cable has become an evil presence in our home."
58464,Marge,you mean this thing?
57615,Marge,well... i was thinking we could hire a nanny to help me out.
62356,Marge,away from you.
64349,Marge,it tastes like... cuddling! / it tastes like clean clothes!
66160,Marge,get up / everybody's gonna move their feet
65693,Marge,hurry up! i want to get grampa back here by three so we can get him and maggie on the same nap schedule.
60646,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so lucky to be married to such a selfless and loving man."
63636,Marge,let me get a good look at you!
62109,Marge,homie!
62602,Marge,uh-oh. he's getting that stabby look.
65019,Marge,they even have a day spa staffed by former all-pro linemen.
62706,Marge,maybe you'll run it in for a touchdown.
55748,Marge,"no, i just think you should talk to bart about-- good lord!"
54615,Marge,"yeah, sure."
59905,Marge,why do you want bart? he's not much of a singer.
67758,Marge,"well, don't give up. when you love somebody you have to have faith that in the end they will do the right thing."
58181,Marge,"kids, i made some lemonade for you."
60944,Marge,well here's another low-rated annual event -- spring cleaning!
63855,Marge,"sorry, sorry muscle spasm."
64266,Marge,"henry the fourth, part one... henry the fourth, part two..."
55461,Marge,"no, it's nothing bad. i'm just concerned, because my husband hasn't been attending your services lately."
65036,Marge,"dr. zander, what happened?"
59688,Marge,"sure, go ahead."
66950,Marge,"hello again, principal skinner."
55527,Marge,"bart, we're sending you to bed without your supper."
63241,Marge,i overslept!
64298,Marge,uh-huh...
55528,Marge,bart! stop being confident.
57561,Marge,"your franchise, how much?"
56749,Marge,"oh, homie, aren't they adorable?"
60842,Marge,"wow, this restaurant is so international. le pizza, der hamburger, señor grilled cheese... i hope i don't accidentally order an elephant."
57593,Marge,the answer is no.
58281,Marge,"kids, from now on, i don't want you touching anything in our house. dart!"
66320,Marge,"i don't understand what's so great about these state of the art, solar-powered, computo-glasses."
66312,Marge,and getting the termites out of the trees.
64400,Marge,"ned, there's only one man i should be eating whipped cream with."
59645,Marge,"maybe i'd better check mine. ""today, your husband will die."" homer, i'm scared."
55352,Marge,i don't know if that tape is working. you ate three desserts tonight.
59959,Marge,how are you supposed to dial?
57194,Marge,"but, you know, we realized we're more comfortable in a place like this."
66714,Marge,i'm not sure this campground is family-friendly.
54798,Marge,glow in the dark monster make-up.
62900,Marge,i remember everything -- you get drunk all the time!
54685,Marge,everything's fine! cupcakes and sprinkles!
64675,Marge,"homer, can we please find bart?"
58162,Marge,"homer, you sing all the time!"
58808,Marge,either put that book down or let me drive.
60135,Marge,"just, just let me get--"
55565,Marge,ow!
58584,Marge,i guess i've been in denial. homer... kang is maggie's father.
62782,Marge,grampa no!
55523,Marge,"well, we brought some pizza."
61927,Marge,shiner be gone.
64433,Marge,he does all the time. you just never listen.
61137,Marge,when will they stop?
59766,Marge,look at those exotic positions.
57332,Marge,"i'm sorry, honey. the waffle iron's in the shop."
58132,Marge,how do you think i felt?
65598,Marge,it sure was nice to have a day together as a couple.
57396,Marge,"ohhh! give yourself up, homie!"
60012,Marge,where did it go?
65883,Marge,splatter?
60620,Marge,fine. i'll go talk to her.
58232,Marge,"no, no, no. just the first two."
66921,Marge,go get your money.
58802,Marge,eighteen hours? nobody works that hard.
66924,Marge,"oh, bart, that's so sweet. it's the best present a mother could get and it makes you look so dangerous."
57722,Marge,"homer, that's very clever!"
62536,Marge,"let's see... what would be a good duet? hmm... ""just the two of us""... ""you and me against the world""... ""ebony and ivory""..."
57502,Marge,"all right, i was trying to keep it from you, but i had a good reason. every time you go to that cook-off, you get drunk as a poet on payday. remember last year?"
58362,Marge,bart!
59662,Marge,"geez, you just have to remember three extra numbers."
56680,Marge,"so homer, how'd you do?"
54629,Marge,there will too be women astronauts!
62781,Marge,"grampa, killing yourself is a sin! god wants us to die of old age, after years of pain and reduced mobility!"
62068,Marge,whoa! save something for your wedding night.
66417,Marge,"oh please, homie..."
55697,Marge,it frightens me that you want to work on something that's so unsafe.
57979,Marge,bart!
64586,Marge,and just what might that be?
54690,Marge,homer?! i wasn't expecting you.
62719,Marge,"she's kissing his boo-boo! that's it, i'm going in."
54592,Marge,video games and too much beer. you sure know how to show a girl a good time.
62409,Marge,look who's sleeping in our bed again.
55255,Marge,what's that?
63440,Marge,wow. is it much different from a normal plane?
59993,Marge,"it's kind of you to take us in, dr. bushwell."
66257,Marge,"we can't afford christmas. and when you can't afford christmas, you've failed as a family. that's what all the big stores say."
57618,Marge,"homer, if you're going to do this to every applicant, we're never going to find one."
57883,Marge,that's not a funny story.
62149,Marge,i'll have you know i could have married sideshow mel!
66331,Marge,"okay, marge simpson, entering the matrix, for a brownie recipe."
55399,Marge,"i'm sorry, honey."
57558,Marge,"i'm sorry, agnes."
60554,Marge,where did you get that suit?
56312,Marge,"no, think about people. about moments in your life that have been very romantic."
58004,Marge,c-u-p! i wanna c-u-... oh my god!
56409,Marge,"oh my. lisa, go to your room."
63561,Marge,can you at least put it in your jacket?
60920,Marge,club soda will get that blood out.
63807,Marge,"lisa, how could you?"
64354,Marge,"eh, well..."
58303,Marge,ralph certainly has a lot of imagination.
58995,Marge,"and picasso started out painting realistically, then moved on to cubism. by the end of his life, he was just painting crank letters to the editor. they call it his ""angry jerk"" period."
62318,Marge,think of the leg up you'd have!
58695,Marge,homer!
57146,Marge,"really? you like it? oh, i'd love to wear this someplace special."
64773,Marge,the pie was poisoned. you were right! i guess we've got to kill him before he kills us.
61303,Marge,you and lisa better go find homes for these puppies -- and don't just dump them all off on some crazy lady.
56406,Marge,"are you two bonkers? we almost got killed, not to mention all the embarrassment i suffered."
65267,Marge,i just got a message from maggie in my brain.
56068,Marge,yeah.
60556,Marge,"homie, i don't mean to nag, but what does this have to do with healing your eyes?"
62242,Marge,you didn't validate my parking.
56625,Marge,"homer, what if this doesn't work?"
67809,Marge,oh dear.
64811,Marge,"uh-huh, yeah. here's your breakfast."
61894,Marge,this is the most exciting scandal since the juice was on the loose.
62764,Marge,"there, there. god, i miss homer."
63809,Marge,thank god they're not jeering at us anymore.
55102,Marge,"oh, look at that, a shoe box house. lisa, you're so clever."
59061,Marge,"well, maybe for your wedding!"
67073,Marge,my feet are getting wet!
63506,Marge,maggie's crying!
63283,Marge,i can't fill out that clipboard. i... don't have email.
59854,Marge,"yes, it says here he's the movie magician behind ""creepshow,"" ""friday the 13th"" and ""dawn of the dead."""
63884,Marge,bart's been moving nonstop all afternoon. maybe there's too much sugar in his sugar-frosted candy o's.
54669,Marge,"promenade? with you? forget it, bub!"
66503,Marge,"no, i'm going to join him forever."
66382,Marge,"kids, today we have a very special guest -- my husband."
67162,Marge,"oh, that's very funny."
54905,Marge,"krusty, why don't you tell us what's wrong? you'll feel better."
55694,Marge,"homer, no..."
62927,Marge,"i can't wait to see what evolution will make next: maybe a bird with a people face, or a bear with pants on!"
62290,Marge,"homer, i'm glad you're getting exercise, i just wish it wasn't crazy exercise."
55146,Marge,homer? is that you?
59209,Marge,maybe it needs more fertilizer.
59550,Marge,"lisa's gone berserk! do something, homer! do something!"
58177,Marge,you don't deserve an allowance.
58376,Marge,that's what i call break-neck speed.
63799,Marge,although it was suspiciously pro-lawnmower.
61701,Marge,"so... pie man, why don't you show me your superpowers? pie man?"
62648,Marge,bag or keister?
55444,Marge,blanche.
61745,Marge,"homeland noodles with uncle sam balls? apu, aren't you going a bit overboard with the patriotism?"
59460,Marge,oh!
62301,Marge,a tv shark is not a babysitter!
65737,Marge,"""burly paper towels, burlyville, minnesota. dear sir or madam: your paper towel packets promised a hundred and two sheets of towels. but i was blessed to receive one hundred and three. i'm returning the extra towel, unused..."""
57757,Marge,"yeah, he's broke!"
55286,Marge,her manager? that's ridiculous. i won't allow you to spend any more time away from your family.
55991,Marge,i hit it! i hit it!
62508,Marge,no.
66456,Marge,"yeah, i was a little surprised i wasn't considered before. todo o meu marido se preocupa é ser um herói para sua filha. por favor, perdoa-lhe."
55160,Marge,whenever she needs it.
55083,Marge,wha'd you say? i can't understand you with all that distortion.
67680,Marge,i'm for equal rights. but do we really need a whole amendment?
65629,Marge,what does that mean?
59414,Marge,you're on fire!
65929,Marge,"are there any two words more exciting than ""couch shopping?"""
58805,Marge,you don't know what they're saying.
65622,Marge,hello? rita lafleur? did you know a man named abe simpson?
58168,Marge,"actually, we're done."
58586,Marge,"there i was, having a great time in the back yard, when without warning, i was abducted by aliens."
60224,Marge,this is the worst thing you've ever done.
55268,Marge,maybe we could see something a little more adult.
67093,Marge,why should i feel like a traffic cop every sunday morning when i'm just trying to get a little goodness into the family.
58691,Marge,nah!
66473,Marge,"well, i was just trying to--"
55357,Marge,"how was your day at work, dear?"
58350,Marge,"oh, for pete sakes. why is that monkey wearing a diaper? i thought he was housebroken."
55992,Marge,"phht, it's only midnight. come on, i know a place."
57374,Marge,i feel sorry for everyone who's cooped up inside watching the seventh game of the world series!
60453,Marge,you care about bart's feelings.
67062,Marge,"i'm sorry, but this is more important than that silly, loud game."
59576,Marge,"well, no kicking. it's too dangerous."
56499,Marge,"is there something wrong, homie?"
65275,Marge,i just got a b-mail from maggie -- she's gone into labor!
56048,Marge,yes.
60454,Marge,i think we should try to restore bart's faith in buck. and we could start by getting buck to quit drinking.
66427,Marge,how about this... what if we give the van houtens twenty-five percent of the money?
63269,Marge,that's why i got duplicates!
61744,Marge,i'll have you know i am very well liked in springfield.
55310,Marge,white. and what would you like for appetizers?
66842,Marge,"i've printed out our driving plan! if we work together, we can get bart to his sports...lisa to her music...and maggie to the five birthday parties she's invited to today."
65228,Marge,if you kissed her that would be lovely.
66806,Marge,"oh, so good to have you back."
61723,Marge,"no, homer."
57195,Marge,"oh, isn't that somewhat unusual?"
57468,Marge,"oh, homie. i know you love me. we don't need to get married again."
62562,Marge,"no, i don't. i'm still upset about what happened today. i don't have many friends and when i finally start to make some, you ruin it!"
67011,Marge,are we cured yet?
64814,Marge,"we'd love to send you here, sweetie. we just can't afford it."
67390,Marge,"oh, don't call me lady. my name is marge simpson, this is my family and we're not going anywhere. we're all going to have to live together, so you better get used to it... please."
62793,Marge,red lobster?
66490,Marge,you're alive! but how?
62410,Marge,"i spy with my little eye, a girl who's not sleeping in her room like she promised."
66522,Marge,we're going to that game party and we're going to be charming and witty.
56102,Marge,the best performance of your life?
65954,Marge,"all right, at least i can delete these westminster dog shows."
64852,Marge,we know. and we're going to do something about it.
66214,Marge,"homer! i know you're here, your car's outside!"
60345,Marge,"you know, tomorrow is the annual springfield formal event. we weren't going to go, after last year's... unpleasantness."
66651,Marge,oh. now i completely understand you.
64802,Marge,"oh, that's ancient history. ooh, here's my paper on ancient history."
60952,Marge,but there must be some sort...
59895,Marge,"once again, i'm outraged by this last-minute switch."
63495,Marge,"come on, sweetie. everyone's going to sleep."
60900,Marge,wow!
65987,Marge,that's okay. i...
58137,Marge,tap the brakes! tap the brakes!
60244,Marge,just do it. do it. do it now!
56573,Marge,"oh, homer. don't start stalking people again. it's so illegal. remember when you were stalking charles kuralt because you thought he dug up your garden?"
55784,Marge,"i'm proud of you, homie."
60865,Marge,oh no! i pepper sprayed ralph!
62815,Marge,i'm just trying to take the pressure off of you.
57215,Marge,"ah, poor homie. poor, poor..."
58641,Marge,why don't you play with one of bart's video games instead? hugh downs says they're the latest craze.
62574,Marge,"ooh! well, now i really hope my chute opens!"
60264,Marge,let's stick to original monopoly -- the game is crazy enough as it is.
55719,Marge,if you don't mind! we're on our way to a funeral.
63066,Marge,don't you dare go limp!
58241,Marge,"willie, i'm not sure we're making any headway here."
59235,Marge,hello? homer? where are you? you promised you were going to have a tea party with maggie.
55598,Marge,"well, who was it?"
62704,Marge,chocks?! why don't we try it... freestyle.
67778,Marge,"c'mon, patty. you don't want to show up looking like yosemite sam."
59730,Marge,mmm.
58857,Marge,s.u.v. coming through. open up for marge. thank you! whoaaa! daylight! c'mon. c'mon.
57650,Marge,"it's not your fault, homer. it's those lousy writers. they make me madder than a, um... yak in heat!"
65730,Marge,"you're a good man, homer simpson."
62998,Marge,what are those noises? they sounded zoological!
65638,Marge,"homer, pay attention!"
58855,Marge,nobody will ever cut me off again!
58714,Marge,"homer, would you please stop talking about the children's graves?"
55479,Marge,"oh, i don't know that she's as attractive as jack nicklaus..."
66561,Marge,the water's gonna get cold!
67089,Marge,"very nice, maggie. and lisa you look lovely. bart, assume the position."
59711,Marge,really? like what?
63196,Marge,"well, let me tell you a story about a time revenge brought only unhappiness and misery. it happened many years ago in paris--"
55324,Marge,we'll discuss it later. is milhouse okay?
62315,Marge,"bart, get your things. you're leaving with me!"
67768,Marge,...to be called up whenever and for whatever reason i desire.
57198,Marge,no.
61084,Marge,i am so sick of that song!
57767,Marge,"no, no, i don't feel like going to a trash pile today."
60898,Marge,you've just been marge-inalized!
67074,Marge,"we all are, dear. your father says there's nothing to worry about."
63717,Marge,"now that's enough, you each got one in."
55717,Marge,the funeral's in little neck falls. looks like we'll have to go to duff gardens another time.
59186,Marge,who's going to clean up all those jets?
65317,Marge,"it seemed a little... ""ripe"", so i brought it home to clean it for you."
55039,Marge,"""marge, from the first moment i saw you i never wanted to be with anyone else. i don't have much to offer you... except all my love. will you marry me?"""
63707,Marge,stop it! stop it!
57855,Marge,"""you are my sunshine, my only sunshine / you make me happy, when skies are gray / you'll never know, dear / how much i love you / so don't take my sunshine away..."""
59419,Marge,that's right.
65682,Marge,stay back! you know i'll use this... because you saw me using it.
62978,Marge,"i've tried to make those, but they always end up as brownies."
57917,Marge,"that's wonderful! but still, can't you do anything for bart?"
56026,Marge,i'm watching a videotape that could change our lives.
64100,Marge,if i'm more relaxed i'll be a better mom! can we? can we?
60400,Marge,"artie, that's a sick idea. come on, homer, we're leaving."
61696,Marge,"well, whoever he is, the pie man would never cave in to blackmail."
55353,Marge,there's another thing i've been wanting to talk to you about...
57247,Marge,"of course! of course! i would never, ever have thought of that!"
56709,Marge,why don't we all take a five minute break? it'll clear our heads.
59467,Marge,i don't remember the air in the kitchen being so wavy. good lord - that's gas!
60987,Marge,hold your horses. i was up all night fishing out the drawstring from your father's swimsuit.
56357,Marge,"no, oh, artie!"
55211,Marge,"oh, dear."
63152,Marge,don't you defend him! i want that mooch out of my house right now!
60442,Marge,"hurry up, bart, or you'll be late to be killed by the dog."
63656,Marge,impossible! their commercial featured a talking frog.
61430,Marge,and you're fine with me trying to get it published?
58502,Marge,"turn it off, homer."
58394,Marge,bart! what have i told you about throwing money away at that joke shop?
55148,Marge,that's nice. do you think you could loosen my cuffs?
60593,Marge,"tonight, we invite both manjula and apu for dinner, but we don't tell them the other one's coming."
59130,Marge,it's not dope! it's something to help you concentrate.
64005,Marge,i'm just trying to--
55654,Marge,everyone agreed that lisa was a beautiful baby...
59182,Marge,it's impossible. i killed you.
61350,Marge,her name is lisa. and i wouldn't trade her for all the sleep-in sundays and speed dating in the world.
60609,Marge,you'll get the hang of it. today's just a little gusty.
66630,Marge,"why, why does this have to be so hard?"
55801,Marge,lisa needs braces.
55280,Marge,homer! where did you get that suit?
63462,Marge,be my guest.
57821,Marge,he doesn't hate you. he just feels insecure because you're getting through life so easily and it's been so difficult for him.
56277,Marge,does that earring mean you're a pirate?
62651,Marge,what are you talking about?
57547,Marge,"i guess i'm just not comfortable with the whole idea of ""investing""..."
67300,Marge,leave pedro?
57841,Marge,"well, it's time to say ""good night."""
55420,Marge,"stanley stop, or i'll tell stella."
57090,Marge,goodnight.
55231,Marge,"no, maggie!"
59284,Marge,all it takes is the right cleanser and a little elbow grease.
58073,Marge,"oh, thank you bart, thank you lisa, for all your help!"
63329,Marge,"well, maybe if you go..."
59564,Marge,let me talk to otto.
60636,Marge,i can't believe we've been arrested for murder.
67676,Marge,pick one.
60702,Marge,that explains that.
63596,Marge,why don't you wear a tie that goes with my eyes?
64392,Marge,hi ned. where are the boys?
67838,Marge,"well, you certainly captured the moment. hmmm ."
57347,Marge,"i can't believe it! i've done all my housework and it's only 9:30! well, better go upstairs and make sure the beds are still made."
56234,Marge,"oh homie, if you feel so bad about yourself, there's always things you can do to feel better."
57135,Marge,president bush is driving on our lawn! he must be lost.
57262,Marge,there. now that gum should lift right out.
63727,Marge,the load is on the road.
54751,Marge,"now, if maggie runs a fever, you call this number. if she sticks her finger in an electrical socket, call this number. and if she drinks pine cleanser, call this..."
60083,Marge,"gee, you strangle him all the time, and that never happens."
60046,Marge,mm. that sounds perfect!
62098,Marge,"mind your manners, lisa."
56407,Marge,"you know, you're right. this truly was the best vacation ever. now, let us never speak of it again."
67611,Marge,"that's right, he did. excuse me, but dr. hibbert has been our family physician for years, and he thought bart was fine."
67401,Marge,like what?
65232,Marge,that's because it would kill you.
65915,Marge,it's a snuggle dungeon!
63858,Marge,i hid it all in the one place you'd never look.
63981,Marge,"lisa, add another name to our christmas card list. next to our jewish friends. where is lisa?"
63452,Marge,"homie, what are you doing? you don't know how to fly!"
63532,Marge,"well, if i know doctors, he's probably golfing."
66689,Marge,homer! homer. i think there's someone downstairs.
63943,Marge,uh... the same thing you're doing here.
66372,Marge,"no! i'm not giving up on reaching those kids, and i might just have a secret weapon."
58776,Marge,"oh, no!"
57522,Marge,...and you're from mars.
57727,Marge,"you've made some money and had the fun of being a wanted criminal. why not quit now, while you're ahead?"
63315,Marge,i think i'll go to bed.
62349,Marge,fros-ty! where's your magic top hat?
64351,Marge,"i stopped my crying / why, i don't know / but this rosey, cozy, bubbles-in-my-nose-y / makes me wanna have... mo'!"
65601,Marge,just yell across the house like you do everything else!
56063,Marge,"i wonder if they have a lost and found. oh, what the hey."
64769,Marge,why did you do that?
55314,Marge,bart! stop that.
58456,Marge,"homer, a hand!"
67804,Marge,"well, then, feed him!"
60960,Marge,"oh honey, i can't believe this is happening. i'll miss you so much."
58789,Marge,"oh, i'll make the whole thing."
57104,Marge,"i love you so much, my little bitty barty."
64390,Marge,you two are going out? i thought i told you the flanderses were coming over to dinner.
62316,Marge,"bart, i love you. but sometimes i don't love your choices. now we have to find another school for you."
60949,Marge,"honey, you did have a great time doing those commercials. and you made a lot of money."
57820,Marge,"you'll have to face him sometime. and when you do, i'm sure he'll be just as anxious to make up as you are."
54966,Marge,"what's the matter, can't you find a hair style you like?"
66787,Marge,i thought you were going to try to relax.
60409,Marge,where are you taking me?
67149,Marge,"no... no, thank you, mr... uh... ... brunswick."
57611,Marge,it's my hair. excuse me.
64042,Marge,"oh homie, the insurance bill is due today. can you make sure to mail it?"
56520,Marge,you didn't want to have bart.
56802,Marge,oh for crying out loud...
66890,Marge,this is all my fault.
62368,Marge,"well what if by harming a manatee you could save two manatees? but before you answer, consider this: the manatee you'd have to harm is pregnant."
60476,Marge,so you've settled for branson.
64488,Marge,"homer, while you were imagining what the winter olympics were, seymour said we were all going to the olympic trials!"
63345,Marge,there it is -- ol' bounce 'n' giggle.
66867,Marge,"really? awag? really? well, if you think tha--"
58323,Marge,we don't have a clapper.
59454,Marge,she's president of the united states.
63153,Marge,"that's right! i just found my gumption, and i like it!"
63368,Marge,"next time maggie does that in a pool, tell me quietly, don't announce it."
59651,Marge,"well, i've got a whole list of chores: clean the garage, paint the house, grout the tu--"
66203,Marge,you can have one of these!
62455,Marge,i learned about it in here.
64361,Marge,now who has ideas for this year's fundraiser?
63143,Marge,"it's true -- i do have trouble saying ""no."" it all started when i was seven..."
54920,Marge,now hadn't you better get ready for school?
67254,Marge,"yes, bart."
58126,Marge,we were robbed?
61965,Marge,what's going on here?
61229,Marge,ta-da!
62365,Marge,"listen, buster. i had to buy a club soda i didn't want to get change for this phone!"
56876,Marge,"this is my fault. i tried to teach bart about town pride, but the power of my words filled him with a sort of madness."
60286,Marge,our plan worked perfectly.
64375,Marge,cuddling's for after.
55116,Marge,bart?
62767,Marge,lisa! what are you doing in the nutmeg state?
63690,Marge,but our happiness was about to unravel just like kevin costner's career: because of the postman.
59859,Marge,"you know, a tennis court can really make your house look classy. i hear mel brooks has one. i mean, sir mel brooks."
60707,Marge,get in.
62302,Marge,homer!
63373,Marge,"you should've seen the faces of your children when they caught you stealing. kids, get in here and show your father the faces!"
55646,Marge,"anyway, bart had just entered the ""terrible twos."""
57831,Marge,i know. and i made your favorite --
66647,Marge,yesterday's whatsit? why does everyone go to them?
60236,Marge,"you know, lisa, around here, buddhists don't get any desserts in their lunches."
65481,Marge,don't give me that load of--
67530,Marge,"well, you won't be watching these cartoons anymore. ever."
66241,Marge,you don't hear me listening to the thompson twins anymore. although...
59507,Marge,a diner!?
66475,Marge,homie! you look like an n.b.a. coach!
62372,Marge,huh.
67508,Marge,"homer, drive defensively."
59812,Marge,"yeah, see how much better that feels?"
56051,Marge,"good news, honey. two weeks are up. you don't have to wear your glasses anymore. and your scalp and posture seem fine."
66488,Marge,if you could just ease up on the eating after three a.m. that's all i ask...
59028,Marge,"oh, look! there's the store where i buy my yarn. but you don't want to buy your buttons there."
66042,Marge,"let's just enjoy our happiness, homie. accidental motherhood is the greatest thing that can happen to a woman. and i think bart's finally outgrown his misbehavior."
66474,Marge,hair volumizer... cologne?
60231,Marge,oh no...
63189,Marge,"oh homie, i'm so worried. but if i concentrate, our love is so strong, i know i can hear your thoughts."
66510,Marge,why can't kids still watch captain kangaroo?
67568,Marge,no! you're ruining the show. oh... oh... oh. stop.
57752,Marge,"well, i'm sorry!"
64629,Marge,"although i guess this would teach her sharing and caring, but... we're going home."
65271,Marge,"sweetie, i've been waiting to hear you say that for so long. although you could've waited till morning..."
55292,Marge,what does that mean?
66327,Marge,yoink!
60746,Marge,what if i just do aerobics and ...
65620,Marge,got it. papadapaconstanti-kasgianopolopodopotopolis.
65255,Marge,"isn't that just a rip-off of ""the honeymooners?"""
62202,Marge,"you know homer, i let a lot of things slide, but when you can't keep a roof over your family's head, you're just not much of a father."
57687,Marge,"we're very proud of you, by the way."
65365,Marge,look! a shooting star!
59263,Marge,"i knew you had your hands full with the babies, so i baked you some banana bread."
67191,Marge,"oh... yes, hello, helen."
62489,Marge,"for the last time, no!"
59303,Marge,"oh, homie."
58834,Marge,what in blazes?
66948,Marge,and a short temper.
60972,Marge,"i'm just happy you're excited about something besides saving the whales. face it, they're doomed!"
63191,Marge,homer!
54953,Marge,homer...
67026,Marge,a bully?!
58772,Marge,"aren't you coming, ed?"
59147,Marge,and their beams.
54856,Marge,i think it means he's having a barbecue.
55972,Marge,"well, you were unlucky, but there are a lot of good men out there."
56502,Marge,no!
65513,Marge,it's about not agreeing on something.
56925,Marge,i can't believe i put my own pleasure ahead of my home and family. that is so like me.
57295,Marge,"girls, lisa. boys kiss girls."
63735,Marge,"there were so many things i wanted to do in life that i never got a chance to do: doctor , safecracker , stethoscope sales lady ... none came to pass. but the thing i really wanted to be, ever since i was little, was a ballerina!"
65901,Marge,why are all his laundry basket shots three point attempts?
60330,Marge,mm. i guess you just can't use the law to nag. maybe i should just stop trying to change the world.
65833,Marge,he's ten years old!
60166,Marge,it's about time mr. burns found a woman. i can't stand to see a man single.
66770,Marge,homer... homer...
63491,Marge,oh but wednesday's not good for me.
62879,Marge,that sounds horrible!
64761,Marge,"homie, help him up!"
67633,Marge,some string beans?
62214,Marge,"oh, he must smell leftovers."
62550,Marge,you what?!
58679,Marge,no.
66262,Marge,"homer simpson! ask yourself -- ""w.w.b.j.d.?"""
55806,Marge,that doesn't sound like they like you at all.
64572,Marge,"homie, just tell them what they wanna hear!"
66629,Marge,"thank you, homie."
57501,Marge,"no, homie, wait!"
58250,Marge,"have a great weekend, kids! be nice to the underprivileged countries."
66204,Marge,again? i was hoping you could spend some time with the kids.
62534,Marge,"hello, bart. just so you know, i sold our bike."
54764,Marge,homer?
56994,Marge,"i'd like to, honey, but i'm not sure how. your father can be surprisingly sensitive. remember when i giggled at his sherlock holmes hat? he sulked for a week and then closed his detective agency."
65897,Marge,lousy.
64325,Marge,i knew it!
66760,Marge,"well, he's not in the neon sign store."
55200,Marge,"oh, that's very good, lisa."
59704,Marge,"you are not pretending to be dead, young lady. this family has had nothing but bad luck when it comes to farce."
59036,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry, but... oh, it really is."
67933,Marge,"then ""yes"" -- hither me forth on mine arduous quest!"
57018,Marge,i just don't think you should get too excited about the woman who abandoned you for twenty-five years. you could get hurt again.
65734,Marge,and this goes too.
59033,Marge,where'd you get that champagne?
54791,Marge,a-positive.
63805,Marge,we never get more than one move into this game.
65765,Marge,"i think it's time to go ""off family."""
57288,Marge,oh. here we go.
60862,Marge,"look, this really made me feel vulnerable. i want to know how soon you think you'll catch this guy."
65644,Marge,i don't care for silent auctions. it just encourages hovering.
61945,Marge,"oh, bart, honey i'm so sorry."
59613,Marge,"ooboy, my bad. becky, i'm so sorry i accused you of trying to kill me and steal my family."
62230,Marge,"homer, how did you think i'd feel when i saw that?"
58066,Marge,selling real estate could be just what i'm looking for. i'd really like to give it a try.
56358,Marge,"now, really, i mean it. now stop it!"
64438,Marge,and i even got rainbow sprinkles!
62045,Marge,homer!
66670,Marge,"so. he likes ghosts better, eh? fine."
59189,Marge,"oh, all right."
54816,Marge,"homer, it's the thought that counts. the moral of this story is, ""a good deed is its own reward."""
67517,Marge,are you all right?
66996,Marge,ohh!
56973,Marge,sometimes.
63719,Marge,"go, go, go, go, go!"
65542,Marge,looks like the red light's on.
57469,Marge,what?
67051,Marge,"well you do, don't you?"
65329,Marge,don't panic. this can be separated out. quick! does anyone have a centrifuge?!
59691,Marge,with a song about thrift!
59358,Marge,so he's stuck like this forever?
67457,Marge,hmmm. i was going to wash my hair.
60003,Marge,"they also make ""juice-lix."""
66455,Marge,um... deixar meu marido sozinho!
54810,Marge,"homer, i don't think it's in the cornstarch canister."
58670,Marge,"oh, that's cute. did you get it in the souvenir shop?"
58481,Marge,"i made you some homemade pepsi for the dance. it's a little thick, but the price is right."
56040,Marge,that's not fair. the lesson here is that self-improvement is better left to people who live in big cities.
60905,Marge,"no, no!"
63487,Marge,"i'm so tense, i can't enjoy count almaviva serenading the intended bride of dr. bartolo. i just can't."
64952,Marge,and a completely new hairstyle!
63338,Marge,"now, thanks to you, my special little guy will be haunted by this for the rest of his life."
64654,Marge,"and where there's exotic fish, there's gotta be a..."
59790,Marge,there's so much evil in the world.
55989,Marge,"you're not going to hunt me for sport, are you?"
64960,Marge,neither did i. i didn't want to know what color the statue of liberty was. but you know what? i was wrong. and these ladies are too.
62418,Marge,four thousand dollars?!
66652,Marge,get the first aid kit!
64759,Marge,"oh homie, what a great idea to take a cruise in uncharted waters."
56931,Marge,this is so humiliating.
65531,Marge,"no, lisa! if you click that turnstile, it'll blow our budget!"
58954,Marge,"oh, how cute. let's call this little guy a ""groundhog..."""
61529,Marge,"oh my. well, homer, maybe you should take him to moe's."
66687,Marge,you always do the right thing... sort of.
56816,Marge,no.
61336,Marge,i got the roofi tickets!
61827,Marge,even the pope couldn't forgive this pizza... and he's letting a lot of things slide these days.
54748,Marge,grampa?
66424,Marge,but the van houtens are our friends!
57110,Marge,"no, i will not pay you five hundred dollars for sex!!"
58211,Marge,no fires.
57337,Marge,"we have roots here, homer. we have friends and family and library cards... bart's lawyer is here."
61317,Marge,isn't it kind of dry?
63792,Marge,trust me.
64188,Marge,"well, i..."
56428,Marge,donut? what's a donut?
67307,Marge,"oh, oh, homer. i feel giddy. wait, what about a babysitter?"
67166,Marge,"hm, very smooth."
60441,Marge,"nice try. but we're still going to ""riverdance""."
55445,Marge,"yeah, go on."
57491,Marge,i'm sure your insurance will cover the house.
61967,Marge,m631700000642j?! this is a new loan tracking number -- you got a new mortgage?
59114,Marge,"according to the map, this house is owned by the dog from ""frasier."" and that's where ellen degeneres and anne heche live."
58899,Marge,this sounds juicy.
67182,Marge,i don't think so.
64447,Marge,homer! where are you?
54790,Marge,"lisa, we did the best we could... what's a zebu?"
55658,Marge,"lisa, time for your feed --"
61801,Marge,"when virginia woolf wrote ""every woman needs a room of one's own,"" she must have been talking about the kitchen."
61686,Marge,let's see how your sister's doing in the place-setting competition.
67367,Marge,"oh, homer. your job has always put food on our table, and the kids'll get over it."
55123,Marge,"ooh, perfume. meryl streep's ""versatility."""
56853,Marge,i don't think that's a very good idea.
58233,Marge,"look, let's the three of us try it together."
65738,Marge,a pillowcase full of quarters?! where did you get that money and what have you done with the pillows?!
59555,Marge,no knife games on the kitchen table!
65577,Marge,i do!
66963,Marge,"well, come on, you two. don't forget about the film festival."
59478,Marge,"well, if barney's that important to you, you've gotta work it out. old friends stick together, like o.j. and a.c., or the falcon and the snowman."
60830,Marge,and the state of florida.
67388,Marge,look at me. i've never been so angry. my hands are shaking.
60528,Marge,works for me.
62750,Marge,no!
55252,Marge,"we all have to make sacrifices, dear. maggie's baby clothes will have to last for a little longer..."
55142,Marge,get out.
60704,Marge,"oh, homie..."
61845,Marge,he sure is -- if he can keep up with these party animals!
58366,Marge,"homer, this has gone far enough. will you please just apologize to the garbage men?"
64824,Marge,"i don't know, compliment his glasses."
55953,Marge,this is dangerous. i wish we could have found a sitter for maggie.
58539,Marge,what are those cats doing behind you?
57241,Marge,selma... about you and troy. we're not sure he's... all he seems.
59638,Marge,"oh, save it for your next book, you little snitch!"
63613,Marge,"look maggie, i'm wonder woman."
58463,Marge,just grab 'em!
57513,Marge,"no beer, huh? i guess i know what a promise from homer j. simpson is worth."
66340,Marge,everything in the newspaper makes him mad.
62618,Marge,"voila! which is french for ""ta da""!"
64313,Marge,that flattens my soda pop! you're on!
63268,Marge,our new photos are back!
59581,Marge,"yes, i hate when things get worn out... hmm... socks... welcomes..."
57116,Marge,who knocked down the pins?
56461,Marge,"lemme give my special little winner a big, big hug."
57791,Marge,hello. listen lady.
59208,Marge,i'll repress the rage i'm feeling.
64942,Marge,"hey, they're your gutters too."
61746,Marge,uh oh. poonam and uma are fighting!
56988,Marge,here's your lemonade and here's your beer.
56248,Marge,homer!
61840,Marge,"thanks, honey, for saving me from myself."
61970,Marge,i would like it. you never come to my mother's.
61262,Marge,that sounds great -- but only if your father promises to behave.
56076,Marge,homer! what is it? slow down.
65424,Marge,do a lot of people pay?
63109,Marge,it's in that dumpster.
57928,Marge,balzac!
61667,Marge,here's to life without children!
62838,Marge,"""a highly skilled professional will come to your home, and clean it top to bottom while you relax."" but how could i have won? i don't subscribe to this periodical."
65417,Marge,mike's hard!
66798,Marge,"chief, i hope this is the call i've been praying for."
64829,Marge,i'm so glad you two are friends again.
55589,Marge,"... and finally, moe's tavern has contributed a coupon as their way of saying ""welcome to springfield."""
57305,Marge,"i know you're joking -- but it is! say, why don't you put on your swimsuit and head for the beach?"
57600,Marge,hello?
61416,Marge,"boy, when you write you can let your imagination run wild. ""temperance was doing the laundry..."""
64737,Marge,i'd like to return this handbag. unused.
63076,Marge,"lisa, i'm sorry you got a bad grade on your ""moe and tell."""
62225,Marge,"we better get you home. come on, lisa."
57222,Marge,"cheer up, homie."
64928,Marge,you know nothing about my son and even less about apples.
64735,Marge,homer! take me home!
58478,Marge,my poor homie. couldn't you try some other far-out money-making scheme?
65990,Marge,you'd better be asking for something p.c.: pie or cake.
67100,Marge,"yeah. sit down, homer."
62158,Marge,"oh, come here!"
65961,Marge,"no, no, it has to be something big that'll change his whole outlook. why don't we take moe on a road trip?"
62284,Marge,"here's a pretty little wig for lisa, and a handsome toupee for bart!"
65381,Marge,he won't leave the car.
59008,Marge,"and it's all because of your letter, lisa."
60252,Marge,we were looking for lisa!
59378,Marge,"stop swirling, homer!"
66233,Marge,"lisa, your food's getting cold!"
64931,Marge,awww...
55323,Marge,"oh, oh... thank god!"
63988,Marge,okay. one night.
60418,Marge,but i can explain!
60927,Marge,"homer, god isn't some kind of holy concierge. you can't keep bugging him for every little thing."
59030,Marge,and that's where the bookmobile lady used to live!
67663,Marge,"i wrote a poem for you this afternoon, homer. it's called, ""to a husband."""
58122,Marge,seven a.m. no earlier. and you can't set your alarm clocks 'cause i got 'em!
66564,Marge,how permissive?
57178,Marge,uh-huh.
59406,Marge,i wonder what would happen if they had a baby?
66186,Marge,"i asked him here to cheer you up, but i didn't think you'd drop everything to go gallivanting with some, no offense, spaniard."
61442,Marge,"jack ruby was a man, not a jewel."
67441,Marge,you'd think the player's wives would be a little closer to the action.
59387,Marge,the boat's going sideways!
62652,Marge,"well, maybe someone else can help you, but i am not a drug grocer!"
65260,Marge,i hereby declare thanksgiving dinner officially over!
58277,Marge,"homer, i insist you steal that car."
63603,Marge,"why does every kid who stays with us bring ""mommy meals""? so i put pineapple in my potato salad. live a little, huh!"
65248,Marge,homer! are you... schmoozing those men?
63220,Marge,i did!
65123,Marge,"it's big to you. would you like a ""get well"" pork chop?"
65744,Marge,we have to do something until the storm passes. now just fill out these customs forms and we can get started.
67165,Marge,oh. well... all right. when do we start?
54969,Marge,who's using the power tools?
67615,Marge,i don't know. maybe we should take his money and put all this ugliness behind us.
55685,Marge,"well, i think we should spend the money on something the whole town can be proud of."
63450,Marge,"sweetheart, what do you mean?"
59982,Marge,"oh, thank you. your ground is so comfortable."
59694,Marge,"bart, it's so sweet of you to take the family out to krustyburger."
64048,Marge,"no, sweetie. at this point in a marriage, a wife should know what her husband can do and what he can't. who was i to think you could mail an envelope?"
63984,Marge,"lisa, i don't like this at all."
57475,Marge,or swindling our neighbors.
67133,Marge,you can't take it back. you had your name engraved on it.
64003,Marge,"these be mini-pizzas made from dragon eggs, your majesties."
66017,Marge,"sweetie, you're just gonna be who you are."
67787,Marge,"bart! lisa! if you don't behave, we'll turn this car right around and go home."
64217,Marge,definitely a cup.
66893,Marge,"if we don't give back the money we won counting cards, the casino people are going to hurt homer!"
59797,Marge,a convict painted that?
67558,Marge,no. i'm sorry about the dinners. i'll make up for it tomorrow night.
65746,Marge,"what, 'cause they rented a van and taped an antenna to the top?"
60970,Marge,"ooh, a new hamburger sandwich."
61257,Marge,"that's the last of them. you did the right thing, bart, and now you can keep the money."
56774,Marge,and i'm gonna keep teaching your class. like it or lump it.
55588,Marge,that's sweet.
65698,Marge,"the animal shelter hasn't had any greyhounds turned in. just a dachshund, a chow, and a pregnant raccoon."
59803,Marge,"oh, homie. i knew you'd support me."
57400,Marge,"oh, all right, we'll go."
67190,Marge,"oh. well, thank you."
54808,Marge,homer... breakfast is ready.
67912,Marge,"yo! i'm the coolest puppet in sockville, and i love strained spinach!"
61065,Marge,"well, there are a lot of beer cans around here."
57356,Marge,"homer, please, you're hurting my arm!"
58318,Marge,"bart, it's too nice a day to leave ralph in a closet. you boys should go play outside."
65602,Marge,we're not talking!
67693,Marge,"yes, i remember."
62823,Marge,"looking through my purse, looking through my purse... keep walking, monkey!"
64758,Marge,"colonel ketchup, i say it was you that killed him in the parlor with the letter opener."
64280,Marge,no. i lost.
65279,Marge,"okay, everyone. smile while the pets take our picture."
61222,Marge,"thanks for not killing me, homie. here's an extra pork chop."
62275,Marge,"actually, i think your father's still upset about the way things went down."
64733,Marge,i suppose i should get something to eat.
56687,Marge,but my new idea is different. i think we should hold a film festival and give out prizes.
55398,Marge,well... i thought i told you..
59388,Marge,"honey, we want mr. burns to find this place exactly the way he left it."
58941,Marge,"lisa, no, no, don't! it won't be the--"
65465,Marge,"i know my son did a terrible thing. but there's a chapel on this ship, and in that chapel there's a book, and it says, ""judge not, lest ye--"
60652,Marge,"homer, this is all your fault. if you hadn't plugged in your dancing santa, none of this would have happened."
66676,Marge,he has a point...
55011,Marge,"that's good, lisa."
55367,Marge,"well, i really think we need to replace the washer and dryer."
59503,Marge,"you seemed so understanding before. what happened to ""boys will be boys""?"
65672,Marge,the kids are a mess! you brought them home exhausted and pretentious!
63181,Marge,homer! you made an effort!
57293,Marge,"bart, you can invite milhouse. lisa, you can bring a friend, too."
57419,Marge,the house is perfectly fine!
61208,Marge,maggie's gone!
67829,Marge,"come on, homer. i want you to see what your sick little girl did."
65823,Marge,read the rest of the title!
61485,Marge,maggie!
65483,Marge,this car's so clean! i'm not getting flea bites on my ankles!
59377,Marge,"homer, did you jimmy open mr. burns' liquor cabinet?"
59743,Marge,get 'em off me! get 'em off! get 'em off!
61559,Marge,do you have to make such an unholy racket?
66608,Marge,i'm in.
58696,Marge,you're guarding the mayor tonight? after fat tony swore revenge?
61190,Marge,"bart, plants don't-- wheww!"
65548,Marge,"here's your smoothie, sweetheart."
62033,Marge,dissin'? do rappers still say that?
65814,Marge,"instead of watching tv, we can read children's books written by tv stars!"
64184,Marge,maybe i'll keep this to myself for a while.
55026,Marge,"oh, homer."
58693,Marge,homer! i don't want you using your new sleeper hold on the children.
58443,Marge,big enough for two...
58868,Marge,how could they take away my license? it feels like i lost a limb.
62526,Marge,uh-huh. and how will this affect your job at the power plant?
66342,Marge,"oh, absolutely. these sessions keep me on an even keel."
65784,Marge,she's gonna raise three kids without wrecking that perfect figure.
67022,Marge,bart!
61334,Marge,"aw, look how happy she is."
61630,Marge,our marriage is just an illusion. he doesn't care how i feel at all. he doesn't know how to love.
55873,Marge,i'm marge simpson. your new cellmate.
60058,Marge,i contributed by not objecting too much.
62548,Marge,"lisa, sweetie, i think your father would like to put your book up on the fridge where everyone can see how nice it is."
65984,Marge,"got it, music lessons!"
57759,Marge,see!
63391,Marge,no street curs!
57512,Marge,has anyone seen homer?
59786,Marge,"they're unveiling a combination apron/smock. it's called a ""smapron."""
62309,Marge,bart! turn away from that screen and look out the window!
55233,Marge,i buy one lottery ticket a week with the girls at the hair salon. we each play our birthday. and that's enough excitement for me.
59362,Marge,he hit the star player!
59241,Marge,"you did it, homie!"
57676,Marge,"so if you wore a hawaiian shirt, it wouldn't be gay?"
66938,Marge,homer!
57061,Marge,tuck-in time!
56586,Marge,"okay, tv off. it's family time."
61318,Marge,"homer, is there something you're not telling us?"
56719,Marge,"this? this? no, i - i've just got a touch of the rheumatiz."
56136,Marge,"homie, you should be proud. only a handful of people have done what you've done."
56789,Marge,that's mary had a little lamb.
61920,Marge,"yeah, i guess."
57608,Marge,does anyone else want anything while i'm up?
63061,Marge,don't worry. i have a secret weapon -- one more powerful than any gun.
56569,Marge,"thank you, doctor. whenever the wind whistles through the leaves i'll think lowenstein, lowenstein."
56811,Marge,"homer, there's no reason for you to feel threatened. you'll always be the man of this house."
55205,Marge,and the next man wants to hit the ball too. and he does. and there he goes off in that direction. and everyone is happy.
66763,Marge,homer?
59444,Marge,i guess i'll be driving.
63380,Marge,maybe we should split up.
63486,Marge,"chief, i think we should cancel the performance."
55087,Marge,"i'll get some at the store tomorrow, homer."
61300,Marge,dr. hibbert? is someone seriously ill?
56443,Marge,"time for church, bart. i bet your little friend jessica will be there."
55038,Marge,is this it?
67370,Marge,"hello, everyone. you know, halloween is a very strange holiday. personally, i don't understand it. kids worshiping ghosts, pretending to be devils... things on t.v. that are completely inappropriate for younger viewers. things like the following half hour. nothing seems to bother my kids, but tonight's show, which i totally wash my hands of, is really scary, so if you have sensitive children, maybe you should tuck them into bed early tonight, instead of writing us angry letters tomorrow. thanks for your attention."
63464,Marge,i'm not cooking!
55170,Marge,"hi, did you miss me?"
56408,Marge,"i hope you realize now that violence on tv may be funny, but it's not so funny when that violence is happening to you."
66788,Marge,"homer, i have to use the porta potty."
58796,Marge,"oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! if anything, your home makes me ashamed of my home!"
61615,Marge,"no, i'm here to have a little girl-talk with mrs. krabappel."
56165,Marge,bart!!!
65183,Marge,"okay marge, you test drove a convertible once, you can do this."
58957,Marge,please stop eating that. god's gonna furious.
61211,Marge,you guys are the world's worst cops.
59523,Marge,that's south dakota.
66234,Marge,"well, someone who loves you put melted butter on them!"
55572,Marge,"well, maybe you'd get promoted if you worked a little harder."
66055,Marge,one more to go and i'm done.
65285,Marge,this is the last airline that would take us.
59341,Marge,talk to me.
65677,Marge,there's gotta be a bounce house around here somewhere. at least maybe a piñata...?
59539,Marge,okay.
58412,Marge,what are you doing?!
64391,Marge,i guess it'll just be dinner for four.
65952,Marge,fine. what would you get rid of?
57530,Marge,bad fawn! hmm. shoo! shoo!
59952,Marge,"homer! don't be... wow, that is huge."
64029,Marge,only if it lasts forever.
62991,Marge,he's just drumming louder!
63312,Marge,i'd like that very much.
67158,Marge,oh!
61316,Marge,what a mall!
56819,Marge,"homer, give me my pepper spray."
64805,Marge,that's odd. lisa just threw her saxophone out the window.
56911,Marge,you did the right thing by telling me.
67028,Marge,"what on earth are you talking about, homer?"
61226,Marge,why is bart so tall? and shaggy?
63348,Marge,you really wanna make love on half a mattress behind a billboard?
62500,Marge,puddle!
55382,Marge,"you can have the shower to yourself, homie. i'm finished."
56045,Marge,"homer, you should be more supportive."
66885,Marge,it's not gambling! it's math.
56161,Marge,there! isn't that a lot better? now you can do whatever you want. but don't mess up the house.
57989,Marge,yes.
62871,Marge,you're describing how to parallel park.
58291,Marge,"lisa. lisa honey, wake up!"
61187,Marge,this is a perfect opportunity. we'll beat those cavalry kids by selling candy!
58735,Marge,mm-hm. what about clay? you got any problem with clay?
60245,Marge,"i was just making christmas cookies. but since you don't believe in christmas anymore, i guess you don't want any."
62308,Marge,what are you two doing?
57409,Marge,i have a favor to ask: please shut this place down and move away from springfield.
56884,Marge,"bart! put that down! guns are very dangerous, and i won't have them in this house."
55629,Marge,"uh, they had 30 sons and 30 daughters."
67725,Marge,"gee, artie. artie wait. i don't know. i mean, it was it was a beautiful evening. let's not ruin it."
57717,Marge,i don't think it had broken axles before.
62358,Marge,you are.
58726,Marge,i can't believe it passed.
61903,Marge,"the excitement never stops. chloe, would you like to see slides of our trip to athens... boulevard recreational center?"
59610,Marge,why you little...!
63187,Marge,three years is a long ways away.
63434,Marge,shake it! shake it!
65643,Marge,the only thing we know is it'll cost eight hundred dollars.
62938,Marge,"i never heard anything about it on the gossip shows, or the blogosphere or in my supermarket check-out magazine."
58265,Marge,"oh, yes! as long as it's tasteful... and never at someone, or with... and not..."
59763,Marge,"come on, homer. they're only in town for eight months, then they're gone!"
65037,Marge,those are pieces of broken glass.
62679,Marge,that was the most horrible part of all!
62423,Marge,"sweetie, we're gonna get you home and straighten out all these fears you have."
59486,Marge,"well, maybe you added it wrong. let me add it..."
58344,Marge,hmf. the monkey's on my part of the sofa.
59537,Marge,but you just said that...
55943,Marge,uh... mr. hutz?
64429,Marge,"a bird eating potato chips... my feet walking... that boy who got sick on the tram... grampa talking to a mermaid hedge... the park rules in spanish... a fat baby... grampa telling a story to a trailer hitch... oops, i erased them all!"
66230,Marge,quit talking about that baby!
55489,Marge,oh my god.
57556,Marge,edna.
54661,Marge,"excuse me, is this room one-oh-six?"
54951,Marge,"actually, i was thinking we could cut down on your beer."
56544,Marge,hmm. that would have to be my first day of school.
65619,Marge,the place that changed my life?
66355,Marge,"bart's usually first in line for taco night, but now he's ""muy tarde."" is it all right to say ""tarde?"""
65593,Marge,"ooh, a christmas ornament museum! can we stop?"
66067,Marge,"listen, i want us to be honest with each other."
60794,Marge,your school chums are going to be so jealous of your little outfit.
63625,Marge,"oh, you don't want to hear about my boring old day."
57473,Marge,what a wonderful evening! a magical way for two people to renew their love.
65039,Marge,uh... twenty-three dollars... and there's a can of beans in my car.
66033,Marge,maybe if you'd talked less about guy stuff you'd know more about your so-called friend.
60660,Marge,"homie, to honor springfield's newest hero, i made you your favorite dinner. all three courses are dessert."
67035,Marge,good. then here are some cupcakes.
59578,Marge,hello. hel-looo.
66254,Marge,"sorry kids, i guess the hats and mittens will have to wait until next year."
62631,Marge,"you know, if i was born three months later, emerald would be my birthstone."
54594,Marge,i'm afraid it's top ramen again.
66790,Marge,what did you give him?
61875,Marge,"now, i know there's a handsome young man behind all that hair and dirt."
55459,Marge,"no, homer. he doesn't mean to be sacrilegious, lord. he just likes to sleep in on sundays..."
58703,Marge,no...
61028,Marge,"homie, i'm sorry... you know i usually bring my a-game to the bedroom... but tonight i just can't throw the heat."
65229,Marge,hel-lo.
59969,Marge,what? what?
62681,Marge,oh...
67040,Marge,"no, bart. this note isn't about you."
64891,Marge,i know when the freakin' fiesta bowl is!
60872,Marge,what if i can't feel comfortable outside again?
59596,Marge,"don't mess with me, i've got jimmies!"
63940,Marge,we should be getting back to the party.
62483,Marge,i was asking for something.
56551,Marge,"ready for breakfast, doctor smith?"
63344,Marge,"homer, stop that."
57889,Marge,"good morning, agnes. how's your new son working out?"
66723,Marge,you got very lucky this time. don't push it.
60357,Marge,"please, homie? no more craziness -- for me?"
56216,Marge,"homer, would you please stop reading that ross perot pamphlet?!"
65214,Marge,"foodies, help me! my husband's in danger!"
57814,Marge,i only have five lobsters. are you sure he's not bringing anyone with him?
60062,Marge,"excuse me, hobo. can you play something a little less unnerving?"
60959,Marge,"please don't go, bart. i'll let you swear in the house. everything but the big three."
62325,Marge,i knew they'd try to convert you! that's what they do! well i'm not having another twelve kids.
63233,Marge,"no, no, no, no, no! let's not get crazy."
61519,Marge,"homie, that kojak is sexier than cannon and barnaby jones put together. i think he looks a little like you."
63669,Marge,i'm sorry your surprise party was spoiled.
64816,Marge,you what?!
64508,Marge,homer!
61314,Marge,"excuse me, can i ask you a favor?"
55599,Marge,mmhmmm.
55733,Marge,"homer, i found this behind the radiator. i really think you should throw it away."
67777,Marge,"well, selma hated egypt, too. a camel spit on her."
59334,Marge,i can't be in the hospital! tomorrow is laundry day. and i've gotta de-meat lisa's baloney.
63393,Marge,"homer, can you breathe?!"
63394,Marge,"if someone did eat bart's shorts, they'd have a tummy full of pocket garbage!"
63757,Marge,"well, at least she's got a friend."
65062,Marge,we're throwing the brunch!
64315,Marge,"i can't back out. this is for a cause that's bigger than i am. if gandhi could go without eating for a whole three-hour movie, i can do this. besides, i'm a woman. he'll probably go easy on me."
63472,Marge,"you know, it might be a little more romantic without your entourage."
66164,Marge,lumbar! it means lower back. how many times will you make that mistake?
61285,Marge,but seeing you like this is more than i can bear.
57252,Marge,i can't take this anymore!
56414,Marge,"when you locked the front door, did you remember to lock the back door?"
63102,Marge,"oh, stop. just stop. you don't care about anyone else's happiness but your own!"
66144,Marge,"well, you are the best this circus has to offer..."
62941,Marge,"well, we have managed to squeeze a lot of fun out of married life."
57064,Marge,"well, life is like a box of chocolates --"
65702,Marge,"well, tell us your version."
65407,Marge,"spin the top. if it falls over, we're in reality. if it spins forever, we're still in a dream."
66237,Marge,because you're doing your homework and you don't look happy.
55284,Marge,has she kissed you?
64599,Marge,see? dylan is clearly a girrr--
55172,Marge,and from now on i hope you'll help me out a little more than you're used to.
56031,Marge,i'm hearing that you feel a lot of shame.
65146,Marge,wanna go home and celebrate?
66698,Marge,homer works at a nuclear plant! he can help us get home!
58349,Marge,"lisa, please. you have absolutely no reason to be jealous. you're still a very important part of bart's show."
67630,Marge,"i suppose if he'd been able to do it that week, we might have given him the five dollars."
61810,Marge,"oh my god! someone, somewhere says i'm better than someone else!"
63663,Marge,...anus! ...anus! ...anus!
56880,Marge,"when my father was first trying to catch my mother's eye, he sent her a box of candy with his photo in it. after that, she never forgot him."
58684,Marge,"oh, homie. i'm so glad you're all right."
57647,Marge,shush everybody! it's coming on!
55097,Marge,homer!
65582,Marge,what a wonderful thought.
64673,Marge,"excuse me, have you seen this man?"
65923,Marge,"not because of what you bought, but because i realized that no matter what, you will never stop trying. and there's nothing a woman loves more than that."
59682,Marge,"oh, that's too bad."
63580,Marge,i told you twenty times! you never listen!
66824,Marge,that's not a healthy way to lose weight.
66666,Marge,"homer, do something!"
63400,Marge,you give that to me!
59237,Marge,"okay, sure."
65683,Marge,"also, i didn't want to tell you, but... that wife and her gang looked down on me because i don't breastfeed!"
56204,Marge,"honey, you should listen to your heart, and not the voices in your head, like a certain uncle did one grey december morn."
61029,Marge,"you're so cute when you're begging for sex, but i'm just too tired."
54693,Marge,duffman!
62472,Marge,david is so helpful...
55237,Marge,"oh well... we lost the money, but at least we've still got each other."
57551,Marge,it would be nice to beat those women at their own game. maybe i should look into a franchise.
54879,Marge,"well, they said they changed it just enough so they don't have to pay us."
67443,Marge,would you like some fruit juice?
66100,Marge,when does it get better? when he's eight hundred pounds and has to be cut out of the house to go to a movie?
59100,Marge,is mel gibson here?
61642,Marge,"what i want is a really good ""weeper."""
65997,Marge,ugh. speaking of police...
66453,Marge,"you know, you're pretty rude."
63543,Marge,ooh! shlomo's judaica is having a blowout on dreidels.
65826,Marge,wondered where that was.
59514,Marge,"you know, you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."
63297,Marge,let's see -- what kind of goofy goobly should i be?
57320,Marge,kids! stop that! don't make me get the carney!
64075,Marge,"it's okay, homie -- you can have my viewer."
64745,Marge,cut it out! you're upsetting the gravy boat!
62065,Marge,actually your aunt is marrying a very lucky... woman.
55917,Marge,what's wrong with this phone? it's making crazy noises.
66838,Marge,"it's not that professor x wouldn't get up, it's that he couldn't."
60498,Marge,i love these jesters. they're exactly what i need to forget about my first husband.
64040,Marge,yeah!
58445,Marge,"hm, something's not right. does this bed feel lumpy to you?"
54715,Marge,that'll stop her from seeing him.
59560,Marge,"oh, becky, you look beautiful. i thought you might want to see this bridal magazine. it's got nine hundred tips for the perfect marriage. all ""don'ts."""
64951,Marge,i brought home fried chicken...
62784,Marge,and i don't know who's more handsome: the bull taunter or the bull stabber.
57772,Marge,wow.
59860,Marge,and it's gonna do wonders for our social life.
59499,Marge,"oh, thank goodness. where were you?"
63509,Marge,"huh. thank you, crie! i'm huh... i'm sorry about the kick. i've never done anything like that before."
67312,Marge,like an angel.
57956,Marge,and this is for pushing me off the cliff.
60935,Marge,"i'm so sorry, reverend."
57201,Marge,"checking accounts aren't really for children, bart."
63273,Marge,and they pay big money for photos.
56454,Marge,no.
57657,Marge,nooo. it's an heirloom my grandmother passed down to me -- a very rare old figurine from the civil war.
60894,Marge,"ned, i'm not afraid!"
62919,Marge,"well, i might as well see what all the fuss is about."
61480,Marge,"homer, i don't need fancy things. and even if i did, this is the wrong way to get them."
58184,Marge,"i see. well then, no chores, no allowance."
58546,Marge,"oh, my good, gray extension cord."
67320,Marge,except for one thing... no chaperone.
66927,Marge,thank god for homer's christmas bonus.
61299,Marge,how did you get her out?
61206,Marge,you have your own baby monitor in our child's room?
62047,Marge,"oh bart, i'm so glad you're okay."
63992,Marge,but he'll be gone a lot repairing refrigerators.
57068,Marge,"homer, didn't you get any milk? all i see is egg nog."
65579,Marge,"maggie's not a baby! her soft spot's been skulled over for the last three months! being a mom is who i am, and i'm not done being who i am."
63798,Marge,i love documentaries! especially the one that came with our lawnmower.
60893,Marge,i'm not afraid!
55804,Marge,"honey, you look fine."
58081,Marge,"and here we have a lovely gourmet kitchen, with gas range, central can-opener, and foam under-flooring for enhanced standability."
66776,Marge,doesn't your culture say anything about mercy?
62234,Marge,"sweetheart, your friend ray is in your head."
57276,Marge,just thank heaven everything worked out for the people we care about.
55583,Marge,oooh...
59161,Marge,"you know, homie, the ""e"" doesn't work on that typewriter."
60111,Marge,"oh, this seems like such a waste. i mean, he was charming and witty."
56046,Marge,homer!
66951,Marge,bart?
64376,Marge,"tomorrow, my love."
61873,Marge,"sometimes i think he's more interested in his ""itchy and mitchy"" cartoons than me."
62402,Marge,"tonight i want you to really try to sleep in your own bed, because... homer, stop that!"
63926,Marge,that's the fuel gauge.
57849,Marge,"well, it certainly was nice of you to accept bart in the middle of the semester."
60736,Marge,"well, i've read enough articles about flirting to know it when i see it."
61445,Marge,"henry the eighth had everything he could want, except a son to follow in his footsteps..."
67359,Marge,"oh, homer."
59410,Marge,"okay, lisa. i've got furious d across the board, boxed with the three and the eight, and wheeled up and down."
58814,Marge,my darling bride manjula / i hereby mend my ways / i'll shower you with valentines / for seven love-filled days!
58490,Marge,"well, there's certainly no greater accomplishment than fathering three beautiful children."
55553,Marge,what are you putting in there?...
66737,Marge,apu is a good man. he sent over front row tickets and backstage passes to his show at the costington center.
67001,Marge,"homer, this is our house."
67658,Marge,because sometimes it's fun to use the good china.
60331,Marge,that's the best one!
61619,Marge,sure there are downsides. but a relationship can't be all hand-holding and restaurant desserts.
61495,Marge,"look lisa, there's something in here for you!"
55343,Marge,"oh, homer, i love you just the way you are. lisa, what's that number?"
59747,Marge,should i just back out of the room?
66392,Marge,"homie, homie, we'll be old someday."
67889,Marge,i don't think i can.
58708,Marge,"that's right. like my mother always said, you've gotta stick it out, even if you picked a loser. to the bitter end."
65499,Marge,"helen, have a canapé! there's enough for everyone, but not too much."
67855,Marge,well...
63918,Marge,i said they were thrill-crazed drug seekers. don't put words in my mouth!
56220,Marge,"well, i think it's wonderful that your father has fallen in love with my mother."
57117,Marge,good for him!
66177,Marge,"i'm sorry, but does kirk know how silly he looks?"
64192,Marge,"what's wrong, homie?"
63586,Marge,i'd like to see you do a guy sometime.
66089,Marge,are you watching it?
59846,Marge,"oh, chief! i found some evidence that points to the real arsonist."
64686,Marge,but you can keep me company.
59156,Marge,"oh. so, bart..."
57596,Marge,"oh, it's just a mob war. go back to sleep, honey."
59530,Marge,"well, looks like we got everything for bart's camping trip: blair witch repellent, antler saw and deep woods scrabble."
55829,Marge,oh my god.
64685,Marge,"well, i don't need much help..."
66252,Marge,"bart, don't use language like that!"
58681,Marge,"i'll tell you when you're dead, grampa."
67828,Marge,hm.
63290,Marge,everyone can see you! get inside!
60024,Marge,lisa!
65262,Marge,yup!
54967,Marge,ed asner?
57093,Marge,here's your hot chocolate.
62972,Marge,"on the surface, that sounds perfectly pleasant."
57283,Marge,you don't have to join a freak show just because the opportunity came along.
64012,Marge,are you saying lisa's not there?
55513,Marge,homer!
55115,Marge,see how good things can happen if you make a little effort?
54773,Marge,we're here!
62072,Marge,the toilet seat's up!
65067,Marge,"these people are always grinding against each other, and i think they're all related. i wish we'd never come."
56730,Marge,"well, i'm sure these things didn't destroy themselves, now did they?"
58251,Marge,"homer, what are you doing?"
55127,Marge,i did not! i promised i would get mad! she's an eight-year-old girl.
63724,Marge,"so, how was your outside time?"
67657,Marge,because sometimes it's fun to dress up for dinner.
66767,Marge,"okay, remember we're parked in the ""ethnic princess"" section."
63064,Marge,we're going to dump it in the water to get the army drunk.
62907,Marge,"wow, she still works here?"
59390,Marge,"homer, give him the fifty cents."
67462,Marge,the father of the loser mows the lawn -- 
60520,Marge,he's so adorable. can we have another baby?
55169,Marge,"well, good. i'm coming home, honey. you can pick me up at the train station in an hour. and bring the kids. bye!"
64579,Marge,"oh my god, homer's gone!"
64858,Marge,we're bringing the dog because we've found him a new home at a farm upstate where he can run and play all day.
66906,Marge,"isn't bart sweet, homer? he sings like a little angel."
61365,Marge,that wasn't me!
64818,Marge,"what's wrong, sweetie -- you seem upset."
56350,Marge,they hit it off right away. but there were rivals for the fair lady's hand...
63372,Marge,you're nothing but a diabolical master thief. the kind that haunts the slopes of san moritz or the casinos of monte carlo.
65100,Marge,i hope we haven't stumbled onto my anniversary present.
62497,Marge,"maggie, would you like to ride with me?"
61385,Marge,"and lord, if you think i'm making lemon bars for your bake sale sunday, you'd better stop killing our cats."
60985,Marge,i just gotta stay one lesson ahead of the kid.
57726,Marge,"homer, there's no point in pretending you're making those noises. your homemade liquor is exploding again."
67391,Marge,sure.
67586,Marge,"yes, dear. all you want."
61444,Marge,i know a little something about history. gather 'round.
56493,Marge,homer! homie! the kids have a great idea on how you can clear your name!
66958,Marge,"there's no guy with peanuts, dear."
56790,Marge,that's the same thing! you just replaced dees with doos!
58068,Marge,"what in the heck is a ""dwelling""?"
64060,Marge,"come on, kids! let's take our stuff back inside."
64204,Marge,this school has really gone downhill.
66379,Marge,are you saying i'm wasting my time?
65776,Marge,"well, i must admit it's a relief to get that taken care of."
57799,Marge,oh my god... ned!
58748,Marge,"homer, it's just a coincidence, like that guy named anthony michael hall who stole your car stereo."
56486,Marge,"i already talked to the indignation coordinator out on the lawn today. i told her you were a decent man. but she wouldn't listen. besides standing by you and supporting you, there isn't anything more i can do."
60700,Marge,it's true. i couldn't even wake you up for work this morning. i had to tell mr. burns you had violent diarrhea.
58893,Marge,"homer, we're picking up cel phone calls over the baby monitor!"
63023,Marge,it's so unfair -- i'm as handy as any man.
54981,Marge,he hasn't done that since he was two.
56158,Marge,stop remembering tv and get back to work.
65045,Marge,"oh, i always forget about this part."
66183,Marge,marge simpson! it's so nice to meet a friend homer met through the mail who isn't a sea monkey!
61238,Marge,thanks for the meatloaf recipe. i claim it as my own.
59713,Marge,hold still.
60591,Marge,"kids, we want to talk to you about something."
62837,Marge,"homer, this says i've won homemaker magazine's ""clean for a day"" contest!"
57281,Marge,so you want to go on tour with a traveling freak show.
58098,Marge,because it's so dilapidated.
66464,Marge,"actually, i'm a little surprised lisa likes him."
62093,Marge,"homer, if you do this one small favor, it could transform selma's life."
67039,Marge,but they sent a note from school.
65655,Marge,"homie, you have such a way with foods. let's go inside."
60581,Marge,apu is having an affair?!
60748,Marge,what on earth have you done? my mcguppies became bazongas!
58428,Marge,oh yes he is! yes he is!
56686,Marge,now i know you haven't liked some of my past suggestions. like switching to the metric system...
60954,Marge,"bart, the larynx is not a plaything."
61111,Marge,people do crazy things in ads... like eat at arby's.
60863,Marge,why is it ned flanders?
61146,Marge,oh my god! let me help you up!
55978,Marge,i'm not sure.
56694,Marge,"it's supposed to say jay's name, not yours."
56812,Marge,"hey everybody, mom's home."
60407,Marge,"remember, homie. i'm doing this for us. see you on monday."
58308,Marge,you know who's nice?
55556,Marge,"oh, i see."
59489,Marge,aww. he can crawl up through my toilet any day.
55162,Marge,uh-huh.
56896,Marge,"the police have such a strong case against homer. mr. burns said he did it, they have homer's d.n.a..."
56513,Marge,the arabian nights room looks nice...
55196,Marge,"no, homer. the truth would humiliate her."
67851,Marge,"oh, homer, don't be jealous. i was a schoolgirl, the beatles were very popular and i had a crush on them."
61224,Marge,"ooh baby! did i find something to throw out today! if you like space in the attic, are you gonna be happy!"
63794,Marge,"okay, have fun at the laughter house. now i'll just turn off my phone to save the battery."
58587,Marge,"i absolutely refuse to go along with this. but since i have no choice, i'll take the alley."
62916,Marge,"well, i think it's good to give both ideas a fair hearing. maybe they could learn from each other."
64601,Marge,i give up!
60853,Marge,"uh, ""a."" and i'd like to add that proposition ""hug lisa for me"" has my full support."
59528,Marge,"but you need to try things on! every brand has a different idea of ""husky."""
59002,Marge,"well, they're in the business. real people might not be so understanding."
57006,Marge,bart!
62926,Marge,"thank you, honey, for opening my eyes."
57542,Marge,"no, i'm not."
56782,Marge,"homer, this is an operation!"
59481,Marge,"actually, i took the picture, so i gave my prize to the orphanage."
62376,Marge,"okay. uh... you know, up close you're kinda cute."
57007,Marge,what are you talking about?
65494,Marge,"well, we're here to offer to throw you a little party in your honor."
61504,Marge,but she's only eight!
57264,Marge,"oh, we've tried everything. olive oil, lemon juice, tartar sauce, chocolate syrup, gravy, bacon fat, hummus and baba ghanouj..."
63895,Marge,i just made a thirty-seven hundred mile car trip. i need to wash up.
66762,Marge,where is this party?!
58034,Marge,"thanks for helping us out, reverend. i know you've never performed a hindu ceremony..."
54757,Marge,"he forgets birthdays, anniversaries, holidays -- both religious and secular -- he chews with his mouth open, he gambles, he hangs out at a seedy bar with bums and lowlifes..."
59137,Marge,i was thinking of something a little more... adult.
62185,Marge,i want you to look into the faces of those poor men -- each one is a life you made worse with your ratting.
65242,Marge,see? luckiest man in the world.
64933,Marge,"you know, this is the first time i've ever been at moe's without that little voice in the back of my head saying ""this is not a safe place to drink."""
59236,Marge,"oh no, not lenny. not lenny!"
55747,Marge,he called you a bad father.
59279,Marge,what in the world?
67691,Marge,"well thank you, artie."
61566,Marge,"eh, why do people worry about stuff?... it's all gonna work out."
62268,Marge,"bart, don't use that word... oh crap."
61979,Marge,here's my new idea to sell both beer and grub / we will turn this filthy dive into a proper old-time british pub!
55152,Marge,no. i mean a vacation by myself.
64913,Marge,"fine, i'll do it!"
55289,Marge,"homer, how much did you just give that man?"
64352,Marge,i'm still hoping homie will come back.
56130,Marge,"homer, when i met you, you weren't an astronaut. you didn't even know how to use a touchtone. but i still respected you, and i always will, no matter what."
61382,Marge,"oh, lisa. honey, it's okay. you're a buddhist, so you know your cats are now reincarnated as a higher form of life."
57677,Marge,"homer, i don't think there's a problem with bart. but if there is, it's probably because you're not spending any time with him. goodnight."
65047,Marge,"okay, we've got peach bruschetta on peach toast, peach-aroni peach-za, and my famous b.l.t.s -- or should i say p.p.p.s?"
62195,Marge,when i was a kid we didn't show our affection by head-butting.
59363,Marge,"a field goal? hm... nineteen, twenty, twenty-one... that would win the game!"
65998,Marge,that's not the way american police do things!
67640,Marge,"we've squabbled over money before -- never this much -- i mean, i know this is different than that time i washed your pants with the twenty in the pocket, but i--"
58894,Marge,"oh, that's not the point. we should report this to an omnitouch care-rep. people's privacy is at stake."
62694,Marge,"ooh, carl."
62675,Marge,"wait, wait, wait, there's one thing i don't understand here."
59835,Marge,farm couple?!
59371,Marge,good lord! this bedroom is as big as our house!
67503,Marge,now we can blame him for everything.
54939,Marge,we can't afford to buy a pony.
55316,Marge,because he wants his honeymoon to be romantic.
63767,Marge,the father of lurleen lumpkin?
59944,Marge,"i'm not racing! it's me, marge simpson!"
59180,Marge,homer! stop that!
63789,Marge,bart is a ten-year-old boy. he still sits in the driveway and pretends to drive the car.
66205,Marge,how was work?
56106,Marge,it certainly is exotic.
60189,Marge,how did you get my number?
58469,Marge,i don't want you reading those awful scandal sheets.
66854,Marge,at last! i'll earn money for schlepping!
57741,Marge,"that's laddie. bart says he won him at a church carnival, two towns over."
64834,Marge,"homer, did you know he was in the pile?"
67301,Marge,yeah.
63105,Marge,"homer, you wanted a sign that i still love you, so here it is."
61279,Marge,englishwomen don't pump gas naked!
56850,Marge,"homer, taking an officer's cap is an arrestable offense."
65328,Marge,"lisa, i love spending mother-daughter time with you. we have so much in common, like... um... oh no! someone's about to put the thousand island ladle into the vinaigrette!"
60241,Marge,she's not a devil. i just don't know what to do.
61847,Marge,plus your school-yard chums: martin and ralph!
64770,Marge,no it wasn't!
67799,Marge,"bye, herb."
63978,Marge,you're teaching bart a terrible lesson of intolerance!
56436,Marge,"you just answered your own question with that commode mouth. besides, you kids need to learn morals and decency, and how to love your fellow man."
64524,Marge,"i'm french, not you."
67047,Marge,"no, i'm very upset."
67632,Marge,"homer, would you like some more macaroni and cheese?"
57250,Marge,"hello?... oh, homie, hello! i can't remember the last time you called me from -- oh, you want to speak to lisa?"
64340,Marge,i don't see the safe zone anywhere.
58125,Marge,what happened?
57594,Marge,"homie, maybe we should go inside."
55603,Marge,"homer, please i just had eggs."
67673,Marge,"no, it's true, bart. we used to shoot pool... and go dancing..."
55008,Marge,"now, bart, lisa did a wonderful job on my hair and we saved forty dollars for the family. we all have to pull together 'til your father gets a new job."
66928,Marge,"don't worry, homer. we'll just have to stretch your christmas bonus even further this year."
56755,Marge,"rev. lovejoy, your old army drill sergeant, and the regional director of the irs."
62529,Marge,"oh, ba-art!"
58811,Marge,this is about investment opportunities in yemen.
61501,Marge,you were purposely teaching her the wrong word!
59426,Marge,"homer, you help too."
58000,Marge,"he's going to need a... you know, ""protection."""
56701,Marge,no reason.
64191,Marge,blabby's gonna build an abbey. groovy.
66207,Marge,what?!
66595,Marge,then that's what i'm gonna do.
64918,Marge,"and anita's family rented a beach house, and guess what? they went to the beach every day!"
65480,Marge,"busy day at work? did you get a lot of work done, workerman?"
60096,Marge,"ooo, that really covers the cat crap!"
55320,Marge,my little guy's first rock concert. i hope the spinal taps don't play too loud.
56815,Marge,i suppose i would.
56120,Marge,"i understand, honey. when i was your age there was a..."
61429,Marge,oh that's wonderful. and the characters didn't bother you at all?
67183,Marge,"oh! oh! well, all right."
56630,Marge,"stop it, stop it. can't you see this barnyard noise guessing game is tearing us apart?!"
57625,Marge,"well that's nice, kids, but i don't know where we're going to find anyone like that."
60279,Marge,"get out, homer."
57289,Marge,"am i cool, kids?"
59633,Marge,stop it!
62058,Marge,"you're getting married?! patty, that's wonderful!"
66112,Marge,"ben, ramona, i wanna tell you something i've learned over ten years of marriage. the secret is: no secrets, except good secrets like this train."
66360,Marge,i don't know bart. this is one of those... arkham asylum-type hospitals.
58128,Marge,bart's absolutely right. this is the one day that shouldn't be about material things.
65235,Marge,"i'm sorry to bother you at home, mr. marlowe..."
66747,Marge,out now.
56404,Marge,"oh my, it looks like we're doomed!"
57750,Marge,"lisa, what in the heck are you doing?"
59288,Marge,"hm. well, did you see that picture of me in..."
62236,Marge,homer!
57929,Marge,but balzac is the name--
55491,Marge,my name is marge bouvier. i'm here about your ad.
60459,Marge,honey...
55600,Marge,"homer, bart's at a very curious age. as his father, i think you should have a frank and earthy discussion about...hmmm, you know."
60288,Marge,why do you always wait 'til we arrive to complain?
63319,Marge,"no, no. i'm fine."
60864,Marge,"okay marge, you can do this. you've done it a thousand times before."
56958,Marge,see? it was a good idea to come here after all.
67836,Marge,"hmmm, what are you doing, dear?"
67450,Marge,was he rude?

62787,Marge,"it's a book about management, and lee iacocca says it's ""definitely, dot dot dot useful."""
64013,Marge,"lisa ran away, and it's all my fault! if i'd just let her continue her obsessive relationship with that troubled little girl, everything would've been fine."
59735,Marge,"that's no gentleman, that's my husband."
58003,Marge,"look, i want a cup."
59908,Marge,"oh, please. you get exhausted watching ""the twilight zone"" marathon! i'm a regular billy crystal."
60445,Marge,i guess you're not going to have an adventure this week.
59625,Marge,... and just a few stars down from the cheerios honey bee.
62041,Marge,we have kidnapped your son. follow instructions and bart will not be harmed.
61254,Marge,those fudruckers!
59246,Marge,"doctor, how could a little baby save a full-grown man from drowning?"
62929,Marge,"homer, we need those tickets to get in!"
66291,Marge,"lisa, tell your brother that stealing is wrong, no matter what."
62321,Marge,"bart, i'm glad you had fun, but i wouldn't get too into that catholic church. with all the sitting and standing and kneeling, it's like simon says without a winner!"
65690,Marge,fifty gallons of baby formula will put out that blaze.
64215,Marge,"wow, your first day at the new school! lisa, have fun! bart, don't!"
58862,Marge,"ooo, did i ever. and that herbal anger rinse just washed the rage right out of me."
57390,Marge,oh. yeah. thank you.
64812,Marge,not a good time!
66603,Marge,he does it to all of us.
65836,Marge,i wasn't laughing -- i was being worried.
62714,Marge,sorry i asked.
59368,Marge,"that's not an award, that's part of the set."
64405,Marge,you said you were at a parenting class!
66210,Marge,have you kids seen your father? surprised he's not here ogling these girls.
63150,Marge,christmas card? i haven't even taken the photo yet!
66377,Marge,"darn it, they're stuck."
65794,Marge,you should know that me saying i don't care means i couldn't care more.
58552,Marge,"ohhh, oh, honey. oh, come here."
65769,Marge,"that's where they filmed ""the wire""! step on it!"
58192,Marge,i don't know.
62701,Marge,we had a lot of fun. they're terrific kids.
61767,Marge,hello? octopuses? i'm done.
64782,Marge,why did you do that?
60397,Marge,pretty much. yeah.
67248,Marge,"oh, dear."
63820,Marge,the door's open! i think someone broke in!
59543,Marge,and you will be a dancer.
58422,Marge,"no, no, no, i have my part in this, too, um..."
54980,Marge,what are your son's hobbies?
57697,Marge,"uh, grampa's not coming..."
63648,Marge,i think i'll speed through the cheering.
61725,Marge,"homie, i know this shouldn't bother me, but a girl only has one first love. i guess it didn't mean that much to you."
67686,Marge,"well, no i don't. actually, i never really..."
59648,Marge,poor homie. i still can't believe a piece of broccoli killed you.
55934,Marge,i think we need a new hairdryer.
58489,Marge,the kids and i want to show you all the great things you've done.
64591,Marge,i don't see any chewing!
65943,Marge,what do you think?
54756,Marge,"well, it's not that i don't love the guy. i'm always sticking up for him. it's just that he's so self-centered."
59623,Marge,"fortunately, i had a network connection. the man who cut my hair was also president of fox."
64395,Marge,dinner's ready! dinner's ready!
64063,Marge,"oooh, hot comes out of hot... it's like i'm dreaming! thank you, ned."
54663,Marge,i know who i'm in love with.
57710,Marge,"oh, i do. i'm just a little concerned about the kids. maybe i should call."
65134,Marge,wait! i know a place you can go! a place where a sadistic man with government experience can feel right at home.
63968,Marge,well maybe...
65156,Marge,"aren't you gonna come to bed, homie?"
63852,Marge,"oh, homie. i got you something too."
64771,Marge,"no, it was berry-peach!"
64817,Marge,awww.
55976,Marge,what's so special about it?
59173,Marge,"oh my god, we killed ned flanders!"
66075,Marge,there you go. good as new.
61971,Marge,"until you pay us back, you're answering to me! and there's gonna be big changes."
56332,Marge,what's brunch?
66585,Marge,i'm afraid homer and bart's problems are beyond our power to solve.
65948,Marge,"sorry maggie, i just don't have the touch today."
55257,Marge,not now.
56929,Marge,it's maggie!
59997,Marge,"don't worry, doctor. we'll get you all the help you need."
56750,Marge,"look at branford ii! isn't that cute? he thinks he's one of the models, inc."
62263,Marge,but... you're still fat!
58321,Marge,"oh, see, i knew you'd find something you liked about him."
63889,Marge,those walls do look safe.
57780,Marge,i don't know... guilt?
67336,Marge,"soup's on! hurry up, or it'll get that icky skin on the top."
61637,Marge,"dayton, ohio!"
55831,Marge,and you're a nuclear technician?
56116,Marge,how did it go?
58496,Marge,something electrical might be good.
54832,Marge,crazy house!
64143,Marge,and... release the groom.
65334,Marge,"""she had now come to the part that peter pan hated. 'i do like a mother's love,' said tootles..."""
55454,Marge,what!? what would help!?
64714,Marge,is it your laundry?
63041,Marge,i forgive you my darling. get well.
65049,Marge,"ooh, couples! that way i can enjoy my massage, and make sure you don't enjoy yours too much."
65144,Marge,"oh, homie..."
56523,Marge,i just left my first session and i haven't even opened my mouth yet.
65478,Marge,"here, right?"
65013,Marge,/ ooo!
59443,Marge,you set off the smoke alarm to rush us to a beer festival?
56057,Marge,"then how 'about going as florida? you enjoy orange juice, and old people like you."
59903,Marge,look! krusty invited us to the taping of his last episode.
56290,Marge,"while you were out ""earning"" that dollar, you lost forty dollars by not going to work. the plant called and said if you don't come in tomorrow, don't bother coming in monday."
57083,Marge,"my son may not be perfect, but i know in my heart he's not a shoplifter."
60377,Marge,i haven't lost so much sleep since little barty had the scoots.
66219,Marge,you have a baby together?
64990,Marge,abe? are you feeling all right?
61832,Marge,"look, i'll be a winner with feet of clay... like mickey mantle. everyone loves the mick."
59339,Marge,so it does.
59463,Marge,gold bars discovered by homer?
65735,Marge,"excuse me, you're that proctor that's shutting down my children's school."
58135,Marge,"well, if you mean the money, i suppose we'll just replace the items the burglar took from--"
62921,Marge,"wow, darwin's argument is incredibly persuasive. and his ship was the beagle, which reminds me of snoopy... my favorite peanut!"
60145,Marge,let's do this thing.
57785,Marge,"oh. well, it's time to start telling the truth. now, when i have to tell my husband the truth, i cook him a big delicious dinner. by the time he's done eating, he's too full and tired to care what i have to say."
66920,Marge,"kids, you want to go christmas shopping?"
64332,Marge,where did they all go?
63341,Marge,okay. if you pretend to be our chauffeur at my high school reunion.
61799,Marge,i'm calling a contractor.
56562,Marge,daddy?
63897,Marge,"now homer, boys will be boys."
59918,Marge,"well, i'd like to go. how about you, maggie?"
56327,Marge,oh!
65985,Marge,sweetie... did you ever think of doing something a little more creative with your time?
65592,Marge,okay.
54801,Marge,"bart, you have to help someone in need. it's the only decent thing to do."
65280,Marge,"cousin kathy invited us so our feelings wouldn't be hurt, and we're going so her feelings won't be hurt."
67140,Marge,hm. well... all right.
56372,Marge,"now wait a minute. i'm not sure about this. every time we've ever gone on vacation, i end up being horribly embarrassed, we end up in a big fight, and we come home more miserable than when we left. you have to promise me that this isn't going to happen this time."
58030,Marge,"well, i'm glad you were having fun, because i've had my hands full with apu's mother."
60757,Marge,"homer, let me explain something--"
56329,Marge,you're a very good teacher!
66839,Marge,that's not really what i was--
58617,Marge,"you know, i really don't appreciate being called a narc."
64544,Marge,you're wrong! and whenever you're wrong you just sprout gibberish.
55824,Marge,uh-huh.
58480,Marge,lisa...
54811,Marge,"homer, you encouraged him. you should be strangling yourself."
67891,Marge,from the desk of ringo starr!
59838,Marge,not until you finish your sundae.
62177,Marge,don't leave now! the next piece is an atonal medley by philip glass!
63073,Marge,"homer, we can't scuttle like crabs for the rest of our lives."
63325,Marge,bart's coming down!
67467,Marge,"ohhh, well, what won't make him logy?"
66143,Marge,mr. burnsum! you should treat these poor people with respect!
63512,Marge,i don't want to live like that.
65512,Marge,it's angry.
60251,Marge,oh no! our daughter's run away on christmas eve.
64670,Marge,"but that's impossible! if you're the real walt warren, who's taking our son to the baseball game right now?"
67824,Marge,"oooh, this one looks very reputable."
56921,Marge,squalid hell hole... toilet paper hung in improper overhand fashion... dogs mating on dining room table?
56891,Marge,i guess it's never the most likely suspect.
55101,Marge,"homer, all those fatty, deep-fried, heavily salted snacks can't be good for your heart."
66600,Marge,"i'll cook this meat, cut it up, and make it into sandwiches."
58569,Marge,"may i remind you that two people are dead? oh, wait. i just got it."
59068,Marge,"hawaii, here we come!"
59857,Marge,"oh, look at you two. you look so ""couple-y."""
67667,Marge,"oh, homer, homer."
58993,Marge,a claes oldenburg. he's a european who defied convention and embraced american popular culture.
56941,Marge,he's going to baptize our children?
67095,Marge,what's this? a personal stereo? were you going to listen to rock music in sunday school?
63664,Marge,"milhouse, have you seen bart?"
59316,Marge,"to be fair, not all evil robots are killers."
67698,Marge,and the city forensics championship is coming up.
63557,Marge,"dwight, please, don't do anything crazy."
63718,Marge,"out of the house, kids! i have to make an adult phone call."
62458,Marge,"young man, you go work on your spelling... or i'll delete all the custom ring tones from your cell phone!"
57205,Marge,"sweetheart, maybe you just want krusty to be alive so badly, you think you see him everywhere. i went through the same thing when lyndon johnson died."
59714,Marge,"are you kidding? there's funky winkerbean! over here, funky! look, it's the noid! avoid the noid! he ruins pizzas!"
59336,Marge,"oh, really? well, knock yourself out. just don't expect any miracles from those two."
66289,Marge,what's going on here? is there a fondler in the neighborhood?
63966,Marge,what would have happened if there was someone who could break us up every time i had my doubts about you?
56067,Marge,i'll walk.
64098,Marge,"ooh, look! a welcome mat that tells you your weight!"
67246,Marge,principal skinner!
67595,Marge,but i like that statue.
61985,Marge,"homer, moe and i are just work friends. you and i are... marriage friends."
66483,Marge,sh-sh-sh!
59897,Marge,"honey, i'll make it up to you in bottle rockets."
62637,Marge,of course.
55905,Marge,"no, he hasn't."
63706,Marge,what the?
64001,Marge,"now remember, juliet's family is very classy, so be on your best behavior."
64559,Marge,and i'm taking all the exciting colors out of your crayons!
57565,Marge,"hairnets, everyone."
60837,Marge,today's tuesday and you've had six beers.
67671,Marge,i think this is sick. they're staring at a dot!
58139,Marge,"well, at least the burglar's having a merry christmas."
65377,Marge,"homie, whatever it is, it's not happening."
65810,Marge,"okay, no tv at all."
60968,Marge,i could have sworn it was three hundred and two.
56122,Marge,"lisa -- ordinarily, i'd say you should stand up for what you believe in, but you have been doing that an awful lot lately."
60259,Marge,yes! merry christmas to us all.
54819,Marge,but it certainly was a memorable few days!
65198,Marge,but this was all i had!
57322,Marge,"the polite thing to do would've been to clean the shells first. shoo, shoo!"
65099,Marge,this looks like it's from a wind-up toy.
57514,Marge,your father decided he'd rather come home in a taxi. or a police car.
59861,Marge,can you believe it? kent brockman playing on our court!
57961,Marge,candied apple!
67757,Marge,"lisa, i brought you some lemonade for your protest."
64428,Marge,"oh, there's so many photo ops, but i already filled up my camera in the parking lot...parking lot c sign... the tram... a license plate from canada..."
67574,Marge,excuse me. excuse me. he was addressing me.
62600,Marge,it's obvious why bob is a vaunted pillar of your community.
67221,Marge,bart!
57430,Marge,"so, twiggy, i hear you and your husband woody just had a baby. what did you name him?"
58847,Marge,"oh, i don't know... it doesn't seem right."
60205,Marge,"well, is anything coming back to you?"
63710,Marge,did you just unlock the car from here?
67720,Marge,what are you doing here?
57545,Marge,"well, you said you'd bring them peace and love and it looks like you did it. i'm proud of you, homie."
56769,Marge,"well, i'm sure some of you already know me. i'm bart simpson's mother."
57519,Marge,"well, i was sure you'd be on foot, because you always say public transportation is for losers. and i was sure you'd head west, because springfield slopes down that way. and then i saw the lighthouse, and i remembered how you love blinking lights... like the one on the waffle iron..."
66020,Marge,is it your impression of mr. burns eating soup? because i'm not in the mood.
63240,Marge,"ooh, how about ""little bo peep?"""
60467,Marge,"grampa, come on."
62905,Marge,i don't recognize that name.
61091,Marge,i didn't gasp like that until i was eighteen!
61751,Marge,"lisa, that's not funny. you believe in the bill of rights."
60436,Marge,that car's as big as all outdoors.
55449,Marge,"get up, homer. it's time for church."
58779,Marge,to what?
55613,Marge,"i was wrong about you buying that truck. i'm very proud of you, mr. plow. ."
61671,Marge,"homie, people in the other elevators can see us."
55704,Marge,"well, bye."
57531,Marge,"homer, it's two a.m.! what happened?"
63108,Marge,now i know that my lega-she is really a lega-we.
67396,Marge,"look, homer! radish rosettes. these are hard to make. they are a very advanced race."
58076,Marge,"thank you. thank you, everybody. i'm going to do my darndest to uphold the principles and ideals this jacket represents."
67321,Marge,"oh, there it... went."
57013,Marge,"uh, excuse me, sir, i think there's been a mistake."
59563,Marge,"oh, you can fix little defects like that with gentle nagging. make it part of the background noise of your relationship. that's how i polished homer into the perfect... homer! no, that's ice!"
58951,Marge,"speaking of ribs, is there any grub around here?"
63995,Marge,"okay, you two. lights out."
56272,Marge,"oh, look. there's bart. wave to him."
67697,Marge,"well, you seem like a nice enough guy, but i really don't have the time."
66373,Marge,maybe!
66486,Marge,"homie, you can't keep doing this to yourself."
55932,Marge,"more cocoa, mr. burns?"
60907,Marge,"a little of this and a little of that. bulkenoids for my lats, mesomax for my delts, and estrogen blockers for that minty taste."
59136,Marge,bart's so well-behaved now... maybe you and i could have a night out!
58728,Marge,"oooh, ""free foot pain analysis?"""
61249,Marge,"oh, isn't that sweet? even your brother's adding his kudos."
60068,Marge,"oh, look! a shooting star!"
58984,Marge,"here he is. this is where the... ""magic"" happens."
63976,Marge,"homie, it's very open-minded of you to have bart's muslim friend's muslim family over."
67526,Marge,you don't have to go to all that trouble just for me.
64419,Marge,"uh-huh, and now hand me your neck..."
63146,Marge,"homie, wake up! i rented that negligee you like."
55696,Marge,"according to this book, the monorail goes over a hundred and fifty miles an hour. what if something goes wrong?"
59699,Marge,we don't have a stash.
66094,Marge,i've never felt so flushed after watching public television.
54610,Marge,well here's a question for you: why should i stay with a man who resents how i've flowered?
60432,Marge,"ohhh, is that where boozer drank the pee?"
65059,Marge,why did you seat us in siberia?
60671,Marge,"yeah, probably dreaming about the time she shot mr. burns."
66761,Marge,i'm sorry. i'm trying to find my husband and nothing's open.
54948,Marge,"homer, just where were you planning to keep this horse?"
65905,Marge,i'll just stick this in your apology card drawer.
66394,Marge,"homer, how are we doing with those cots?"
64379,Marge,garden view?
57999,Marge,sounds like you need some first aid.
63827,Marge,"excuse me, i think i'm holding up better than you are. in fact, i've got energy to spare."
66190,Marge,they rented everything from comic book guy for ten bucks.
61866,Marge,"hey, kids, i just heard they cancelled league night down at the bowling alley. you know what that means -- open lanes!"
62215,Marge,"well, he does seem happy here..."
65972,Marge,"and look over there, moe."
55044,Marge,bob?
57008,Marge,what?!
56484,Marge,homer! wake up! wake up!
55094,Marge,you're telling me that the city won't pay to get a boy out of a well?
61447,Marge,"no problem! in elementary school, we girls learned about sacagawea while the boys were learning math!"
66536,Marge,"don't you dare say ""ostrich eyes."""
65663,Marge,that's not applesauce...
60603,Marge,i know a great nametag place. they do fabulous work.
66746,Marge,"i never thought i'd say this to someone i cared for, much less my husband, but i'm saying it now: i don't want you here on christmas."
61258,Marge,well... someday i'd like to go on a nice vacation.
66860,Marge,homer simpson. working with those plants is great! it's helped you get in touch with your feminine side.
60360,Marge,what's going on?
58367,Marge,"oh homer, you didn't beat city hall! they picked up our trash because i wrote a letter of apology to the sanitation commissioner and signed your name. period."
58033,Marge,"i don't know, but i'm sure it's spicy."
66624,Marge,we don't have drone delivery! you'll have to find a substitute!
59433,Marge,"homer, are you all right?"
56979,Marge,homer? get ready. patty and selma will be here any minute.
58486,Marge,"oh, honey, don't eat that. wouldn't you rather have your sugar bag?"
57152,Marge,"we ran with different crowds. you had your debutante balls and skinny-dipping, and i had my home shoe repair course."
66031,Marge,maybe he had a good reason to give you the ultimate screw-over.
63198,Marge,there was a happy young family...
58387,Marge,has anyone mentioned that homer doesn't know anything about mountain climbing and that this is all crazy?
58213,Marge,"homer, no!"
56933,Marge,"i miss the way bart would say something and then say ""dude."""
57835,Marge,"inflation, trade deficit, horrible war atrocities... how are we supposed to do our big musical number with so many problems in the world?"
67647,Marge,"well, maybe lisa's right. tomorrow night it might be nice to go out for dinner."
60437,Marge,"i hope you enjoy these german sausages. i've been grinding all day, so i'm not sure what organ meat is in what intestinal casing."
64710,Marge,"we've got plenty of songs in the car, by maggie's favorite singer: roofi!"
65828,Marge,"homer, bart said the kids were going to the van houtens, but luann just told me they're supposed to be here. they've disappeared!"
60685,Marge,"the horde is almost dead! there's still some writhing and twitching, but that should stop by morning."
63955,Marge,what are you doing?
61290,Marge,"lisa, i think your father just left!"
64475,Marge,really? how romantic?
54635,Marge,are you saying that america was founded on... misconceptions?
61657,Marge,and we're blowing off uncle tyrone's birthday!
58755,Marge,bart?
59865,Marge,as far as i know.
58267,Marge,"what'd he say, lisa? what'd he say?"
56422,Marge,"you stay here 'til you're no longer insane. mmmm, chili would be good tonight."
63769,Marge,she needs to see you right away!
61954,Marge,"homer, i want you to get that gamma radiating what's-it out of my home!"
57183,Marge,call it fate. let's go...
60775,Marge,"i've gotta stop them from shooting... i, i, don't... lisa, don't hate me for this..."
58348,Marge,"i'm proud of you, honey. you're finally giving something back to the community, after taking so, so much."
65373,Marge,"oh bart, you got me the fluffy pet i've never stopped thinking about!"
55765,Marge,"homer, are you going to the duff brewery?"
61826,Marge,baby ear medicine.
64822,Marge,"hm, i never figured him for the bully type."
63925,Marge,"homer, that was rude and shortsighted. patty and selma have the map."
56311,Marge,"no, no, no. no, ask your heart what its fondest desire is."
57493,Marge,no! come on!
58410,Marge,and look as handsome as the day we were married.
64658,Marge,"or lieutenant commander tom dodge in ""down periscope."""
63351,Marge,are bees building hives in your diaper genie?...
65343,Marge,i feel kinda silly i walked all the way out here. you're just fine. you always are.
62910,Marge,"well, i'm so glad there's a show we women can enjoy!"
64279,Marge,guess who the garden club elected president?
63164,Marge,"gil, remember me?"
57675,Marge,"homie, i can hear you chewing on your pillow. what's wrong?"
58091,Marge,that house is on fire.
64681,Marge,"moe's is closed, huh?"
67521,Marge,"how'd it go, homer?"
62007,Marge,you showed me you could be a really sweet guy. you can make a woman very happy some day.
64422,Marge,bart simpson!
64462,Marge,i thought the government sent it to us as part of the stimulus package. at least that's what the letter said.
58310,Marge,"bart, you don't have to go anywhere today. i've got a surprise for you."
65754,Marge,"homie, we made it!"
59250,Marge,you don't want something that overshadows the pencils.
64278,Marge,bad baby!
65607,Marge,i thought they only paid fifty dollars a trip.
55525,Marge,"please, homer. why do i always have to be the bad guy?"
61644,Marge,bart!
56518,Marge,you threw them out the window in a fit of passion. you said you were never going to need them again.
62605,Marge,"we're in a foreign city, with no car, being stalked by a killer. i feel like i'm the bourne identity!"
57754,Marge,you told me about that candy bar you found three times!
61868,Marge,fine! i'll take my mothering elsewhere.
57764,Marge,"hey, calm down. you're wrinkling your church clothes!"
66263,Marge,what would baby jesus do?
55987,Marge,"oh, that's nice."
61621,Marge,you just say...
63350,Marge,"oooh, the new issue of ""smothering mother magazine."""
55519,Marge,we're talking about bart.
61106,Marge,family head-count!
65096,Marge,"excuse me, has anyone seen my toy?"
64456,Marge,"homie? homie, can you hear me?"
56300,Marge,wake up!
64712,Marge,"no appetite, honey?"
60967,Marge,i can't count how many times your father's done something crazy like this.
62859,Marge,i know that sound!
64128,Marge,no rockets! you can pick the frosting.
61869,Marge,"great roll, nelson! here, i cut up your hot dog for you."
60833,Marge,"well, just a little one."
63336,Marge,you should all be ashamed! passing judgment on a child for a sports boo-boo! what have you people ever done?
67145,Marge,i don't see what he's doing that's so different from what i'm doing.
66726,Marge,what is that racket?
56920,Marge,what's going on here?
56996,Marge,"homer, we need to have a serious talk."
56249,Marge,i want this to end now!
67283,Marge,"oh, eight carousels. we're in for a real treat!"
64173,Marge,"what's your angle, mister?"
56611,Marge,"ooh, i don't have that."
61988,Marge,of course not! i'm in bed with homer!
64884,Marge,he's starting to wake up.
62763,Marge,"charles, please -- your son might see this."
63975,Marge,what have you done with the old ones?
58887,Marge,she didn't say it yet!
58783,Marge,let go of those.
66171,Marge,can we focus on my son? up in the sky?
55682,Marge,my husband is still alive!
64713,Marge,lisa? are you in here?
61514,Marge,uh-hmm.
60353,Marge,"i don't know what you said, but i'm sure it was beautiful. oh homer, this is the kind of night i thought we could never have together: incident free."
66080,Marge,"ooh, i love that show!"
63831,Marge,"it doesn't work that way, homie."
65006,Marge,we can. it'll be great. like a reality show without the cameras.
67717,Marge,"no, artie, artie. the best argument is that i've known and respected you for eight years, and i would be delighted to go to the prom with you."
58225,Marge,"when we got married, you promised me my harvesting days were over."
62531,Marge,"here, try yours on. i got you a child's large because your tummy's getting kind of bloopy from all the cakes we've been having. somebody here likes princess cakes."
60246,Marge,hm. it's a pity.
62519,Marge,"well, bart, i guess that's it. we'll have to go back to our separate things."
56101,Marge,"honey, i know you feel a little silly saying the same four words over and over, but you shouldn't. you're making people happy. and that's a very hard thing to do."
58314,Marge,but...
54768,Marge,all this fish represents is just how selfish you are.
56138,Marge,"those aren't tickets to the game, homer."
57908,Marge,"sure, honey. bart had just completed his first day at school. and bart just..."
57769,Marge,"...sermons about ""constancy"" and ""prudissitude"" are all very well and good, but the church could be doing so much more to reach out to people."
66146,Marge,"i too am a freak. one eye is blue, and the other a pale brown."
65986,Marge,i was thinking something more artistic. something musical. you could take advantage of a fantastic musician living right here!
67375,Marge,hmmm. this kitchen certainly could use a woman's touch.
60284,Marge,you insensitive jerk! maybe this family would be better off without you!
58698,Marge,"remember how excited we were when this place opened? then a week later, we just forgot about it."
57137,Marge,bye bye!
54711,Marge,darn these long bank lines. although it does give me a moment with my thoughts. darn these long bank lines.
65674,Marge,and what's with the scarf? it's soaked in neck sweat.
66768,Marge,"c'mon, maggie. the first ride we go on will be for you."
54851,Marge,"lisa, the contest isn't for three hours."
67082,Marge,why... that's my husband!
64688,Marge,"um, i'm gonna go read a book."
65384,Marge,why? are you going to do the laundry?
61119,Marge,"okay kids, stay together!"
62274,Marge,"bart, you wanna go to the video arcade?"
66547,Marge,"so as her teacher, i was wondering if you could tell me why lisa has such trouble making friends."
56629,Marge,one more hour.
58200,Marge,i wonder how that happened?
59767,Marge,watching those women is giving me ideas...
67091,Marge,"let's go, homer."
64121,Marge,hello?
61040,Marge,homie?
56783,Marge,how's my special little guy?
56700,Marge,yes.
59604,Marge,i'm not insane!
54843,Marge,"bart, maybe this is something you'd like to do, too."
56286,Marge,"uh... i meant, my number one girl."
59675,Marge,don't you two have a list of chores to do?
61804,Marge,i guess it would be a hoot to have my face on everything.
67220,Marge,your father. he's having a boys' night out.
67739,Marge,ooh. that's a good idea.
65870,Marge,i wish you wouldn't wear sweaters that the senior ladies knit.
62862,Marge,milhouse! you're bart's best friend!
66329,Marge,why is it the recipe card you need is always the one homer writes his cocktail ideas on?
58788,Marge,"all right, i'll get you the materials. but you're building it."
55019,Marge,"well, i'll let you know."
58009,Marge,are you wearing my self-defense whistle?
67371,Marge,i still can't believe how inexpensive it was.
60403,Marge,"besides, i like some of the noises you make in bed."
65807,Marge,while bart turned out so wonderful in his own way!
64371,Marge,and every month is me! i don't remember doing this! i certainly don't remember doing august!
65686,Marge,the cool people are everywhere! somehow they've even made the weather rainier!
58757,Marge,but this will be so confusing. the mailman won't know what to do. did you think of the mailman at all before you did this?
63818,Marge,i'm used to buying my critters pre-made. how does your store differ?
62130,Marge,"last year, you spent five thousand dollars on donuts, two thousand on scalp massages, five hundred on body glitter--"
67475,Marge,open the can.
63028,Marge,i help more than you might think.
58133,Marge,homer! you won't believe what's happened! it's a miracle!
58621,Marge,"homer, for god sakes, put your poncho on!"
59883,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry, homie. we'll talk about it later, okay?"
61935,Marge,we've gotta go now!
58209,Marge,"we don't want to kill them, bart. we just want our home back."
67841,Marge,"well, i think we better set an example."
55652,Marge,"well, bart, what do you think of little lisa?"
57318,Marge,"no! now park your keister, meester!"
56923,Marge,what?! no! you can't! i won't let you!
61369,Marge,awww...
66697,Marge,"it is, 'cause my baby's not in it!"
67800,Marge,maybe he just said that to make conversation.
62901,Marge,oh of course i do! that's why we're such a great team!
61910,Marge,that's ridiculous. no one's bowl smells... it's like christmas in aspen.
61460,Marge,why are your clothes so dirty? and why do you smell like liquor? have you been clubbing?
57748,Marge,"what's the matter, bart? weren't you happy with him?"
63157,Marge,gil?!!
64849,Marge,who's a possum? you're a possum.
57723,Marge,"well, it is. i've known your father since high school and this is the cleverest thing he's ever done. besides, he's only breaking a silly, two-hundred-year-old law..."
67416,Marge,i don't want to snuggle with anybody who's not letting me express myself.
55939,Marge,"good, now you hold maggie. i'm going to buy some earrings at the gift shop."
61023,Marge,"there he is. krusty, we came to see how many campaign promises you've kept."
62847,Marge,two.
66369,Marge,sounds like that would take a while.
54675,Marge,doctor marvin monroe?! are you alive or dead?
60618,Marge,what does he want now?
60750,Marge,you had no right to make my bosom this ample!
60081,Marge,no! goodnight. seesh.
64406,Marge,"well, i think you're very interesting girls, but from now on, the only witch in lisa's life is which boy will marry her. right, homer? homer?"
67086,Marge,"cheer up, homer. at least they let you go."
59536,Marge,"all right. i'd like to sign my daughter up for lessons, vicki."
60895,Marge,grampa! i'm not afraid!
65415,Marge,there's champagne in those!
55305,Marge,i'm just not.
64323,Marge,"i can't back out, because if i fight him tomorrow...it'll be a less-violent world for you kids in the future."
65131,Marge,how are you going to find him?
58304,Marge,mmmaybe he needs some real friends.
60204,Marge,it would be a good excuse to use my yaqui tea set...
61658,Marge,so much for getting my groove back.
59146,Marge,oh.
55327,Marge,and it came with a free instruction book.
62937,Marge,"ooh, the baseball-playing man! i barely recognized you without your costume on."
57923,Marge,"homer, have you seen the frozen peas?"
61518,Marge,"oh, your nightlight's burned out. and the only bulbs we have left are these red ones."
64136,Marge,because their r.s.v.p. cards arrived one day after the deadline!
59286,Marge,could you at least tell me what you're planning to do with me?
62547,Marge,"oh captain, you're so handy!"
55582,Marge,"well, i guess that's it. people like us can't afford justice. come on homie, let's go before he fires you too."
67415,Marge,"well, i don't feel like snuggling."
59055,Marge,"lisa, thank god you're okay."
61589,Marge,it's important for me to see you take at least one step. then maybe we can have some memories together that aren't just a nauseous blur.
61966,Marge,"homer, those kookoo-birds at the bank goofed up and sent us a mortgage statement."
64235,Marge,"although, i am gonna miss our little love nest."
67252,Marge,"well, going to france sounds like a fantastic opportunity, but i think bart should have a say in this."
62671,Marge,"""local anahoopi indians believed this stalactite was the finger of tsisnajini, their god of pointing down."""
57507,Marge,remember your promise: no drinking.
62986,Marge,"bart, put that away!"
65346,Marge,"all right, who's the wisenheimer that's been eating the powdered food?"
63239,Marge,james patterson!
54855,Marge,"no, that was about the budget gap. this is the trading gap."
62898,Marge,"i still don't remember you, but for the first time since this happened, i wish i did... homer."
60684,Marge,"thank you, general. that's a big relief."
56856,Marge,go back to bed! don't make me come up there!
64501,Marge,"c'mon, baby!"
67604,Marge,bart! bart!
63742,Marge,"look, lis! i'm as supple as ever!"
55512,Marge,is it 37?
62032,Marge,"homie, i think you did great. and to celebrate, i made omelets from the eggs people threw at our house."
64138,Marge,"okay, okay, everyone back off! i want to see myself."
60329,Marge,"oh, all right. but take maggie with you."
67908,Marge,no.
59175,Marge,shut up! shut up! shut up!
54869,Marge,you got a job? doing what?
56186,Marge,i'm very concerned. mr. burns has stolen our son and he won't give him back.
65180,Marge,back to the car!
67888,Marge,i thought there was some good in everybody until i met him.
67831,Marge,"homer, what are you saying?"
58022,Marge,what?!
63702,Marge,romeo and juliet? arthur and guinevere? brangelina?
63898,Marge,where's bart? we're gonna be late for lenny's party.
58610,Marge,"homer, you haven't touched your food."
55830,Marge,"well that still doesn't explain why you ate my soap. wait, maybe it does."
61489,Marge,grocers don't make that much.
57324,Marge,"three! we have three kids, homer!"
65376,Marge,please don't say one again.
55500,Marge,he's not dead.
54691,Marge,"oh homer, i didn't want you to find out this way."
60342,Marge,when who should ring the doorbell but ned flanders.
61732,Marge,"how's the ice cream, kids?"
62845,Marge,"et tu, zud?"
58983,Marge,that's my life you're describing.
64860,Marge,"well, ""ditching"" is a harsh word."
67339,Marge,oh! the little tiger tries so hard. why does he keep failing?
61232,Marge,homer!
63236,Marge,homer! don't kill the foreign man!
58594,Marge,"oh, you couldn't destroy every politician."
63849,Marge,"marge, calm down. for as long as there's been baking, there's been erotic baking. it fills a need, and harms no one."
66515,Marge,that sounds like fun. i'll just tell homer and--
58713,Marge,"but only by two points. and they didn't resort to stealing bases like the other team, so it's kind of a moral victory."
56761,Marge,"homer! for the love of god, no."
56459,Marge,"hey, watch out for the shaq-attack!"
63247,Marge,'you look at that paneling -- i feel like i'm back in wooden times!
60238,Marge,"honey, is this about some boy at school who doesn't like you?"
54706,Marge,"this place is so boring. if somebody doesn't do something interesting, i'm gonna have to. but what?"
63539,Marge,i promised that bank robber that i'd visit him in jail. but i just can't do it.
57394,Marge,"i want you to take larry back to mr. burns right now, before you get in a lot of trouble."
66049,Marge,"well in the first place, the elephant's cufflinks would be the same size. it's the cuffs that would be bigger. as for homer, i'm getting him a case of his favorite snack cakes, dolly madison."
58483,Marge,"oh, honey. a baby couldn't have organized a big school dance. unless it was especially skilled. or one of those super-babies from brazil."
59069,Marge,"c'mon, homer! japan!"
60948,Marge,don't go telling your buddies at work about this.
61076,Marge,"homer, would you at least let me take you out on a date?"
55030,Marge,you don't have to do that.
58557,Marge,no kickboxing!
58473,Marge,i am!
67492,Marge,"i've noticed that, too. well, when you feel like coming down, we'll be there."
59184,Marge,"remember, you're vulnerable to kryptonite!"
58337,Marge,"no! no, bart! that money's going toward your college education."
58812,Marge,"oh, that's sweet."
61294,Marge,is there any sign of my husband?
66470,Marge,you know lisa's a vegetarian.
61736,Marge,"now, that wasn't so bad, was it bart? you know, sometimes the fear of some..."
64033,Marge,"homie, please come inside."
60597,Marge,look who's here. it's this thing!
61610,Marge,principal skinner is having second thoughts? poor edna!
67944,Marge,"oh, let's see, should i take the ""trail of death,"" or the ""path of doom?"" maybe i should just go back."
62082,Marge,"please lift this restraining order, judge harm. it's poking our family apart."
66056,Marge,"""dear 'horny in haverbrook,' sorry, i am not interested in cheating on my wonderful husband, who is described in the attached pdf. say hello to my trash folder, marge simpson."""
63973,Marge,"gee, they sure give the christmas spirit the bum's rush around here."
65878,Marge,power.
57538,Marge,"i don't believe you, homer."
61397,Marge,i know -- i got your message.
67269,Marge,what?
55897,Marge,that man is so rude.
58974,Marge,and you could at least get that snake out of the piano...
54758,Marge,"he blows his nose on the towels, and puts them back in the middle..."
65353,Marge,homer! that is not banishment-hearing behavior!
63058,Marge,so they're not shipping you overseas?
65919,Marge,"really? jeez, they make everything."
64594,Marge,play with lisa.
55254,Marge,you wouldn't want what he's eating. it's mostly just snouts and entrails.
63828,Marge,"my purse is made of hemp -- if we burn it, the ""silly smoke"" will mellow out those guards!"
57933,Marge,"as i was saying, things couldn't be worse for lisa or bart..."
67833,Marge,"homer, please. it's not just the quilt. he's a nice dog, but he chews up everything. he doesn't obey. he's not even housebroken. and we've spent all this money on an obedience school and i don't see any improvement."
66869,Marge,"well, not all of them. like, um, ninety percent?"
66209,Marge,first few weeks of what?
55870,Marge,"i'll be fine, dear."
54862,Marge,don't you think you should get a little fresh air and maybe some exercise?
64996,Marge,what are you guys doing up there?
60170,Marge,"well, don't look too hip. you don't want that girl falling for you."
60994,Marge,"and ned, i haven't seen you this happy in years."
63612,Marge,"bye, bart! enjoy your funny books!"
62076,Marge,"patty, it's not what you think. veronica is a man!"
58159,Marge,what did you get?
67204,Marge,is thursday okay?
59355,Marge,you college boys are only interested in one thing.
64611,Marge,"come on, let's go! what are you waiting for? come on."
58923,Marge,it's not fair. your father always gets to have such exciting adventures. maybe it's time we took a walk on the wild side...
63483,Marge,"what is it, sweetie?"
56003,Marge,"i don't want to be a wet blanket, but maybe you should give yourself up."
66485,Marge,please let it be a bear that did this.
60958,Marge,"homer, don't make things worse."
58633,Marge,ohh.
55692,Marge,but main street's still all cracked and broken.
64083,Marge,but that doesn't mean that you can't have a little dinner.
56028,Marge,"that video really opened my eyes. i can see that i'm just a passive-aggressive co-culprit. by nagging you when you do foolish things, i just enable your life-script."
66592,Marge,"dear lord, please help homer's friends understand that make-believe computer football is no excuse for using the internet to be mean."
66875,Marge,even i saw that. i guess i can't tell homer.
58895,Marge,show biz is so fascinating.
65803,Marge,look at me!
56903,Marge,"here's your toast, maggie. i melba-fied it myself."
67775,Marge,he should be honest... and caring... and well off... and handsome...
63279,Marge,experts disagree on location of heaven?!
66345,Marge,it's not a secret. it's a funny story.
66621,Marge,i'm sorry i woke you up. i'm just so anxious about tomorrow. what if the store fails? what if i fail?
55908,Marge,would you like to come in for tea and marshmallow squares?
60124,Marge,"oh, homie, no. we can't."
62689,Marge,how can you be sure?
62412,Marge,what if we show lisa we can sleep in her room without being frightened? hm?
58860,Marge,"oh, great. what'd i do?"
61325,Marge,you've made that promise before.
56721,Marge,oh lisa!
58018,Marge,poor barney.
57682,Marge,"oh, homie, i'm so glad you're safe! hmmm, you feel softer than before."
55450,Marge,it's church. you have to go.
63549,Marge,"don't be silly, lisa. in fact --"
62514,Marge,stop the showcase!
65545,Marge,give back my baby!
59834,Marge,i know... but the lord will forgive me if it helps you get a second chance.
55251,Marge,"lisa, i'm afraid we'll have to stop getting you those volumes of encyclopedia generica from the grocery store."
61573,Marge,this is a pamphlet for chimney sweeping.
66566,Marge,"homer, get up!"
67455,Marge,bart!
55975,Marge,"homer, please. you know it's hard for me to make friends."
65728,Marge,"i'm proud of you. society may have crumbled, but our decency hasn't."
56506,Marge,shh. i don't want people to see us looking at these books.
60917,Marge,"damn straight, i didn't sacrifice my period for second place!"
59225,Marge,"no, but i use only the fre..."
57983,Marge,i've left homer.
60104,Marge,"oh, you don't have to do..."
58258,Marge,"homer, quiet. you'll queer the deal."
59549,Marge,"there she is! hi, honey! wow, look at her go."
58720,Marge,it's only 5:30.
63484,Marge,that's nice!
55643,Marge,let's keep looking.
58160,Marge,mm! who knew that lee marvin could do such marvelous splits?
63848,Marge,how could you not tell me this is an erotic bakery?!
56164,Marge,"homer, it looks like it could gore."
66069,Marge,he's writing me again! better put a stop to this.
55753,Marge,"aw honey, i know what you're going through. when i was a girl i had a crush on bobby sherman."
67672,Marge,"homer. it's not the end of the world. you know, before we got married we hardly ever watched television."
60408,Marge,"hello, artie."
56043,Marge,"sure, steak."
66840,Marge,absolutely.
57860,Marge,"oh, homer. of course you'll have a bad impression of new york if you only focus on the pimps and the chuds."
65221,Marge,"ooo kids, did you hear that lesson?"
67157,Marge,i can hit that one pin all right. but the rest of them don't even wobble.
61412,Marge,temperance had to face the unhappy truth...
55508,Marge,"well, i'm sure glad we didn't turn into mindless zombies."
63333,Marge,"oh, yeah, that's really something."
67656,Marge,you looked so peaceful lying there.
59211,Marge,"more tumbleweed, lisa?"
62353,Marge,is this a snuggle film?!
66397,Marge,don't call me a gal. makes me feel like i'm your mother.
62663,Marge,"homie, what's that?"
63426,Marge,sorry-sorry-sorry!
57139,Marge,"honey, i don't think these clothes are us..."
62053,Marge,"homer, you married every gay couple in town."
56265,Marge,"i must admit, you really do make a gal feel needed."
62970,Marge,"okay, just one more kid to pick up."
56733,Marge,"excuse me, we're having a problem with our dog..."
67437,Marge,fourth street and d!
54792,Marge,a mother knows everything about her family.
57054,Marge,go crazy?
59220,Marge,"homer, no!"
61662,Marge,right here in dayton.
56421,Marge,go crazy?
67532,Marge,because.
61461,Marge,"homie, they're beautiful. that chevron station has the most romantic bouquets! i feel a swoon coming on... here it is!"
67560,Marge,"hmmm, sure. oh, dear. i can't. i've got three protest rallies tomorrow."
63145,Marge,uh... hm...
62010,Marge,"goodnight, both of you."
60177,Marge,look at those massive plaid shoulders.
55259,Marge,the dog will get out!
56919,Marge,it's like i'm on some wonderful drug!
67710,Marge,"merci, i guess."
55848,Marge,"oh, that's right. i invited a guest speaker to talk to the class."
61763,Marge,i can't believe that historic rock is gone.
59041,Marge,i was really starting to enjoy ethnic mismatch comedy #644. i've never heard so many viagra jokes in thirty seconds.
60078,Marge,uh... hello.
66135,Marge,"i know, he's changed."
64680,Marge,you're home early!
56039,Marge,i knew it. if only i had nagged more...
55854,Marge,"hello, barney. are you playing the town drunk?"
57567,Marge,thank you.
60023,Marge,"we've got to get to the hospital, homer!"
59319,Marge,"well, anyone would be nervous with all the economic turmoil you read about in the..."
67210,Marge,homer!
56072,Marge,i won sixty dollars last night.
67426,Marge,"here you go, bart."
66165,Marge,just put on the kiss record.
56655,Marge,"oh, for the love of criminy! gimme that! i know bart did something wrong, but he's my son and i'm going to punish him myself."
59847,Marge,not yet. you have to guess what it is.
64920,Marge,what are you boys doing?
66908,Marge,"""dear friends of the simpson family: we had some sadness and some gladness this year. first the sadness. our little cat, snowball, was unexpectedly run over and went to kitty heaven. but we bought a new little cat, snowball ii...so i guess life goes on. speaking of life going on, grampa is still with us, feisty as ever. maggie is walking by herself. lisa got straight a's, and bart, well... we love bart. the magic of the season has touched us all..."""
56897,Marge,"no. no, no. when i took your father's name, i took everything that came with it, including d.n.a."
58498,Marge,"homer, that's not a table, that's our dryer."
56967,Marge,"please pass your father the syrup, lisa."
54793,Marge,four b.
54737,Marge,come here!
58057,Marge,i'm tired of being cooped up in this house all the time!
67461,Marge,"well, i'm sure it is, but why do we want to do that?"
64843,Marge,"mr. burns, you can't hurt us after all we've done for you."
67256,Marge,yes! yes!
67189,Marge,i'm a married woman. please don't call me that.
65335,Marge,is it on your father? little girls always get crushes on their fathers.
57181,Marge,"no, i can't. c'mon, let's go."
58195,Marge,"so mr. cooder, how long have you been in the traveling amusement industry?"
60321,Marge,who is this?
66191,Marge,if you're happy i'm happy.
59417,Marge,it's hard to believe we're never going to see maude again.
62545,Marge,"if i give you money, how is the gift really from you?"
60200,Marge,"hmmm. and, bart is set for the week."
61454,Marge,"no, it's a sacagawea dollar. you can trade it in at the bank for a real dollar! eh?"
63110,Marge,not that one.
56069,Marge,go home. you're bad luck!
60033,Marge,breakfast!
56255,Marge,"kids, your father and i are going through a really tough time right now. and i don't know what's going to happen, but just remember that both your mom and your dad love you very very much."
61203,Marge,"thank you, selma."
66400,Marge,your day is my day! we're the same age! you're turning into your father!
67346,Marge,"well, maybe it would help him to be left back. it won't be so bad, bart."
56465,Marge,i won't have any aggressive condiment passing in this house.
56416,Marge,homer!
62086,Marge,he brought home your homework when you were sick.
63499,Marge,"if you're so smart, you do it!"
59831,Marge,i read in the daily fourth gradian that you need someone to paint a mural.
62873,Marge,have you been talking like this for my entire marriage?
57803,Marge,ned! where are you?!
58888,Marge,i don't want a cellular transmitter sticking out of my roof!
55419,Marge,"homer, it'll just be a few minutes more!"
59117,Marge,"oh sorry, honey, i used up the last roll on that man i thought was judge judy."
63534,Marge,"homer, i have to go. if i don't make it, feel free to remarry -- from anyone on the list in the bulletin board in the closet."
66385,Marge,"if you defeat this madman, i'll release you from your pledge and teach you other fun ways not to get pregnant."
66015,Marge,thank you!
63172,Marge,where's maggie?
55447,Marge,really?
59936,Marge,"homer, you're still here? you should've left for work an hour ago!"
58455,Marge,"heh, heh. yeah."
57711,Marge,"his arm! oh, my special little guy, are you okay?!"
64398,Marge,"ned, you got whipped cream in your mustache!"
63006,Marge,you are not bringing that thing home.
59874,Marge,that's all i ask.
66276,Marge,my uncle died in your bed. merry christmas.
64467,Marge,we've got a million dollars?! screw the toast!
58436,Marge,"quick, the barn!"
55465,Marge,"kids, could you wait outside for us?"
56007,Marge,"ruth, i've done a lot of thinking, and i really consider you a friend. and an important part of friendship is..."
59502,Marge,did you really have to handcuff the children?
59436,Marge,"oh, yes. the whole town thinks you're a real humanitarian. ned flanders is green with envy."
55754,Marge,"the point is, i want you to stop making these calls."
64493,Marge,"homer, who's that?"
64147,Marge,i can't believe homer left me at the altar.
65707,Marge,"this isn't the learn zone. darn it, it's a fun place!"
67924,Marge,"uh, gee homer, don't quit..."
62503,Marge,"he was a singer in the sixties, like the archies and the banana splits."
55981,Marge,you look... nice.
66791,Marge,my husband can't really think he's ten.
56083,Marge,homer!
63837,Marge,urchins!
63525,Marge,homer! lisa is receiving the student of the millennium award at school.
63087,Marge,"look, maggie, i made another you! out of sticky orange wood!"
67126,Marge,"whoa... hmmm. thank you, bart."
60219,Marge,"wow moe, you've been doing a lot of sleuthing."
64819,Marge,is it milhouse?
61026,Marge,but i didn't do anything.
63466,Marge,hi... you!
56837,Marge,"and that's the drunk tank, and this is mommy's desk."
65740,Marge,and i hope bart passes his test and saves the school.
58378,Marge,no they didn't. you just brought a bucket of chicken to church.
63294,Marge,still nothing. but maybe now. or now. the only thing that changes is the banner ad.
57244,Marge,"well, there you go."
63155,Marge,gil!
63029,Marge,"this is shirley. yes, fine, he'll be there tomorrow. goodbye!"
65695,Marge,fine. just stay here and hold down the fort.
63874,Marge,"okay, bart went to the comic book store."
57524,Marge,...a profound mystical understanding?
56078,Marge,what?
55238,Marge,"well, he's not dead, but he is awfully sick."
54619,Marge,he loves me so much... after what i did to him!
66525,Marge,"don't be too loud and don't be too quiet. when you're too quiet, you get that psycho look."
57878,Marge,i hope your father had as much fun as we did.
58297,Marge,it says the ceiling was donated by the velcro company.
64071,Marge,he won't come over!
55790,Marge,uh... not to my knowledge.
58778,Marge,g'night.
59641,Marge,i can't believe it. we won another contest!
61231,Marge,my heart is fine.
64850,Marge,what's that?
65711,Marge,"calm down, everyone. calm down. i'm sure they'll have us out of here soon."
56834,Marge,"you don't have to call me ""officer."" i'm not on duty here."
64553,Marge,"oh my god, homie -- we're having a real conversation!"
61633,Marge,a band in a closet! every girl's dream.
63668,Marge,this magic marker's running out of ink.
58361,Marge,oh lord! now what are we going to do? just let the trash pile up?
60906,Marge,i feel good... with no repercussions!
66881,Marge,"okay... there's a song about, um... how democrats and republicans can't get along. it's called ""cats and dogs."""
56178,Marge,"i've gotta stop fantasizing about lee majors. ah, one more."
67160,Marge,you're a very good teacher!
64573,Marge,"this country's so historic -- for all we know, jesus could have given a talk in conference room c."
65024,Marge,"homie, maybe you should stop. we've talked about the gray zone..."
64499,Marge,boo yeah!
55812,Marge,arrrgh!
67565,Marge,substantially-less
63397,Marge,i've only got twenty-seven minutes! the pre-heat is on!
66786,Marge,"homie... workaholic is probably your best ""aholic"" ever, but you need to relax...so i got us all tickets to see the circus on saturday."
63232,Marge,we let you in thirty-two years ago and it's brought us nothing but pain.
57958,Marge,what a day! they found out i was a witch so i had to leave my family.
65824,Marge,"oh, dang it!"
65691,Marge,i guess i do feel a little bad about not breastfeeding my kids... except lisa. i breastfed lisa for nine months.
64331,Marge,"well, i wish somebody would've stuck around to hear it."
67308,Marge,not to worry.
54797,Marge,butterscotch and imitation butterscotch.
62383,Marge,ooo.
55999,Marge,stolen?!
58037,Marge,the police auction...
59456,Marge,"be nice to your brother, lisa."
67020,Marge,"oh, homer... we love you."
60899,Marge,"ruth powers, my old neighbor? oh, my goodness, look at you!"
63468,Marge,"oh my god! oh my god! quick, everyone put on their long faces!"
59622,Marge,"okay, the material was a little corny, but homer and i had real chemistry onscreen."
65342,Marge,lisa!
66730,Marge,i never knew so many women suffered from extramarital jamming.
65793,Marge,i was the only one without a date at patty's new lady friend's travel bookstore soft opening!
64010,Marge,i wonder if lisa has threatened the model u.n. with her rice tariff yet.
63161,Marge,sure!
56504,Marge,i simply can't wait that long. maybe we should get some help... how 'bout a book?
67948,Marge,bart?! you brought me back to life!
56211,Marge,everybody get ready! here comes the birthday girl in her very first dress!
61616,Marge,"so, how are you holdin' up?"
62893,Marge,i'd love to.
56873,Marge,it's almost lunch time. do you know where your brother is tutoring?
57081,Marge,wait! wait! i don't want maggie's face hidden behind that pacifier.
65609,Marge,maybe there's enough homer in the world for now.
67689,Marge,"i'm sorry, i don't even know your name."
60810,Marge,this rope was woven from handlebar mustaches.
60536,Marge,"oh, you two! we're eating genetically modified vegetables! look how big they are."
63689,Marge,there is a part of our past that we haven't told you kids about. a turbulent part.
64234,Marge,yeah. a house in the suburbs does sound pretty nice right now.
60749,Marge,"accidentally giving me breast implants is not a ""simple misunderstanding."" my surgery was botched!"
55100,Marge,"oh bart, i've missed you so much."
64150,Marge,he's right here.
56872,Marge,i choose to take that literally.
61082,Marge,"nobody owns christmas carols. they belong to everyone, like grapes at the grocery store!"
67527,Marge,humph... where would an innocent child get the idea to attack her father with a mallet?
57271,Marge,uh-huh.
66084,Marge,why are you singing that?
66665,Marge,i'll go make up the couch for you.
63286,Marge,i never have to look out the window again!
58669,Marge,look who's a little cowgirl!
67770,Marge,i want you to find a husband for my sister selma.
57581,Marge,"oh my god, what happened to your fingers?!"
67801,Marge,"time to get up, lisa. it's a school day!"
63583,Marge,stop it! that's my favorite couch!
65962,Marge,"moe, this trip is about turning your life around."
61527,Marge,"i don't know, artie..."
62680,Marge,how can you take it? we haven't found it.
62176,Marge,i'm so excited. it's like giving birth to a child of steel and iron.
59349,Marge,"okay, okay calm down. they couldn't have gone too far."
61407,Marge,"ooh, i just finished my first paragraph. spell check!"
54694,Marge,duffman?
65935,Marge,so charming. it's like he's selling silver polish at the state fair.
64701,Marge,maybe we're not going home right away.
66196,Marge,homer!
55612,Marge,our driveway's snowed in!
54653,Marge,my husband... and my best friend!
65610,Marge,"you know, i always send the theater manager a check the next day."
59836,Marge,"oh, jack. i know you hate to betray your artistic vision, but just do it."
57105,Marge,"since i got my present early, i think you should get yours early too."
65149,Marge,what happened?!
61112,Marge,"well, he's not yours anymore. you threw him out on christmas eve!"
59291,Marge,where are we going?
63771,Marge,no suicide axe!
63378,Marge,i can testify at the trial.
58013,Marge,"well, at least i'm making conversation."
60706,Marge,get in.
67706,Marge,"tres bien. well, i should probably be going. i have a big forensics meet tomorrow."
64575,Marge,but it says here in the brochure...
55955,Marge,homer?
59568,Marge,"bart, remember that talk we had about you volunteering our house?"
65305,Marge,"lenny, do you live here?"
66734,Marge,are you okay?
55020,Marge,"hmmm, what do you think about?"
56318,Marge,"oh, no, no. homer is my... ball's name. i'm marge."
63864,Marge,okay. milhouse?
62094,Marge,"okay, don't do it for her--"
55031,Marge,"homer, maybe it's the champale talking, but i think you're pretty sexy."
64940,Marge,"homer, you can't order anything from that magazine. it's twenty-five years old."
59559,Marge,"let's see. candles, flowers, place cards, rice..."
60605,Marge,my little munchkin bumped her pumpkin.
61378,Marge,i said no!
62212,Marge,i'll tell you what it means when it's over.
65234,Marge,i'm going to bed.
65227,Marge,to the victor go the spoils.
57384,Marge,"grampa, are you sitting on the pie?"
62588,Marge,"ooh, marriage!"
61228,Marge,"i'm not fooling around, people! park your keisters in front of that tv! now!"
65696,Marge,maybe one of your tavern wenches can do the laundry.
61176,Marge,all right. everyone inside. let's go.
57016,Marge,i don't know what to say. i finally have a mother-in-law. no more living vicariously through my girlfriends!
59566,Marge,"becky, what have i done here? i'm so sorry."
61235,Marge,don't tell me you're actually going.
62281,Marge,i guess i'll just cut my own hair.
62860,Marge,maggie! my sweet little angel!
66619,Marge,would it kill one of you to wash a bell pepper?
56885,Marge,i'm going to bury it in the yard where little hands can't get to it.
55950,Marge,"lisa, stop being so suspicious. did everyone wash their necks like mr. burns asked?"
57270,Marge,"so apu, why didn't you go back to india when your student visa expired?"
66896,Marge,"i don't know if you watch us all the time, or if we're just like an ant farm you got for your birthday and left on the shelf, and every once in a while you check out what kind of crazy tunnels we've built."
57478,Marge,"when i first met your father, he was loud, crude, and piggish. but i worked hard on him, and now he's a whole new person!"
57165,Marge,queen of hearts. i believe all the rest are ours.
67642,Marge,"oh my lord. well, i don't want to wait another minute to find out whether you love me anymore. i think that you should look me in the eyes and find out."
64256,Marge,screw your courage to the sticking-place and we'll not fail.
59405,Marge,it's the only fire extinguisher endorsed by both lynda carter and george foreman.
59347,Marge,lost them? what do you mean?
62759,Marge,what an odd thing for a man who's not interested in me to do.
57412,Marge,i'm third generation.
65650,Marge,homie... it looks like you're putting all your eggs in one basket.
55904,Marge,"homer, this is serious."
63166,Marge,"the only house i'm interested in is my own, which you defiled for eleven hellish months. but now i've learned to say ""no!"" no to your mooching! no to your manipulation! and a big fat no to the kingsbridge school district!"
61424,Marge,it's really important that you read it and tell me what you think.
57032,Marge,yay.
56554,Marge,"sure, okay. i'll talk about father. father christmas. that's what they call santa claus in england. they drive on the wrong side of the road there. now that's crazy. people are always saying how small england is. but you couldn't fit it all in here. not by a long shot. you know what? i'm cured."
58935,Marge,i would have feigned interest.
64335,Marge,i guess i could!
67057,Marge,come on. you can do better than that.
64362,Marge,how 'bout history?
57640,Marge,you're missing the itchy and scratchy show! don't you like it anymore?
65906,Marge,"no! i'm tired of your broken promises! ""marge, i'm gonna lose ten pounds."" ""sweetie, i'll be home at eight p.m."" ""sweetie, i'll be home at eight a.m."" ""i'll take you out to the most romantic lunch of your life."" i'm done!"
63091,Marge,"why did cavemen paint on walls? why do you scratch your name on tupperware? so when you die, something's left behind that says, ""i was here. i mattered. that's my tupperware."""
59471,Marge,gimme that!
63857,Marge,"homie, i've got a confession to make: i'm an erotic baker."
57903,Marge,"ooh, there's the bus. goodbye, sweetheart!"
61900,Marge,"well, it is good to see you, chloe. would you like to come over for dinner tomorrow?"
65236,Marge,...but my husband's acting pretty odd. coming home late. drinking in the morning.
58462,Marge,clothes! we're saved!
60347,Marge,but breaking your jaw has made you so sweet. maybe we can go.
66655,Marge,hear hear!
55495,Marge,"oh, well, isn't that... whoa!"
55224,Marge,"oh... oh... unng... oh, bart."
67808,Marge,"lisa, don't confuse your brother like that. have a nice day at school, bart."
62128,Marge,"oh honey, i know it's not easy, but we've got to put money away."
66829,Marge,restore! restore!
62932,Marge,that's you!
64109,Marge,"the giant's causeway is the result of a volcanic eruption. well kids, isn't that an informational fact? kids?"
58273,Marge,"oh, knock it off, homer. you're the fattest one in the car..."
59958,Marge,i'm the one who told you that.
66802,Marge,"before you fix him... can you change one little thing? i'm embarrassed to ask this, but after we... snuggle, he always rolls over and goes to sleep and i'd rather..."
62403,Marge,noooo!
57806,Marge,did you see a man being chased by some young hooligans?
62851,Marge,but you're so much more... ravaged than i am.
55664,Marge,"homer, i prepared a special surprise just for you."
61280,Marge,all this attention! i feel like a secretary on administrative professionals day!
62642,Marge,that's right.
67666,Marge,homer? homer?
60213,Marge,burly to the rescue!
64903,Marge,"we called ourselves ""the cool moms."""
55701,Marge,i'm going to see mr. lanley.
59111,Marge,ooh!
67296,Marge,ohhh.
56976,Marge,i don't see what that has to do with groundskeeper willie.
59669,Marge,they were looking at me. with their eyes.
54806,Marge,"you're still angry, homer. why don't you sleep on it?"
62344,Marge,"oh bart, i knew one of these dumb things would work!"
59360,Marge,where are we?
64991,Marge,at some point i think we should see a doctor.
61476,Marge,"go ride bikes for a while, huh."
59753,Marge,you were carjacked in the church parking lot?!
67288,Marge,"i know it looks very bad, honey -- but who knows? maybe it'll turn out he was innocent all along."
63680,Marge,this election is on every channel.
66359,Marge,"well, i hope he gets out soon and takes his bird back. i don't care for how it circles the cat."
59149,Marge,stop him! he's wacked out of his gourd.
58383,Marge,oh my goodness gracious!
55962,Marge,that's one right there.
59533,Marge,i remember little vicki valentine! her perky smile and dancing brought america right out of the depression.
61374,Marge,"and the bumper stickers misspelled ""on""."
58099,Marge,"well, there it is..."
66430,Marge,"oh sweetie, you want your parents to be happy, don't you?"
55040,Marge,"oh, homer, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!"
63894,Marge,we were gone for two weeks!
66827,Marge,"thank you, lord. and i'll give up online scrapbooking like i promised."
65875,Marge,"well, she's just a substitute. maybe you could transfer ms. cantwell to another school."
62612,Marge,i've still gotta bake my christmas pie!
57375,Marge,"next to spring and winter, fall is my absolute favorite season. just look at all this beautiful foilage."
66285,Marge,this is fun! and it was so nice of the movie company to let you show their film.
60754,Marge,"don't worry, maggie, i'll have these silly things out in just two days. till then i'll just try to hide them from the family."
64308,Marge,"guys, please. when you yell like that, no one can hear me."
58046,Marge,well... you might say we're going to the best steakhouse in the whole universe.
55853,Marge,"mm-hm, if you'd like to learn more about colonial times we could take a field trip to old springfield towne."
62610,Marge,christmas is a family day
60719,Marge,did they ever find tom petty's toe?
67639,Marge,"homer, i'd like you to forgive me for doing the right thing."
63969,Marge,"lisa, sweetie, i'm honored that you choose my name, but it's not that great. back in high school, the boys used to call me marge ""boob""-ier."
67247,Marge,"homer, principal skinner's here."
62665,Marge,"well, it creeps me out!"
59312,Marge,"no, they're not. they're terrible, terrible ideas."
54891,Marge,"look, i know bart can be a handful but i also know what he's like inside. he's got a spark. it's not a bad thing... of course it makes him do bad things..."
58516,Marge,congratulations. your child or children have been selected to appear in who's who among american elementary school students.
61073,Marge,"lisa, marriage is a beautiful thing. but it's also a constant battle for moral superiority. so i can't apologize."
64764,Marge,i'm not really in the mood anymore.
54595,Marge,"i'm sorry, i'm not ready to do that yet. i want to wait until i'm married, or at least really drunk."
63865,Marge,you did the right thing.
55843,Marge,you're going to get an education. i'm going to teach you myself.
57745,Marge,"well, we wrecked the first dog. we've got to treat this one right. bart, why don't you take laddie for another walk."
55640,Marge,"that afternoon, we left bart with my sisters and went househunting."
54873,Marge,"well, bart's been acting very strangely. and that pizza delivery truck has been parked across the street for two weeks."
66003,Marge,"helen lovejoy, you always have to stir the pot."
67381,Marge,"i'm in the kitchen, homer!"
60909,Marge,"not so fast, busboy!"
56198,Marge,the dog has had enough excitement.
61468,Marge,are these diamondique?
63415,Marge,watering can!
55597,Marge,i really think that was the character's name... don quixote!
55718,Marge,"oh homer, quit pouting."
65933,Marge,"i know this seems bad, but nothing brings out the best in springfield like a crisis..."
60640,Marge,it's hard to get in the mood... with all those murderous eyes staring at us...
66134,Marge,who cares what happened? daddy's back!
67386,Marge,homer...
55012,Marge,"i want you to take baths, bart."
66822,Marge,get up!
64411,Marge,bart's cooked us a five-course romantic dinner.
66317,Marge,jesus says to love your enemies.
67756,Marge,"thank you, barney. how many people are coming, homer?"
64568,Marge,"ned flanders, you would take our family to the holy land just to try to make my husband a better man?"
55634,Marge,"hear that, bart? you're going to have a little brother or sister to play with!"
67842,Marge,"well, i always enjoy the glass blower at old springfield towne."
61306,Marge,maybe now we can get that padding that goes under rugs.
64521,Marge,it was a footnote. see?
67753,Marge,"oh, homer."
63092,Marge,"i'm so glad you like it, moe."
60739,Marge,that doesn't sound very convincing.
65325,Marge,"...i want you to have a fun night doing guy stuff. don't worry about me, i'll be fine."
62115,Marge,you don't smoke!
66095,Marge,chat room?
67474,Marge,"no, no, no, the other shelf."
62632,Marge,"homer, look what this is doing to grampa. we have to settle this question once and for all with a paternity test."
59032,Marge,"well, it's not really on our walking route..."
58358,Marge,"well, we'd better start our love day clean-up. you kids take care of the wrapping paper. i'm going to dismantle love land."
66168,Marge,"chief, what are you doing to save our son?"
62891,Marge,i really know where you're coming from.
67628,Marge,...all that time.
60334,Marge,"it may contain brief rudeness, adult explosions, and scenes with garry shandling."
63893,Marge,thank god you're okay!
54609,Marge,"homer, your music is so angry and bitter."
57699,Marge,"i know she's young, but lisa has proven herself mature and dependable."
57248,Marge,"the national grammar rodeo! i wish i were going. oh, wait, wait -- i mean, i wish i was going. is that right, bart?"
61562,Marge,i hope i can still have fun while everyone else is drinking.
64853,Marge,how can you say a thing like that?
64939,Marge,just hope the kids didn't hear us.
55971,Marge,your point being?
55014,Marge,"""barnacle bill's home pregnancy test""? homer, shouldn't we have gone with a better-known brand?"
67865,Marge,then i'm in the class?
66656,Marge,homie! our prayers have been answered!
60276,Marge,you and ned married a couple floozies?
59934,Marge,it's been a whole week! why are you letting my husband die? what does that have to do with baseball?
57637,Marge,but we're happy just the way we are!
56360,Marge,"yeah, right."
61372,Marge,i probably should have watched it first.
67004,Marge,but we don't have that kind of money.
54807,Marge,"please, homie? for me?"
57448,Marge,"and now it's too late -- they're here. bart, greet our guests and take their coats."
64638,Marge,homer?
61553,Marge,i don't talk like that.
58351,Marge,"you said this monkey would be sweeping the floors and cleaning the gutters. and now he just lies there, struggling to breathe."
56477,Marge,"will you two stop saying ""gummy"" so much."
57736,Marge,"... bills, bills... oh a rejection letter from the new yorker subscription department... hmm. who or what is ""santos l. halper?"""
56214,Marge,"homey, you know, it's funny -- both my mother and your father seem pretty lonely."
59935,Marge,he's not moving.
66328,Marge,for once i'm grabbing the goody.
62887,Marge,"wow, that's what i would've said. well, i would've said ""polite and clean,"" but wow, still..."
60687,Marge,no bellybutton?! you're a clone! then the real homer...
56524,Marge,"i don't know, homer. we're right in the middle of the busy housekeeping season."
63609,Marge,our anniversary!
60202,Marge,"oh, homey, you poor thing."
61032,Marge,"oh, that's so sweet. i was tired of putting my keys in that bowl, like a cave man."
66343,Marge,dr. carlock is like my wednesday reset button.
60690,Marge,"i very much doubt that, homer. these are horrible ghouls from the past."
59024,Marge,"oh, come on, let's go for a walk! this family's getting so lazy."
63678,Marge,i'm just really worried about your weight. bart says that we got a call from nasa and your gravity is pulling satellites out of their orbit.
60285,Marge,why don't you just take britney beers and get outta here!
61622,Marge,"oh, that's so lovely. but it's too late to win us back with sweet talk!"
58884,Marge,what?
60602,Marge,at the golden banana?
65550,Marge,i was supposed to be with all of you.
59517,Marge,"okay, bart. i'll sweet-talk the sheriff, while you grab his keys."
57126,Marge,"can we get rid of this ""ayatollah"" t-shirt? khomeini died years ago."
60589,Marge,sure.
57290,Marge,"good. i'm glad. and that's what makes me cool -- not caring, right?"
59215,Marge,is that plutonium on your gums?
62333,Marge,noooo!!!
61015,Marge,quick! someone perform cpr.
62576,Marge,you're joking. you've gotta be joking.
63692,Marge,"homer's perfect for me! just look at this note: ""i miss you."" aww..."
61021,Marge,"krusty, why did you just drop your pants?"
54755,Marge,"oh, homer."
65523,Marge,what are you gonna say?
63340,Marge,exactly.
63795,Marge,"okay lisa, i'm turning my phone back on to see if your father is ready to be picked up. huh, i have over four hundred text messages."
63618,Marge,"who thought walking could be so difficult? well, i'm sure everyone else is having trouble too."
59423,Marge,what floozies? what are you talking...
67538,Marge,i'll tell you what i'm going to do. i'm going to write a letter.
57518,Marge,"i woke up and you weren't there, and i was so worried..."
63577,Marge,"homie, i made you my ""killer"" lasagna."
66933,Marge,"well, sure, okay..."
57970,Marge,"no! no one's using this gun. the tv said, you're 58 per cent more likely to shoot a family member than an intruder."
61692,Marge,"i'm looking up your nose, but i feel like i'm staring into your soul."
54987,Marge,"bart, you know there is such a thing as being a bad winner."
57084,Marge,fine. play the tape. then everyone can see you've got the wrong boy.
55460,Marge,"reverend lovejoy, i had a bit of an ulterior motive in inviting you to dinner."
67620,Marge,"yes, he's been our family physician and trusted friend ever since the day i became a mother. he's seen us through everything from colds to impetigo with competence and loving care."
59663,Marge,"more wheat cakes, mr. mayor?"
56374,Marge,even worse was our trip to sandy beach.
54877,Marge,"oh, bart. why couldn't you have gotten a paper route like other boys."
61250,Marge,you were?
59632,Marge,"you don't have the guts, little man!"
67591,Marge,sure.
65771,Marge,that's moe and a bag of garbage.
64651,Marge,stop that sniffing! it's not for you! they're making the house next door smell like cookies so people will subconsciously want to buy it.
66605,Marge,bubble gum cigarettes?
63529,Marge,point zero nine.
66337,Marge,"okay, i guess."
64141,Marge,dim the lights.
59639,Marge,"you just don't say no to the redheaded stranger. and when i heard it was for awareness, that sealed the deal."
64387,Marge,i can't believe you're gonna spend another weekend with him.
66970,Marge,sure! you never forget. it's just like riding a bicycle.
58932,Marge,anyone? anyone at all?
66194,Marge,"jumping on the bed. but i never disobeyed my parents, till i married you."
59063,Marge,thirty-three cents? i paid almost double that.
55236,Marge,"homer, the odds are three hundred and eighty million to one."
57765,Marge,church shouldn't be a chore. it should help you in your daily life.
57705,Marge,"oooh, malaria zone! that's where all the explorers shop."
56466,Marge,"you caught me at a real bad time, moe. i hope you understand i'm too tense to pretend i like you."
63768,Marge,"she's thirty-four, and she's having a rough time!"
64115,Marge,"so homer, fearing we would do the same, preemptively filed for divorce..."
66952,Marge,"you look very intelligent, dear."
57402,Marge,"and the furnace has been giving off a lot of carbon monoxide, so keep the window o--"
60465,Marge,but you were very open with your feelings.
58094,Marge,i thought i'd do anything to succeed in business. but bending the truth... i don't know.
66200,Marge,are you mocking me?!
63478,Marge,"aw, you're sweet."
56188,Marge,are you sure you can get him back for us?
64167,Marge,i wasn't talking to you.
65473,Marge,"got what, homer?"
60141,Marge,"if that costume shop knew we were using these burglar outfits for real, they'd be furious."
61486,Marge,maggie doesn't talk yet.
64498,Marge,i like to warm up by sweeping behind the snack bar.
59634,Marge,i shot the sheriff / but i did not shoot the dep-u-ty
66576,Marge,"/ oh! breathe, homie, breathe!"
56765,Marge,"i'm worried about the kids, homie. lisa's becoming very obsessive. this morning i caught her trying to dissect her own rain coat."
57902,Marge,"oh, honey, i can't right now. bart's gonna be late!"
62124,Marge,i have a book from the library with the same information!
59118,Marge,put it away. put it away!
60675,Marge,my favorite is number three!
55325,Marge,"homer, i've been thinking about what bart said. if he's really interested in being a musician, maybe we should buy him a guitar."
64956,Marge,"what do you think, homie?"
63469,Marge,longer!
55368,Marge,"homer, wait. herb, what're you talking about?"
62955,Marge,then i guess you'll do it without me.
57163,Marge,"yes. they're better. socially better. and if we fit in, we can be better too. so today, while the rest of you were out being different, i did a very good job of fitting in. so good that evelyn gave us a guest pass. they might even ask us to join!"
56537,Marge,in a little while.
55639,Marge,you don't have a cousin frank.
66785,Marge,none.
61449,Marge,...sent lewis and clark and some embedded journalists to find the northwest passage.
57679,Marge,"homer, john brought us cactus candy!"
57269,Marge,it's hard to believe someone so close to our family could be an illegal alien.
55773,Marge,do you need a beer to fall asleep?
55345,Marge,hmmm... hostage negotiations.
56127,Marge,"bart, i told you, don't draw on your father's skull."
60521,Marge,"i don't know, it's awfully expensive to fly to brazil."
63593,Marge,i told you not to mock me at picnics.
56179,Marge,no it's not.
64980,Marge,oh.
59907,Marge,perfect.
67820,Marge,a hundred and twenty-five dollars!!
67690,Marge,"""bringing up a son, even a blind one, isn't a lifetime occupation. now, the more you help him... the more you hurt him."""
58243,Marge,"homer, you don't have to go with them!"
55832,Marge,what did you way?
54743,Marge,we'll be there!
57075,Marge,"please, bart, no more pranks. it would mean so much to me if we could have just one nice family photo."
55124,Marge,"homer, those are very thoughtful presents. but you have to tell me where you got the money from."
65797,Marge,"you're both in the doghouse, which is misleading 'cause i still like the dog."
67870,Marge,"oh, that's wonderful, isn't it kids?"
62382,Marge,homer?
66904,Marge,"sorry, excuse us. pardon me..."
58244,Marge,"homer, come back!"
65132,Marge,how did that happen?
55462,Marge,"homer, you're crazy. tell him this is all crazy."
64044,Marge,you mean back to the poor house?
66662,Marge,homer look what someone left in the kitchen. frosty chocolate milkshakes.
62672,Marge,"don't worry, homer. we'll get that fireman who cut you out of that teacup ride."
59119,Marge,you mean like john leguizamo?
60349,Marge,a formal. the one place you can wear a tiara and not look crazy.
64556,Marge,"and there's a map of the subway system attached. homer, we've got to stop him!"
65386,Marge,we're wetting the bed?
56447,Marge,"bart honey, do you know who did take the money?"
55531,Marge,why are you letting him do this?
67795,Marge,i hope we're not spoiling them.
63500,Marge,crie? what does that stand for?
65172,Marge,everything's fine... we'll just wait here for the tow truck.
59822,Marge,two more bites.
67485,Marge,"okay, lisa, we're ready for your centerpiece!"
55414,Marge,"stanley, stop or i'll tell stella."
64932,Marge,"well... homer got along so well with the other dads, i couldn't break it to him."
60320,Marge,hello?
65519,Marge,i never have any idea what to do for lisa. to be the mother of someone who's so smart and so sensitive and who beautifully plays an instrument i don't really care for. it's so hard.
61121,Marge,"bart, get out of there!"
61829,Marge,that's an entry?! i thought it was garbage.
63165,Marge,"listen, bub. i have something to say to you, and it can't wait."
61953,Marge,"homer, use your inside voice."
65838,Marge,it's not all lady stuff. look at all these fitness publications.
58112,Marge,mm-hmm.
63270,Marge,bart looks so cute as a mighty oak in the school play!
62175,Marge,"well, aren't you?"
60186,Marge,"""dear burly, comma, i've never written to a registered trademark before. are you a real person, or just a composite, question mark? in either case, i would love a signed photo. sincerely, marge simpson."""
57573,Marge,"""hang in there, baby."" you said it, kitty. copyright 1968? hmm. determined or not, that cat must be long dead. that's kind of a downer."
67402,Marge,"children, bedtime."
66813,Marge,"car, wake grampa."
67198,Marge,really!?
66604,Marge,what's going on? are you kids eating your feelings?
66914,Marge,"oh, dear. maybe bart is a little more realistic."
61652,Marge,"homie, look at them!"
66886,Marge,it's not a takedown! and i haven't told him about it -- yet.
64206,Marge,the only person getting an education here today was me! in how bad it is!
61360,Marge,but i haven't endorsed it yet!
61095,Marge,"lisa, you don't know what you'll want in the future. i didn't marry the first boy i... well, i did. but you shouldn't!"
61370,Marge,what are you going to do?
58419,Marge,"good night, homie."
60056,Marge,"oh, we're calling it day care."
63986,Marge,now take it off before they sting you!
62740,Marge,"well, that's very impressive. does that include the people and the furniture?"
58602,Marge,secure.
67242,Marge,"bart, if you had cleaned up your room when i asked you to, your father's trick back would still be aligned. so you pick up this mess right now."
66587,Marge,"ooo, i'm getting a message from your father's fantasy football league. i must still be logged in as him."
66815,Marge,"here's what you do. you just take his hand, look in his eyes and say ""i don't want to be with you anymore."""
67618,Marge,do you know what i'd settle for if it was up to me? bart's medical bills and an apology!
62250,Marge,"doctor, you're a pediatrician!"
67277,Marge,"oh, bart, my baby boy. welcome home."
61198,Marge,"oh, lord."
64643,Marge,this is my mother's eightieth birthday party and you're not ruining it. you'll have a good time. i invited a friend for you.
61661,Marge,"hi, sweetie. we're just calling to check in."
55856,Marge,ninety-eight point six. you're fine.
54676,Marge,"well, i think you're helping us make progress."
67137,Marge,excuse me... where do i throw this?
65358,Marge,"please sir, we've been thrown out of a place we've always called home. we just wanna live out our lives in peace."
60798,Marge,i need that tape!
55132,Marge,"i am not cleaning that... ah, who am i kidding?"
57326,Marge,"yes, doctor, it's what we've always feared: it's loose. hugo is loose. see you soon."
64749,Marge,mama bear said 'i'm sure sister bear will come to her senses.'
56983,Marge,we better call ned. he has a ladder.
56616,Marge,that's what really happened.
61735,Marge,bart! that hobo skeleton is not a toy!
54910,Marge,if you eat too much you'll have nightmares.
59445,Marge,rockin' fun zone? that sounds funnn...
64271,Marge,maggie's genius and creativity far exceeded that of the others. and i'm not just saying that 'cause i'm her mother.
66011,Marge,excuse me.
64459,Marge,"the laundry. the machine's on the fritz, and we can't afford the four hundred dollars to fix it."
60827,Marge,i'm never gonna go to paris.
63605,Marge,stop naming things!
58431,Marge,"homer, don't look."
60801,Marge,"yes they did, look closer."
60654,Marge,"oh, forget it. they couldn't catch a cold with a... a, a cold-catching thing."
59505,Marge,you went to the snack car?
65202,Marge,but there weren't four musketeers...
66836,Marge,"oh, kids, stop arguing. or keep arguing. i don't care. homer, i'm sorry i tried to help you control your weight. i'm not sure of anything anymore. sorry i ever open my mouth."
66758,Marge,"well, with all that you folks have experienced, i think we could enjoy listening to a little of your wisdom."
65932,Marge,how did we get bedbugs?
65400,Marge,homie! we're here to find answers to your problem!
56014,Marge,"stop that, bart. homer, speak to him."
55474,Marge,no! no! i meant you were one of the good-looking ducks... that makes fun of the ugly one.
63235,Marge,now you can cut!
59755,Marge,"homie! homie, wake up! they've captured your crazed foreign carjacker!"
61952,Marge,what a delightful sprite.
59485,Marge,now what's wrong?
62305,Marge,"bart, don't make fun of grad students -- they just made a terrible life choice."
61008,Marge,no!
57916,Marge,bart's gay?
67745,Marge,what? whadda ya mean?
63937,Marge,really? me? you did?
63905,Marge,"bart, i've had it with you! i'm taking away all your tv privileges."
58985,Marge,i'm happy for you. now g'night.
67903,Marge,well... i'll tell you what. why don't we invite mr. bergstrom to dinner?
62551,Marge,"homie, you might score more points if you didn't wear that salamander suit. you look like the mascot for some horrible southern college."
56269,Marge,is it true we should wait at least an hour after eating before we go in?
60669,Marge,"well then, who shot all the gangsters?"
59842,Marge,"oh, jack... you threw it all away, over a stupid feud with skinner."
58032,Marge,"i've been looking over this list of things for the ceremony. i've got the extra wine glasses, but i'm still short a tandoori oven, an elephant, and four castrati."
66444,Marge,"oh, perfect. now that's art."
62306,Marge,"ned, let me give you a little something for babysitting."
60001,Marge,breakfast!
60559,Marge,"homer, it's over. i want you to look at your children and promise them you will never do drugs again."
61402,Marge,that's it. a novel about whaling -- that's something you haven't seen before. thank you...
55725,Marge,homer!
56274,Marge,"this was a lovely idea, homie. come here and kiss me."
59862,Marge,"homer, ball!"
57909,Marge,"sorry, lisa. it's just how the story goes. no matter what bart tried, he just couldn't fit in at school."
56846,Marge,you have to move your car.
59754,Marge,"oh, dear. we don't want that."
59802,Marge,"oh, nothing... how would you feel if i did some volunteer work at the prison?"
60005,Marge,you can't have a brownie. period.
62260,Marge,"i already use crayons for lipstick, and fireplace soot for eyeliner."
66983,Marge,"oh, i'm not much of a drinker."
65697,Marge,did you spend this whole time doing fake chores in a fake village?
58373,Marge,"good god, homer! you're turning our wonderful little town into america's trash-hole."
67036,Marge,"oh, homer, you'd lose your head if it weren't securely fastened to your neck."
59814,Marge,"oh. well, you know, lots of people shoot apu. it's just a hundred-dollar fine now."
58299,Marge,"come on, maggie, let's try and find the enormous pendulum."
59573,Marge,"actually, that was becky, too."
62090,Marge,"don't cry, sweetie. everything's gonna be all right."
59925,Marge,"oh, homie, i love them. i can't thank you enough."
61626,Marge,i wish you'd devote this much time and attention to our relationship.
65277,Marge,the contractions?
61796,Marge,"okay, here's your precious articles."
54677,Marge,let's not fight anymore. let's just make him decide between us.
67338,Marge,"homer! go ahead, lisa."
57968,Marge,"homer, we need something to protect this family."
58626,Marge,"i know you feel bad about the juice incident, but i'm sure you can make up for it somehow."
60006,Marge,no!
54858,Marge,"we can't hold it against him, just because he has things a little better than we do --"
65426,Marge,"bart, no dinner means no dessert."
60761,Marge,"now wait, homer."
60299,Marge,oh.
60404,Marge,"wow! homer, that was amazing."
55269,Marge,"ooh! the paper called it a ""taut political thriller""."
63494,Marge,"goodnight, maggie."
62664,Marge,on the back of your head.
56998,Marge,con: you're endangering your health.
63733,Marge,"lisa, have i ever shown you my shattered dreams box?"
59200,Marge,why don't you have the colonel's wife save you?
66900,Marge,they sure did... casino management.
56660,Marge,this is a special occasion. patty and selma just got promoted at the dmv.
62971,Marge,"no problem, i'll just drive up to your house and get it."
54657,Marge,...make him feel good about himself.
59418,Marge,"now homey, you know, ned and the boys need us. and you know what that means."
62690,Marge,"there, there... the fact that you tried means everything."
54769,Marge,"oh yeah, sure."
64310,Marge,"at least in other sports they're trying to put a ball in a net or a zone. but in this sport they don't put anything in anything. and if they did, i wouldn't want to see it!"
57180,Marge,"oh, i give up."
61421,Marge,"well, i guess that part is loosely based on your father."
58600,Marge,tree!
60531,Marge,i don't think my daughter should hear this.
60042,Marge,poor ned. he can't look anywhere without being reminded of maude.
55928,Marge,"bart, run down to the store and get a big bag of ice for your father."
63519,Marge,he hasn't been home in four days.
62172,Marge,then it's agreed! we ask frank gehry to build us a concert hall!
66826,Marge,"well that's great, homie. just let me finish uploading this photo."
66041,Marge,our first anniversary.
56097,Marge,"oh, it sounds like you really learned something on your field trip. think you'd be interested in a career as a box maker?"
67646,Marge,"get it while it's unbelievably hot, kids!"
57455,Marge,you know who the real victim is in all this? milhouse.
55617,Marge,"ohh, now homie, you have your health, you have your best friend back, and you do have that certain special something."
59472,Marge,you danced for hours just because they told you to?
61475,Marge,kids?
62914,Marge,"okay, be cool. i've got some candy in my purse..."
58198,Marge,"ooo, what a nice surprise! this is so generous of you, cooder."
65778,Marge,i guess. as long as we don't make it a habit.
64739,Marge,"homie, you know what happens when you push your luck..."
63567,Marge,"""you chat up the guard at the gate, while i knife the guard behind me."" i can't do that, dwight."
64864,Marge,well we've gotta buy something!
62173,Marge,"dear mr. gehry: would you please build a concert hall for our town? we may not be the biggest city, or the prettiest, but we were the first city in america to abandon the metric system!"
57510,Marge,woo-woo!
59056,Marge,i guess everyone has a different vision for the perfect world.
54887,Marge,"bart, don't feed your sister hotels!"
67014,Marge,arrrgh!
62785,Marge,you've been transferred to india!?
61399,Marge,thank you!
66976,Marge,"you did it, homer."
65491,Marge,homer!
60780,Marge,"can't beat a skybox. all the excitement of being in the sky, with the security of being in a box."
60574,Marge,homer? what's going on?
54896,Marge,hello?
58513,Marge,that was your idea!
55487,Marge,"grampa, you said that about all the presents."
59540,Marge,why does it have a picture of vitamin barn?
61833,Marge,"hey, plenty of kids are gonna look up to me when i'm auntie whatever it is. right now people just know me as the wife of the guy who doesn't go to work. can't you understand that i need this?"
67153,Marge,never.
56470,Marge,"homer, we can't root for one child over the other. you wouldn't like it if the kids played favorites with us."
55959,Marge,"they need our support. besides, they gave me two tickets to the ballet."
54621,Marge,"oh my god, you're a junkie!"
56418,Marge,homer! homie? hm... what he's typed will be a window into his madness.
66300,Marge,"homer, tell them your side of the story. i know i hurt you, but please trust me now. it'll work."
62630,Marge,"homie, you just met this british man. it's too soon to get so emotionally invested."
60688,Marge,my homie's dead? how will i go on?
56985,Marge,"bart, no!"
58095,Marge,"so that's how you see me? as a spineless, potato-cooking housewife who can't compete in the real world?"
59307,Marge,goodbye everybody!
58488,Marge,you're thirty-nine.
55000,Marge,"oh, homer!"
58083,Marge,"yeah, but you shouldn't have to settle. you know, i've always loved the house you're in now."
61204,Marge,i don't know if toy drunkards are an appropriate gift for a baby.
59057,Marge,who's up for some beers?
59259,Marge,"you know, i saw apu today. he's really frazzled."
58506,Marge,they're not very...
56739,Marge,i think they're in love.
67107,Marge,well then come down for breakfast.
65845,Marge,"if you don't want to die alone, come out of your room!"
60928,Marge,i'll just call a plumber.
63578,Marge,you're a killer for hire!
64439,Marge,then don't have any.
59018,Marge,are you okay?
60938,Marge,are you sure? because it really spoke to me.
61899,Marge,"terrace. evergreen terrace. the street that smells like pee. this is my daughter, lisa."
67926,Marge,because i'm a ghost!
56058,Marge,why?
67952,Marge,coming right up. mind if i turn on a little music?
57808,Marge,you've got to get him out of there!
67576,Marge,ohhh.
63259,Marge,"oh, i don't know, he might come home any minute."
63652,Marge,"oh, lighten up. you tv fat cats have plenty of money. my cousin maureen saw you flying in business class!"
60448,Marge,"thanks for coming, mr. mccoy. we cooked your favorites: rattlejailbird meat, varmint kabobs, and refried whiskey."
62922,Marge,"lisa, i think i have a way to help you at the trial today."
62797,Marge,"noble sir, you may accompany us to america in my late husband's clothing."
55113,Marge,"well, anyone who beats you up for wearing a shirt isn't your friend. ooh this looks good.... oh and this one is very, very cute... and these... oh look! little bow ties."
61679,Marge,we understand perfectly well!
63502,Marge,"okay, i'll sign up."
56682,Marge,"no, homie. you see. you see, this is the stuff i've been telling you about that you never see."
65916,Marge,what does this do?
65484,Marge,why is he trying to kill you and why did she call you her love?
67915,Marge,"oh, and homie, can you come home early from work tomorrow so i can have a girls' night out?"
64624,Marge,"lisa, i know kids have been making fun of your blonde hair, so i got you this book from the ""being different"" section of the bookstore."
58276,Marge,i didn't mean any disrespect. i just can't figure it out.
62283,Marge,"ooh, i could be the rachel to your jacob."
65135,Marge,"wow -- the gym ropes are seaweed, the basketball nets are fishing nets..."
58438,Marge,very close...
66310,Marge,"homer, i want you to take kumiko and comic book guy a housewarming present... and maybe check in on them?"
57823,Marge,just a little more... then he won't have any reason to resent you.
56930,Marge,...and then i saw my boy in a burlap sack and they told me he had lice!
62467,Marge,a robot?
62437,Marge,"oh kirk, come join the parents in the kitchen. we're having alcohol drinks, and dishing on the parents who aren't here."
56746,Marge,"oh, my god! she's having babies! oh, i'm sorry, girl. i thought you were just getting fat."
63302,Marge,"that's better. now, let's role... play!"
62161,Marge,"three hundred cans of budget club mushroom soup! if you have some noodles and tuna fish, you could make a casserole that's small on price, but big on flavor."
60085,Marge,the best thing about a gypsy wedding is i'm not the hairiest woman here.
65264,Marge,you'll understand one day when you have kids of your own.
56386,Marge,oh.
63841,Marge,me? a professional baker's employee? imagine how different my life would be!
58520,Marge,one reward coming up. ta-da!
65107,Marge,no! you should never raise your hand to a child. just leave the crust on their sandwiches. they'll get the message.
62015,Marge,i agree. hey! aren't you that crazy cat lady?
56878,Marge,i'm happy for the school. it sounds like this money is gonna provide a lot of new opportunities.
62848,Marge,now i have a question... who are you people?
66159,Marge,"i have no regrets about that. it was a perfect pregnancy. didn't smoke, didn't drink, lost three pounds. and every night before bed, homer would give me a little kiss... music. could bart have been prenatally screwed up by the kiss music?"
60610,Marge,"bart, don't slurp your soup."
60829,Marge,the late frank grimes...
61293,Marge,"mr. connor, thank you for helping find my husband. i don't want my last words to him to be ""clip your toenails, they look like fritos."""
62505,Marge,a tea house?!
62257,Marge,forty-seven?
58325,Marge,permission granted.
61776,Marge,stop that! we're guests in mr. burns!
62346,Marge,why would we want to go to santa's village? it's august.
59139,Marge,i think you misheard me.
61668,Marge,the kids tracked us down! our romantic holiday just became a stinkin' family vacation.
58889,Marge,i guess...
65428,Marge,homer!
57082,Marge,that's crazy! bart's not a shoplifter! he's just a little boy!
55068,Marge,aww...
65101,Marge,homer? could you please turn down those blimp engines and tell me where you are?
59719,Marge,but i do feel bad about the starving children...
56303,Marge,"homer, young people learn about love from adults, and we've been setting a terrible example for our children and the community in general. i want us to deal with the issues raised by this book."
64291,Marge,where's your brother?
60583,Marge,"oh, this is so awkward. today's the day we play badminton with them. oh, i hope no one makes any double entendres."
60506,Marge,"uh, i think we're with comquaaq."
55321,Marge,"hmmm, well, all right, but make sure they don't pick up any of the band's attitudes towards women... liquor... religion... politics... really anything."
59364,Marge,will that really work?
56202,Marge,"well, bart, your uncle arthur used to have a saying, ""shoot 'em all and let god sort 'em out."" unfortunately, one day he put his theory into practice. it took seventy-five federal marshals to bring him down. now, let's never speak of him again."
66799,Marge,"well, bring him here now! i want my homie back! i miss him and the things he did!"
63634,Marge,you also remembered i like flattery!
64974,Marge,i'm looking for homer simpson.
63093,Marge,"homie, this sculpting has made me feel so fulfilled. i'm as hopeful and full of life as i was in the years before i met you."
59636,Marge,... a smile.
67417,Marge,"okay, homer. fair enough. you got it! all right! good! that's it. that's how i'm gonna express myself. that's right. goodnight."
65001,Marge,time to finally return your father's overdue movies.
55896,Marge,i'm pretty sure there is.
59031,Marge,"ooo, looks like something exciting's happening. well, we'll have to read about it in tomorrow's paper."
66009,Marge,a proud mother always does.
65440,Marge,"you wanna know what happens on your stupid show? firstly, the ""mysterious island"" is fifteen miles from long beach. also, doorway three led to hell despite the series creators' repeated insistence it did not lead to hell, and the entire strandedverse is a piece of gravel in a cosmic kitty litter box!"
54946,Marge,those aren't even words!
67898,Marge,"lisa, we can talk, but first you have to accept the fact that i feel that way about your father!"
54607,Marge,homer! you're embarrassing me!
67694,Marge,"well, i don't think you're my type."
61302,Marge,stop it! stop it! stop it!
66766,Marge,you didn't have to do that. i love you just the same.
61929,Marge,let me think about it. no.
64838,Marge,"hm... well, okay."
64157,Marge,you want to know the score? i'll tell you the score.
56344,Marge,"well, as jerry lee lewis would say: ""there's a whole lotta frowning going on."""
59864,Marge,chief wiggum! are you here to make a bust of some kind?
62697,Marge,"what do you think, maggie?"
58505,Marge,"no, bart. homer... all these inventions, they're..."
54734,Marge,i must apologize for my husband.
64037,Marge,oh really?
61152,Marge,"that's us in a nutshell. i care so much about you, homer, but i'm not even on your list. excuse me."
63118,Marge,"well, if no one else jumped off the empire state building, would you not jump?"
57844,Marge,i certainly hope so! that's better.
57240,Marge,"what?!! oh, my god!"
63552,Marge,hello?
62008,Marge,it's true. you'd be quite a catch... if you'd just shower and shave and stop swearing under your breath.
60936,Marge,"homer, that was not very christian of you."
60229,Marge,do a nice one for grandma.
59242,Marge,homer!
58352,Marge,i want you to take that monkey back so he can be rehabilitated and get a second chance.
62137,Marge,i melted string cheese over some corn chips!
59231,Marge,it certainly is. why don't you put down your gun and have a slice?
67003,Marge,"gee, homer, are you sure this is the right thing to do?"
63080,Marge,"oh, you should be ashamed! your father works very hard to put lobsters on our table. every night, he comes home exhausted, with his voice too hoarse to talk."
59614,Marge,"well, that's a relief, too, knowing i'm not crazy. so i guess everything really worked out for the--"
63257,Marge,"be nice, homer. don't you see how great it is that they found each other? like how the parts of a pig nobody wants combine to make a yummy hot dog."
57621,Marge,i guess we're not going to find anyone.
60138,Marge,but first we gotta break out of these stocks.
54968,Marge,"homer, are you ordering junk off the tv again?"
58108,Marge,"mmmm. goodbye, ned. if the slightest thing goes wrong with that house, i want you to call me right away. or you can beep me. in fact, why don't you just stay here tonight? we'll go to a hotel."
57113,Marge,all right.
58687,Marge,i've got maggie.
59441,Marge,hmm. a night out is a night out.
67661,Marge,"oh, where can he be?"
58683,Marge,homer!
66294,Marge,how is that not stealing?
54710,Marge,he cares so much about those doggone dugongs. i wish i felt that kind of passion. maybe i should join him on his mission...
55182,Marge,"although actually there's only one. and it's more of a love postcard, from some brewery he visited."
67192,Marge,we're... uh...
55677,Marge,"oh, homie, i don't know. this might upset them."
63332,Marge,who would do this to bart?
61714,Marge,uggams!
66295,Marge,i'm so tired of being trapped in this embassy.
59827,Marge,"uh, mecca? well, let's..."
56430,Marge,"good morning, dear."
58067,Marge,"oh boy, i've got a lot to learn before that license test."
57132,Marge,you didn't vote for anybody.
60376,Marge,i'm taking him to dr. hibbert's this afternoon. you know how hard it is to get a doctor on wednesday morning.
58028,Marge,"oh, bart and lisa! you remember your father, apu. well, this is your father, apu's mother."
62295,Marge,homie... i'd better start dinner.
67498,Marge,children need discipline. you can ask any syndicated advice columnist.
66609,Marge,uh-huh!
63639,Marge,and i'll just fold this old sweaty blanket and put it in the closet.
62221,Marge,you're not married to ray!
60891,Marge,i got all the way out to the tree before i realized i'd left the house.
64925,Marge,"it's close, but no."
64762,Marge,this poor man must've been out there for days!
61240,Marge,"okay, homie. if it makes you feel better, i think your mom's all right, too."
61456,Marge,"c'mon, bart -- we can make this fun. history's like an amusement park, except instead of rides, you have dates to memorize."
66858,Marge,why are you telling me all these things?
66834,Marge,he chose to spend the night in a jail with strangers instead of with me.
59953,Marge,she got it open.
56151,Marge,underpants.
64038,Marge,...of school!
67605,Marge,"oh, bart! we thought for a minute you'd gone away from us."
64161,Marge,can you at least bring a sweater for maggie?
59327,Marge,i'm sorry!
59748,Marge,there you are. how was the magic act?
64209,Marge,"what if we got a small apartment there? we wouldn't have to live in it, but we would have a waverly hills address."
59583,Marge,really?
58944,Marge,"okay, okay! let me just get the wire cutters."
57025,Marge,yeah.
55410,Marge,"maggie is allergic to strained pears, and she likes a bottle of warm milk before naptime..."
62568,Marge,"would i?! now let's see... homer cut up my wedding dress to make a badminton net -- which he never uses, he spent my last three birthdays in jail, called out his bowling ball's name during sex..."
64999,Marge,"and remember, on the road, the only vice you can indulge in is gluttony. save lust and rage for me and the kids."
64076,Marge,there'll be another one in north yemen in 2027.
55350,Marge,how cute. they don't open their mouths do they?
67342,Marge,"oooh, your third bowl... i think you may be on the mend. is there anything else i can get you?"
67523,Marge,a dash of rosemary... a smidgin of thyme... a pinch of marjoram...
63867,Marge,"i'm sorry, mr. leary. sometimes it's hard to be a parent."
61958,Marge,"homer, that was apollo twelve!"
57029,Marge,five tires?! am i seeing things?
67310,Marge,this is marge simpson. i'd like a babysitter for the evening.
65406,Marge,and maybe you'll stop overeating too!
63249,Marge,shut up! it's an instructional website! shut up!
67376,Marge,homer! what's this thing in the corner?
62846,Marge,my head feels like it was punched by a boxing man.
66661,Marge,homer!
61379,Marge,it's no! his old bike is fine!
65859,Marge,your behavior at that game was unacceptable! you're lucky they gave you your participant trophy.
56452,Marge,"i think lisa needs to feel a little special tonight. how about letting her ride up front, too?"
62252,Marge,cottage cheese!
60456,Marge,"well, we're not giving up. we're going to cure you of drinking."
65205,Marge,"and the food will all be weird foams -- cooked with chemicals, or served in a test tube. it's too crazy for you."
54670,Marge,wait nicely!
59221,Marge,what is it? carrots? peas? maybe it's okra.
61288,Marge,"now look here, mister. i forbid you to fight a bear."
55746,Marge,"homer, we're going to my sisters'! remember, pick up bart!"
60071,Marge,the buffalo are gone. i think you shot them all.
62880,Marge,no! and i hope i never do! the best thing that ever happened to me was forgetting about you!
60665,Marge,"but you're just perpetuating a negative italian-american stereotype. i mean, you could be a pizza man, organ grinder, uh... leaning tower maker... and... did i say pizza man?"
64026,Marge,"homie, please, nothing good will come of this."
67792,Marge,"homer, please."
56432,Marge,"listen, kids. you're eight and ten years old now. i can't be fighting all your battles for you."
66570,Marge,well... it could be worse.
66795,Marge,we're gonna have a lot of mittens this winter.
66584,Marge,"oh, thank god."
63046,Marge,how could you eat that goo? you don't know what galaxy it's from!
55128,Marge,but gambling is illegal.
63762,Marge,so that's it. she's been burned by the most important man in her life... her father.
62273,Marge,"homie, i'm worried you're turning into some kind of super koo-koo stage mother."
61213,Marge,all the time. sometimes i bring them lemonade.
56584,Marge,i meant our wedding rings.
66712,Marge,those were your father's sweatpants.
66847,Marge,dare i say it? yippee!
67212,Marge,"don't strain yourself, dear."
65809,Marge,"and now that i know better, no dvds for you kids. just educational television."
66778,Marge,homer!
62687,Marge,"reverend, why do we really need this?"
67578,Marge,hello?
67943,Marge,"great, i'll come with you. shouldn't you bundle up? here, let me enchant your pants."
64252,Marge,i think mel would be happier as an understudy. a six-feet-understudy.
57641,Marge,an occasional hug is all i ask.
55933,Marge,have you been up all night eating cheese?
66917,Marge,homer!
54995,Marge,of course. all work and moe play makes moe a moe moe.
61535,Marge,"okay kids, this book should help you deal with your feelings."
56810,Marge,"you got it, little buddy."
62532,Marge,"bart, are you having a fight with your boyfriends?"
58841,Marge,m-a-r-g-e.
60007,Marge,stop it!
57587,Marge,what are you talking about?
55982,Marge,"i am lucky. i have a husband and three wonderful children, thank you very much."
65153,Marge,they're all pretty big...
55378,Marge,you're what?
60489,Marge,"ooh, did you say joan van ark?"
55545,Marge,i think one side of our house is sinking.
65760,Marge,"homie, if we did both die, we've never named guardians. the kids could end up wards of the state."
56448,Marge,we really shouldn't have let them do this. it can't be helping his self esteem.
67244,Marge,well... okay.
65723,Marge,"lisa and maggie are downstairs, and bart's in his room with milhouse."
55198,Marge,"that's disgusting. and besides, when a woman loves a man, it doesn't matter that a crocodile bit off his face."
65739,Marge,"well, we're gonna turn this change into change for the better!"
54754,Marge,"hello, reverend. we're glad we could come. oh, hello helen."
62980,Marge,"homer, where did you get that truck?"
67184,Marge,"what, homer?"
65366,Marge,on a night like tonight i have to believe there are.
55106,Marge,bart?
62324,Marge,"homer, you've been out all night! and you look like you've accepted someone as your personal something. were you at that catholic church?!"
64154,Marge,just what i always wanted.
64118,Marge,who are you calling an old lady?
63601,Marge,fine. since the color of my eyes isn't important to you then you don't get to see them until you remember!
65445,Marge,well of course they don't.
66919,Marge,"well, homer and i are looking forward to your visit, too."
58661,Marge,hip hip--
63027,Marge,"uh-oh, switch!"
64134,Marge,i can't believe you're ruining the second thursday before the wedding!
64619,Marge,lisa is very sensitive. if something she loves dies in front of her--
65057,Marge,"hm, there must be some mistake."
58231,Marge,"now, how are we going to get my homie back?"
67670,Marge,you're alive!
65245,Marge,the farthest thing from this office i know: rafting down rattler river canyon.
67131,Marge,the holes were drilled for your fingers.
65401,Marge,we know there's a marriage in trouble and it has something to do with fish...
65121,Marge,i put a slice of apple in it!
59313,Marge,what about mr. burns? maybe he'll help us out.
56688,Marge,yes!
62071,Marge,"i just can't believe my sister would keep me in the dark all these years, then expect complete acceptance on the day she gets married."
65399,Marge,at last we'll get to the bottom of...
55485,Marge,"homer, those are ice cream men."
62736,Marge,i'll do it. i'll do it. i'll do it. i'll do it. i'll do it.
60332,Marge,"oh honey, think pink. look, a salute to safe sex!"
66158,Marge,he's such a little dickens. although dickens was pretty well-behaved.
60455,Marge,have we gotten all the liquor?
57858,Marge,"sorry, sorry."
65436,Marge,"why, if it isn't jimbo, dorf and ernie."
55283,Marge,have you kissed her?
57698,Marge,"actually, bart, lisa is going to be in charge tonight."
56261,Marge,"homer, what happened to you?"
56397,Marge,"i want all five t-shirts to say, ""best vacation ever."""
57369,Marge,"homer! homer, he's not going to get tired! you've got to hit him back! hit him back!"
61286,Marge,"oh, dear lord."
60633,Marge,homer!
66087,Marge,can i have one hour of grownup time where you two aren't tattling on each other or using obscure references?
55164,Marge,"""bungee jumping, kayaking, calligraphy, cigar making, hula dancing... hmm... i guess i've done everything."
66480,Marge,"homie, i felt terrible when you said i felt ""stuck"" with you. but then, i realized: i am stuck with you. i couldn't stop loving you if i tried."
66807,Marge,"thank you, sven-golly. i knitted us a blanket."
58217,Marge,but what if they try to talk us into something?
57001,Marge,con: i am finding myself less attracted to you physically.
59980,Marge,he doesn't look so fast to me.
65534,Marge,"well at least it didn't end as bad as ""romeo and juliet."""
66905,Marge,oh... lisa's class.
56140,Marge,"homer, that's not god, that's just a waffle that bart tossed up there."
66591,Marge,well i don't like this trash talk. and i'm gonna do something about it. even if i have to bring in the big guns.
57804,Marge,donny's discount gas!
56581,Marge,"aw, homie. you know, you are a member of a very exclusive club."
59092,Marge,"hey, we never opened that envelope to see what our gift is."
59450,Marge,who cares? he's dishin' out the dirt.
58647,Marge,"the water's boiling! quick, chuck him in!"
65331,Marge,"well. i usually take lisa, but i can just go with bart."
67360,Marge,"i love you, homer."
64505,Marge,let's give the olympics a miracle!
66759,Marge,no casual racism!
66972,Marge,"your father's gone, too."
66026,Marge,i've had it! no more karate monsters!
64645,Marge,you said you'd be home by seven to help with my mother's birthday!
54728,Marge,"homer, please. we've never thrown a party. now we're gonna pay back all the friends who've invited us to their homes."
63215,Marge,"what's the matter, sweetie?"
60028,Marge,"oh, no. we're out of gas. i couldn't figure out this stupid italian gas gauge."
57728,Marge,"that was a very sweet thing you did for poor wiggum, but what's going to happen to you?"
55756,Marge,i think we should go.
66256,Marge,"first in freeways... ""the 'yuh-huh' state""... ""jewel of the fracking belt""... ""still a british colony at heart""... ""land of many water snakes""..."
55144,Marge,ahhh!!
61943,Marge,nooooo!
57202,Marge,seven hundred dollars.
56512,Marge,kids? kids?
61986,Marge,"moe? what's up, partner?"
59064,Marge,eww...
64027,Marge,"forget it, marge. a girl like you could never land a homer simpson."
65726,Marge,how can you call yourself a christian?
65617,Marge,grampa's army footlocker! i bet the most important things in the world to him are in this box!
65566,Marge,it says on your facebook page you have no kids.
57616,Marge,"homie, please, i never ask for much, but this is something i really need."
61301,Marge,we did -- homer took him. didn't you?
67846,Marge,homer?
64633,Marge,"i don't want to get homer in trouble, but it's just plain wrong to use that blind spot to turn our back yard into a mecca of misdemeanors!"
61604,Marge,would you like to join us?
58430,Marge,"i love him, too. g'night."
65958,Marge,i sent you to the store to get applesauce for maggie two hours ago!
56548,Marge,but it's true. they didn't write their own songs or play their own instruments.
58500,Marge,what happened? you didn't fall.
58444,Marge,should we get started?
54814,Marge,it doesn't do anything.
62060,Marge,oh no. no no. no. i'm just... surprised.
66060,Marge,he forgot our anniversary again? he remembers the exact number of pork chops in the freezer.
60913,Marge,i wasn't asking.
55188,Marge,"yes, homer."
55149,Marge,homer
67185,Marge,"here you go, kids. special lunches. lots of good things for growing bodies and some treats just for fun."
65085,Marge,this ends now!
58104,Marge,no. there is absolutely nothing else to tell you about this house.
66406,Marge,go! go! go!
57891,Marge,"oh, now be fair, edna. i liked armin tamzarian too, but he was at least as big a weenie as sgt. skinner."
67458,Marge,you brought food...
65051,Marge,oh screw it.
66460,Marge,lucas.
64797,Marge,you see that mirror? i discovered that if i sat in the kitchen i could see if the bathroom was free using the reflection from the mirror off the toaster.
66198,Marge,"come down, homie! ""you only live once"" also means when you die, you die!"
55492,Marge,single white female wanted for mysterious expedition. must like monkeys. non-smoker preferred.
63650,Marge,"i've gotten so much accomplished: i saved ""lost"", watched all of ""rome"" in a day, and got through ""two and a half men"" in two and a half minutes. then i ran out of space and had to choose between ""sophie's choice"" and ""schindler's list."""
63810,Marge,no more simpsons movies! one was plenty!
67703,Marge,"well, not me. shut it off and let's get down to business."
67522,Marge,"well, he's got a pretty good father."
59705,Marge,"now that our son is an honor student, i'm going to get one of those bumper stickers that informs strangers of that fact."
59050,Marge,"homer, i've never seen this side of you! but i like it..."
58876,Marge,"looks like it's time for plan b. one, two, three, ""b""!"
57517,Marge,"oh, homer, thank goodness you're safe!"
66715,Marge,we brought cheerios for you!
61490,Marge,"and even then, he could only speak german!"
63078,Marge,"lisa, grab your sightseeing shoes! we're going vermonting!"
62751,Marge,"well, i liked the genie part. that was fun."
54876,Marge,"homer, what did you find out?"
60815,Marge,"hm, i guess we'll have to find a new way to entertain ourselves."
56552,Marge,wait! daddy! wait! please don't leave. take me with you!
58813,Marge,"hey, look at this one. it's a poem. from apu!"
61157,Marge,what?
64195,Marge,"well, i'll make you forget all about it."
57107,Marge,"now, i know you love video games, and i asked the clerk which is the one every boy wants..."
65293,Marge,my daughter's a vegetarian.
66333,Marge,who's mommy's little girl? genealogy dot org says you are. you are!
62553,Marge,did you just vomit in that suit?
59893,Marge,"look, we're all trying to have dinner. so why don't we just... psych! psych! psych!"
60313,Marge,"aw, hop in."
67876,Marge,"i'm painting his portrait, homer."
63173,Marge,"it's the famous barnacle bay fog! there's even a poem about it! ""oh cotton candy in gossamer light / thy soft gray kiss upon my cheek"" it smells like heinie!"
56435,Marge,bart! lisa! time for church.
66035,Marge,we're not broken!
61682,Marge,"shut up and kiss me, you doomed hunk!"
57410,Marge,springfield doesn't want places like this!
63997,Marge,"say ""yes"" say ""yes""!"""
58527,Marge,yes?
58245,Marge,that's my husband!
58019,Marge,"apu, you're a bachelor. get up there!"
59955,Marge,"okay, that's in the ""maybe"" file. what if you two bond over your malibu stacey dolls?"
62340,Marge,"it wasn't a fair fight! your church suckered him in with gory stories, just like we were suckered into getting cinemax."
64079,Marge,you guys have treated me like a princess. every day's been like the first ten minutes of mother's day!
63253,Marge,can we at least get out of the house for an evening?
58404,Marge,"homer, what's going on? shouldn't you be at work?"
58612,Marge,hey!
64193,Marge,"well, i know a place in this house where you can really relax."
57358,Marge,"homer, of all the crazy ideas you've had, this one ranks somewhere in the middle. you're thirty-eight years old, you don't know how to box and you haven't gotten any exercise since grade school. before you even consider this, i insist you consult a doctor."
59652,Marge,"son, i don't like you watching that fire. it's too violent."
63991,Marge,now you know how i'll feel when you go to college.
64355,Marge,"oh my god, i've never felt so... uncreeped-out by you!"
57882,Marge,let's bake him a cake.
58253,Marge,"internet, eh?"
64257,Marge,macbeth!
67773,Marge,"homer, you will find her a man."
67599,Marge,"um, i don't know. i guess one person can make a difference, but most of the time, they probably shouldn't."
58518,Marge,"oh, i've never been so proud. you both deserve a big, big reward!"
62145,Marge,"lights out, weirdoes!"
61493,Marge,"look at these courses you'll be taking. ""advanced peek-a-boo""."
60535,Marge,"all right family, who can guess what's different about dinner tonight?"
66851,Marge,sure!
58820,Marge,"i do too. but it was sweet. women really like that sort of thing, homie."
58663,Marge,this should be very educational. i want you kids to pay attention.
59762,Marge,"ready for the circus, homer?"
56693,Marge,"just a minute, homer! oh, look what you made me write! anyway, we think you'll really enjoy our quiet little town. sincerely, marge simpson."""
64581,Marge,"thanks, but you can stop giving the tour now."
67327,Marge,you'll see.
67374,Marge,what on earth was that?
60269,Marge,this family has hit rock bottom.
66668,Marge,i'm just happy you're happy.
61305,Marge,my husband's a power-mad star.
62399,Marge,so that's why i've been smelling margaritas at three a.m.
61496,Marge,"and maggie gets a shirt, too!"
61059,Marge,"homer, i'm sorry you saw that, but i was very upset that night."
56100,Marge,"bart, it's time to get ready for the show."
64655,Marge,water feature...
67719,Marge,homer!
64962,Marge,the a.a.? no!
57164,Marge,"oh, don't thank me. thank my beautiful new suit."
58020,Marge,"don't be shy. uh, excuse me! excuse me, we have one more bachelor!"
61349,Marge,i'll cut to the chase. i brought with me the very best reason i can think of for what i believe in.
60923,Marge,mm-hmm.
62711,Marge,where's bart? i haven't seen him since you came home.
64061,Marge,"homie, the faucet won't stop leaking."
64783,Marge,you're alive?
57102,Marge,"oh, bart. i can't believe you did this."
64262,Marge,"no, i just encouraged him."
57218,Marge,"sorry, but you need a good night's rest."
56852,Marge,"i'm sorry i had to arrest you, homer. but what i did was right. someday, when you really need it, you'll be happy there are dedicated cops like me out there."
63643,Marge,the doctor called me about all the crazy surgeries you wanted. and i said no. but i did have him unstaple your stomach and turn you back into the sweet man i love.
64491,Marge,"well, they should."
62946,Marge,"uh, let's see here... ooh, here's something the book's previous owner underlined! ""be honest with your partner about what you're feeling."""
64281,Marge,"oh, homie... take your shirt off again."
59411,Marge,president clinton?!
61620,Marge,"well, it's... in my case... hmm."
58452,Marge,"you don't think there's anything wrong with what we're doing, do you?"
61727,Marge,"oh, homie! you did care."
63715,Marge,homie... have you been cheating on your diet?!
55649,Marge,"bart, from now on, the baby sleeps in the crib."
58064,Marge,mr. hutz! i didn't know you sold real estate.
61351,Marge,then wait in the shadows!
66892,Marge,reverend! reverend! they took homer!
57350,Marge,"i've been so bored since we moved here, i've found myself drinking a glass of wine every day. i know doctors say you should drink a glass and a half, but i just can't drink that much."
62488,Marge,"homie, no! it's not street legal!"
67222,Marge,"oh, bart. excuse me, sir. the party next door seems to be a little raucous. could you please ask them to quiet down a little bit, please?"
62078,Marge,"grampa, you're a greet grater! i mean a great greeter! now look who's senile!"
60249,Marge,"ah. well, you do have a present under the tree. i guess no one told santa you were a buddhist."
61012,Marge,"occasionally, you might hear a faint roar..."
66581,Marge,they've been at it all night.
61880,Marge,"nelson, what are you doing out this late?"
67853,Marge,"now, they're only thirty-five calories apiece."
56250,Marge,all right. okay. everybody out!
67409,Marge,homer... i'm a bailey booster.
64290,Marge,that's odd. there isn't a single man in this whole bowling alley.
60282,Marge,why don't you come inside and we'll talk?
66985,Marge,do you think we should leave the kids unsupervised?
58815,Marge,the only ad you took out was to sell our lawnmower.
61808,Marge,i hope the ovenfresh bake-off likes them as much as you do.
62982,Marge,and i can stop looking the other way from what my husband's doing.
59873,Marge,all of that is you. you've gotta take this more seriously.
59655,Marge,what?! you threw our precious babies into the woods?! we could have sold them!
55781,Marge,"bart, could you go get the cupcakes?"
62622,Marge,"i'm trapped -- like the ""l"" in a b.l.t.!"
58116,Marge,$300 for doing nothing?! i feel like such a crook.
57282,Marge,of course you have a choice.
66465,Marge,you can do better!
54627,Marge,"no, i'm going to be an astronaut."
55809,Marge,homie!
58270,Marge,i've really gotta get dinner started...
61359,Marge,save our families! sign our petition!
65092,Marge,"okay. okay, the spare key is somewhere in here."
63169,Marge,we're not gonna make it!
57371,Marge,"oh, homie, are you okay?"
60428,Marge,"and our marriage, with his latest invention -- the snore converter."
63589,Marge,"bart, go out to the shed and get some more butane!"
60027,Marge,"oh, he's on the blue man group again. c'mon, we've got lotsa time."
65964,Marge,grampa's in charge of you kids while we go to capital city.
65340,Marge,i'll get a couple glasses.
67840,Marge,"homer, that's terrible. we should be teaching the children to treasure the elderly. you know, we'll be old someday."
55817,Marge,why'd you bring that up?
55082,Marge,bart! be polite.
63833,Marge,it's clown trouble. that's your responsibility.
59380,Marge,"well, don't run up mr. burns' phone bill."
58060,Marge,i found this hat!
60989,Marge,"well, it ain't happening today."
65466,Marge,"sorry sweetie, i just needed to get that out of my system."
66014,Marge,"no, he cheated."
62249,Marge,his liver looks healthy.
60396,Marge,"look, it's great to see you, but you should know i'm happily married."
54984,Marge,don't you at least have something to say to bart?
67049,Marge,"do you think you're being nice enough to your sister, bart?"
56689,Marge,"you like my idea? actually, i have several others..."
65435,Marge,it means i'm mad!
55046,Marge,marcus?
65041,Marge,and now my son is a bully. can you fix him?
65231,Marge,you make electricity. it runs the hospital!
61312,Marge,"that's a very violent image, lisa."
66028,Marge,dammit!
59140,Marge,i thought you'd like it. and i'm enjoying the friendship between showgirl and that seamstress.
67124,Marge,...and my sisters.
66693,Marge,i thought people in the future would be more full of peace and love. like in epcot center.
54957,Marge,thirty years?
55767,Marge,what's so funny?
59253,Marge,"say, whatcha got there?"
62199,Marge,you mean get beaten up by him?
61105,Marge,the amish are so industrious. not like those shiftless mennonites.
54845,Marge,"well, when i used to get stuck like this, i'd go for a bike ride. do kids go on bike rides anymore?"
61601,Marge,but he won't know where to go or what to eat.
65421,Marge,mr. burns seemed like such a nice man the day he arrived.
65005,Marge,i hate to say this about the cat lady... but i think she's crazy. she's a hoarder!
67740,Marge,"aren't you ready for church, homer?"
65959,Marge,what kind of accident?
60226,Marge,let's just write to david bowie again.
55235,Marge,you can still win some money if you have five out of six.
61272,Marge,"no, it's too risky! we'll just wait till the traffic thins out. turn, turn, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning, keep turning..."
58926,Marge,"excuse me, mister... trainee, i'm trying to find a musical doorbell."
56759,Marge,"dogs! chief, you're getting powdered sugar all over my floor!"
55375,Marge,"herb, i appreciate your generosity, but i don't need any gift from you."
67649,Marge,"please, homer. can't we try it?"
56391,Marge,this is just what i was hoping for. spending the day together as a family.
56446,Marge,that's what he wore to church.
56624,Marge,yes.
59343,Marge,"oh, i don't know, honey. i've got a lot of therapy left."
66898,Marge,my family loves your microwave lasagnas.
64539,Marge,"let's have lunch at ""crouching tiger hidden eggroll."""
62724,Marge,i believe he's saying he's okay.
65510,Marge,why would you believe him?
59133,Marge,"oh, grow up."
58676,Marge,"well, giving him a kidney is a wonderful way to show him how you feel."
65330,Marge,lisa?
67882,Marge,doesn't it bother you that he orders you around like that?
60902,Marge,steroids!?
60181,Marge,and burly's still got soaking power. spill something else.
61263,Marge,tony... i mean mr. prime minister... what should we see first?
66794,Marge,i really do miss my homie this time of night.
65450,Marge,and i sold our good china.
63843,Marge,cakes!
56575,Marge,everyone likes you. you're a wonderful person.
67159,Marge,but...
61367,Marge,i try my best. they ridicule me. they mock everything i cherish.
62699,Marge,"i'm a ""star wars."" now let's see who you've drawn!"
58903,Marge,oh my god!
55951,Marge,how'd you know he's a vampire?
61007,Marge,there has to be a solution that pleases everyone. from ducks and trees to yous and mes.
55092,Marge,what are you doing to save my baby boy?
60486,Marge,"well, look who the fates dragged in."
66524,Marge,"you will not sing unless there's a sing-along, and never take the tray out of the caterer's hand."
60836,Marge,but i'm afraid you'll get hurt.
59736,Marge,"oh, please. i didn't say that for clapping."
67069,Marge,"used, isn't it?"
62445,Marge,how could you ask me that?
58027,Marge,i'm just so honored to have you here in our home.
66181,Marge,"i can't believe i'm saying this, but i'm starting to regret saying yolo."
57876,Marge,"you know, when i was a girl, i always dreamed of being in a broadway audience."
56886,Marge,he's causing us all to yell!
66864,Marge,he's not my lover!
66783,Marge,"there's a yiddish word for it: ""shpilkes."""
55241,Marge,"oh, honey. seven-hundred and fifty dollars is a lot of money. we really can't afford this operation."
59796,Marge,wow. the artist really captured jimi's passion and intensity.
59264,Marge,"well, you don't have to be sarcastic."
67465,Marge,homer?!
59534,Marge,"don't smart mouth, lisa."
60449,Marge,take him outside.
65298,Marge,"bart, it's okay to say that at home, but not in court! take it back!"
61677,Marge,"you win, kids. just sleep here tonight and we'll all go back to springfield tomorrow."
56361,Marge,homer.
65055,Marge,no!
54762,Marge,get back in bed.
56806,Marge,thanks benevenstanciano.
58580,Marge,"homer, do something! the ceiling's not a safe place for a young baby!"
66645,Marge,"you're working so hard you've lost weight! we're killing ourselves trying to run a restaurant no one goes to... i've never said this to you before, but i'm saying it now. i'm going to moe's."
58800,Marge,"oh, i'm so glad we were able to get together."
60388,Marge,"okay, hold onto your hats. ""dear artie..."""
65625,Marge,"well, we certainly don't want to cause you any more pain."
62054,Marge,don't you push them! they've gotta work that out for themselves.
64065,Marge,"well, let's see what else is in the job jar."
65301,Marge,you'll miss the turnoff to the fancy new mall!
66021,Marge,"i always wondered what you were hiding under your curly locks, my beautiful yellow melon!"
66306,Marge,"well, come in! i'll explain how it all works. okay, it helps if she's got a mother she's trying to get back at."
56954,Marge,this is where the wolf blows down the pigs' house!
56088,Marge,"homer, tell your child what you bought when i sent you to town to get some insurance."
65587,Marge,i can't believe we're never going to have another child...
58898,Marge,"okay, then you can take lisa to dr. hibbert's."
63182,Marge,"homer, this is wonderful. where are the kids?"
63141,Marge,"he's still in need, we have to let him stay. it's what dr. king would want us to do."
60314,Marge,we want to sue the sugar industry for selling a harmful product.
55344,Marge,"operator, i'd like to place an order for my husband."
63632,Marge,"homie, i'm back!"
61267,Marge,"homie, i don't think we'll be able to find the kids from up here."
67235,Marge,"i've been thinking, homer, and you know what bothers me the most about this whole thing? you taught bart a very bad lesson. your boy idolizes you."
65204,Marge,"oh, i doubt it. you sit at communal tables, full of hipsters."
59455,Marge,we're not giving you money.
65361,Marge,i miss our home and i want to go back.
57790,Marge,you've just got to accept it. your gameboy is gone. it's at the bottom of the ocean.
60300,Marge,"apu, everything in this store is overloaded with sugar."
62387,Marge,"i'm sorry, homie. i just can't find it in my heart to come back right now."
65320,Marge,no tv on the computer!
62989,Marge,"homie, look -- he's enjoying it."
62502,Marge,"well, i hope neil young will remember..."
54665,Marge,you are the first person who ever said that!
61171,Marge,just like real indians!
56883,Marge,strained carrots for maggie... strained carrots for grampa.
55279,Marge,"i'm sick of that waitress and all the time you've been spending with her, and this whole country music thing."
62069,Marge,i don't think it's exactly what mom would want.
57636,Marge,the house is still a mess and i'm going bald from stress --
60287,Marge,"i'm so proud of us. when we stick together, we can do anything."
64093,Marge,"well, it would be nice if the first thing i saw was a world at peace..."
67617,Marge,"homer, what's happened to you? all this greediness and lying and shifty lawyers and phony doctors --"
61924,Marge,"not that you care about the ups and downs of my appliances. do ya? huh, do ya?"
59249,Marge,"oooh, look at all these clever pencil holders."
56044,Marge,"i know you think the junior campers are square and... ""uncool,"" but they also do a lot of neat things, like sing-a-longs and flag ceremonies."
57670,Marge,what on earth are you talking about?
59631,Marge,swings!
63090,Marge,really? you think people would be kent-rested in me?
62278,Marge,you have?! that's so nice!
61185,Marge,well you ain't seen nothin' till you've seen the pre-teen braves.
65612,Marge,homie! do you know what yesterday was?
58342,Marge,why didn't you tell me you were bringing home a filthy monkey?
59244,Marge,"ohhh, homey, is that what's bothering you?"
64589,Marge,yes! enjoy!
55371,Marge,"well, it's pretty ingrained."
66393,Marge,what pills?
59299,Marge,that's right. and what else have we learned?
61989,Marge,mm-hmm.
59344,Marge,i think so too. bye!
61612,Marge,spice up! spice up!
62292,Marge,just as you predicted.
62384,Marge,"homie, i accept your apology."
60223,Marge,"oh, that's sensible."
66414,Marge,"well, i guess we have to go to an art gallery and buy a new painting."
58989,Marge,"well, i guess nothing else matters as long as you're happy."
66187,Marge,"i'm not used to strange men saying the word ""bedroom"" around me."
65825,Marge,i lost my other earring.
66577,Marge,mammogram appointment.
62965,Marge,marriage is hard work. but it's worth it -- when you've got someone wonderful like i do.
67921,Marge,why?
63431,Marge,yay!
65989,Marge,"so, how much are lessons?"
63082,Marge,i've been doing the same thing for the last ten years. and all i have to show for it is a clean floor.
55580,Marge,"so, do you think i have a case?"
59732,Marge,mmm. i'd like to visit that long island place. if only it were real...
64421,Marge,"a few more minor adjustments, aaand..."
57974,Marge,"homer, i told you this morning, no guns at the dinner table."
66649,Marge,"so you see, ms. zengler, the mother hubbard's express across the street is stealing all our business. it's not fair."
66079,Marge,"well, he keeps falling down a cliff and living, so i guess that's true."
58007,Marge,"you know, homer, it's very easy to criticize."
55668,Marge,"hello?... yes... oh, dear lord! homer's in the hospital! they think it's his heart."
54646,Marge,i thought they were just tall so boats could see them.
57601,Marge,"excuse me, sir. i can't find my children."
55576,Marge,oh my goodness!
64292,Marge,bart simpson! i'm glad your father isn't here to see this!
62186,Marge,"oh, homie..."
58747,Marge,it's hard to believe someone that young could have risen to the rank of admiral.
67056,Marge,"well, it doesn't matter how you feel inside, you know. it's what shows up on the surface that counts. that's what my mother taught me. take all your bad feelings and push them down, all the way down, past your knees, until you're almost walking on them. and then you'll fit in, and you'll be invited to parties, and boys will like you... and happiness will follow."
55297,Marge,"kids, will you come in here?"
56146,Marge,that was you!
64868,Marge,"lisa, what are you doing?"
61959,Marge,"now that mr. burns has eliminated the drug plan, we're gonna have to cut back on our diseases."
58227,Marge,"homer, you know i always try to put the best face on everything. but there's no face on that damn bean! we hate it here and the family wants to leave."
62723,Marge,you'd be surprised what he could do if you just gave him a chance.
64721,Marge,"ooo, so many celebrities have their own label: princess penelope, booberella, the real housewives of ogdenville, even scratchy."
55795,Marge,lisa needs braces.
59946,Marge,i won. don't take that away from me.
64336,Marge,"now lisa, you're a vegetarian, but these cows have made a different choice."
62761,Marge,"what? no! listen, charles, i don't want to hurt your feelings..."
54766,Marge,"we came to this retreat because i thought our marriage was in trouble, but i never for a minute thought it was in this much trouble. homer, how can you expect me to believe...."
66699,Marge,"my sweet baby! ooh, it feels like you have a full diaper."
58296,Marge,unless you're a man.
62395,Marge,instead of a stamp museum we'll be next door to a graveyard?!
62881,Marge,i'm sorry you have to leave. but i just can't think of another way.
58852,Marge,"that's nice, dear!"
62645,Marge,i guess -- they're homer's expired pain medications.
57125,Marge,you'd get some fresh air and exercise.
57899,Marge,coming out of my eight-track...
65195,Marge,of course.
65487,Marge,"also, the passion play isn't stupid, it's the greatest story ever told!"
61715,Marge,"now, i'm gonna warn you kids: the next part of the story gets a little ""w-b""..."
64871,Marge,what?
57689,Marge,for life!
58848,Marge,of course not!
63125,Marge,you really made my daughter's christmas.
67413,Marge,well i think the non-card question is a valid one.
58620,Marge,hmf. i think you've had too much strawberry wine.
60844,Marge,what are you doing here?
58900,Marge,bad cat! leave her alone!
55666,Marge,nice healthy oatmeal.
64025,Marge,i see a hair.
59121,Marge,i don't want to pump my little boy full of drugs.
65496,Marge,it's extreme enough for me when they smear the wedding cake on each other's faces.
63862,Marge,that laughter sounds like the result of misbehavior. bart! how did you get a cell phone?
61471,Marge,dioxy-ribo-diamondoid?
63392,Marge,it says here don't bother naming them. snakes have poor hearing and only live to strangle.
56526,Marge,"oh, i forgot to clean the lint basket in the dryer. if someone broke into the house and did laundry, it could start a fire."
56137,Marge,"bart, do you have something nice to say to your father?"
62920,Marge,"homer, please."
55494,Marge,what's he saying?
60992,Marge,sara sloane has been involved with every tinseltown hunk from affleck to zmed!
62042,Marge,thanksgiving's not for months.
64094,Marge,you're even more beautiful than i remembered.
62578,Marge,"i'm sorry, i can't steal. not even from mr. burns."
55903,Marge,we've left it all behind. how can you make a clean break with your life?
55253,Marge,i don't think you've thought this through.
65860,Marge,"i know your grampa seems exciting now... but all that preening and cheating, those turnbuckle antics are not gonna make him happy."
62676,Marge,you never had detention all summer.
56115,Marge,i guess we've learned that happiness is wherever you find it.
60162,Marge,ooh... it must be chinese new year.
55805,Marge,because they love you down at the plant.
61274,Marge,i guess it's just too much for me to ask for one vacation where we don't go to jail or to a condo sales pitch.
62979,Marge,"homer, our house is on fire! help me save the children!"
65009,Marge,wait! wait! wait! wait!
62013,Marge,you'd better stop
64212,Marge,it's so kind of you to live there so our kids can go to a better school.
61585,Marge,"i'm afraid what i like can't be swallowed, sniffed or smoked."
61538,Marge,i'm so happy to be getting my husband back.
58960,Marge,"yes, god."
58643,Marge,"no, no, you just stay put."
61599,Marge,my baby boy is in jail! i'm the worst mom in the world.
63070,Marge,what's with the lined composition book?
61505,Marge,"fine. ""extremely satisfied."""
67702,Marge,why is there make-out music on?
64268,Marge,"that's it, three stories. that's what we always tell."
66189,Marge,ooh!
60289,Marge,"lisa, you're not buying more than your weight in books."
62426,Marge,something's wrong with maggie. we should get her to dr. hibbert. but i don't see him anywhere.
54708,Marge,this sure beats slaving over a hot stove!
62703,Marge,what's wrong with your teeter-totter?
59202,Marge,"no, no, no, no, you'll get sap on your duelling blouse."
56784,Marge,marge!
59398,Marge,i didn't say they couldn't. i said you shouldn't.
64247,Marge,"lisa, let me tell you the story of a great woman held back by a not-so-great husband."
63824,Marge,"homer, look what i found with your mother's things."
57022,Marge,"mother simpson, we'd like to ask you a few questions about your past."
63994,Marge,are your parents okay with that? they've never met us.
56232,Marge,hm? hm?
62217,Marge,you're drooling on my goodwill pile!
54997,Marge,your father's stock is worth fifty-two hundred dollars!
58371,Marge,how could you spend four point six million dollars in a month?
62429,Marge,amen!
60857,Marge,"apu, where's your bathroom?"
55979,Marge,you already asked me that.
67176,Marge,"well, sure, if you don't mind taking care of the kids again?"
59473,Marge,get it away from the house!
62271,Marge,but your song said you liked springfield.
65359,Marge,i don't think this place is so great.
60369,Marge,so many dings.
56405,Marge,i don't approve of that.
64578,Marge,"but you still have our passports, right?"
58472,Marge,"all those eyes, just leering and leering at us."
58292,Marge,because your father has a big surprise for you!
59700,Marge,"oh, no. my baby's up there!"
56854,Marge,"no, it's officer simpson - of the police!"
66502,Marge,"look, life's tough. it's hard to make it through. the only way i know is when you make a decision that comes from your heart, you stick with it."
65936,Marge,...debugged and fresh as a daisy.
59629,Marge,"now homer, this is no time to be thinking about food."
63049,Marge,i have to be honest with you -- i can't love a four-thousand-ton cannibal.
63642,Marge,okay.
58156,Marge,"besides, it's mine. yoink!"
67856,Marge,but mr. schindler...
62131,Marge,"oh please. from what i hear, you waltz in there at 10:30, take a nap on the toilet, then sit around ""google""-ing your own name until lunch."
67150,Marge,jacques.
57811,Marge,"""marge"" is already taken? oh, how about ""marjorie""?"
67005,Marge,"oh, homer."
64318,Marge,is he okay?
65021,Marge,this place even has its own arts district! with football-hating intellectuals!
66008,Marge,"bart, when you were on that stage, it felt like you were pouring those notes right into my heart."
55222,Marge,"oh well, you'd be surprised."
58536,Marge,not you. bart.
55199,Marge,"homer, for the last time, i am not putting that in."
65110,Marge,"i hope you're proud of yourself, homer."
56355,Marge,"gee, artie. artie wait. i don't know. i mean, it was it was a beautiful evening. let's not ruin it."
60373,Marge,"when homer's jaw was crushed-crushed-crushed, his life took a nitro-burning funny turn!"
63947,Marge,"homie, what's taking so long?"
64788,Marge,get them back -- she can't get neck-holes! it's picture day tomorrow!
55369,Marge,that's a very clever idea!
67596,Marge,i'm not. i think everyone in springfield should see it.
62448,Marge,"no, no, no!"
65502,Marge,time for cake! let's finish this sucker up.
59843,Marge,then why are you hiding?
60395,Marge,"artie ziff? ohh, oh, that e-mail. look, i got a little drunk and we..."
59841,Marge,"now wait, you don't know that jack did this. just because he's an ex-con..."
56396,Marge,it must be wonderful to ring in the new year over and over and over.
66846,Marge,"see ya at the bake sale, sucker!"
65567,Marge,uh-oh! do you hear that rattle?
65115,Marge,we'll announce the results in next year's season premiere. probably at the end so you'll watch the whole thing.
58810,Marge,i'd love to look at sculleryweek -- if you're through with it.
66612,Marge,your monkey just ate all my turkey.
56650,Marge,we'll meet you boys back here for dinner. good luck honey.
56937,Marge,"well, look at the other side."
61287,Marge,"homer, there's no rear on that thing."
54678,Marge,"those are great reasons, but there's one reason you should choose me. because i know everything that you've done, and yet i still want to be with you."
59916,Marge,are you sure someone hasn't been bitten by the jealousy bug?
58193,Marge,let me get you a coaster for those feet.
65511,Marge,"ned, i realized long ago, there are some things homer and i will never completely agree on."
61420,Marge,what do you mean? my book is set in whaling times.
58707,Marge,"you know, homie, there's so much more two wives could do for you."
62662,Marge,"uh... ooh, ooh, it's lovely. i like this part in here... the way it, um, it goes."
61364,Marge,that ad makes me look like a criminal.
55541,Marge,"resident... occupant... hmm, free sample of ""lemon time""..."
64967,Marge,why are you always trying to cause trouble with me and homer? our marriage is rock solid!
56109,Marge,"hmm. oh, we're low on milk for maggie. you wanna come with me to the kwik-e-mart?"
61002,Marge,why is that jet flying so close to our house?
61858,Marge,"well, i guess it's just you and me, bart!"
59224,Marge,can i interest you in a mincemeat pie? there very...
63265,Marge,nooooo! it's gone! that family album was a record of my accomplishments -- it's like what a résumé is for a man.
67440,Marge,"let's see. upper, upper, upper mezzanine. hmmm. yes, these must be ours."
61941,Marge,"well, looking at you kids, i know i made the right choice in life."
58119,Marge,"hey, kids, i made your favorite cookies -- christmas trees for the girls, and bloody spear-heads for bart."
56489,Marge,"yes, yes, yes. that's fine. good, good."
60446,Marge,bart sure is fond of that cow gentleman.
63676,Marge,don't you remember what today is?
65383,Marge,"wait, wait, wait. he's just a boy! do you have to put him in jail?"
62253,Marge,"aw honey, please take this seriously. when people used to ask me how you were doing, i said ""at least he's got his health."" now you've got nothing! nothing! for me, please try a healthy vegetable."
66413,Marge,"that's okay sweetheart. your pig thingy didn't mean it. it's just... it felt comforting to know that while we watched tv, there was art going on behind us."
55968,Marge,"well, thank you for a lovely time."
61022,Marge,election night is so exciting. i'm on pins and needles.
54813,Marge,"oh, my! it's mr. burns."
55406,Marge,i don't think so.
55648,Marge,"bart, get out!"
55422,Marge,i'll twist this bottle in your face!
55060,Marge,"""you will not see me again until i am a man."" oh, homer, homer."
58588,Marge,"i tried to resist, but they applied powerful mind confusion techniques."
54588,Marge,you leave me sitting here all alone...
58097,Marge,"the first house i have to show you is, uhm, a handyman's dream."
56829,Marge,"bart, it's illegal for you to operate that class nine vehicle without pads and a helmet."
63545,Marge,"i really shouldn't show up without an apple pie for dwight. in fact, i really shouldn't show up without an apple pie for everyone at the prison."
59495,Marge,not now.
55616,Marge,"homie, please don't go."
63200,Marge,"don't worry, they're still drunk from school!"
61273,Marge,what difference could it make? he hit the friggin' queen!
59792,Marge,"hey! hey, over here! here, bully, bully, bully, bully, bully!"
67434,Marge,"well, we have one quick stop and then it's on to capital city."
67695,Marge,"hmm, i don't know."
57644,Marge,mmm... okay. just be careful.
57170,Marge,"i don't know. lisa, tonight is very important. mommy has to alter her suit so it looks like a totally new one."
59696,Marge,i can't believe how young he is. he'd be cute if he weren't so idealistic.
62783,Marge,"well, i had my doubts, but grampa sure looks manly in those leggings!"
63231,Marge,what do you want?
55395,Marge,"homer, my audition is in half..."
57159,Marge,pleased to meet you. you look like such a happy bunch... of people.
58011,Marge,how can you treat him that way? don't you remember how bad your father made you feel when you played sports?
60463,Marge,"oh, my god!"
59127,Marge,"yes, i just thought you might love me enough to let me help you."
67705,Marge,bien.
61452,Marge,"come spring, they sought help from the native americans."
61950,Marge,"well, i like t-shirts with a nice joke, like ""support our troops."""
64720,Marge,"hm, i think i'll look for a new handbag..."
57719,Marge,why do you have so many bowling balls?
65127,Marge,"kids, can i talk to wayne alone a minute?"
64031,Marge,you used protection. we never had any!
58599,Marge,stop calling everyone suckers!
56589,Marge,homer!
65745,Marge,"no, homie! it's too dangerous!"
66012,Marge,did you pass?
60846,Marge,i agree -- a girl should have her own private diary. i had to share mine with my uncle.
62700,Marge,i'll help you.
58210,Marge,no fires!
67940,Marge,"why milhouse, don't you look pretty."
61358,Marge,"to overturn these horrible anti-family laws, we've prepared the ""families come first"" initiative. now, the first thing we're gonna need is money."
55793,Marge,"homer, lisa needs braces."
66648,Marge,go on. please.
65488,Marge,ned and edna married?
67099,Marge,"now, move it!"
56273,Marge,"hmm, maybe we should spend more time with bart. he's becoming isolated and weird."
65266,Marge,"why do you say ""future?"" this is now."
61342,Marge,"excuse me, everyone. i'm a mother."
55823,Marge,homie! you're all right!
67232,Marge,"here, if you have any soul left, you'll need these. i know i will."
56276,Marge,"my, these seas are certainly heaving."
56744,Marge,bart! don't ever say that word again!
65397,Marge,what do you see?
58433,Marge,ooh. there's the turn!
64723,Marge,yes!
62388,Marge,"oh, my sweet, sweet homie! you sacrificed yourself for the manatees."
57231,Marge,but?
60877,Marge,two...
66321,Marge,"homie, i think the kids are just hungry."
66967,Marge,"there, there, homer. you'll find a job. you've caused plenty of industrial accidents and you've always bounced back."
62204,Marge,it's raining inside!
65053,Marge,"selma, i just can't get over the new you."
67282,Marge,"ooo, i've got to go, homer. my sisters are here."
67583,Marge,oh dear!
64329,Marge,okey-doke.
65090,Marge,maggie!
64602,Marge,i hope dylan likes trucks.
65337,Marge,this house is not an embarrassment!
62369,Marge,i think the worst part was when i realized that homer lied to me.
54914,Marge,"oh, my land!"
65158,Marge,"... and here's a marble for lisa for cleaning her room, and a marble for bart for not trashing lisa's room."
54842,Marge,it certainly has enriched our lives.
56390,Marge,"see all that stuff in there, homer? that's why your robot never worked."
62649,Marge,that's a female replacement hormone.
54749,Marge,"grampa, could you do something?"
67539,Marge,dear purveyors of senseless violence: i know this may sound silly at first...
59168,Marge,only your father could take a part-time job at a small-town paper and wind up the target of international assassins.
59770,Marge,lenny says we've got the day off! yippee!
62310,Marge,it's happening in ned's house! why would he allow that?
58762,Marge,who's trent steel?
57052,Marge,well homer maybe you can take some consolation in the fact that something you created is making so many people happy.
64221,Marge,i love tapas! it's like appetizers for a meal that never comes!
59192,Marge,love ya lots!
63119,Marge,"lisa, you're never gonna get a husband by being sarcastic."
56091,Marge,"i don't think the guns are a good idea, homer."
63595,Marge,homer! the wedding's in twenty minutes! just pick a tie!
61913,Marge,"when we published the story, we received the school's highest award."
63111,Marge,you're the worst husband in the world!
61051,Marge,"james taylor. homie, remember that song we used to sing?"
66578,Marge,maybe you two are more similar than you'd like to admit.
56666,Marge,"bart, i told you before, stop gnawing on the drywall."
65460,Marge,"bart, we're too worried to enjoy each other's mouths."
60366,Marge,the demolition derby? that'll scratch my itch.
55346,Marge,better give me the weight loss tape.
67608,Marge,hmmm.
66037,Marge,"oh, that's perfect."
62507,Marge,no.
66663,Marge,the milkshakes have vanished!
54689,Marge,"no, it can't be! i would never hurt marge! i'm a good man!"
59452,Marge,"homer, you know i had a gambling problem."
66284,Marge,"bye bye, maggie!"
61578,Marge,you let me believe that i'd done such a terrible thing?
65068,Marge,you've never supported mine!
60106,Marge,"mmm... good morning, pierce. where's homer?"
67923,Marge,"homer, i don't know you. my wife and your wife are friends. we met just three hours ago."
58280,Marge,i'd like to believe you...
60955,Marge,"i heard a wonderful saying today: ""forgive and forget."""
64258,Marge,"""in last night's 'macbeth,' the best performance was barney gumbel as duncan, followed by duffman as macduff, lenny leonard as lennox, eddie and lou as the two soldiers without lines, then last and least, the lead, homer simpson."""
66809,Marge,"homer, quick! get your shooing broom!"
63432,Marge,what'd i miss?
67626,Marge,...so i guess that may not count as anguish.
55054,Marge,"homer, i don't know how we can afford all these things on your salary."
63052,Marge,"wait, i have an idea! the martians are only killing humans, so we should pretend to be animals!"
55764,Marge,"bart, don't give the dog cigarettes!"
61003,Marge,"maggie, give me that!"
64096,Marge,maybe i'm just being selfish. i don't know.
58777,Marge,"well, i'm glad you changed your name back to homer simpson."
67231,Marge,my suggestion is for you to sleep in the filth you created.
65405,Marge,uh-oh.
57348,Marge,guess i can't complain. everything's perfect here.
62958,Marge,what? no! no! what? no! what?
60272,Marge,"we've got to do something, but what?"
60988,Marge,then all that's left is to protect maggie from the sun.
64303,Marge,this goes on for a while...
63870,Marge,shouldn't you just be happy for their success?
67216,Marge,"sorry, homer."
62863,Marge,i remember bart!
56410,Marge,"this sounds awfully controversial. lisa, you know i don't like controversy in this house."
54960,Marge,the kwik-e-mart.
60008,Marge,homer!
57713,Marge,"oh, bart, we've bought those before and you always just throw them out the car window on the ride home."
55212,Marge,"children, tell me when your father stops scratching himself. kids?"
61320,Marge,you wasted our money on something extravagant for yourself!
66793,Marge,"well, i guess it'll have to be in bart's room. and i thought when homer cut off his thumb was bad."
56702,Marge,yes.
62373,Marge,and treated like i deserve.
66101,Marge,"that is so sweet! there i go again, settling!"
63673,Marge,"hmm, okay."
54970,Marge,"well, we're going to the beauty parlor. maybe you should do something with the kids while i'm gone."
57628,Marge,"my, she seems too good to be true."
56260,Marge,"here's your water, moe."
60214,Marge,but whose body is it?
59427,Marge,"they don't show police chases, do they?"
64249,Marge,"out, damn'd spot! out, i say!"
66973,Marge,there he is!
58763,Marge,where'd you meet this trent steel? moe's?
64664,Marge,thank you... you're very sweet...
57431,Marge,is it really necessary to watch tv while we're eating? we're getting food all over.
57401,Marge,"now, the cat needs his medication every morning --"
54668,Marge,"oh, homie."
64463,Marge,"i'm not a dude, i'm a hottie!"
57635,Marge,nope.
56732,Marge,"yes, the dog..."
62126,Marge,no more oriental mustard!
64919,Marge,but i don't want a beach house. sand makes me sad. because it used to be big rocks. but not anymore. not anymore...
67612,Marge,"well, maybe lisa does have a point. i don't mind you boys doing this in the living room, but in court doesn't bart have to tell the truth?"
66552,Marge,lisa's door's unlocked!
54824,Marge,"now homer, don't panic. you have plenty of white shirts."
62520,Marge,you... invited me... to your treehouse? wow -- that's like bruce wayne letting his mother into the bat-club.
58542,Marge,"what's the point, bart? i punish and i punish and i punish, but it never sinks in. so you know what? do what you want. you want to play with little hoodlums? fine. have fun killing things."
60193,Marge,i will!
57024,Marge,"i'm so sorry i misjudged you, mom. you had to leave to protect your family."
67922,Marge,"um... mr. demon, could you come back for my sisters later?"
61396,Marge,"homer, you left two jobs and bought an ambulance without even a phone call."
59099,Marge,"of course, homey. aren't you thinking about me?"
67585,Marge,it's time for krusty.
57391,Marge,can't we just go upstairs?
59988,Marge,let's just float by quietly...
67709,Marge,consonants.
63551,Marge,hello. hello?
56385,Marge,"oh, i see. all right. i'll have the baby guts."
57150,Marge,i did marry homer.
62004,Marge,homie...
67236,Marge,"yes he does, homer. and when he sees you treating women as objects, he's going to think that it's okay. you owe your son better than that, homer."
61742,Marge,"well, america's not perfect--"
67570,Marge,"oh, please. all right. i'm trying to earn a living here. all right! stop! stop!"
66121,Marge,hello! where's homer?
62798,Marge,"good sir, i do not approve of your fleshly gaze."
56906,Marge,"bart, it's class photo day. no dracula fangs."
60753,Marge,/ oh.
67240,Marge,homer!
63481,Marge,"i couldn't agree more, julia."
63015,Marge,don't you have any follow-through on anything?
63850,Marge,harms no one? explain that to... well what about... i think you forgot about... hmm...
59338,Marge,"oh, i don't want to be a bother."
56764,Marge,"honey, maybe you should relax a little?"
62792,Marge,he was gravely wounded in a bank shootout.
58870,Marge,"i'd like to help you, chief, but my license was revoked. seems i'm full of rage."
65966,Marge,"moe, i know things haven't been easy for you. but you're with people who love you in the most exciting of the twin cities."
57599,Marge,bart? lisa?
60782,Marge,"c'mon, lisa. it's time to go."
61947,Marge,"maybe when the tooth fairy saw it was your last baby tooth, she realized you're not a little boy anymore. so she gave you a grown-up gift."
55114,Marge,and don't make that face at me.
58042,Marge,"there has to be more to life than just what we see, lisa. everyone needs something to believe in."
63474,Marge,"see? isn't it nicer, with just you and..."
61162,Marge,i want to thank you all so much.
57397,Marge,and where is all that liquor coming from?
61246,Marge,where did you get that tutu?
63288,Marge,"six hundred twenty-nine thousand results. wow! and all this time i thought ""googling yourself"" meant the other thing."
66736,Marge,"you didn't join a band to become famous like in ""almost famous."" you loved playing music with your friends. that was enough to make you happy."
58946,Marge,"i'm really sorry, everybody, but i've tried everything. i'm afraid we're just going to have to learn to live with it."
57497,Marge,homer!
62745,Marge,"as long as it's not a knock-knock joke. i always ruin them by saying ""come in."""
65371,Marge,ooh! an apron with a sonnet!
62804,Marge,it's really more of an amiable concordance.
60658,Marge,"well, they're both lovely."
55423,Marge,"heah you ah, homah."
57749,Marge,"well, if that's what you think is best, let's just go down to the kennel and get santa's little helper back."
67524,Marge,"oh now, homer, they're nothing special. the extra ingredient is care."
57344,Marge,"even if we sell the house, we still won't come close to paying off the mortgage."
61680,Marge,"i don't know... homie, why don't we just go home, wait 'til the kids fall asleep, and have sex in the car?"
57969,Marge,"homer, i don't want guns in my house! don't you remember when maggie shot mr. burns?"
61089,Marge,"that was a delicious meal, cookie. what do we do with our garbage?"
57186,Marge,why do you have to question everything i do?!!
65805,Marge,this so-called educational dvd may have even stunted the development of the kids who watched it!
66493,Marge,no! i'm throwing you out of the house! you can live with your no-good son.
58912,Marge,"beef salad, beef on the cob, beef-fried beef, uh... is there anything on the menu that isn't meat?"
58771,Marge,are you sure it's a federal law that i have to dance with you?
57987,Marge,"not right now, dear."
55596,Marge,don quixote.
59080,Marge,"but mr. ambassador, how are we going to get home?"
66265,Marge,"well, they don't grow on trees."
66398,Marge,it's eighty-two degrees!
58365,Marge,"homer, that crazy lady who lives in our trash pile attacked me again."
61568,Marge,oh no! i'm gonna be incarce... incarce... incarce... i'm going to jail.
61852,Marge,"gee, i did the best i could..."
60093,Marge,george lazenby?
58189,Marge,you had a quadruple bypass. you nearly died. don't you remember?
62444,Marge,"oh boy, am i beat! if you wanna return a melon to the grocery store, clear your day!"
62213,Marge,"okay kids, we only have time for a quick visit to grampa, so as soon as he feels loved, we're outta there."
63485,Marge,she's perfect! for the first time since you became an opera star i can finally relax.
62006,Marge,"moe, i need to tell you something."
59706,Marge,"an ""a"" in astronomy. how'd you do it?"
61646,Marge,"homie, if i died, would you be sad?"
66690,Marge,"oh, don't mention her eye. don't mention her eye."
57685,Marge,ho-mer.
56038,Marge,"uh, i don't want to judge the rightness of your ego orientation, but my inner critic says you should've done your job!"
65312,Marge,"yeah, look!"
55430,Marge,forget about him. let's rehearse the bottle scene!
66878,Marge,"huh? oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... the revue."
57342,Marge,"well, we could use the extra money... and this house is falling apart."
58230,Marge,reverend lovejoy! you've got to help me! my entire family has been taken in by the evil movementarians.
67518,Marge,"gee, i never realized tv was such a dangerous influence."
65063,Marge,i still can't believe it. i have never been so snubbed at one of selma's weddings.
59392,Marge,"ooh, the drain bugger!"
65982,Marge,what did he do now?
60072,Marge,how romantic!
63511,Marge,"homer, where have you been?"
61812,Marge,well...
57830,Marge,yes! and it might look something like this...
55260,Marge,here boy!
60797,Marge,my hair isn't really blue.
60572,Marge,did it again!
67573,Marge,"what is it? what? ""smartline?"" yes, i've heard of your late-night panel discussion show. well, i'd love to."
55662,Marge,it's not good for your heart.
65192,Marge,of what?
55250,Marge,... will now be chub night.
66625,Marge,"mother hubbard central expects you to buy a lot of stuff from them. uniforms, fixins... it's like they don't care if you make money as long as they make money. what kind of corporation does that?"
60201,Marge,"oh, no..."
66944,Marge,"all right... hmmm... how about ""he""?"
59745,Marge,but where did it come from?
65344,Marge,now we're supposed to stay down in our storm cellar for three hours...
57346,Marge,"okay, the oven is cleaning itself, the autovac's on dirt patrol... annnd maggie's enjoying her swingamajig..."
58261,Marge,"they need a good, stiff, all-purpose dress shoe. something for church, but also for doctors appointments dental check-ups, piano recitals, building dedications, visiting elderly relatives, haircuts and shoe shopping."
64973,Marge,shoo! shoo! shoo! shoo! shoo! shoo! shoo!
56498,Marge,hasn't this experience taught you you can't believe everything you hear?
55416,Marge,"homer, can you run some lines with me?"
62464,Marge,"well, i guess you showed you do trust me after all."
55994,Marge,"homer, stop that! it's just a weather station."
65093,Marge,we got out of it just in time.
61050,Marge,i can't believe our family finished a project this complicated.
54800,Marge,bart does.
60362,Marge,this place is so dull. the nine-one-one button is covered with dust.
63251,Marge,what the heck are these?
67645,Marge,"your meatloaf will be ready in eight seconds, homer."
54976,Marge,"they want a name, homer, not a vague description."
65804,Marge,"maybe instead of watching tv with the kids, you could take them outside and... what are you doing?"
62617,Marge,"they can't charge me for something i use every day. what's next, a spatula tax?"
67489,Marge,"oh, why don't i go talk to her?"
60077,Marge,"oh, listen, you can hear the beautiful ethnic serenade..."
66098,Marge,where's it from?
59942,Marge,not on my watch!
55881,Marge,so how are things at home?
55940,Marge,homer?! did you eat that donut?
67534,Marge,homer! i'm trying to work!
65249,Marge,"for god's sakes, homer! i've given you three children!"
55948,Marge,"homer, stop picking at it."
55215,Marge,"lisa, it's not that bad."
58336,Marge,they want you to spy on your friends?
57490,Marge,remarkable -- there doesn't seem to be any damage at all. it just goes to show you that everything will work out if you have faith.
61695,Marge,homie... are you the pie man?
56210,Marge,"hey, hey, hey hey, stop it! i made a special cake for you to ruin. it's over there."
66255,Marge,look at all these out-of-state license plates!
56501,Marge,"oh, bart. it's just an old golf umbrella stuck in a tree."
64023,Marge,hey!
61774,Marge,where'd you get that rib?
63536,Marge,"dwight, use your noodle. if you surrender now, you're only looking at a few years in jail. i'll tell them you're a good guy."
58153,Marge,"look, i know this has been a stressful holiday. but, in a way, having nothing reminds us how lucky we really are."
66857,Marge,fine. there's meatloaf...
58385,Marge,now that's just non--
66688,Marge,my sandwich!
62747,Marge,"well, you've set me up, for laughs down the road."
57213,Marge,sor-ry. next time get your own darned corn.
57895,Marge,because we couldn't find grampa to sit for them.
65725,Marge,no one was laughing. you kept it a secret!
57377,Marge,"i can honestly say that was the most fun i've ever had. the mill, the history, all that gorgeous foliage."
61069,Marge,"don't worry, sweetie. your father won't stay mad forever."
55063,Marge,my husband by my side.
60849,Marge,"chief wiggum, my daughter is innocent until proven guilty."
59477,Marge,"well, you still have lenny and carl."
67292,Marge,"well, maggie, it's just you and me again."
59912,Marge,but...
60683,Marge,"they look like you, they were rude to patty and selma, and the horde has been described as ""very gassy."""
58147,Marge,"i know you're used to getting hate mail, but i'm not."
66005,Marge,"of course. but very, very, very angry at all the time i wasted."
64473,Marge,"okay kids, time to apply the final ""date night"" touch. lisa, spray just a hint of perfume on my neck, bart, you tell me this dress doesn't make me look fat. and... now!"
58623,Marge,"oh, lord."
59009,Marge,"no one's gonna jinx you, homer. in fact, we're rooting for you."
66868,Marge,majesty.
61877,Marge,"lisa, just take a bite. one bite -- that's all i ask!"
58434,Marge,homer!
65563,Marge,this car looks a little small. is the engine powerful?
56082,Marge,"homer, when you forgive someone, you can't throw it back at them like that."
63803,Marge,"i get it -- every title means the opposite of what it means! then i bet i'll love ""chernobyl graveyard!"""
64122,Marge,"whatever you say, ""lance."""
63760,Marge,"listen, i'm sorry i called you all those mean things like, oh, i don't even remember..."
63822,Marge,"come on, homie -- your mom wouldn't have wanted you to stay in bed forever."
55088,Marge,"maggie! you talked! can you say ""mama"" again?"
57141,Marge,it is.
62539,Marge,don't call me mother! my name is mom! and my son is no mama's boy!
61983,Marge,"get lost, rummy!"
59867,Marge,"okay, we'll be right out."
63550,Marge,damn these sturdy foreign-built phones!
64666,Marge,"guys, guys, i'm married!"
64360,Marge,"i call to order this meeting of the ""springfield charity chicks."" as you all know, last year's cake and cookie sale raised one hundred twelve dollars to fight childhood obesity."
60115,Marge,she'll be killed!
55961,Marge,"hello, ruth?"
55591,Marge,and this is for the man of the house... which i guess... is you.
62224,Marge,"hey boy, want a treat?"
62111,Marge,honey... your near-fatal boo boo today really scared me. what would the kids and i do if something happened to you?
55742,Marge,"hmmm, well, you've cooled down."
67819,Marge,those are very elaborate sneakers.
67582,Marge,huh huh.
56366,Marge,"mmmm, homie..."
67681,Marge,not if i have to do heavy lifting or math.
60651,Marge,i don't care what they say. i won't feel safe in this town until we have better police.
58568,Marge,"oh please, lisa. everyone's already figured that out."
62259,Marge,jimminy kimmel! look how much they're charging for bart's treatment!
55752,Marge,"why didn't you ask our permission, lisa?"
66729,Marge,i can't take it. all homer does is play that stupid bass! doink doink doink doink doink doink doink!
58550,Marge,why are you sitting like that? what are you hiding this time?
55380,Marge,"oh, i'm going to miss this."
66683,Marge,our water was on fire.
64792,Marge,"ooo, everything's changed! that tree used to be a smaller tree. and that food bank used to be a regular bank."
56086,Marge,"well... yes, i do. but they're all heirlooms, too."
62439,Marge,"look, why don't you both stay and have one of my marge-aritas?"
59914,Marge,"don't be selfish, lisa."
60874,Marge,"all right, just to the mailbox and back."
66070,Marge,"is that him, getting the text?"
56160,Marge,then stop screaming so loud.
66993,Marge,"oh, i'm sorry. i'm sorry. sorry."
55622,Marge,"hmmm, i don't think so. oh, maggie, when are you going to talk?"
56036,Marge,"oh, thank you."
66816,Marge,it's gotten me out of a lot of gym memberships.
56547,Marge,no! no!
55431,Marge,why? are you going?
61654,Marge,"you know, if we were younger and crazier, we'd trade in these tickets and run off to miami!"
57111,Marge,it's sick! and i don't have that kind of money to spend on sex! maybe you could get someone with money to sponsor your team. like mr. burns.
67265,Marge,lisa!
67732,Marge,"yeah, you want a ride?"
59145,Marge,"i understand the electrodes, but why does he have to be on a treadmill?"
59840,Marge,"oh, don't fight. all great art is controversial at first. but years from now, people will point to these cuddly little creatures, and say, ""that's a jack crowley."""
65274,Marge,"oh, it's so good to meet the octuplets' octuplets."
64357,Marge,i could do worse...
67319,Marge,no. because you're wearing a bib.
65595,Marge,i can't believe we spent the whole day here.
62969,Marge,"carpool, nelson!"
57487,Marge,this down here in the first place!
55090,Marge,"dear lord, before we peel the foil back from your bounty, we ask you to watch over little timmy o'toole, trapped in that well."
59981,Marge,what? what is it?
62138,Marge,i'll let you sass me!
65087,Marge,"no, no, no, no, no, no, no, julio is my little secret! i've said too much!"
61140,Marge,"i am so sorry, homie. how is your crushed pelvis?"
56119,Marge,that toy isn't safe for a baby like maggie.
64984,Marge,homer!
62463,Marge,homer!
56822,Marge,"two hundred. no! no! i mean, i mean nothing. i don't take bribes."
64543,Marge,you were never going to apologize!
59516,Marge,i'm beginning to dislike the man with the whip.
65614,Marge,i still feel guilty. your father's not going to be around forever.
60036,Marge,"it's all right, boys."
61609,Marge,i'm glad i sent the kids to grampa's to protect their innocent minds.
63938,Marge,pumps are shoes! that explains a lot.
57363,Marge,but you'll get killed!
61014,Marge,"...the shaking's so bad, all my omelets have become frittatas."
54767,Marge,to who?
61532,Marge,no. your problem is you never think of anyone besides yourself.
54787,Marge,"boys, you better come in the house. you don't want to get the sniffles."
54933,Marge,"don't worry, he'll be here."
60737,Marge,"ah, homie, are you as attracted to me as you were when we met?"
59825,Marge,"oh, my goodness!"
54673,Marge,won't the other homer be a problem?
66491,Marge,"now homie, i hope you'll use this second chance to live a more sensible life."
60458,Marge,"honey, i've got some bad news for you."
62050,Marge,which book?
64427,Marge,that's right! it is!
62216,Marge,homer!
56858,Marge,freeze! every mother knows the secret entrance to her son's tree house.
62279,Marge,a kids' barbershop? but they don't have my templates.
67016,Marge,arrrgh!
67087,Marge,"oh, homer... my brilliant beast."
57078,Marge,"sure. we're gonna have a great day. ba-da-bing ba-da-boom, right bart? bart?"
61611,Marge,every day you find a new way to aggravate me.
62780,Marge,"homie, you should give your dad a call. you can't stay mad at him forever."
57040,Marge,...go again.
61897,Marge,"chloe, hi!"
62896,Marge,mr. simpson?
58851,Marge,canyonero!
67113,Marge,a little?
61534,Marge,"oh, what do you think?"
64674,Marge,"walt, it's a nice face, but i don't think it would drive a professional waitress to lie."
54942,Marge,stick to the subject.
57839,Marge,"well, if you won't think of society's ills..."
63216,Marge,"aw, grampa. we should take lots of pictures of him while we still can."
57707,Marge,"oh my god, you walked into the fountain! get out of the fountain!"
58130,Marge,homer!
57655,Marge,"oh, homer, look! look! a tv guide owned by jackie o.!"
65199,Marge,gordon ramsay!
59042,Marge,"mmm-mm. oh, i can feel the pounds just melting off."
56608,Marge,"actually, when i was about to have bart..."
63860,Marge,"don't feel too bad, homie. you'll be free tomorrow. and i used all my new baking skills to make a special cake to remind you of me."
66567,Marge,"krusty, i brought some homemade chicken soup. we used the play-doh maker for the matzo."
56347,Marge,it all started on an outing for dinner...
66161,Marge,you gotta lose your mind in detroit rock city!
65903,Marge,from the gas station?
66686,Marge,our. water. was. on. fire!
55607,Marge,we went fishing.
56392,Marge,"ah, you know, part of spending time together as a family is spending time apart as individuals."
57185,Marge,without. let me go!
66169,Marge,it's all my fault. i should never have listened to those kiss albums when i was pregnant.
67772,Marge,it's patty who chose the life of celibacy. selma simply had celibacy thrust upon her.
59321,Marge,i'll never get rid of this useless junk.
60462,Marge,hello?
55841,Marge,"that's wonderful, homie!"
54611,Marge,who gets... cutie-puss?
62019,Marge,"everyone seemed so happy, but i'm surprised at ned. he left out all the good times cain and abel had when they were growing up."
56270,Marge,who could that be...?
60804,Marge,if you just...
63854,Marge,how dare you?!
60420,Marge,"grampa, that happened a year and a half ago! we have to go save homer."
60294,Marge,i can't believe it. everyone's celebrating their obesity!
58288,Marge,i'm getting worried about lisa. she's been gone for hours.
60492,Marge,god wants you to lead the french army to what?
63587,Marge,"oh, what a wonderful night."
54900,Marge,"sweetie, i'm sorry, but krusty isn't coming to dinner again."
58341,Marge,monkey! there's a monkey in the house!
66452,Marge,i did not pay seven ninety-nine for an app so i could use the english option.
62038,Marge,"don't argue with marge, i know what's best / the only rap in this crib, keeps sandwiches fresh!"
54779,Marge,"but the big day finally came. and because i'd worked for it, all those lightbulb-warmed treats always tasted extra-good."
60019,Marge,"homer, help!"
58845,Marge,"oh, crud. and we're so close to the house."
53334,Ned Flanders,is this a dating video?
53943,Ned Flanders,"god's least favorite word, uttered on the public airwaves!"
52914,Ned Flanders,homer's passing...away.
53875,Ned Flanders,what are you doing?! you're gonna get hurt!
53931,Ned Flanders,"oh, i wish! no, these are complimentary boxes from the shipping company."
52542,Ned Flanders,"friends, we love you all, but i also have a ""sinister"" motive for asking you all here -- ""sinister"" being latin for ""left-handed."" but enough joking."
53362,Ned Flanders,"maybe we can. my name's ned flanders, and i'm here every week. rain or shine."
53923,Ned Flanders,"hiddily-ho, blobareeno."
53473,Ned Flanders,"oh, maude, i turned your dream of a christian amusement park into a bemusement park."
52708,Ned Flanders,"well it's bart simpson! c'mon in! you're just in time for ""sponge bath the old folks day!"""
53146,Ned Flanders,"oh, now roddy, it's just a stuck ball. i'll get it."
53563,Ned Flanders,"well boys, good thing we brought the eye soap."
53798,Ned Flanders,"well, it might be fun to be a landlord. landfella -- there's only one lord!"
53615,Ned Flanders,yep. now all we gotta do is turn that woman into a fella and that kiss into a game of scrabble.
52817,Ned Flanders,"what the gumdrops is going on, here?"
53849,Ned Flanders,"you betcha! in fact, some parents have been known to hold ""pox parties,"" so other kids in the neighborhood can get the disease when they please."
54262,Ned Flanders,someone to hold the other end of the sheet when i fold it up. someone to put in my prayers.
53662,Ned Flanders,"oh, i got it -- you want me to stay out here and work on the chorus."
53314,Ned Flanders,"well, i don't care for the speed, but i can't get enough of that safety gear. helmets, roll-bars, caution flags..."
53375,Ned Flanders,did i hear my name? my ears are burnin'.
53995,Ned Flanders,"well son, if you take responsibility for your actions, this could be the start of a better life for you."
54367,Ned Flanders,"gambling, eh? satan's most potent recruiting tool!"
52637,Ned Flanders,nooo!
53574,Ned Flanders,the steering wheel is a giant onion ring!
53693,Ned Flanders,"my angle is givin' in this world, livin' in the next."
53164,Ned Flanders,gosh darn it! am i that pre-diddley-dictable? i've wasted my whole dang diddley life.
54161,Ned Flanders,delete! delete! delete!
52795,Ned Flanders,"yeah, you."
54152,Ned Flanders,"lord, i think i may have finally reached him..."
53193,Ned Flanders,"how do you do it, homer? how do you silence that little voice that says, ""think""?"
52574,Ned Flanders,"listen to that singing... those poor fools. homer, i'm ruined."
52564,Ned Flanders,"ah, got your eye on the gas grill. she's a butane beaut."
53981,Ned Flanders,"c'mon, shoot! shoot!"
54480,Ned Flanders,you're never bored paintin' the lord.
54085,Ned Flanders,"lord, you said love thy neighbor, but you didn't have to make it so easy."
53561,Ned Flanders,and bless your humble home.
53870,Ned Flanders,do you have one for a mailman?
54314,Ned Flanders,"i thought i smelled death-a-diddly. what is that, an eight-pointer?"
53174,Ned Flanders,seems fair.
53925,Ned Flanders,isn't this your posse on this glossy?
53550,Ned Flanders,"i'm with you, homer."
54490,Ned Flanders,christmas is my busy season. sold three pairs of scissors this month! two came back.
54484,Ned Flanders,"really, really, really?"
54191,Ned Flanders,boy cheeks!... fanny!... derriere!... hiney!... backside!... ...cover up that coin slot!
53418,Ned Flanders,"no, i'm not!"
52910,Ned Flanders,no.
52649,Ned Flanders,"ah, homer, why don't you plow it again?"
52754,Ned Flanders,"heh-heh, yeah."
53764,Ned Flanders,"well sir, i don't believe we've ever met."
53281,Ned Flanders,"oooh, yes indeedy, homer. looks like they're settling in for a long stay."
53215,Ned Flanders,what's the occasion?
53818,Ned Flanders,"""made in humbleton, pa."" i don't usually make big life decisions based on things stamped on things that i bought at a garage sale. but corndog it boys, it's time for a change!"
52671,Ned Flanders,my name is ned.
53416,Ned Flanders,son of a diddly!
53484,Ned Flanders,nooo!!!
54423,Ned Flanders,enough!
53718,Ned Flanders,"come on, ned. just because you foresaw dr. hibbert's death doesn't mean you can see into the future. it was just a sinister co-inky-dink."
53035,Ned Flanders,okely-dokely-do.
52555,Ned Flanders,absotively posilutely.
52827,Ned Flanders,you just be ready with that garbage bag.
52589,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer! this little thing-a-ma-jig really works great. now that i've saved the earth, maybe i oughtta spruce up the ol' homestead."
53429,Ned Flanders,"all right, i'll take the couch and you can have my room."
54173,Ned Flanders,okily dokily.
53879,Ned Flanders,"well, i think it's about time you boys get to bed."
52651,Ned Flanders,you'll be history!
54439,Ned Flanders,church songs with clapping... i don't think this is what martin presbyluther had in mind when he founded our religion by sticking his three suggestions under the pope's windshield wiper.
54112,Ned Flanders,i never thought otherwise.
53973,Ned Flanders,"i can't say for sure, but as a christian, i assume the worst."
53758,Ned Flanders,anyone want some coffee for the ride back?
54282,Ned Flanders,"are you sure, lord?"
53047,Ned Flanders,i think i swallowed a toothpick.
53855,Ned Flanders,"christ is born, who's on my horn?"
52980,Ned Flanders,it's all gone. everything... gone-diddily-on.
53228,Ned Flanders,"excuse me, reverend? it's, ah, hard to hear you with those fans goin'."
53570,Ned Flanders,"oh sure, speed walking, ballroom dancing, rhythmic gymnastics, extreme choir..."
53757,Ned Flanders,they warned me satan would be attractive. let's go.
52989,Ned Flanders,uh-huh. floor feels a little gritty here.
53845,Ned Flanders,"okily-dokily, here's some french roast, now i'll go make toast."
53502,Ned Flanders,you're using my table saw to violate a court order?
52898,Ned Flanders,who wants to be the first to enter god's good graces?
53883,Ned Flanders,"i'm not ned, i'm a friendly dog. oh, i'm not a good liar. i did come here to check on the... where's rod?"
53297,Ned Flanders,feels like i'm wearing nothin' at all!
52656,Ned Flanders,"sure, you can borrow it for a little while."
52737,Ned Flanders,"homer simpson! that's a dilly of a pickle. hey, let's conference you with marge, huh?"
53815,Ned Flanders,"don't say it, homer. this is not the time."
54207,Ned Flanders,"howdy, cousin ted!"
54128,Ned Flanders,"today, my readin' ribbon's smack dab in the middle of matthew twenty-three."
53872,Ned Flanders,hiya marge. rod and todd in the land of nod?
53175,Ned Flanders,"of course i... oh, my stars! i can't do that."
52942,Ned Flanders,"ooh, sounds spine-tingly-dingling. just promise you'll have a good time."
52719,Ned Flanders,"okey-dokey, everybody find a partner. two dads to a raft."
53548,Ned Flanders,nobody.
53483,Ned Flanders,i've gotta close praiseland down. someone could get hurt.
52540,Ned Flanders,"heya, homer!"
53816,Ned Flanders,"well, toddy, you know how i said our friends are like the canaanites? today i realized they're more like the midianites."
53882,Ned Flanders,"well, their mascot is a kneepad wearing a helmet... why not?"
52588,Ned Flanders,"well, i guess my first wish is to get rid of those awful aliens."
53568,Ned Flanders,"praise the lord, my seat has scored!"
54051,Ned Flanders,"aw, maude. your dead grandmother's pajamas. you know what that does to me."

53952,Ned Flanders,"you know what they say: ""with great power comes great responsibility."""
53817,Ned Flanders,i wish we lived in a place more like the america of yesteryear that only exists in the brains of us republicans.

54089,Ned Flanders,"well, the people who lived here before, um, weren't always the best neighbors. but i love 'em. and, uh, you can't be a saint unless you live among the lepers. hope you don't mind."
54416,Ned Flanders,"i want you to punch me in the eye. if you do, then we're even, according to exodus, leviticus and matthew."
53512,Ned Flanders,"well, ginger, sure is, uh, um, neat that you managed to hunt me down."
54342,Ned Flanders,"okay simpsons -- well, call me a cockeyed optimist, 'cause i think some sort of celebration party might possibly be fun."

53876,Ned Flanders,"well, well. look at my dull-eyed angels."
53635,Ned Flanders,"sweetie, that's not the kind of dress you wear outdoors... or indoors... or in a dirty dream."
53276,Ned Flanders,"oh, i wish. you see, that night when you hit me with your car..."
53658,Ned Flanders,"uh, homer, i think you want your house, next door."
53976,Ned Flanders,banks? well deposit yourselves in a seat 'cause you've earned my interest!
53063,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, i hate to be a suspicious aloysius on you, but did you steal my air conditioner?"

54276,Ned Flanders,i started drinking orange juice with pulp! i asked the reverend and he said it was okay. then he hung right up on me. that man is cranky at three in the mornin'.
54300,Ned Flanders,"y'know, i knew a backstabbin' buckeye named roz at bible camp. twice as tall as she should've been."
52818,Ned Flanders,murdered?
53154,Ned Flanders,"howdy, homer."
54186,Ned Flanders,don't use that dog as a ramp...
52956,Ned Flanders,"pays for itself after the 16th visit. you know, most people don't know the difference between apple cider and apple juice. but i do. now here's a little trick to help you remember..."
52826,Ned Flanders,"now, in case all that smilin' didn't cheer ya up, there's one thing that never fails. a nice glass of warm milk, a little nap, and a total frontal lobotomy."
53291,Ned Flanders,the chri... i-i-i don't think you understand my objection...
54331,Ned Flanders,/
53812,Ned Flanders,the whole town is laughing at me behind my back. i guess you're the only real friend i have.
53862,Ned Flanders,and purple and white and pink and orange / and red and yellow and green and brown / scarlet and black and ochre and peach...

53768,Ned Flanders,"your mouth is hopin' for a soapin', boy! now stop asking silly questions and go kill your brother!"
52886,Ned Flanders,okay. for one gold star: what persian king exempted the levites from taxation?
53716,Ned Flanders,"well this is one dilly of a daily, lisa. can't wait for tomorrow's!"
53469,Ned Flanders,i'm maude. god is super!

53126,Ned Flanders,oops! that's for me. flancrest enterprises is my home business.
53687,Ned Flanders,that homer just burns my waffles!
54090,Ned Flanders,i think you should. the court papers will be a great way to stay in touch.
54042,Ned Flanders,"wordplay: never cared for it. but it's never too soon for you two to join the ""i do"" crew. now i'm not sayin' it's all jell-o with cool whip. she'll nag ya. she'll try to change ya. you'll be fighting the same basic fight for years and years and years--"
52531,Ned Flanders,"hey, anybody mind if i serve as bartender? you know, i have a ph.d in mixology."
53379,Ned Flanders,"oh, no! i could never support the black arts."
53951,Ned Flanders,so it is! i'm just here to pay the fine for the sunday school bus. you towed it with the kids still in it!
53246,Ned Flanders,god... bless him!
54130,Ned Flanders,duly noted. but we will make sure not to dilute the sacred gospel.
54583,Ned Flanders,"well, howdaly-do, simpson? gettin' a little exercise, eh? good for you, pal. oh, look at this old rascal! he's a wet old baby boy, isn't he? isn't he? you're just a water monster."
53210,Ned Flanders,"ooh, nuts."
54030,Ned Flanders,for the last few weeks. but most of the time i've known you you've treated me like dirt!
53841,Ned Flanders,"back off, you servants of the holy see!"
54399,Ned Flanders,"sorry, homer. now, do you mind if i pray at your bedside?"
54096,Ned Flanders,the parson?! he's coming here?
53807,Ned Flanders,i coulda sworn i just heard someone shriek my name.
52770,Ned Flanders,we're headin' back. todd's got zesty italian in his eye.
53437,Ned Flanders,"oh, who am i kidding? i'm not over maude at all."
54057,Ned Flanders,lock onto his wiener.
53819,Ned Flanders,the flanders family has pulled up stakes. you have laughed at us for the last-diddily-ast time.
54459,Ned Flanders,a brief one.
52767,Ned Flanders,"sometimes to keep from hurting someone's feelings, we have to say things that aren't exactly..."
53906,Ned Flanders,"um, that was god disguised as a stork."
52823,Ned Flanders,"oh, i see by the big board we've got a negative nellie in sector two. i'm afraid i'm going to have to ask the whole family to kinda freeze and prepare for re-neducation."
54526,Ned Flanders,"uh, knock what off, simpson?"
54475,Ned Flanders,"ah, too much aggravation! we just forego flipped food!"
53824,Ned Flanders,i'll see what i can do.
54294,Ned Flanders,"wake up, flanders! there is no hell, and there is no god. if there were, would he let me do this?"
53503,Ned Flanders,"gee, i always like to help you, homer, but i don't want to be an accessory to some sort of shady doin's. and it does raise a whole host of ethical questions, such as..."
54070,Ned Flanders,"when i was putting new insulation in your attic, i slipped on this lamp and really banged my head."
54458,Ned Flanders,i haven't felt this inspired since the blueberries at breakfast!
54145,Ned Flanders,"lord, please help homer experience the redemptive power of this sacred land."
53049,Ned Flanders,"yeah, well, if you're sure that'll help..."
53726,Ned Flanders,'cause i had a vision of myself... shooting your father.
54388,Ned Flanders,why don't you come on in and have breakfast with us?
53668,Ned Flanders,sin of regret.
53488,Ned Flanders,"so, how 'bout a movie tomorrow night?"
53156,Ned Flanders,"well, i did, but--"
54126,Ned Flanders,thank you all for coming.
54532,Ned Flanders,"hey, there's homer simpson! oh, what a perfect opportunity to follow up on my letter."
52924,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, i'm welcoming the bushes on behalf of the neighborhood association."

52686,Ned Flanders,i'll never have that problem again.
52716,Ned Flanders,"okilly dokilly. now, our annual father-son rafting trip is next weekend."
52883,Ned Flanders,...of bible questions.
53091,Ned Flanders,i'll take four!
53912,Ned Flanders,as sure as i am that jesus hates hip hop!
53646,Ned Flanders,that's what maude used to say.
54011,Ned Flanders,kindly deeds / done for free
52679,Ned Flanders,what?! you give me one good reason.
52667,Ned Flanders,"dear lord, thank you for ziggy comics, little baby ducks, and ""sweatin' to the oldies,"" volumes one, two and four."
54329,Ned Flanders,"lord, forgive me for my pride. all-wise, as always, you have rightly raised homer above me."
52537,Ned Flanders,"why homer, you silly goose! the weed whacker's just for the edges! you're gonna be out here all day!"
53723,Ned Flanders,"homer, i can foretell people's deaths!"
53028,Ned Flanders,"oh, i admit it! it's only two-alarm -- two-and-a-half tops! i just wanted to be a big man in front of the kids."
53145,Ned Flanders,hmm. that's odd. it didn't come out the rear end.
53946,Ned Flanders,first things first!
53461,Ned Flanders,"well thanks, homer."
52765,Ned Flanders,oh... well... that sounds super duper.
52697,Ned Flanders,"uh-oh. better cancel that dinner party tonight. thanks for the nose-news, neighbor."

52806,Ned Flanders,"well, homer, what a pleasant..."
54482,Ned Flanders,"well, we pulled more plugs than a dutch doctor. now let's take a trip to the side of the house."
53216,Ned Flanders,homer!
53122,Ned Flanders,"oh ho, i'm afraid i played a dirty part in this little charade."
53527,Ned Flanders,"hidilly-hey, homer!"
52730,Ned Flanders,here's our chance! dolphins always help humans lost at sea.
54235,Ned Flanders,"bart simpson? why, he lives right next door to me! yeah, when they made him, they did not skimp on the puppy dog tails."
53493,Ned Flanders,"so, did you boys have a good time?"
53079,Ned Flanders,what?
53710,Ned Flanders,...and a backrub can just be a backrub. it doesn't have to lead to adult situations.
53500,Ned Flanders,all right officer.
53383,Ned Flanders,"why, there's my name in gold."
54436,Ned Flanders,"well, the good news is it forced us all to church."
53560,Ned Flanders,"oh, you'd win that bet. seems like i'm spending all my money on religious pay-per-view. or as i like to call it, ""pray-per-view."""
53666,Ned Flanders,"well, the folks at the senior center sure will love that peach tree we planted."
53307,Ned Flanders,"mm-hm. that's the one! they've got a top-notch leper colony there, so we shipped 'em right off. ooh, cost us a bundle, too. i guess we'll have an ""imagination christmas"" this year."
54461,Ned Flanders,"well... i'm down to a kiosk, thanks to that place."
52640,Ned Flanders,"heck, you'd have done the same for me."
54072,Ned Flanders,hello?
52966,Ned Flanders,"y'know, i like his films, except for that nervous fella who's always in 'em."
52821,Ned Flanders,"hey, why that sounds like gabriel's trumpet. you know what that means, kids?"
54550,Ned Flanders,"all right, how's this for a wager? a batch of your wife's delicious blueberry muffins against one of my wife's homemade wind chimes!"
53749,Ned Flanders,"i can't run, i'm wearing flip-flops!"
54503,Ned Flanders,do you think this looks okay?
53099,Ned Flanders,"oooo, that's a dilly. how 'bout it, marge?"
54346,Ned Flanders,"well, sir... when we got married, i knew i'd find some spices in my chili. i guess they can go to springfield hellementary."
53856,Ned Flanders,you want me to deliver the christmas sermon? i feel like i'm born again again!
53652,Ned Flanders,i bet we woulda lasted twice that long.
54536,Ned Flanders,dear neighbor...
53020,Ned Flanders,"oh, now, why would i be afraid of that?"
53606,Ned Flanders,yep. why would that twinkie want to go out with a ding dong like me?
54546,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, may the best man win."
53772,Ned Flanders,"now, there's no need to actually whip 'em. we can put the sound in later."
54074,Ned Flanders,the rent check is late.
53631,Ned Flanders,"well, what seems to be the problem, officer?"
53083,Ned Flanders,do you have a problem with the way i'm coaching?
52572,Ned Flanders,"oh, oh, no, it's just a little campout tonight, then off to my sister's apartment in capital city. hey what do think, kids? the big city!"
52648,Ned Flanders,"thank you, plow king-a-lee-ding."
53365,Ned Flanders,"oh, hi bart. how much this time?"
54196,Ned Flanders,"rod? hold up daddy's shaving mirror out the window, would ya?"
52714,Ned Flanders,"okay, kids, now i'm gonna teach you how to trap wild animals. but this should only be used in a life or death situation."
53163,Ned Flanders,"mmm-hmm. and some people steer clear of that whole hornet's nest. i'll stick with just plain white bread, thank you very much. maybe with a--"
53994,Ned Flanders,"young man, what would your mother say if she knew you were shooting nice people in the brain?"
52721,Ned Flanders,"i guess now we know why they call them rapids and not slow-pids, huh?"
53467,Ned Flanders,"nope, they're all the same. plain."
52781,Ned Flanders,"i told you, officer. i'm not ""hepped up"" on ""goof balls."""
53813,Ned Flanders,"homer, is this true?"

53466,Ned Flanders,"ohh, what can i get you, little christian? how 'bout a noah's ark of jellies?"
53945,Ned Flanders,imploring people i never met to pressure a government with better things to do to punish a man who meant no harm for something nobody even saw. that's what i'm doing!
53089,Ned Flanders,"hey-hey there, marge. just brought the kids over to share a prayer with the blessed angel, if it's okay with you."
53571,Ned Flanders,"gosh, fifty thousand dollars? i'm donating this whole check to ""bibles for belgians."""

53771,Ned Flanders,"now i must bury my son, while you wander the earth forever, with the mark of evil upon your face."
53025,Ned Flanders,"thanks, everyone. i'm all better now. no more storing up the anger 'til i explode. if any of you does something i don't like, you are gonna hear about it!"

53754,Ned Flanders,but the infinite beauty-- / but the bible says--
52950,Ned Flanders,"uh... homer... ah, about those things you borrowed from me over the years -- you know -- the tv trays, the power sander, that downstairs bathtub... you going to be needing those things in cypress creek?"
53520,Ned Flanders,"come on, boys."

54542,Ned Flanders,"good shot, toddsky!"

52861,Ned Flanders,"well, i guess i am putting up the halloweenie decorations a little early. criticism accepted."
54370,Ned Flanders,"edna, i'm not one for costumes, but i sure do like that feather in your hair."
52584,Ned Flanders,"homer, affordable tract housing made us neighbors. but you made us friends."

52831,Ned Flanders,"well sorry, the shelter's kinda full."
52642,Ned Flanders,"homer, god didn't set your house on fire."
53538,Ned Flanders,"hey, hey, now hold on there. the nice people want to hear the real words."
53431,Ned Flanders,"ohh, no problem. a little starch will fix her right up."
52960,Ned Flanders,"homer, i'm as permissive as the next parent. i mean, just yesterday, i let todd buy some red hots with a cartoon devil on the box. but you can't possibly think it's appropriate for your ten-year-old son to work in a burlesque house!"
53846,Ned Flanders,"hey homer, why the sour puss? didja chugalug a skunky snapple?"
53387,Ned Flanders,"hey, whatever happened to the plow from your old snowplow business?"
53963,Ned Flanders,pride!

53192,Ned Flanders,"oh, righty-o. one betting disk please."
54062,Ned Flanders,one hundred and one thousand!
53958,Ned Flanders,"no, the lesson here is he's being punished for thinking women are beautiful."
54328,Ned Flanders,"you know, homer's givin' it the old bible college try. maybe i should have dialed down the doubting thomas."
52676,Ned Flanders,april fool's!
53573,Ned Flanders,that cuts the mustard with me.
53787,Ned Flanders,"well, well, well, looks like someone's having a pre-rapture party."

52619,Ned Flanders,"hot diggity! how 'bout that, marge? li'l ol' stanley me! ""stella!"" ""stella!"" heh heh."
52777,Ned Flanders,"no, i-i mean just the flanders family."
53637,Ned Flanders,"sara, i hate to say it, but your top's upstaging the pops!"
52837,Ned Flanders,okay.
53041,Ned Flanders,"oh, imagine that -- sleeping quietly after a bug attack! oh, and todd's as dry as a bone! lisa, you're a wonder! i'm going to recommend you to everybody!"
54084,Ned Flanders,my ballpoint is all clicked-up for you.
52874,Ned Flanders,"uh, er, that's just raspberry jam."
53412,Ned Flanders,son of a diddly!
54266,Ned Flanders,wait... you've all plucked a peach from her tree?
52608,Ned Flanders,"okay, mister, you've got yourself a deal. i'll shave off the soup strainer, if you give the sailor talk the old heave-ho, okay?"
54119,Ned Flanders,"top of the mornin', homer."
53475,Ned Flanders,"i'm sorry, sweetheart. oh, please don't look at me like that."
53435,Ned Flanders,"mm. well, goodnight, maude. i mean, maude. i mean, rachel. i mean, maude."
52585,Ned Flanders,"hey, fellow slave, is that one of those monkey paw dealies that lets you wish for things?"
54563,Ned Flanders,"mercy is for the weak, todd."
52710,Ned Flanders,"well sir, just apply a smidgen of peanut butter to an ordinary pine cone and you got yourself a makeshift bird feeder, sir."
53305,Ned Flanders,"no, no, no, no, no, no, no. i'm just thinking we could send you to a better place... you know, a place where they can really take care of you."
54359,Ned Flanders,okily-dokily!
53294,Ned Flanders,that shy little imp?
52935,Ned Flanders,marge simpson -- still making juice the old-fashioned way?
54220,Ned Flanders,homer! gimme back my tree!
54533,Ned Flanders,"reverend, i'm sorry to bother you at this hour but i threw a man out of my house today. i feel like i've violated matthew 19:19."
52915,Ned Flanders,into death.
52990,Ned Flanders,"why me, lord? where have i gone wrong? i've always been nice to people. i don't drink or dance or swear. i've even kept kosher, just to be on the safe side. i've done everything the bible says, even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff. what more could i do? i... i feel like i'm coming apart here. i want to yell out, but i... i... i just can't dang-diddily-do-dang-do-don-diddily-darn-do it. i... i...i..."
52845,Ned Flanders,"now, maude, in our movie, you lay baby moses in the basket, then put it among the reeds. okay? lights, camera, act - diddily-doddily-doodilly- action jackson!"
52982,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, everyone's alive. guess that's something to be thankful for."
52927,Ned Flanders,thankily-dankily! greatalicious!
53980,Ned Flanders,um... the battery seems to be dead. i'll get some help by hidin' in that bush.
52844,Ned Flanders,lucky i was wearing an extra large piece of the true cross today. i think i'll go inside.
53188,Ned Flanders,"god homer, watching you risk your life turned my beat box all the way up to .. rumba! yea, i was praying you'd be safe but to be honest, part of me wanted to see ya get splattered."
53082,Ned Flanders,ow! that's it!
53299,Ned Flanders,"hi-didly-ho, i..."
53496,Ned Flanders,so you are running a day care center?
53004,Ned Flanders,"you ugly, hate-filled man."
53065,Ned Flanders,"ex... ex... excuse me, sir? i think you've got my tv. sir?"
54516,Ned Flanders,"well, you may be right!"
54353,Ned Flanders,"so after all this time together, you two still haven't agreed on how to raise your kids?"
53847,Ned Flanders,really? do you mind if i bring my boys over so she can infect rod and todd? then there'll be a pox on both our houses!
53110,Ned Flanders,"oh, hi, marge. heh-heh. guess we gave you quite a start. we were painting todd's room red -- pretty messy work -- and then we came out here to take a break. must've dozed off."
52876,Ned Flanders,peek-a-boo! i see you!
53765,Ned Flanders,"well, i'll just call you friend. here's your tape... friend."
54278,Ned Flanders,"springfield. my home town. pretty little place. although, even the garden of eden could use a nice cleansing rain now and then."
52928,Ned Flanders,"now, todd, don't scare the president."
53312,Ned Flanders,"hey, need any help, homer?"
52593,Ned Flanders,"fella came into the store today and asked for change for a dollar. well sir, i gave him three quarters by mistake. took me the whole afternoon to track him down."
52880,Ned Flanders,"well, i don't know if the allegations are true / but you got us, and baby, we got you."
53831,Ned Flanders,now you've got a pen pal.
53857,Ned Flanders,"don't be nervous, ned. you've practiced this so many times in the shower."
53809,Ned Flanders,"well, mel, they're swell."
54024,Ned Flanders,homer!
54411,Ned Flanders,nope... not that... not to my taste... flag that for later... finally!
53803,Ned Flanders,"here's your room, ladies. you can catch some z's while you earn those degrees."
52838,Ned Flanders,"que sera, sera / whatever will be, will be / the future's not ours to see..."
54384,Ned Flanders,and the spirit of neighborly cooperation broke out as if all the weird angry people had left.
53249,Ned Flanders,looks like heaven's easier to get into than arizona state.
52921,Ned Flanders,"uh-huh. well, i... uh, i guess you could put a lot of nice things in there--"
52804,Ned Flanders,okily-dokily.
54415,Ned Flanders,i would embrace such a glad visit!
53415,Ned Flanders,son of a diddly!
53920,Ned Flanders,whaa -- ?
53585,Ned Flanders,"lord, this town may have turned its back on you, but not the flanderses. wherever we are, you'll have your church. are you with me, boys?"
53990,Ned Flanders,"look homer, people don't come back as anything -- except for our lord, who came back as bread. that's it."
54077,Ned Flanders,"homer simpson, i took pity on you, and what do i get in return? a kick in the kadiddlehopper!"
52747,Ned Flanders,ned flanders...
52824,Ned Flanders,"okay, everybody. let's see some big smiles."
53868,Ned Flanders,"here are the numbers for the police, fire, ambulance, poison control, burn clinic, and people nearby with rod and todd's blood type."
52829,Ned Flanders,"i kinda figured this might happen, so i built the shelter big enough for both our families."
52871,Ned Flanders,"hey, kids! nachos, flanders-style! that's cucumbers with cottage cheese."
53509,Ned Flanders,maybe never.
53863,Ned Flanders,this is my favorite kind of surprise: mild!
54506,Ned Flanders,this one's mine. and this one's mine. this one's mine... and this--
52657,Ned Flanders,"we'll take good care of your boy, simpson. enjoy the miracle of creation."
53760,Ned Flanders,"no, no, it's home-brewed."
54069,Ned Flanders,"well, as you are my tenants, i'll see what i can do."
52661,Ned Flanders,"heidy-ho, simpson. your son shoved this through our doggie door."
54445,Ned Flanders,we've lost him.
52684,Ned Flanders,"now, marge, don't you worry. we've all had our brushes with the law."
54147,Ned Flanders,"homer, could you at least turn the camera off?"
53293,Ned Flanders,well i... okay.
52819,Ned Flanders,"all right. it's true. i am a murderer. i over-watered maude's favorite ficus plant, i panicked, and then i buried the remains. i was hoping to replace it before you got home."
53619,Ned Flanders,i'll have you know she pays full price for all her watercraft!
52663,Ned Flanders,"homer simpson! well, if that don't put the ""dink"" in co-inky-dink."
52613,Ned Flanders,"ho, ho, that's where you're wrong, friend."
52937,Ned Flanders,hmm. i seem to have mashed more hair into it. oh well.
53737,Ned Flanders,homer! do not press the core destruct button!
53793,Ned Flanders,"he scampered out of parade magazine and into my knick-knack nook, and uh, well his little buddies soon followed."
54065,Ned Flanders,"say homer, why don't you let me take a peek at that leak?"
53308,Ned Flanders,"ah, ha, excuse me, neighbor..."
52541,Ned Flanders,"okay, thanks for comin'!"
54053,Ned Flanders,"what a charming single entendre. now look, i know marriage is scary, but if you really think she's the one, it gives you two a shot at forever."
53886,Ned Flanders,"welcome to the jungle gym / i'll make it safe again / when playtime is a safe time, everybody wins..."
53641,Ned Flanders,"homer, sara wants us to have s-e-x."
54008,Ned Flanders,bible salesman!

54341,Ned Flanders,less news from the pews!
53022,Ned Flanders,"mmm, mmm. 'sure are fun to scratch. mmm. satisfying."
53296,Ned Flanders,"well, it allows for maximum mobility."
53643,Ned Flanders,"well, i consulted my bible and found some verses supporting what you want to do."
54199,Ned Flanders,i'm standin' right here!
53866,Ned Flanders,woo hoo!
53115,Ned Flanders,"hey, heard some no-goodnik stole your tree. well we got a 30 footer, so you can have the top of ours."
52926,Ned Flanders,tip-top-notch!
54068,Ned Flanders,"well, i guess i'd better be..."
53482,Ned Flanders,"hello, gas company? how poisonous is your gas?... wow. but-- eh, but i'm talkin', you know, about outdoors with plenty of ventilation that... how could that be worse?... okay, permanent brain damage, or just temporary?... i see."
54254,Ned Flanders,"pretty funny, homer."
52571,Ned Flanders,"well, there's no house to put it in, homer, not since that nice fellow from the bank, who was only doing his job, came and locked it up."
54444,Ned Flanders,"reverend, this is just the kind of tomfoolery that's been on the upswing since you left! pure, unadulterated tomfoolery!"
53960,Ned Flanders,"behold, the las-diddily-ast room of ned flanders's hell house!"
54383,Ned Flanders,"i hate to be a nag, but this is my real head."
54222,Ned Flanders,that feeling is mutual of omaha.
53107,Ned Flanders,"uh, now that you mention it, we could use..."
54573,Ned Flanders,no-sirree-bob!
53583,Ned Flanders,they've broken every commandment except one!
53991,Ned Flanders,even the sing-alongs?
53719,Ned Flanders,"just wriggle loose. i'll catch ya, li'l critter!"
53385,Ned Flanders,"well, i'm all for rescuing the kids, but i wish you hadn't sawed off my roof."
54575,Ned Flanders,"oh, are you sure? we got that new propane beauty just sittin' in the back yard."
54034,Ned Flanders,"""...lest i come and strike the earth with a curse."" thus ends the book of malachi. i guess i did know the whole old testament by heart. out with the old... in with the new. testament, that is. matthew one. ""the book of the genealogy of jesus christ, the son of david, the son of abraham..."""
53072,Ned Flanders,"uh-huh, but we'd love to have you on board."
52735,Ned Flanders,"godspeed, li'l doodle."
52843,Ned Flanders,lucky i always keep a bible close to my heart.
52998,Ned Flanders,"oh, now, calm down neddilly-diddily-diddily-diddily-diddily... they did their best... shoddily-iddily-iddily-diddily... gotta be nice... hostility-ilitity-bility-dility -- aw, hell, diddly-ding-dong-crap! can't you morons do anything right?!!"
54005,Ned Flanders,"homer, can we take it easy on the taser?"
52740,Ned Flanders,"what do you think, reverend?"
52991,Ned Flanders,"aw, what happened now? did the rubble burn down?"
53226,Ned Flanders,"leapin' lazarus! is this what passes for eternal rest these days? rod, go get daddy his buryin' shovel."
53284,Ned Flanders,... they'll fill your lives with...
54031,Ned Flanders,i forgave you for accidentally killing my wife.
53566,Ned Flanders,"now rainier, i really don't think it's right to sell these playdude centerfolds."
54212,Ned Flanders,not on my watch!
54043,Ned Flanders,i think i'd like to finish my sentence: and years.
53735,Ned Flanders,i gotta find homer -- he's gonna blow up the whole town!
54204,Ned Flanders,"neighbor, we've got some work to do."
54340,Ned Flanders,"homer, did you just buckle your belt through my loop?"
53411,Ned Flanders,will do.
54380,Ned Flanders,"yes, but there's two sides to every--"
53525,Ned Flanders,"now, throughout history, when people get wood, they'll think of trojans."
53348,Ned Flanders,"yeah, well, maybe i'll call you again."
54014,Ned Flanders,"man, that's harder to swallow than evolution."
52751,Ned Flanders,what?
54587,Ned Flanders,"whoops, my heart rate's dropping. better skedaddley-do."
53684,Ned Flanders,where the h-e-c-k is everybody?
53436,Ned Flanders,"no, n-n-no i know this is a-a-a tad unseemly, but if you'd just let me even out the back..."
54535,Ned Flanders,"a gentle answer. well, that is a jim-dandy idea. bless you, reverend."
54099,Ned Flanders,settle. settle down.
52755,Ned Flanders,"hidilly ho, stanster."
53678,Ned Flanders,"gee, looks like this town has a good sam log-jam."
53148,Ned Flanders,"well, something's in there all right."
54585,Ned Flanders,"oh, you betcha! you know, they got velcro straps, a water pump in the tongue, built-in pedometer, reflective sidewalls and little vanity license plates."
53495,Ned Flanders,"oh, roddy, he's not runnin' a day care center."
53170,Ned Flanders,"yeah, i, i guess i do."
53605,Ned Flanders,"no, it's sara sloane. i have a date with her tonight."
54501,Ned Flanders,"see marge, someone up in the sky did hear your prayers..."
54049,Ned Flanders,"sweet dreams, my new best friend."
54071,Ned Flanders,"so, unless you have anything else for me..."
53837,Ned Flanders,it sure is great to look down my nose at everybody again. mind if i waggle my finger a little bit?
54055,Ned Flanders,don't you think i've got better things to do on my honeymoon than spy on you two?
53064,Ned Flanders,"now, now, there's plenty of exits for everyone."
53808,Ned Flanders,"oh, that's better."
54141,Ned Flanders,the old city. where b.c. turned into a.d.! let's go!
53645,Ned Flanders,it says a man should make restitution if he eats his neighbor's grain. and that's good enough for me.
54334,Ned Flanders,s'okay... she's my wife.
53743,Ned Flanders,"oh, you stupid son-of-a..."
53392,Ned Flanders,"hm, sounds like a plan."
53136,Ned Flanders,"easy, ned, don't breathe in."
52563,Ned Flanders,"oh, yeah. sure. thought i'd just get rid of some of the clutter. see anything you like?"
54169,Ned Flanders,i did it! i reached him!
52717,Ned Flanders,"oh warren, i know your dad is in prison, but don't you fret. a special celebrity dad has been arranged for ya."
54061,Ned Flanders,three... two... one... it's ash wednesday everybody! set down your gins and confess your sins!
54206,Ned Flanders,"neighbor, marge invited me over to be the little angel on your shoulder, so you wouldn't listen to the four hundred devils on the other."
53393,Ned Flanders,homer! wake up! the car's filling with...
54330,Ned Flanders,never again will i question...
52936,Ned Flanders,why don't you freeze it with an ice cube and hit it with a hammer? works for me when i get bubbly-gum in the ol' push-broom.
52808,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer, what's the big brouhaha? ha."
52872,Ned Flanders,"oh, bart. i know you're still getting adjusted here. tell you what. we'll do whatever you want to do."
53067,Ned Flanders,"little higher, wendell... a lot higher, martin... ah, ralph, that's a basketball."
53360,Ned Flanders,"no, i hear what you're saying. it's always hard to replace someone."
52875,Ned Flanders,"no, son. no sirree, bob."
53439,Ned Flanders,yea-- what?
52981,Ned Flanders,maude? rod? todd?
52660,Ned Flanders,"oh bart, you met grandma flanders. hope she didn't scare ya."
54277,Ned Flanders,we just wanted to give you all a big thank you from team nedna.
52597,Ned Flanders,"no reverend, the point is, he said a bad word."
53267,Ned Flanders,"sorry to break character, but these stunt pants are getting pretty toasty!"
53233,Ned Flanders,there you go.
53207,Ned Flanders,"what are we gonna do, homer? my kids are gonna be traumatized! and then there's maude. and then there's maude!"
52573,Ned Flanders,"say, todd, i want to talk to your uncle homer. you're head of the car till i get back."
54538,Ned Flanders,"hi, simpson! having fun?"
53801,Ned Flanders,"well, i do appreciate that you've got a cashier's check... now, do you have any pets?"
53905,Ned Flanders,no one was ever a monkey! everything is what it was and always will be! god put us here and that's that!
52815,Ned Flanders,it's time to put you away.
52944,Ned Flanders,"open the door, maude! i don't have time for the secret knock!"
52655,Ned Flanders,i just this minute bought it at the hardware st...
54170,Ned Flanders,"homer, my friend, of all the false messiahs today, i think you came closest to the truth."
54520,Ned Flanders,"ain't she wonderful, simpson?"
52681,Ned Flanders,i can't imagine what we could've done to... oh... oh no!
53686,Ned Flanders,"oh, for the love of puppies."
53639,Ned Flanders,"se... well, that's a mighty big... kettle of... premarital... uh, doodly..."
53295,Ned Flanders,"hi-didly-ho, schuss in boots."
53802,Ned Flanders,"you poor thing! i've heard about those robes -- flapping everywhere. girls, welcome to your very own ned and breakfast."
54256,Ned Flanders,language.
54470,Ned Flanders,"i told you, the only dancing i like is ""square."""
54566,Ned Flanders,what are you talking about? neither boy lost.
53236,Ned Flanders,what the dickens?!
52546,Ned Flanders,"well sir, i'm opening a one-stop store for southpaws. everything from left-handed apple peelers to left-handed zithers. i'm gonna call it the leftorium."
53010,Ned Flanders,thank you. doctor foster?
53690,Ned Flanders,that tears it. i'll show homer. i'm gonna be the nicest man this world has ever seen.
54156,Ned Flanders,"homer, this is the most sacred spot in christendom, not your backyard hammock."
54146,Ned Flanders,"homer, do you think you could show just the slightest bit of reverence?"
53468,Ned Flanders,how 'bout a maude mask?
54123,Ned Flanders,"you know, maybe i should use a towel marked ""b.d.d."" -- big diddily deal!"
54189,Ned Flanders,buttocks!
53341,Ned Flanders,"homer, i'm having second thoughts. this feels so disloyal to maude."
54460,Ned Flanders,"i said a fit, not a fervor!"
54104,Ned Flanders,"well boys, daddy's back on the beam, thanks to christian prayer and doctor sheldon lowenstein!"
52812,Ned Flanders,"mommy had to go away. she's with god, now."
54502,Ned Flanders,"just hold your horses, son. hey, hey, simpson."
53074,Ned Flanders,who are we?
53578,Ned Flanders,why do i always give in to him?
52951,Ned Flanders,oh... uh...
53677,Ned Flanders,"well, the hobos sure will appreciate our old clothes and lima beans."
53794,Ned Flanders,"you like 'em, huh? come on, i'll show you the other three hundred."
53196,Ned Flanders,"i'll have a shirley... no, a virgin... no, make it a children's... oh, what the heck, you only live once. give me a..."
53125,Ned Flanders,"uh, is that your collar, reverend?"
54375,Ned Flanders,look a little closer.
53430,Ned Flanders,"oh, ah, c-c-could you sleep on my side? i-i'm trying to preserve maude's indentation."
53486,Ned Flanders,"how 'bout i explain it to you over a cup of coffee. that is, if you're willing to give me another shot."
52727,Ned Flanders,"paddle harder, homer. we gotta fight the current."
53103,Ned Flanders,"well, marge?"
52905,Ned Flanders,and this is lord thistlewick flanders...
53382,Ned Flanders,what?
53108,Ned Flanders,"oh, you're sweet to offer, but, uh, we're all just so tired, we just want to get to our new house and rest in peace."
53767,Ned Flanders,"now boys, we're gonna film the world's first and some would say best murder mystery -- the story of cain and abel!"
54275,Ned Flanders,"hey simpson, you wanna hear about the big change in my life?"
54167,Ned Flanders,nothing like a tall glass of luke-warm water to jekyll down this hyde.
52790,Ned Flanders,it's the four elephants of the apocalypse!
52745,Ned Flanders,"i don't really have very much experience, but i'll be---"
52631,Ned Flanders,stella! stellla! can't you hear me yell-a? / you're puttin' me through hell-a / stella! stella!
53552,Ned Flanders,"well, i do miss the mrs..."
54221,Ned Flanders,"hey-diddily-hi, homer."
54525,Ned Flanders,"ah, kids can be a trial sometimes."
54335,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, now we'll have an open marriage!"
53113,Ned Flanders,"we appreciate the offer, marge, but i think we're going to be very happy here."
54400,Ned Flanders,not praying to a character in a comic book.
52772,Ned Flanders,"oh lord, please give me the strength to endure homer simpson's friendship."
53679,Ned Flanders,that was led zeppelin.
53460,Ned Flanders,"ohhh, i'm not very good at begging people for stuff."
53796,Ned Flanders,"boys, enough of your shenanigans. it's bedtime."
53902,Ned Flanders,"you're leavin' already? we, we haven't even gotten in yet."
52881,Ned Flanders,"babe. we got you, babe."
53711,Ned Flanders,"now now, remember why we're here: to celebrate jasper's birthday."
52955,Ned Flanders,"oh, suckin' down the cider, eh? hey, word to the wise... season pass!"
53651,Ned Flanders,"oh, darn the luck. that sounds like the lupus fun run."
53177,Ned Flanders,"so, what happens next?"
52567,Ned Flanders,"all right, homer."
53584,Ned Flanders,that's it. the whole shebang.
52996,Ned Flanders,"oh, something is definitely wrong with this hallway!"
53050,Ned Flanders,"uh, excuse me, fellas... i... i couldn't help thinking it might be nice if you could uh, vamoose, you know. if possible."
53508,Ned Flanders,"my satan sense is tingling! into the root cellar, boys!"
53827,Ned Flanders,why? so you can make me a laughingstock again?
53399,Ned Flanders,"mmm-hmm. this one's fine and dandy, roddy. it's approved by a council of presbylutheran ministers."
53747,Ned Flanders,"well, my roddy told a joke about an octopus and a set of bagpipes -- and the punchline implied that they fornicated!"
53620,Ned Flanders,exact-a-tically-tacally!
53386,Ned Flanders,but it's my car.
53470,Ned Flanders,bye bye.
54578,Ned Flanders,that is the most dishonest thing i've ever heard.
53330,Ned Flanders,"ah, you're right. i've just got to work through the grief. there's not gonna be an easy answer."
52785,Ned Flanders,"oh can't you see this man isn't a hero! he's annoying. he's very, very annoying!"
53618,Ned Flanders,the paparazzi! i thought we fooled them with our cher-crow.
53191,Ned Flanders,j-- what?
53280,Ned Flanders,i resisted these for thirty-five years! why did i wear them today?
54305,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, she went crazy. crazier than sleeping in on a sunday."
53513,Ned Flanders,"oh lord, i know my new wife is a little more... ""peppermint"" than you're used to. but, uh, i know you'd want me to honor my sacred vows, so i will."
54389,Ned Flanders,"eh, for a little bit."
54339,Ned Flanders,"boys, you will please call your new mother whatever she feels comfortable with."
53090,Ned Flanders,"thanks anyway, homer."
53017,Ned Flanders,"oh, well, i'll just have to try harder! oops, thanks for dropping by."
53592,Ned Flanders,"mm hmm! open as a tomb on easter. now, what can i ding dong diddily do for ya?"
54360,Ned Flanders,"well, hello! it's one of those music industry superstars who's turning our innocent children into ladies of the night."
52559,Ned Flanders,"uh, okay."
53086,Ned Flanders,you mean like... an angel?!!
54195,Ned Flanders,blind spot?! mecca?!
53593,Ned Flanders,"oh, i should say not. i gave up on l.a. when those tv people made that poor nun fly. all those puerto ricans lookin' up her dress. that's not right."
53934,Ned Flanders,"homer, you've met my parents."
53448,Ned Flanders,"ohhh, that's a nice thought, toddy, but to build an amusement park you need lots of money, and manpower, and turnstiles..."
54410,Ned Flanders,the answer to my woe must be in here.
53044,Ned Flanders,"well, if you're talking about root beer, i plead guilt-didilly-ilty as char-dardilly-arged."
54453,Ned Flanders,tithe denied! tithe denied!
52860,Ned Flanders,that's a good one.
53636,Ned Flanders,"well, siegfried and roy create a lot of illusions, but i doubt their girlfriends dress like that."
52550,Ned Flanders,"you must have something you want to wish for, homer."
53625,Ned Flanders,"well, i can't see the harm."
54553,Ned Flanders,"all right, and if todd wins, you have to mow my lawn! and do a decent job of it, for a change!"
52939,Ned Flanders,you ever operated a power boat?
53830,Ned Flanders,"that tears it! boys, put on your goody two-shoes. we're moving back to springfield!"
53776,Ned Flanders,are you even listening to me?!
52741,Ned Flanders,"hidilly ho, neighboreenos."
53077,Ned Flanders,"okilly-dokilly, let's put on our game faces."
54045,Ned Flanders,"well, when the sun goes down it means god's gone to china to watch over those good folks. time for some shuteye."
52908,Ned Flanders,"help me! help me, lord!"
53289,Ned Flanders,i move we reconsider our club name. make it something a little less blasphemous. after all we don't want to go to hell.
53600,Ned Flanders,what the...? that's a pseu-diddily-eudonym.
54063,Ned Flanders,so i can rent it back to you. just pay what you can till you get back on your feet.
52591,Ned Flanders,hey ho simpson.
53060,Ned Flanders,"you saved me, reverend. you really went above and beyond. thank you!"
54215,Ned Flanders,"bart, call me walter matthau, 'cause i'm a bad-news bearer. i'm resigning as manager of your little league team."
54247,Ned Flanders,oh yes they were! we deliberately chose a doctor stork so we could say it without lying.
54397,Ned Flanders,homer! i can't believe you're partaking with my parents!
54118,Ned Flanders,we'll let the authorities sort that out.
52995,Ned Flanders,"was that... uh, was that toilet always next to the refrigerator?"
53621,Ned Flanders,no way! i won't even eat vegetables over two inches long.
53608,Ned Flanders,"... rod says ""marco,"" and darn it if todd doesn't say ""polo"" right back! oh, listen to me just running my gums about my kids. you're probably bored silly."
53480,Ned Flanders,"oh, no! this isn't a devine miracle. everyone's just gettin' goofy from the gas."
52725,Ned Flanders,uh-oh... no time.
53759,Ned Flanders,"not that convenience store crap, is it? because i don't feed that to my dogs."
53647,Ned Flanders,"well, and you will. right after the wedding."
53501,Ned Flanders,what the...?!
54136,Ned Flanders,"i sense a ""but"" coming, reverend..."
52906,Ned Flanders,can i come?
54162,Ned Flanders,"please, you've gotta let me back in. i sold six thousand rolls of wrapping paper to get here!"
52635,Ned Flanders,"i see him, son."
53119,Ned Flanders,"looks like slim pickin's today, reverend."
53932,Ned Flanders,"only if he fibbed about his name, age, and occupation on this automated eight-hundred number."
53085,Ned Flanders,"good luck, homer. no hard feelin's."
53187,Ned Flanders,"no, homer, no! i wanna do something exciting, but i can't just go from zero to thirty like that! i-i could be killed."
54114,Ned Flanders,my wife? and my worst friend? could it be?
53337,Ned Flanders,ewwww.
52848,Ned Flanders,"'zounds, i did thee mightily smite-ly."
53453,Ned Flanders,but i...
54362,Ned Flanders,"yes, but jesus said that... pretty much the same thing. darnit, the bible said the devil would be attractive!"
52913,Ned Flanders,you know...
54082,Ned Flanders,because your father lives with me now.
53644,Ned Flanders,and a lot of verses against it.
54395,Ned Flanders,funyuns?! little debbies?!
52674,Ned Flanders,i was more animal than man.
52569,Ned Flanders,what?
53043,Ned Flanders,you did? just a minute. what time can you come over?
53633,Ned Flanders,well of course. wait a minute. this is to adopt two of your kids.
52560,Ned Flanders,"come on, homer. tell him about the store. i'm dyin' out here."
52866,Ned Flanders,yes. eat all of our shirts.
54477,Ned Flanders,should we do something?
54290,Ned Flanders,you made a killer out of me!
53198,Ned Flanders,"oh my goodness, homer. wake up!"
53869,Ned Flanders,"ooh, wow, it's the big unit himself, randy johnson! you've fanned more men than salome!"
54250,Ned Flanders,you have the energy for one more?
52715,Ned Flanders,"howdilly hey, camper bart. ready for today's meeting?"
53607,Ned Flanders,"well sir, that's very encouraging but i can't date a movie star. i'm no arthur miller or lyle lovett."
53183,Ned Flanders,"oh, the lights, the noise, the letter x -- i-it's all designed to inflame the senses. i'm overstimulated! i gotta get out of this town!"
53209,Ned Flanders,how are we going to get outta this mess in an honorable and decent--
53859,Ned Flanders,"my lp of ""dreamcoat!"""
54466,Ned Flanders,does anyone remember when it was considered rude to talk in church?
53487,Ned Flanders,i'm sure.
54224,Ned Flanders,"well, i got excited for nothing."
52938,Ned Flanders,"well, howdilly-doodily, stranger! couldn't help but notice you stealing my boat."
53654,Ned Flanders,why don't you pound that sign into your own lawn?
54102,Ned Flanders,one cran-bran for the flan-man.
54543,Ned Flanders,"so, my little bartley, thinking of entering the tournament?"
54454,Ned Flanders,"pray for a miracle, boy! god can hear you better from up there!"
53039,Ned Flanders,"well, i don't know, lisa. you're awfully young, and the boys can be a handful. todd's been pinching everyone lately."
52556,Ned Flanders,n-not yet. but one of the mall security guards took a good long look at a left-handed ice cream scoop.
53158,Ned Flanders,"i suppose, if you must know... i'm... well, i'm... i'm sixty."
54435,Ned Flanders,noooo!
52636,Ned Flanders,homer! homer!
53805,Ned Flanders,i got phi beta cappuccinos for ned's pre-meds!
53887,Ned Flanders,now i'll lay down some astro turf / so they don't scrape their n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-knees...
52606,Ned Flanders,what's wrong with my moustache?
52931,Ned Flanders,"aw, they're just family heirlooms. that shouldn't stand in the way of homer takin' my job and--"
53134,Ned Flanders,8:45?! here i am yappin' away like it's 8:35. don't forget the mints.
53339,Ned Flanders,"well, with triple word score, that's ninety! ha-ha, i guess my luck is starting to even out."
53785,Ned Flanders,"gee, i thought my vision was perfect. and here i was, worshiping false eyeballs."
53123,Ned Flanders,"uh, maybe we should take a little break-a-rooney, huh? anyone like a draft beer?"
53355,Ned Flanders,"electric guitars in church? oh, my gosh. some dropouts must have overpowered the reverend!"
53627,Ned Flanders,"well, i..."
54418,Ned Flanders,"homer, just call me a little bubble 'cause i'm on the level. punch me."
53675,Ned Flanders,"i'm dying! and there's heaven. but who's that? confucius? and milton berle? boy, have i been barkin' up the wrong tree."
54523,Ned Flanders,"my pleasure, study buddy."
54326,Ned Flanders,"well, congratulations, homer. guess this is just my cross to bear."
54405,Ned Flanders,dare i take another sleep aid?
53300,Ned Flanders,"maude, come quick! the simpsons are covered with cooties!"
53129,Ned Flanders,yep.
53736,Ned Flanders,homer! homer!
53498,Ned Flanders,me? okay.
54547,Ned Flanders,"now, just a minute, simpson. i think my son has a very good chance."
54514,Ned Flanders,"say simpson, i-i've got some time-release granules that'll get rid of that crabgrass in just a half-a-jif."
54023,Ned Flanders,"forget it! i am turning in my... well, i don't really have anything to turn in. so that's that! i suggest you call homer simpson."
53331,Ned Flanders,hmm.
53474,Ned Flanders,it is! it's a bemusement park!
52694,Ned Flanders,hiedilly-hey!
52576,Ned Flanders,i sold it to you for seven cents.
54428,Ned Flanders,"you wanna hit me. well sir, here's a roll of quarters to put in your fist for extra punching power!"
53867,Ned Flanders,"i'm so glad you're watchin' the boys, marge. our last babysitter let 'em watch ""comedy central"", now rod makes me check the closet every night for rita rudner."
54512,Ned Flanders,"oooh, she's a beaut. hey, congratulations, simpson. i'm sure you'll have loads of fun."
53007,Ned Flanders,"ooh, kicking and screaming, please."
54465,Ned Flanders,"we may be going to hell for seeing ""side bosom,"" but this backyard is a little slice of heaven, all thanks to homer simpson!"
53601,Ned Flanders,well i've got a date with a girl with no name / it sure feels good to be back in the game / at dessert maybe i can ask her her name / 'cause i can't pray for her without the right name...
52840,Ned Flanders,"when i was just a little girl / i asked my mother what will i be / will i be pretty, will i be rich? / here's what she said to me..."
53403,Ned Flanders,"jeepers, that's sugary, even for my taste."
54505,Ned Flanders,"oh, my, what a little mess we've got here! well, which ones are yours and which ones are mine?"
53259,Ned Flanders,i think you'll find living thrifty a lot more satisfying than stealing.
53251,Ned Flanders,"well, this goes right into the old poor box."
54218,Ned Flanders,"hey there, mr. burns! for our half hour i thought we'd have a picnic in the park."
53890,Ned Flanders,"uno?! that's a gateway game to pinochle. all diddily aside, boys, what is it about her you miss so much?"
53178,Ned Flanders,"okay, homer. i'm ready to learn. what's the first lesson? just give me the topic sentence."
53848,Ned Flanders,"au contraire, man with no hair! you see, rod and todd can only get the chicken pox once, and childhood's the safest time!"
53897,Ned Flanders,please! somebody take 'em!
52738,Ned Flanders,"kids, did anyone pray for giant shoes?"
52620,Ned Flanders,roger-dodger.
52899,Ned Flanders,"do you reject satan, and all his empty promises?"
53780,Ned Flanders,"well, we could use a new h.q. for the springfield philharmonic. they're playing gustav mahler in abject squalor."
54322,Ned Flanders,"homer, when am i gettin' my power drill back?"
53464,Ned Flanders,you can stop satan with your faith.
54537,Ned Flanders,"i don't blame you for being upset with me, homer. i just wanted to give you this letter. i'll leave now."
52947,Ned Flanders,"now they're trying it as a maritime offense. so anyhoo, how'd you like to use my beach house? free of charge."
54586,Ned Flanders,"well, you know they're not givin' 'em away. but sometimes you've just got to spoil yourself."
54404,Ned Flanders,please don't use that word in bed.
53928,Ned Flanders,"tonight's g-rated gem is a silent film from my favorite year -- yester! and while you enjoy this quiet riot, i'll be slipping these religious pamphlets on your windshields."
52577,Ned Flanders,"you know, ever since that barbecue, nothing's gone right. it's like there's been a-a curse on me."
53033,Ned Flanders,hi-dilly-ho shary bobbins!
54171,Ned Flanders,i'd like that.
53729,Ned Flanders,quit whackin' my barrel!
52958,Ned Flanders,"...adirondack cider can be yellow if they're using late-season apples. and, of course, in canada the whole thing's flip-flopped..."
52544,Ned Flanders,"no, i kid you not. here's the noose i had to wear for ten years."
54106,Ned Flanders,"okily-dokily. but i'm warning you, you're gonna see america's number-one dishwashing crew!"
53016,Ned Flanders,"ooh, thanks for dropping by!"
52801,Ned Flanders,woopsy-doodle.
54352,Ned Flanders,"i just felt so ashamed i just couldn't go home. today, i gave in to the one thing i vowed i would never have in my marriage: strong feeling."
52778,Ned Flanders,we're not going anywhere.
52896,Ned Flanders,"until this, i never thought homer and marge were bad parents. but now i know you kids need a less hellbound family."
54534,Ned Flanders,love thy neighbor.
53978,Ned Flanders,"unmarried?! that's it, i'm turning 'em in."
53543,Ned Flanders,"oh, those are not the words!"
54513,Ned Flanders,"doing a little yard work, huh?"
53688,Ned Flanders,pain is the cleanser! pain is the cleanser!
53459,Ned Flanders,"oh, i don't mind, but my greenback stack's gettin' kinda slack."
52693,Ned Flanders,"maude, these new finger-razors make hedge trimming as fun as sitting through church."
52791,Ned Flanders,"well, gettin' closer."
52704,Ned Flanders,well howdilly dodilly-do!
54464,Ned Flanders,okily-dokily.
53714,Ned Flanders,"huh, credit card bill seems a little chunky this month."
54166,Ned Flanders,not. worth. saving.
53000,Ned Flanders,"oh, okay ""dude."" i wouldn't want you to have a cow, ""man."" here's a catch-phrase you better learn for your adult years: ""hey, buddy, got a quarter?"""
52605,Ned Flanders,"look homer, all of us pull a few boners now and then... go off half-cocked and make asses of ourselves. so, i don't want to be hard on you... but i just wish you wouldn't curse in front of my boys."
54497,Ned Flanders,my best friend is a great runner!
53572,Ned Flanders,"well, hot dog!"
53881,Ned Flanders,i just can't. they're all i've got since that sad day when maude found eternal happiness.
52658,Ned Flanders,"so, kids, what do you want to play?"
54283,Ned Flanders,and so white-bread ned became the avenging sword of the lord.
52650,Ned Flanders,you'll be hist...
53829,Ned Flanders,"homer, that's really touching. but my boys and i are trying to make a new start, and the people here are a little more my cup of..."
53165,Ned Flanders,look at that! everyone's living it up except ned.
54015,Ned Flanders,not bad.
53463,Ned Flanders,"well, maude, your dream has finally come true."
52968,Ned Flanders,"oh, righty-o! it's good for keeping down the urges."
53094,Ned Flanders,"reverend, i've got to admit, this doomsday warning has me just a smidge twitterpated."
52842,Ned Flanders,is that so? well gee... maybe the old flandersmobile could use a...
53748,Ned Flanders,"let's see... ""get bent."" well, the only thing that could mean is kneel down and pray. we'll take the whole box. get bent, everyone!"
54574,Ned Flanders,"okey-dokel. hey, why don't you and your family come over for a barbecue tomorrow?"
53389,Ned Flanders,"sure you did -- ""mr. plow."" you're wearin' the jacket right now!"
52978,Ned Flanders,"no, sirree, we'd be happy as hens to ha--"
53206,Ned Flanders,"homer, why don't we go make the girls some custom omelettes?"
52849,Ned Flanders,"""'zounds"" is a renaissance english word, short for ""god's wounds."" but uh, ""smite-ly,"" that's pure flanders!"
52857,Ned Flanders,"bringing in the sheaves, bringing in... oh my lord!! something horrible has happened!"
53171,Ned Flanders,"how 'bout it, homer? will you teach me the secret of your intoxicating lust for life?"
54427,Ned Flanders,"my prayers have been answered! well actually, just this one."
52830,Ned Flanders,"well, howdilly doodilly neighbors. shouldn't you be in your sheltereenees by now?"
53959,Ned Flanders,"please, lord, grant me the power to psychologically torture them into loving you."
52851,Ned Flanders,"all right, i'd like to call this meeting of the pta to or-diddly-order and let's see if we can't put an end to this strike fuss, huh? mrs. krabappel, why don't you begin?"
54246,Ned Flanders,"edna, you're a very beautiful woman... but i'm a little uh, you know... uncomfortable with premarital sex."
54463,Ned Flanders,children... perhaps it's time that i explain the true meaning of christmas.
53344,Ned Flanders,"okay, here goes nothin'."
54472,Ned Flanders,sure do miss that laugh.
52985,Ned Flanders,"reverend lovejoy, with all that's happened to us today -- uh, i... i kinda feel like job."
52940,Ned Flanders,know anything about water safety?
53576,Ned Flanders,"homer, please don't sue the church. i'm asking you as your friend and neighbor."
54101,Ned Flanders,"no, it's angels food with chocolate on top."
53006,Ned Flanders,i attacked all my friends and neighbors just for trying to help me. i'd like to commit myself.
53118,Ned Flanders,i don't think that's gonna do it.
53404,Ned Flanders,i really hate to be a snitch.
53575,Ned Flanders,"well, whatever i've got i owe to hard work, honest living, and flossing my teeth, tail and toes. plus a little prayer now and then."
54041,Ned Flanders,really? not married? and you were bicycling two abreast?
54287,Ned Flanders,"yes, lord."
54494,Ned Flanders,"oh, homer! unto us this day, a neighbor is born! but why?"
53264,Ned Flanders,"ho-ho-ho! why bother, baby? one smoke detector's enough for mad dog. now let's hit the sack."
52970,Ned Flanders,ach! it was that darn recording again!
54087,Ned Flanders,folks...
54225,Ned Flanders,"i didn't do diddily, and certainly not squat!"
52903,Ned Flanders,"well, i expect that type of language at denny's, but not here."
53304,Ned Flanders,"uh, listen, homer, we'd love to help you, but we're not really set up for lepers."
53650,Ned Flanders,i'm sorry.
53612,Ned Flanders,"oh now, if someone took the time to press that little button, this is the least i can do."
53774,Ned Flanders,"oh, i-i guess you'd rather see a film about a liberal european wizard school, or the latest sexcapade of miss ashley judd!"
52983,Ned Flanders,"y'know, it's kinda funny. the only thing that survived the storm were the family tombstones. they're all we have left."
53014,Ned Flanders,it sure did-diddly-id.
53131,Ned Flanders,"whoa! january first! better get goin' on those taxes, neddy!"
52711,Ned Flanders,"okay, now, everybody take out your junior campers pocketknives..."
54000,Ned Flanders,"well... i could use money. but you have to promise me something, homer."
53769,Ned Flanders,"reverend, thanks for turnin' the church into a he-without-cineplex."
54150,Ned Flanders,"y'know, homer, you might really benefit from opening your heart to the spirituality of this place. please, neighbor?"
53542,Ned Flanders,that's better.
54010,Ned Flanders,i like their christian cover band: a.d.-b.c.! kindly deeds / done for free / kindly deeds
54288,Ned Flanders,really?
54401,Ned Flanders,neither canonical nor comical.
52632,Ned Flanders,the door's frozen shut... and it's the only way out!
54237,Ned Flanders,"...y'know, i wouldn't mind homer lying naked in his hammock, but does he have to string it up higher than the fence line?"
53998,Ned Flanders,what the?
53961,Ned Flanders,springfield is rife with the seven deadly sins! starting with... gluttony!
52953,Ned Flanders,'bye-diddly-i.
53409,Ned Flanders,ow! ow!
54556,Ned Flanders,there you go.
52835,Ned Flanders,"no, sweetheart, you stay here because--"
54107,Ned Flanders,then i give 'em the squeak test and into the dishwasher they go!
52548,Ned Flanders,"well, i know it's a little risky and it's gonna be a lot of hard work, but gosh darn it, it's gonna be a lot of fun, too."
53278,Ned Flanders,"ooo, better pick up the pace."
53622,Ned Flanders,"so anyway, uh, your movie's wrapping up soon. i guess you'll be headin' out on the first bus to the airport. if you ride with a friend, you can save twenty bucks!"
54420,Ned Flanders,what? why?!
53790,Ned Flanders,"all right, neighbor, i'll baby-sit."
53030,Ned Flanders,"sure, buddy, i'd be happy to..."
53720,Ned Flanders,what the family circus? a second premonition came to fruition.
54374,Ned Flanders,here it is. the holy ooze.
52789,Ned Flanders,okilly-dokilly.
53784,Ned Flanders,"sorry, homer. you'll have to call me a ray-theist, 'cause i don't believe i saw him."
53421,Ned Flanders,"uh, uh, huh, oh, hey, rachel. w-well what do you know? we both like plain vanilla with nothing on it."
53037,Ned Flanders,"homer, i've got a fozzie of a bear of a problem. y'know, maude and her mother were visiting tyre and sidon, the twin cities of the holy land. they must've kneeled in the wrong place and prayed to the wrong god, because, well, they're being held prisoner by militants of some sort."
53324,Ned Flanders,"hey, that's my sprinkler."
53511,Ned Flanders,homer!
53042,Ned Flanders,"lisa, ned flanders. you available tonight?"
53828,Ned Flanders,"well, that is true. in fact--"
54025,Ned Flanders,not interested.
52918,Ned Flanders,"so if you're looking for a half bag of charcoal briquettes, or an artificial christmas tree -- trunk only, c'mon over to the hibbert table. pronto."
53222,Ned Flanders,i suppose i do take maude for granted.
52934,Ned Flanders,"better get the ol' snow shovel back from homer, huh?"
53518,Ned Flanders,"oh, that's not you talkin'. that's the honey-mustard dressing!"
54528,Ned Flanders,i feel terrible.
53595,Ned Flanders,"why, you are gorgeous."
54433,Ned Flanders,"how long has it been since we prayed together, neighbor?"
52600,Ned Flanders,is this all he watches?
53425,Ned Flanders,"i can hear her, homer."
53111,Ned Flanders,this is the murder house?!
53695,Ned Flanders,stop!
53140,Ned Flanders,who can?
53328,Ned Flanders,"i just keep replaying the whole thing in my head. i can't believe my last words to maude were ""no foot-longs."""
54133,Ned Flanders,"homer simpson! you are the most infuriating, netflix-d.v.d.-burgling, barbecue-not-putting-out..."
54321,Ned Flanders,"hidilly-ho, dream team!"
52666,Ned Flanders,"if i could give you my heart, homer, i would."
53084,Ned Flanders,"uh-huh. half a brain, huh? well, you know what? it sounds like you just volunteered!"
53073,Ned Flanders,"well, actually, lisa, these balls are synthetic."
53166,Ned Flanders,in the bathroom. not trimmin' my mustache. whaddaya think? do i remind you of troubled troubadour david crosby?
53015,Ned Flanders,"well, howdy, homer!"
53265,Ned Flanders,check it out! mad dog's on fire!
53891,Ned Flanders,"roddy, get down! you're gonna fall!"
52766,Ned Flanders,"homer, maybe you'd have had more fun at moe's tonight."
52976,Ned Flanders,"well, need some help there? you know, maybe you folks should come over and hunker in our bunker."
54016,Ned Flanders,"oh, kitten whiskers!"
52729,Ned Flanders,"wrong, we're saved! sea gulls always stay near land. they only go out to sea to die."
53756,Ned Flanders,"hello, neighborino to the north. i sure like the cut of your gibberish."
52758,Ned Flanders,"heydilly ho, window buddy. just wonderin' if you'd like to come over and give the new pool table a whirl."
53283,Ned Flanders,they can be a handful... of joy.
53182,Ned Flanders,"oh, gee, homer, this all looks so garish."
53910,Ned Flanders,we want you to teach alternative theories to darwinian evolution.
54451,Ned Flanders,all right! a chance to make a new friend!
53405,Ned Flanders,"well, in that case... my neighbor homer released a radioactive ape in my house. it's ah, it's taken over the whole top floor."
53528,Ned Flanders,"homer, i-i-it's me, ned."
54200,Ned Flanders,but neighbor... why did you have to do this? i've tattled this town into a paradise!
54392,Ned Flanders,"now, you know we don't discuss politics at the table!"
52972,Ned Flanders,dang!
52869,Ned Flanders,"heydilly-ho! welcome to your new home, neglect-areenos!"
52641,Ned Flanders,help! help!
52800,Ned Flanders,"well, i may go a little bit easy on the old hickory dickory stick, but that's, that's because my dad was so hard on me when i was a boy."
52895,Ned Flanders,looks like i'm gonna have to baptize you myself.
53706,Ned Flanders,"dear lord, please make homer's blows precise and deadly with a minimum of pain. oh, and forgive me for those impure thoughts i had about the girl on the raisin box."
53825,Ned Flanders,you know what? i'm not gonna. my mustache has the right to life -- it's my body and my choice!
53381,Ned Flanders,"oh, no, homer, remember? maudie got called up to heaven."
52626,Ned Flanders,you're a dame and i'm a fella.
54442,Ned Flanders,yes.
53591,Ned Flanders,"form of business? sole proprietorship. ""owner's marital status?"" happily married... to a dead woman."
52562,Ned Flanders,"hey, i'm flexible! you don't have to pay all at once. i'll be here all night if you change your mind."
53410,Ned Flanders,"hey, you got a tennis court."
54097,Ned Flanders,parson! parson! give us a quick official church position on family.
54398,Ned Flanders,"marge, i've been racked with guilt and pain... my moustache fell out! this is a clip-on!"
53152,Ned Flanders,"thanks for the tip, homer."
54577,Ned Flanders,"mmm mm, sounds terriff!"
54202,Ned Flanders,"i never wanted to turn into big brother. i just wanted to be little sister, tattlin' on everyone so the town would be a nicer place."
53842,Ned Flanders,he's right. can't we all get together and concentrate on our real enemies: monogamous gays and stem cells?
52628,Ned Flanders,i'm trying... i'm trying...
53504,Ned Flanders,wow.
53638,Ned Flanders,"sara, i love ya, but i get the feeling you're just... not a ned-head tonight. is something wrong?"
54552,Ned Flanders,"you know, simpson, you're starting to annoy me."
52850,Ned Flanders,"oh, we sure could use a pooch to guard the flock at the flanderosa."
53012,Ned Flanders,i can't believe i was such a terror.
53789,Ned Flanders,"oh, sorry, but i promised to rewind videotapes for the poor."
53597,Ned Flanders,i'm as real as the nose on your face.
53184,Ned Flanders,"no, i got it."
52762,Ned Flanders,wait a second. you're the man at the hospital who reads to sick children.
53580,Ned Flanders,"and rev, you'll be bunkin' with me!"
53979,Ned Flanders,"listen sheriff, i can help you take down bonnie and clyde."
52923,Ned Flanders,"now, folks, nothin' spells fun like rhinestones on a dungaree jacket!"
54500,Ned Flanders,she's right. we thought we could enter the den of sin and emerge unscathed. but we were scathed! those free ginger ales at the casino... i didn't declare them on my taxes!
53707,Ned Flanders,huh?
52644,Ned Flanders,"well, howdy strangers! what can i do ya for?"
54268,Ned Flanders,no. just plain neighbor.
52623,Ned Flanders,all i want is one embrace.
54382,Ned Flanders,mind if i come over and sweeten your greetin'. sweeten your greetin'! sweeten your greetin'!
54476,Ned Flanders,you'll only taste the spoon!
53239,Ned Flanders,you heard me.
52833,Ned Flanders,"i may regret this when our air runs out and we can't whistle or stay alive, but oh, what the hey..."
54124,Ned Flanders,i play that fight over in my mind a thousand times a day.
53144,Ned Flanders,bingo.
53117,Ned Flanders,"oh-ho-ho. no problem, marge. oh."
52554,Ned Flanders,"now, you put that money away. that was an accident."
53499,Ned Flanders,"yeah, b-but my hands are up."
53367,Ned Flanders,"bart, you're never gonna to grow up if i keep bailing you out."
53523,Ned Flanders,well... i don't have one from you!
52734,Ned Flanders,"you know, homer, this cheese doodle is our last morsel of food."
52611,Ned Flanders,... so recycling is our way of giving mother earth a great big hug.
52712,Ned Flanders,"oop, sorry, bart, that's a neddy no-no. you're not allowed to handle a pocketknife 'til you read this booklet on knife safety and pass a test."
52662,Ned Flanders,"and since we're returning your second born, do you think you could see your way to returning my tv tr..."
53957,Ned Flanders,welcome to eternal darnation!
54579,Ned Flanders,"i should box your ears you, you, you... you sneaky pete!"
53245,Ned Flanders,i said homer!
53941,Ned Flanders,"sixty minutes -- morley safer has questionable pants fold -- ""the l word"" -- used the ""l"" word."
53967,Ned Flanders,greed!
54249,Ned Flanders,"well, a little nibble won't hurt your appetite."
52820,Ned Flanders,"huh? well, now that i can't explain."
53005,Ned Flanders,"homer, you are the worst human being i have ever met."
53626,Ned Flanders,noooo!
54549,Ned Flanders,"oh, i'm a chicken, am i?"
54333,Ned Flanders,"no atheist blood, please."
52700,Ned Flanders,"oh, dear lord!"
54422,Ned Flanders,"now, there's no need to..."
53681,Ned Flanders,"one problem at a time, boy."
52707,Ned Flanders,"hey now, marge. let's not ""should"" this fella to death."
53340,Ned Flanders,i'm just a q without a u.
52890,Ned Flanders,"well, guess! book of revelations... fire-breathing lion's head... tail made out of snakes... who else is it gonna be?!"
53969,Ned Flanders,and this is where sinners spend all of eternity!
52854,Ned Flanders,"no, no. the pta has not disbanded."
54344,Ned Flanders,this could go late -- we haven't even ordered pizzas and pop yet. can you handle rod and todd's parent-teacher conference for me?
54075,Ned Flanders,let's see what else is on.
53066,Ned Flanders,"ho-ho-ho, you betcha. team sports'll keep you away from temptations like rock music and girls."
54253,Ned Flanders,"homer, could you stop throwin' balls over my fence?"
53836,Ned Flanders,"well, you've gotta take it back!"
54088,Ned Flanders,i'm afraid you can't live here.
53366,Ned Flanders,yeah. just answer me this: are you holding your mooching sack?
54455,Ned Flanders,that's not a prayer!
52723,Ned Flanders,"whoa, nelly!"
53036,Ned Flanders,"homer, i can honestly say that was the best episode of impy and chimpy i've ever seen."
52889,Ned Flanders,"no, son, we've got to let bart and lisa get one. c'mon, this one's easy."
53533,Ned Flanders,"well, i know he's wishin' you'd sign his petition...to re-criminalize medicinal marijuana."
53617,Ned Flanders,mm-hmm. i haven't felt this good since we stole the 2000 election.
53263,Ned Flanders,"now for a regular cigarette, to make the night complete. oh! man, that's good."
52878,Ned Flanders,"c'mon, you gloomy gusses. who's up for a big bowl of non-fat ice milk?"
52538,Ned Flanders,"you are a picture and a half! well -- hee hee! -- if you're finished by tomorrow, come on over and strap on the feed bag. we're gonna fire up old propane elaine and put the heat to the meat! nummy nummy num!"
53303,Ned Flanders,"oh, those poor souls. what's the christian thing to do?"
54219,Ned Flanders,"oh, don't be scared, boys. that's just the angels bowling."
54349,Ned Flanders,"chillax?! young man, in the flanders house, we speak the king's diddily."
53731,Ned Flanders,"i was supposed to shoot you, but i didn't! i changed the future!"
53852,Ned Flanders,ow! my flander-doodles!
53442,Ned Flanders,"yeah, just a little shocked. what's that? some kinda sorting machine?"
53076,Ned Flanders,"all right, wildcats! are you ready to give 110 per cent, take it one game at a time, and go the whole nine yards?"
54492,Ned Flanders,"ah, just snowflakes on my mustache."
53127,Ned Flanders,"no-ho-ho, it's true! maude and i sell religious hook rugs over the internet."
53428,Ned Flanders,"now wait just a maude-gone minute, here. i'm through living in the past, and you can see for yourself."
52897,Ned Flanders,today we write a new page in the flanders family bible.
52856,Ned Flanders,"let's see. ""replace teachers with super-intelligent cyborgs. or, if cyborgs aren't invented yet, use people from the neighborhood."""
54163,Ned Flanders,banned for life?
52736,Ned Flanders,"that's what you're smelling, homer! oh, if it weren't for this blasted fog, we'd be saved!"
53003,Ned Flanders,"oh yeah, the clown. the only one of you buffoons who doesn't make me laugh. and as for you -- i don't know you, but i'm sure you're a jerk."
52720,Ned Flanders,"well, homer, looks like we're boat buddies, huh? want me to zinc your sniffer?"
53804,Ned Flanders,"well, thank you."
54019,Ned Flanders,"homer, no! you promised... everything was supposed to be by the book!"
52879,Ned Flanders,"nighty night, my sweet li'l foundling-a-dings."
54240,Ned Flanders,"and you're a former mrs. so, uh... where's your husband buried?"
52774,Ned Flanders,i -- i think i hate homer simpson.
53070,Ned Flanders,"and, uh, bart, you'll be a tackle."
52994,Ned Flanders,"uh-huh. ooh, looks like a loose nail."
53657,Ned Flanders,i walked right into that one.
53141,Ned Flanders,"dear lord, please take mr. bunny up to heaven."
53966,Ned Flanders,lust!
52870,Ned Flanders,mmm-hmm. all we want to do is give you kids a good home until they get their act together.
53029,Ned Flanders,"we'll see, son. we'll see."
54481,Ned Flanders,say no more.
53282,Ned Flanders,"we-ell, morning, apu. how are the little blessings?"
53915,Ned Flanders,"will you shut your yap, ya big monkey-faced gorilla!!!"
52900,Ned Flanders,"wait, homer. what did you just say?"
52760,Ned Flanders,"now, boys, mr. simpson is the guest. he gets to decide what to watch."
53610,Ned Flanders,heaven's gate! i'm gonna be tastin' you on my mustache for a week.
53046,Ned Flanders,"...well, i... i think i may be coveting my own wife..."
53670,Ned Flanders,scared of what? all the funny camp songs we're gonna sing? we'll be safe inside our fortress when they come / we'll be safe from creeps and killers when they come / unless they have a blowtorch / or a poison gas injector / then i don't know what'll happen when they come!
53564,Ned Flanders,"shop o' the mornin', homer! just call me ""mall"" flanders."
53290,Ned Flanders,n-no... you see...
53974,Ned Flanders,what're we gonna do? we can't not vote. nobody does that!
54260,Ned Flanders,"yeah, let me guess. you're probably gonna do something boneheaded like try to talk me outta seein' edna."
54407,Ned Flanders,see you in eight hours!
54223,Ned Flanders,"well, maybe your kids didn't."
54190,Ned Flanders,tushie!
53256,Ned Flanders,"oh-ho-ho, we picked those up cheap. they were evidence in a murder trial!"
53346,Ned Flanders,"mmm. dinner was delicious, edna, but i can't shake the feeling that you're just using me to get principal skinner jealous."
54230,Ned Flanders,did a volcano erupt in candyland? 'cause i just caught me a flyin' red hot!
53149,Ned Flanders,it was people. people soiled our green!
52706,Ned Flanders,"ooh, careful there, marge! almost nicked me!"
53680,Ned Flanders,"well, maybe just a tad, todd."
53252,Ned Flanders,everything but the opinion page! i don't need to be told what to think... by anyone living!
53311,Ned Flanders,"yes, son."
53795,Ned Flanders,how could this have... oh.
53556,Ned Flanders,"okay, here's my amex."
52652,Ned Flanders,"buenos dias, neighboritos. the handle's flanders, but my friends call me ned."
53741,Ned Flanders,must... kill... best friend.
53777,Ned Flanders,wait a minute -- you've got a medium and i've got a message. maybe god brought us together for a reason.
53440,Ned Flanders,always do.
53288,Ned Flanders,my rumpus room with the new bumper pool table.
54565,Ned Flanders,"well, homer, our kids showed us something today, huh? by working together, we can both be winners. thank heaven neither of us has to go through with that silly wager. put 'er there, pal."
53388,Ned Flanders,i never had a snowplow business.
54312,Ned Flanders,"sure is! that's why after homer accidentally killed edna, i married maude's ghost!"
53316,Ned Flanders,no foot-longs!
52668,Ned Flanders,monorail.
53628,Ned Flanders,noooo!
54478,Ned Flanders,"i learned that left is called ""port""!"
54032,Ned Flanders,"i like you too, but you broke the law. so i've got to bring you in."
53750,Ned Flanders,"help me out, homer. my little roddy needs his insulin. breaks my heart to watch him jones-diddly-ownsing."
54236,Ned Flanders,"homer? yeah, he's the peanut in your popcorn... lots of fun... i guess. so, what say we have lunch?"
52713,Ned Flanders,"here you go, your rubber training knife. you've attained the rank of pussy willow."
53935,Ned Flanders,"this is it, boys -- one more out and we go to the championship game. let's do it for groundskeeper willie... who made me this beautiful black bicep warmer!"
52689,Ned Flanders,"you know, reverend, this really isn't a hymn."
52594,Ned Flanders,"all right, that's it, young man. no bible stories for you tonight."
54198,Ned Flanders,de-meat those feet!
54021,Ned Flanders,"you know, if you take your foot off the accelerator going downhill, you wouldn't use so much gas."
53537,Ned Flanders,"doo-da, doo-da..."
52545,Ned Flanders,"well sir, like one out of every nine americans, i'm left-handed. and let me tell you, it ain't all peaches and cream. your writing gets smeared. lord help you if you want to drive a standard transmission."
53462,Ned Flanders,"morning, kent. our volunteers have done an amazing job getting the park ready here. we're gonna show springfield that faith and devotion are the wildest thrill rides of all."
53062,Ned Flanders,uh... homer?
53909,Ned Flanders,they're telling people we're descended from a pack of apes. even though there's nothing about it in the bible!
52868,Ned Flanders,"uh, i'd like to hear from sideshow mel."
53770,Ned Flanders,"boys, i just talked to god. he's vacuuming heaven to get it ready for when dead people show up. and he'd like you both to render a sacrifice."
53234,Ned Flanders,"well, i'd better skedaddle. oh, there's one more weensy little thing -- you see that tree over there?"
53642,Ned Flanders,"well, i'm not sure i want to do it. i mean ""who'll buy the cow when you get the milk for free?"" you know, the cow being me."
52646,Ned Flanders,"howdy-do, neighbor! good pipe weather. thought i'd fire up the briar."
54076,Ned Flanders,"oh, this is good."
53730,Ned Flanders,you leave me no choice!
54343,Ned Flanders,"i'm sorry honey, but i'm stuck in this meeting of the springfield l.g.b.t. the left-gifted, bidextrous, and transhanded community. we're tryin' to decide on the theme for our ""left is right"" parade."
53185,Ned Flanders,"if he's not careful, his scooter could roll right down that ramp."
52698,Ned Flanders,howdy gents. what can i diddily do you for?
53310,Ned Flanders,"oh-ho, true enough. but, uh, did you have to salt the earth so nothing would ever grow again?"
52696,Ned Flanders,isn't that nice?
54050,Ned Flanders,"oh, what better way to celebrate our wedding night than by keeping an unmarried couple apart?"
52612,Ned Flanders,yes?
52811,Ned Flanders,i'm a murdiddly-erdiler.
53031,Ned Flanders,...help out. what can i do-diddily-do...diddily-doodily-diddily-hoobily-hobbily-hibbily-gooble-gobble-gooble-gooble-gabba-gabba-hey?
54351,Ned Flanders,"fine, i guess. thanks for loaning me your pajamas, homer. and marge, thank you for those helpful chip bag clips."
53993,Ned Flanders,"yep, i'm just replacing the front window at my store, which was broken in the riot."
53732,Ned Flanders,what have i done? i've changed the future for the worse.
53490,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer, i need to ask ya a favor. my baby sitter canceled and i got tickets to a christian rock concert."
53725,Ned Flanders,country parmesan.
53861,Ned Flanders,...and lilac and gold and chocolate and mauve / and cream and crimson and silver and rose / and azure and lemon and russet and grey...
54007,Ned Flanders,"homer, take the taser out of your pants."
52624,Ned Flanders,"here, marge, let me. hate to be an armchair blanche, but i always gave it one of these..."
53242,Ned Flanders,"and after i created my fingers to the bone for you i... my unicorn! oh, what have they done to you, gary?"
53261,Ned Flanders,dang! i should've brought the camera.
53053,Ned Flanders,boys... there's a call here for you...
54403,Ned Flanders,that's the plug for the light!
53901,Ned Flanders,"tell you what -- if we turn around, it'll feel like we're at the front of the line!"
52853,Ned Flanders,"oh, this is a dilly of a pickle."
54559,Ned Flanders,"no, you will."
53506,Ned Flanders,"greetings from nedily space center on cape flandaveral. we noticed your sky-ro-technics and thought we'd join in. ooh, looks like a perfect landing!"
52852,Ned Flanders,"well, i guess this is a case where we'll have to agree to disagree."
54179,Ned Flanders,i've gone from lookie-loo to talkie-too.
54086,Ned Flanders,"oh, that's just a family... who used to... make my life, uh... interesting."
53514,Ned Flanders,"oh, we've got a real shower upstairs."
53093,Ned Flanders,"we've come for the angel, homer. it's not safe with the unbeliever."
54037,Ned Flanders,"howdy-do, strangers! hop on in before you become a couple runneth over!"
54297,Ned Flanders,"oh, for cryin' out loud!"
54281,Ned Flanders,"all these years i thought murder was a sin. then, i got new instructions from the good lord himself, through my bible: in his favorite language -- english."
53782,Ned Flanders,yes... but my mower can't get much lower!
53880,Ned Flanders,"and so we don't have another disaster, you crawl up those steps!"
54013,Ned Flanders,hm. i've never seen anyone eat pizza like that.
54317,Ned Flanders,bedbugs? just why is there a bed in city hall?
53705,Ned Flanders,"well, he's got me there."
52945,Ned Flanders,"well, now realistically, homer, i've lived here some 30-odd years. this is the first and only bear i've ever seen."
53843,Ned Flanders,my pleasure.
54409,Ned Flanders,no -- not surf and murph!
52977,Ned Flanders,"oh, it'll be fun. we're gonna go through our old cancelled checks and receipts and give ourselves an audit. make sure we don't owe anything extra."
54541,Ned Flanders,"all right! this will be fun! oh, say, you looked like you were having a little trouble there."
54447,Ned Flanders,god doesn't need twitter to reach people. he uses leprosy and plagues.
52884,Ned Flanders,which version shall it be?
54216,Ned Flanders,"in the last game, our shortstop hit a long foul ball, but the umpire called it a homerun... and i let it go without saying a word. i just don't like the monster i've become."
54227,Ned Flanders,"oh, isn't that a cute little choo-choo..."
53472,Ned Flanders,whoa! where's everyone going? what's wrong?
53313,Ned Flanders,"hi-diddly-ho, pedal-to-the-metal-o-philes!"
52814,Ned Flanders,mary had a little lamb / little lamb / little lamb...
53248,Ned Flanders,"maude, it's a miracle! the lord has drowned the wicked and spared the righteous!"
52690,Ned Flanders,oh my stars!
52957,Ned Flanders,"if it's clear and yellow, you've got juice there, fellow! if it's tangy and brown, you're in cider town! now there's two exceptions, and it gets kinda tricky here..."
54274,Ned Flanders,i guess this is gonna have to be decided by a higher power.
53851,Ned Flanders,"hi-diddly-ho! there's ""no bot"" like a robot!"
54270,Ned Flanders,maybe we should just call it a night.
53452,Ned Flanders,"now the thing is, i don't have a lot of money..."
53390,Ned Flanders,"catchy song, all right. you really wrote it?"
52744,Ned Flanders,"now, who should lead the group?"
53449,Ned Flanders,but where do you put something that big?
53450,Ned Flanders,"well, what the heck. who's ready to build an amusement park?"
53371,Ned Flanders,six months ago. you were at the funeral. you fell into the grave.
53672,Ned Flanders,oh our courts aren't fit to keep children in line. the only thing they're good for is telling women what to do with their bodies. what these boys need is adult supervision.
54569,Ned Flanders,"oh my, lisa was wonderful. she certainly's come a long way with her fingering."
54178,Ned Flanders,maybe. but i feel a little like i'm the tom voyeur to these huckleberry sinners.
53992,Ned Flanders,bullet-proof glass.
53569,Ned Flanders,you betcha. it's a nice break from the male sports i usually watch.
53908,Ned Flanders,stop praying to that stork!
53972,Ned Flanders,"i had to -- i heard a hubbub, bub."
54258,Ned Flanders,"i don't wanna come here. last time i did, someone slipped me a mickey and wrote ""churchy joe"" on my face."
53199,Ned Flanders,"look at this place! we must have really painted the town last night. i have a pounding headache, my mouth tastes like vomit, and i don't remember a thing!"
53510,Ned Flanders,"well, christmas is coming, huh?"
53616,Ned Flanders,"well, that's uh, very interesting..."
53138,Ned Flanders,"uh, listen homer, ah, hate to be a fussy freddy and all, but maude's folks are here and, ah, they're a tad touchy about odors..."
54371,Ned Flanders,homer! homer! it's a miracle!
53853,Ned Flanders,please change me back! this bumble bee has developed an unhealthy obsession with me.
53554,Ned Flanders,"say homer, i was, uh, i was wondering if i could borrow that chainsaw you, uh, stole from me."
53008,Ned Flanders,noooooooooooo!
53364,Ned Flanders,"ah yeah, i never shoulda had that trendy laser surgery. it was great at first, but you know, at the ten-year mark, your eyes fall out."
53013,Ned Flanders,"well, i'll be darn-diddly-arned."
54164,Ned Flanders,"homer, do you know why i'm a christian?"
52888,Ned Flanders,well...
52702,Ned Flanders,"aww, isn't that cute? he's trying to claw my eyes out."
53135,Ned Flanders,get your taxes out of the way?
53078,Ned Flanders,"yeah. thanks for the tip, homer..."
54285,Ned Flanders,"heavenly father, i..."
54272,Ned Flanders,"edna, i had a long walk with homer simpson yesterday, and as i was carrying him back home, i had a lot of time to think."
54054,Ned Flanders,"okay, here she comes! why don't you take marge for a walk, open your heart and see what pours out?"
52779,Ned Flanders,"i can't, it's a geo!"
53535,Ned Flanders,thank you so much.
53810,Ned Flanders,you soft-core sophomores took advantage of my trustful nature. and sullied the internet by putting pornography on it!
54296,Ned Flanders,could this get any worse?
53279,Ned Flanders,yeah...
53894,Ned Flanders,"lord, with you watching over me i shall feel no pain."
53219,Ned Flanders,"i don't want to be a panicky pete, but it's sunday and i haven't been to church yet."
53964,Ned Flanders,sloth!
54518,Ned Flanders,"say, that's right. this is your first visit to the flanders homestead."
52963,Ned Flanders,"well, i'm convinced. the house stays!"
53694,Ned Flanders,"well, actually, i picked up some extra cash renting out my house to a fraternity."
53232,Ned Flanders,"you got it, eve."
53697,Ned Flanders,"""and the angel said unto them, fear not: for, behold, i bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people..."
54310,Ned Flanders,sports stands for strict parental oversight rather than sports!
53962,Ned Flanders,anger!
53098,Ned Flanders,"hm. wh-when you put it that way, it does seem a bit small."
54365,Ned Flanders,"lord, you're testin' me, aren't ya?"
53384,Ned Flanders,"well, i'll just reimburse you right n-- wait a minute. this seems an awful lot like that movie, ""paper moon."""
53080,Ned Flanders,what?! what is it?!
54311,Ned Flanders,coggily-doggily.
53895,Ned Flanders,"only ten dollars to paint my curb like a common whore? well i'm happy to pay for a three-digit spray! tell you what, i'll give you another hundred if you paint my garage!"
54142,Ned Flanders,"homer, that's not why we're here. we can see the stations of the cross!"
53555,Ned Flanders,no problem! discover okay?
54473,Ned Flanders,"well, look who's back."
52825,Ned Flanders,"just relax, let the hooks do their work."
53052,Ned Flanders,"i know, but... they're on their mini-bikes and all..."
54159,Ned Flanders,that's it. i'm losin' it. i'm losin' it!
54022,Ned Flanders,"lucky jim, i'm out of the bounty hunting business."
52964,Ned Flanders,"well, we all changed our minds."
53327,Ned Flanders,"no, homer! i just need to talk."
53161,Ned Flanders,"no, no, and double-no! i haven't done any of those things, folks. you name it, i haven't done it!"

53223,Ned Flanders,"aw, gee, the man's just trying to show his wife he cares for her. how can we sabotage his labor of love?"
54188,Ned Flanders,stop gleaming that cube!
53243,Ned Flanders,"oh, shut up. you are so banished."
54355,Ned Flanders,"edna, i'm sorry and i'll say it in front of god or groundskeeper willie!"
52979,Ned Flanders,"okilly-dokilly. oo, i better go take down the manger scene. if baby jesus got loose, he could really do some damage."
52677,Ned Flanders,"okely, dokely do!"
53351,Ned Flanders,"eh, you boys can go with the simpsons. i'm not going to church today."
54361,Ned Flanders,"name's ned flanders, i've heard of you. haven't seen so much skin since shedding season on a snake farm."
53350,Ned Flanders,"lord, i never question you... but i've been wondering if your decision to take maude was, well, wrong... unless this is part of your divine plan... could you just give me some kinda sign? anything? and after all that church chocolate i bought. which, by the way, was gritty and had that white stuff on it. well, i've had it."
53889,Ned Flanders,the 'n' word!
53938,Ned Flanders,"fetch daddy's thinner, boy."
54379,Ned Flanders,"i just thought if we got together we could change the channel from ""the feud network"" to ""comity central."""
53762,Ned Flanders,"here, let me wrap this wet towel around your head to cool you off."
52654,Ned Flanders,"well, gee, i..."
52893,Ned Flanders,jeepers h. crackers! i'd better call the reverend!
54176,Ned Flanders,uh-oh.

53218,Ned Flanders,what did the aliens look like?
54498,Ned Flanders,am i hearing this right? is the church council truly considering... gambling?
53038,Ned Flanders,"well, any hoodily-doodle, the embassy says it's just a routine hostage-taking -- but i have to drive to capital city, fill out some forms to get 'em out. could you possibly watch the kids tonight?"
53212,Ned Flanders,drederick tatum!
53562,Ned Flanders,"well, cock-a-diddily-doo! what a marge-alicious way to start my flander-rific day."
52796,Ned Flanders,"well, let me just say i want to put the ""stew"" back in students."
52602,Ned Flanders,homer?
54094,Ned Flanders,"well, yes."
54485,Ned Flanders,homer! this is my freezerino.
54299,Ned Flanders,"homer, all nonsense aside, are you okalidokalaroony?"
52993,Ned Flanders,"it's wonderful. i... i... i don't know how i can possibly repay you, but if any of you ever need a favor, just look for the happiest man in springfield."
53521,Ned Flanders,hi-o-diddily-ysseus!
54338,Ned Flanders,"oh lord, please bless our blended family..."
54548,Ned Flanders,"yeah, well, i'm not a betting man."
52941,Ned Flanders,what do you need it for?
54369,Ned Flanders,asterisk-pound sign-at sign-exclamation point!
53318,Ned Flanders,"oh, thank you, apu."
54524,Ned Flanders,"oh, you know how that embarrasses me."
54491,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, our good lord, and my boys are all i've really got. all edna left me was wonderful memories and some ungraded papers, which i'm still working my way through."
53197,Ned Flanders,white wine spritzer!
53414,Ned Flanders,what the diddly-yo?!
53419,Ned Flanders,"thank you, homer."
53408,Ned Flanders,ow! now what was that for?
54154,Ned Flanders,"homer, quit playing that back."
52802,Ned Flanders,"well, cockily-doodily-doo, little buddies. let's thank the lord for another beautiful school day."
54402,Ned Flanders,not praying to superman!
53096,Ned Flanders,"well, nothing's perfect, i sure hate to make you come out here and not buy a house."
53048,Ned Flanders,"uh, i'm in some hot soup here, marge. uh, some teenagers are hanging out in front of the store. i... i think they could start slacking at any moment."
52776,Ned Flanders,"ah, uh, homer, we're gonna visit the boys' grandmother. family only. you know?"
54251,Ned Flanders,"oh, what the heck. i know it's impolite to make a move till episode twenty-five of a ken burns documentary, but you're that special."
53317,Ned Flanders,maude?
54302,Ned Flanders,what the? i've been using that around the boys!
54366,Ned Flanders,homer! is that my camera?
53262,Ned Flanders,ho-ho! what a great pot party.
52692,Ned Flanders,... 'cause the schools can't force you like they should.
54499,Ned Flanders,"why, i bet the lord is pleased as punch that we're using that dirty casino money to rebuild his temple. our mission is one hundred percent pure."
53669,Ned Flanders,the house is slightly askew! to the panic room!
53596,Ned Flanders,"i sure do. you're the most important person in the world, because you're my customer."
53630,Ned Flanders,"forgive my language, but i am one happy camper!"
54544,Ned Flanders,"hey, i like that confidence!... but i hope you're not putting too much pressure on the boy. my todd's awfully good."
54174,Ned Flanders,hot cocoa?
52578,Ned Flanders,no it's not.
54437,Ned Flanders,church!
52748,Ned Flanders,"oh golly, if that doesn't put the shaz in shazam. oh listen, what's the cash value of those tickets so i can report it on my income tax?"
53956,Ned Flanders,just get in there!
52609,Ned Flanders,"hey homer, ya know, i owe you one, buddy. no sooner had i shaved off the old cookie duster, than a lady cast me in a commercial."
54327,Ned Flanders,"dear lord, i know you see all, but trust me, you do not want to see this."
54539,Ned Flanders,"ah, just playing a little mini-golf with the todd-meister."
53753,Ned Flanders,well where's your super-team now?
54432,Ned Flanders,i'm glad the only beef between us is this burger!
54209,Ned Flanders,"glad to hear it, thank the holy spirit!"
53208,Ned Flanders,"well, do something! this is all your fault. you and your stupid program."
53494,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, i never heard a preacher use the ""m-f"" word so many times. anyway, thanks again."
53944,Ned Flanders,to: online christian soldiers... subject: televised super swear...
53614,Ned Flanders,"sir, there's no reason sara needs to do this scene in the altogether."
53380,Ned Flanders,"yeah, you know... magic, fortune telling, oriental cooking..."
54079,Ned Flanders,"when the month is up, i want you out!"
53492,Ned Flanders,would you mind watching the kids? i'm kinda in a pickle here.
53059,Ned Flanders,"oh, oh, thank the lord! he's truly watching over--"
52669,Ned Flanders,"hey homie, i can see your doodle!"
53742,Ned Flanders,"homer, fall backward!"
52794,Ned Flanders,but i thought it might break the ice if we had a little q and a.
52695,Ned Flanders,toodledy-doo!
52822,Ned Flanders,"hidilly ho, slave-a-reenos."
53949,Ned Flanders,okily-dokily!
53656,Ned Flanders,"ooh, that's quite a thing-a-ma-jigsaw. but it looks like you're missin' a piece."
53917,Ned Flanders,"let's go, boys. your poor old popsicle's been licked."
53864,Ned Flanders,"hey marge, i don't i don't really want a computer. you know all those complete strangers googling each other. makes my flesh crawl."
53685,Ned Flanders,wha?
53553,Ned Flanders,maude! you still look as pretty as the day i buried you.
52586,Ned Flanders,okely-dokely.
53763,Ned Flanders,one hundred dollars and fifty cents!
54298,Ned Flanders,"well, looks like it's time for another ""'end of the walk' talk with homer and ned."" tonight's topic: ""the niceness of the evening."""
54111,Ned Flanders,"marge, that dinner was a winner! what's for dessert?"
52859,Ned Flanders,yeah.
52558,Ned Flanders,"oh, right as rain. or, as we say around here, left as rain."
52581,Ned Flanders,"oh, homer, there's no point..."
53609,Ned Flanders,huh.
54265,Ned Flanders,joey kramer? the drummer from aerosmith?
54504,Ned Flanders,"ow. oh, simpson, it's you."
53491,Ned Flanders,"it's gonna be one wholesome evening. so, do you think marge could take care of rowdy roddy and typhoon todd?"
54377,Ned Flanders,don't eat the miracle!
53378,Ned Flanders,"oh, my goodness!"
53172,Ned Flanders,stop that! will you help me or not?
53799,Ned Flanders,"well, i'd love to help you out, but you do have to be over eighteen."
53594,Ned Flanders,do i! no i don't. but i can have 'em here by tuesday.
52638,Ned Flanders,"dear lord, may your loving hand guide homer to the mattress square and true."
54009,Ned Flanders,"homer, i don't think we have the same musical tastes."
54507,Ned Flanders,"well, happy holidays, simpson."
53696,Ned Flanders,"friends, what homer did was wrong. but i've been thinking -- maybe i was just as wrong to give you those gifts."
53724,Ned Flanders,"uh, you die eating a submarine sandwich."
52709,Ned Flanders,"now, just breathe into him every three seconds. make sure you form a tight seal around his mouth."
53930,Ned Flanders,"he's the kindest, sweetest most generous man ever to drive through my living room."
53984,Ned Flanders,okily dokily!
52967,Ned Flanders,"oo, that's a noodle scratcher."
54557,Ned Flanders,"good gravy, what have i done?"
53231,Ned Flanders,"oh-ho-ho-ho, please. you're gonna give me a swelled head. i just stopped by to see if you needed anything."
53888,Ned Flanders,"well, we're gonna do what every kid your age likes to do: look at bread."
52912,Ned Flanders,"you have our deepest condol-diddly-olences. i'm sorry. i'm just nervous, i didn't mean any disrespect."
54125,Ned Flanders,what about sodom and gomorrah?
53181,Ned Flanders,"thanks, buddy."
53147,Ned Flanders,"hm, maybe there is something in there."
52746,Ned Flanders,hidilly ho!
52566,Ned Flanders,"oh, homer, be reasonable."
53396,Ned Flanders,"homer, that's not how it..."
52599,Ned Flanders,but reverend...
52618,Ned Flanders,"oh, indeedily-doodily. i've even been in ""streetcar"" once before. i played blanche dubois! hmmm huh. just part of the fun of going to an all-male school."
54530,Ned Flanders,and then i turn into a snarling beast. talk about flunking the old turn-the-other-cheek test!
53691,Ned Flanders,"i said ""man,"" not ""man-god."" keep your pants on."
53055,Ned Flanders,"oh, i can't see the name of the station... but the gas costs one forty-nine and eight tenths."
53712,Ned Flanders,"oh, thank god. you're finally fighting your demons."
52535,Ned Flanders,well...
54081,Ned Flanders,"uh, say, ""jesus,"" what was the name of the son of zachariah?"
54291,Ned Flanders,i'm gonna kill you!
53713,Ned Flanders,"well, that's good too, i guess."
54567,Ned Flanders,"but... neither, i mean we're both... i mean, you have to do it too."
52553,Ned Flanders,"oh, a little pokey, but things are gonna pick up."
54027,Ned Flanders,"you jumped bail, homer. i gotta bring you in."
53885,Ned Flanders,i don't want you watching my boys ever again!
54149,Ned Flanders,bleh.
53717,Ned Flanders,concussion... diddily... hemorrhage... doodily... injury... bodily...
54357,Ned Flanders,my moustache / is bristly / my letters / are epistly / and i don't wanna / mislead you / i like to hug and kissly--
53744,Ned Flanders,i just told the natives they were havin' sex the wrong way!
53950,Ned Flanders,"top of the mornin', tow-mer!"
53531,Ned Flanders,i guess that could be arranged.
54438,Ned Flanders,it's the parson!
54440,Ned Flanders,"i don't understand that on any level, but yes."
54248,Ned Flanders,"but i think if we hold off for a while, you'll find i'm well worth the wait. like a mild cheddar i get tangy when i'm sittin' on the shelf."
54060,Ned Flanders,"well, homer, maybe i could use a break from the ol' weed 'n' feed."
53933,Ned Flanders,why don't you put this box by your phone so you don't call the number by accident.
53373,Ned Flanders,"hey, uh, careful, boys. that arch is lookin' a little romanesque."
53180,Ned Flanders,"ooh, it's goin' on eight-thirty. i'd better call maude and tell her where i am."
53975,Ned Flanders,"hey, can i give you folks a lift?"
53169,Ned Flanders,"here, this may sound just a teensy bit insane in the ol' membrane, homer. but i, i was wondering if you could show me how to have some fun."
53356,Ned Flanders,ohhhhh.
54408,Ned Flanders,was this always waitin' for me or was it recently thrown together? that's what i wanna know.
53266,Ned Flanders,"ha! ha! ha! that's for clydes, baby. a little fire can't hurt you."
53088,Ned Flanders,"oh, we can work this out, friends. in the spirit of sharing, what say we simply place the sacred bones in--"
52961,Ned Flanders,"uh, it's an angry mob, ma'am. could you step outside for a twinkle while we knock down your house?"
53532,Ned Flanders,...the grace of the lord jesus be with god's people. the end.
53860,Ned Flanders,how i love my coat of many colors / it was red and yellow and green and brown / and scarlet and black and ochre and peach / and ruby and olive and violet and fawn...
53565,Ned Flanders,you betcha! this kiosk sells personalized movies. i had one made starring little rod.
53235,Ned Flanders,"i hate to be a bossy betty, but i have to forbid you to eat its fruit."
53515,Ned Flanders,me and the boys made you breakfast in bed. it's the best darn diddly way to start your first flanders day!
53751,Ned Flanders,i don't claim to be the perfect neighbor...
53285,Ned Flanders,... can't put a price on a miracle...
54139,Ned Flanders,"y'know, our bible study group is going to the holy land next month. i'd like you and your family to come as my guests."
53021,Ned Flanders,"well, maybe a few of them do. back east."
53159,Ned Flanders,"l-listen, folks, there's no magic formula. i just follow the three c's: clean living, chewing thoroughly, and a daily dose of vitamin church."
53791,Ned Flanders,"yeah, so i can't see my own shrinky dink."
53271,Ned Flanders,"""discotheques,"" ""frat houses,"" ""malibu."" nothing about satellite fires!"
52627,Ned Flanders,all i want is one embrace.
52743,Ned Flanders,"welcome, neighbors... since the police can't seem to get off their dufferoonies to do something about this burglarino, i think it's time we start our own neighborhood watch... arooni!"
54172,Ned Flanders,you'd probably get a better deal at a mall back home.
54336,Ned Flanders,"no, but i'm sure newt gingrich wouldn't steer us wrong."
53132,Ned Flanders,"hmmm. let's see, cash-register ink. well, sir, that's a business expense, isn't it? mmm... but then i do enjoy the smell of the stuff -- better not risk it."
54474,Ned Flanders,that was my spatula!
53454,Ned Flanders,"if you could do that, i'd make this place a shining beacon for the lord."
54354,Ned Flanders,pause the assembly! i have to talk to my wife!
53471,Ned Flanders,"ohhh, you want me to stamp your hand so you can get back in?"
54284,Ned Flanders,"peter, andrew, james the greater, james the lesser, john, philip, thaddeus!"
54522,Ned Flanders,"heh, heh. this is a tasty little lager that came all the way from holland."
53524,Ned Flanders,bring it in!
53919,Ned Flanders,what say we take our worthy adversary out for a hot fudge fun-day?
52739,Ned Flanders,okilly dokilly.
53970,Ned Flanders,"well then, my work is done."
53926,Ned Flanders,"oh i don't mean to cause gil ill will, but still..."
53292,Ned Flanders,i've got a motorhome i never use. maybe we should raffle it off.
53455,Ned Flanders,"oh, bless you, sir."
54393,Ned Flanders,there's no emergency here! and please charge us for the false report! i'm going out for a power walk.
53916,Ned Flanders,"you win, lisa."
53260,Ned Flanders,i think i'm gonna be sick.
54529,Ned Flanders,sometimes i forget that we have things a little better than the simpsons. i drag him over here. he has a few beers. you can't blame him for erupting.
54568,Ned Flanders,"y'know, simpson, i feel kinda silly, but what the hay... you know, it kinda reminds me of my good ole' fraternity days."
53999,Ned Flanders,"us... a team? as the salad said to the soup, ""i'm all mixed up."""
52962,Ned Flanders,"that's dignity, all right."
53302,Ned Flanders,"well, that's no..."
53519,Ned Flanders,this is going right to the orphanage.
54048,Ned Flanders,"goodnight, marge."
53703,Ned Flanders,"well, some say being thoughtful is old-fashioned. if so, then i guess i'm just a cave man. if they existed, which they didn't!"
54450,Ned Flanders,can you teach my boys? but no tickling the ivories. you treat them with respect.
54279,Ned Flanders,spend less time on your back and more time on your knees.
53936,Ned Flanders,"now bart, stay humble! your baseball cap won't fit over a swelled head."
53338,Ned Flanders,"homer, you obviously went to a lot of trouble, but dating? it just feels way too soon."
53009,Ned Flanders,"uh, actually, i'm a little chilly. could i have another straitjacket?"
53489,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer!"
54044,Ned Flanders,since two this afternoon. welcome to our honeymoon!
54320,Ned Flanders,i withdraw my... diddily...
52610,Ned Flanders,"ah, i tell ya the way these checks keep coming in, it's almost criminal."
53937,Ned Flanders,"a damp sponge will take care of this weak, water-based... it's oil-based! oil-based!"
54056,Ned Flanders,"red dog, this is mustache one. we have possible male/female interaction -- be prepared to terminate inappropriate contact."
53458,Ned Flanders,"well, it's been a tad harder than i thought, but i'm not complaining 'cause i work for a sweet, sweet, boss. you're our foreman, maude."
53205,Ned Flanders,ginger's my wife.
53056,Ned Flanders,"oh, they're leaving! the ordeal is over!"
53602,Ned Flanders,i've got a date with a movie star?!
52665,Ned Flanders,"first come, first served! what are you in for?"
53139,Ned Flanders,"rod, get off of there!"
54144,Ned Flanders,"i can't believe we lost, reverend."
54180,Ned Flanders,"excuse me, that's your salad fork!... that wi-fi's for hotel guests only!... what's the matter, sir, too cool to sing ""happy birthday?"""
52984,Ned Flanders,"lookin' good, rod. lookin' good."
54564,Ned Flanders,"it's okay, son. you can recover."
53286,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer! can i join?"
53811,Ned Flanders,get out!
53579,Ned Flanders,it's his skull. it's hypnotic!
53401,Ned Flanders,"we'll just see about that-- uh-oh. well, maybe he made a mistake-- nope. it's airtight."
54426,Ned Flanders,never get into heaven... took harp lessons for nothing...
52742,Ned Flanders,you folks got robbed too? the burglar took my shroud of turin beach towels.
54017,Ned Flanders,"lord, in your mercy, could you give my friend a stroke?"
54368,Ned Flanders,"diddily, diddily, diddily, diddily!"
54002,Ned Flanders,"my friend, you have a deal-arooney!"
52678,Ned Flanders,"knock that off, you two. it's time for church!"
53051,Ned Flanders,"uh, marge, i... i appreciate your advice, but, uh, things have gotten... well, they... they're a lot worse."
54143,Ned Flanders,"okay, let's just put it to a vote."
54391,Ned Flanders,"dad, don't encourage him."
54456,Ned Flanders,"can i help you, stranger?"
52596,Ned Flanders,"sorry to bother you, reverend lovejoy, but i'm kind of in a tizzy. our son todd just told us he didn't want to eat his ""damn vegetables."""
53397,Ned Flanders,we're gonna crash!
53778,Ned Flanders,"""so god blessed noah and his sons, and said to them... never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth. i set my rainbow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between god and man."" thank you."
52788,Ned Flanders,"hi-diddly ho, neighbor."
53526,Ned Flanders,"heaven and earth... where were we? oh, now i'm lost."
53559,Ned Flanders,"boy, that's jim dandy roof candy! i'd love to come over some time and watch that church channel."
53721,Ned Flanders,"lord, why have you given me these unholy visions of doom?"
53100,Ned Flanders,"oh, my-diddily-i. will you look at this place! and the price has been slashed repeatedly!"
53277,Ned Flanders,i'm making record time on this fog walk!
53424,Ned Flanders,"well, my wife's passing was rough, but i think i'm finally ready to move on."
53257,Ned Flanders,we got that tip at the chuck garabedian mega-savings seminar.
54570,Ned Flanders,"shhh. it's coming up, son, it's coming up."
53850,Ned Flanders,"well, they might. but you'd have to be awfully money-grubbing to charge your friends and neighbors..."
53217,Ned Flanders,"uh, do i have to be gang-probed?"
53274,Ned Flanders,"a rude frenchman? well, i never!"
53968,Ned Flanders,and envy!
52532,Ned Flanders,"hey, homer! care to try some of my flanders planters punch?"
54293,Ned Flanders,hell! damn! backside! nothing matters anymore! i'm goin' down and my hand-basket seats two!
54261,Ned Flanders,"homer, listen to me. for a long time now i've been lookin' over the fence at that wonderful relationship you have with marge. then i remember what it was like to have a sweet woman of my own lying in a twin bed across the hall from mine."
53623,Ned Flanders,ned flanders in tinseltown?
54229,Ned Flanders,it was right there... with the ... and the...
53839,Ned Flanders,bart and homer can't go catholic! the romans have been separate from us since the schism of lourdes in 1573. and that was about our holy right to come to church with wet hair. which we've since abolished.
53151,Ned Flanders,"homer, is that my muffler?"
52946,Ned Flanders,"homer, i'm in a rhubarb of a pickle of a jam here. i was all set to go off on vacation, when i get called up for jury duty. oh, it's a corker of a case -- seems a man drove up onto a traffic island and hit a decorative rowboat full of geraniums."
54303,Ned Flanders,"thank you. now, it was one of our biggest celebrations...the nineteenth sunday after easter. we'd just had a rousing no-fun run and in the heat of the moment i wanted to offer my respectful best wishes."
54446,Ned Flanders,none taken.
54182,Ned Flanders,ahem!
54576,Ned Flanders,"oh, it's crying out to cook up some good eatin'."
53692,Ned Flanders,"here you go, principal skinner, mrs. skinner."
53655,Ned Flanders,and it wouldn't hurt you to put up some curtains.
53507,Ned Flanders,"it's kind of you to offer, mr. burns, but buzz around town is that you're, well, evil."
54489,Ned Flanders,never claimed to be.
53095,Ned Flanders,"well, shall we sing a hymn? uh, ""nearer my god to thee"", maybe? or, or, or ""amazing grace""?"
53061,Ned Flanders,amen.
53253,Ned Flanders,"evening, neighbor. low on funds again?"
53143,Ned Flanders,"now, the secret to the windmill hole is to--"
54441,Ned Flanders,he's in a place full of brimstone and exposed flesh.
52909,Ned Flanders,"well, as the tree said to the lumberjack -- i'm stumped."
54332,Ned Flanders,diddily... doodily...
54431,Ned Flanders,"you know how you said you could help me with any desire and nothing was forbidden? well, sir, i want you to rid of lisa's bully teacher."
52973,Ned Flanders,but it could be my mother! howdi...
53268,Ned Flanders,it's not working! it just spreads the flame!
54092,Ned Flanders,the simpsons are back!
54376,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, if you ask me, somebody up there is trying to tell you that whatever flat tires you've got in your life, god's there, with his little spare, that enables you to drive real slow till you get to the next station."
53214,Ned Flanders,will you shut up?
53162,Ned Flanders,"oh, can you believe it? it almost seemed like those folks were, were, were making fun of old steady neddy."
53522,Ned Flanders,i'll say. i'd really like to go out and get the mail.
54210,Ned Flanders,"actually, god made some fish that were pretty close to these, so naturally we selected those for further breeding."
53333,Ned Flanders,tape?
53874,Ned Flanders,hey homer! sneakin' kisses from the missus?
53648,Ned Flanders,uh hmm. that's right. i'm like baskin robbins. you get one free taste then you gotta buy the scoop.
53114,Ned Flanders,"uh, marge? still got that deposit check?"
52798,Ned Flanders,"anyhoo, bart, you're gonna have to be punished. this isn't just some sort of club house."
54208,Ned Flanders,flantastic times two! how are connie and bonnie?
53674,Ned Flanders,ahhhh...
53176,Ned Flanders,all right.
52917,Ned Flanders,it's me... ned.
53075,Ned Flanders,who are we going to beat?
54001,Ned Flanders,we have to do everything by the book.
53157,Ned Flanders,"well, yes."
54358,Ned Flanders,"first base, yo! / i like christian rap / a bible on my lap..."
54115,Ned Flanders,naw.
53903,Ned Flanders,excuse me. how can you put up an exhibit on the origin of man and not have one mention of the bible?
52621,Ned Flanders,aww... isn't that cute? and me without a camera.
53275,Ned Flanders,"you can't kill the undead, silly."
54280,Ned Flanders,no more distractions. i have work to do.
52752,Ned Flanders,"wow, these are amazing seats, huh homer?"
52834,Ned Flanders,"well sir, sounds fair. toodle-oo, everybody. i'll, i'll scream when the comet gets here."
52580,Ned Flanders,for two more days. then it becomes libertarian party headquarters. i hope they have better luck than i did.
53377,Ned Flanders,"""they're controlling our minds with flu shots?!"" i knew it. well kids, now aren't you glad we don't believe in inoculations?"
53878,Ned Flanders,"it's the ripcord from a band-aid wrapper! call me ned zeppelin, but is one of my boys abrased and contused?"
52724,Ned Flanders,"oh, quick, homer! which way do we turn--?"
54457,Ned Flanders,that sounds salty but you seem sweet. i'm gonna call you kettle corn!
53590,Ned Flanders,"well, guess i might as well head back to my store. i've got a date with some twins: my state and federal tax forms."
53106,Ned Flanders,"well, neighborinos, i guess this is goodbye... i better make this quick or i'm gonna start blubbering like a baby."
53547,Ned Flanders,"well, i sure didn't."
53698,Ned Flanders,"it'd be my pleasure, homer!"
54468,Ned Flanders,not this month! edna signed us up for a tango class. it was the only way i could avert wine tasting.
53168,Ned Flanders,"never a dull moment, huh, homer?"
52904,Ned Flanders,"oh, gosh, homer, this is strictly a flanders affair. i've got family here from around the globe! here's josé flanders..."
52948,Ned Flanders,"well, if it'll seal the deal, i'll take a look at your septic tank. see if i can get her hummin' again."
52867,Ned Flanders,dear lord. that's the loudest profanity i've ever heard.
54194,Ned Flanders,nothin'. nothin'. somethin'!
53529,Ned Flanders,"well, sir, of course he could... but then again... wow, as melon-scratchers go, that's a honey-doodle."
53545,Ned Flanders,"here's a preview. god said to noah / build yourself an ark-y ark-y / animals came on by ones and twosies, twosies / elephants and kangaroosies - roosies..."
53034,Ned Flanders,"they're not perfect, but the lord says love thy neighbor --"
54313,Ned Flanders,isn't she pretty?
53241,Ned Flanders,"so! this is how you repay me, adam!"
54029,Ned Flanders,lucky guess.
53347,Ned Flanders,"well, diane, i've sure enjoyed chatting with you about your problems with your mother."
53761,Ned Flanders,"careful, it's hotter than a fox news weather skank."
53948,Ned Flanders,"why the crescendo, my dear old friend-o?"
54098,Ned Flanders,you just made my moustache tingle!
54515,Ned Flanders,"well, ooh, there... there... and uh there's a big patch over there."
53834,Ned Flanders,homer!
53457,Ned Flanders,darn teenagers with their beer bottles.
54242,Ned Flanders,"well thank you for taking me to that pinkberry place. it's a lot less racy than its name would lead you to believe. crossin' it off my ""do-not-go"" list."
54177,Ned Flanders,i've got two teens in a public park goin' at it like a couple of gibbons in the back seat of noah's ark!
52673,Ned Flanders,ann landers is a boring old biddy.
54183,Ned Flanders,"i spy, with my electronic eye, illegal wagering!"
54113,Ned Flanders,"well, see ya 'round the mailbox, marge."
53708,Ned Flanders,advice? just call me ann flanders!
53432,Ned Flanders,"cold, huh?"
52749,Ned Flanders,"hidilly ho, neighbor. wanna go to the game with me? i got two tic..."
52855,Ned Flanders,we do have an emergency plan in case of a prolonged strike right here.
52683,Ned Flanders,oh...the network slogan is true. watch fox and be damned for all eternity.
53225,Ned Flanders,"whew, well, at least i got a hunk of moe's hair."
52570,Ned Flanders,homer! over here!
52809,Ned Flanders,ohmygod! what have i done? i've killed her!
53539,Ned Flanders,"oh, let's just take it from the top."
52929,Ned Flanders,who? maude and me?
54448,Ned Flanders,neither! and i don't like it when other people rhyme!
53368,Ned Flanders,"oh, all right. but only because you haven't outed rod and todd."
54363,Ned Flanders,"unless you're gonna slap some wieners on those, turn 'em off!"
53922,Ned Flanders,"i... uh... i got your phone bill in my mail by mistake... and, uh... i'll just pay it."
54323,Ned Flanders,"uh, homer, i'm afraid this is the part of god's perfect plan where you're murdered by robots."
53406,Ned Flanders,"look, if you want me to turn, just point. that w..."
54486,Ned Flanders,it's the name of the freezer!
53137,Ned Flanders,oooooh!
54421,Ned Flanders,no! you can't! if i'm not as good as you... then i'm horrible!
52949,Ned Flanders,"hello, ""mr. brown ground"", whatcha got for me?"
52604,Ned Flanders,"no, i-i came to talk to you about your potty-mouth."
52807,Ned Flanders,but you rang my...
53240,Ned Flanders,vamoose!
53155,Ned Flanders,"well, that's not quite true--"
53603,Ned Flanders,psst! homer!
54046,Ned Flanders,"sorry, homer, i'm afraid it's separate accommodations for you notly-weds."
18594,Homer,gotta go. my damn wiener kids are listening.
31759,Homer,this ends now!
37497,Homer,"the carlsons then wrote down this saga so no one would ever forget their treachery and cowardice."""
21596,Homer,"what? eh. eh. let me handle the creative end of this, marge. you don't understand how the creative mind works like i do."
34912,Homer,"i'm sorry, but this leg's gonna have to go."
28406,Homer,what kind of an example would i be if i didn't take revenge on things?
35248,Homer,okay. i'll go get some stuff.
41584,Homer,"ketchup, please."
13310,Homer,oh.
14447,Homer,see? got her on the first bounce.
30699,Homer,"ha-ha! that's what you get for being luminous, jerks!"
37124,Homer,what are you talkin' about? marge and i are goin' great.
23057,Homer,it's gonna be on towards the end of the flight.
16725,Homer,stupid carbon rod. it's all just a popularity contest.
32911,Homer,it works on so many levels.
25104,Homer,family meeting! family meeting!
34361,Homer,and no tv!
40533,Homer,"well, i always knew you'd change the world, for the better."
32012,Homer,can i have some more money?
25330,Homer,"oh, that's loser talk!"
38224,Homer,"sure, why not?"
29509,Homer,"oh, i've only got a hundred dollars. i'd better bid shrewdly."
20224,Homer,"well, moe, this is it. today's the day i get my new air conditioner."
26301,Homer,i'm laughing but it's a laugh of impatience. show the movie!
25077,Homer,"c'mon, kids. let's leave this awful place and never come back."
22060,Homer,"well, yeah, i know..."
24489,Homer,thank you.
27917,Homer,me too -- i've come to hate my own creation. now i know how god feels.
32579,Homer,noooo!
26331,Homer,marge? marge is gone! but at least the demolition derby form is...
41309,Homer,"homer, that's a terrible thing to say."
23526,Homer,take it!
15511,Homer,yabba dabba doo!
25108,Homer,"damn you, e-bay!"
13616,Homer,"sweetheart, there's nothing i wouldn't do for that magazine."
40265,Homer,"what's wrong with you people? let's show some spirit! come on, get up!"
13453,Homer,marge! marge! what's my blood type?
40496,Homer,"goodbye, son."
27849,Homer,now you're just making up rules. who made you judge judy and executioner?
14527,Homer,"oh, marge. i only said it because i thought that's what you wanted to hear."
13402,Homer,huh?
28928,Homer,"oh man, is this awkward. i'm outta here."
21782,Homer,"ohhh my god, i am such a huge, huge fan of yours, miss basinger."
18971,Homer,why do you need new bands? everyone knows rock attained perfection in 1974. it's a scientific fact.
18865,Homer,"all right, dare."
26187,Homer,"well, not with that temper."
34447,Homer,"yeah, you're right."
40594,Homer,what are you talking about? nobody's trying to teach you that.
31398,Homer,no one makes my daughter sob and run.
19777,Homer,has the whole world gone insane?
24445,Homer,i... 8... p.p.
37586,Homer,and do you love lasagna... like me?
23157,Homer,... we-shot-last-night...
37096,Homer,check mate.
19990,Homer,"thanks for swinging by the house, reverend."
32317,Homer,right... tomorrow.
38088,Homer,what the--
32951,Homer,to your mother's purse!
22384,Homer,this is better.
38735,Homer,sure it is. you know i've always loved laying things down. grooves are just the latest.
22607,Homer,"this is all your fault for trading away your turn. just for that, no dessert tonight!"
33823,Homer,sometimes there's not a train going by.
38365,Homer,"what is your problem, boy?"
33848,Homer,"two, actually. twins."
36819,Homer,"get lost, pervs!"
15320,Homer,cutting my nails? brushing my teeth?
14711,Homer,my personal hygiene has been described as...
29090,Homer,i'm so lame!
19423,Homer,"hello, chief."
27395,Homer,i can't believe the man who agreed to follow my daughter around -- for money -- would turn out to be a dirt bag.
39462,Homer,no! i'm not done yet.
22235,Homer,"ladies, we want to do the honorable thing. so breakfast is on us, with full waffle-bar privileges. but first, i'm afraid we have some bad news. the waffle bar is closed. i'm sorry. i'm so very--"
30004,Homer,where's my bucket?!
37898,Homer,shut up shut up shut up!
35968,Homer,"u.s. of a! great song, ted. when's our next gig? are we goin' to new york, or--"
28829,Homer,i don't think we've seen the last of artie ziff.
36001,Homer,"...counting the moments to closing time when i can stumble home to you. another round, moe. uh-oh. did i type that? delete! delete! hm, typing ""delete"" does not delete."
14016,Homer,"you know, marge, that bart of ours is a little miracle. his winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach, his face alight with wholesome mischief... he reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit."
23937,Homer,"they were so drunk. gentlemen, get off your knees. your rich uncle homer is throwing the wildest box social the high seas have ever seen!"
40606,Homer,no!
30033,Homer,someone who appreciates my in-your-face management style.
40565,Homer,you mean duke it out?
29549,Homer,a church! maybe the homeless people sleeping on the floor will have some ideas.
33973,Homer,what'd i miss?
14540,Homer,"look, i know it wasn't our best season."
14839,Homer,wow. the spine melter 2000.
34918,Homer,you don't want a christmas tree? that's crazy! next you won't want a christmas ham.
22107,Homer,"... and after moe's, we went to krustyburger and the mayor got some more change, and i ordered a double double, but they gave me the double double double double. and then apu gave the mayor lots of change for..."
40713,Homer,all right. stop it! cut it out!
24783,Homer,okay.
24800,Homer,huh? help! mr. burns!
18357,Homer,"yes, sweetheart?"
21009,Homer,then i'll do it!
15440,Homer,"oh night, when christ was born..."
23667,Homer,"apu, you shoulda seen your face when they showed you those babies."
26729,Homer,very well. i'm not gonna be angry dad for one day longer. i'm giving up anger forever!
30850,Homer,"hey monkey, eat tranquilizer dart!"
25209,Homer,"boy, talk about irony. the ama tries to drive you guys out of business. now you're doing the same to me. think about the irony..."
20683,Homer,"something very close, exactly along those lines--a clint eastwood - lee marvin shoot 'em up western!"
17005,Homer,oh.
29354,Homer,yeah. nothing makes parents happier than when an eccentric single man takes an interest in their child.
13434,Homer,are you?
28575,Homer,either way. the important thing is the system works.
25346,Homer,"you know, there's a lesson here for all of us: it's better to watch stuff than to do stuff."
41450,Homer,"wish me luck, dad."
21745,Homer,you intergalactic hussy! how could you?! was he better than me?
38497,Homer,you can still lick it!
34706,Homer,lucky.
38529,Homer,and i will wait and worry!
33401,Homer,"i do! oh, right."
40363,Homer,"no, not you. i'm talking to the boy. keep your head down. follow through..."
25530,Homer,woo hoo!
35528,Homer,"wayne, maybe it's the me being still alive talking, but i think you're awesome."
18814,Homer,"you really blew it this time, smithers."
32894,Homer,"i feel terrible. my own mother reached out to me, and i rejected her. i'm gonna make her a card."
27437,Homer,do you think you could give me a lift home?
35096,Homer,i know what you're saying! i understand food talk in every language!
24996,Homer,"well, before she died, she ordered this bible especially for you."
18890,Homer,"okay. okay. think, homer..."
20470,Homer,"okay. half of you vibrate that way, two of you fall down, nelson, you just spin around in a circle."
30057,Homer,"finally, a character i can relate to. i bet good things happen to him."
41360,Homer,judi dench?!
27779,Homer,"thank you, mr. burns. thank you for... huh?"
27335,Homer,i wouldn't have it any other way.
18038,Homer,lousy teachers. trying to palm off our kids on us.
28304,Homer,what?
21270,Homer,"they let me sign checks with a stamp, marge. a stamp!"
34926,Homer,"now remember, pack only necessities."
26083,Homer,good fire. good fire. keep burning. almost there.
15615,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah."
20862,Homer,"oh, right. i reluctantly accept your proposal."
34785,Homer,"ooh, got a text."
16927,Homer,now i'll pull my arms out with my face...
15213,Homer,"and that's good! but, here's the bad part... uh... uh... ooh, look at that headline: ""canada to hold referendum."" sorry marge, can't talk now."
35508,Homer,the warmth of human contact with a manly whiff of violence.
30504,Homer,"yeah, but i know how to win women back. i even won you back after i lost our wedding album in a bar bet."
16567,Homer,"sorry, dad. you're too old."
23084,Homer,it's a crane. the japanese believe they bring good luck.
39746,Homer,be right there.
18493,Homer,free duff! viva life!
24027,Homer,"oh, it is, it is. but we've been pushing that poor horse too hard."
25733,Homer,"well, they would keep me company. and this pickle you're offering only sweetens the deal."
33665,Homer,yes?
29023,Homer,"ugh, too eighties."
13561,Homer,"hey, michael, i don't get it. these guys seem as normal as you and me."
28076,Homer,you can bring a bag of ice.
31350,Homer,americans!
38690,Homer,"hey, there's always room at buzzard's roost."
38397,Homer,fine.
14500,Homer,"what is it, flanders?"
20447,Homer,"hey, everybody! let's hear it for bart!"
13579,Homer,not insane.
14303,Homer,"hey boy, how's the microphone working?"
40626,Homer,"oooh! it's good news, isn't it?"
38830,Homer,"man, you are a nutcracker. but i've learned something tonight: you know how everyone hates being with their family on christmas? well, being without them is worse. can you find it in your wooden heart to give me a break?"
25564,Homer,what did you just see?
39881,Homer,political what?
14548,Homer,and here it is.
22987,Homer,no. but i got it.
16507,Homer,"strike three, marge. i remember that meeting, and i have a photographic memory."
41105,Homer,"well, let 'em sleep on their own time!"
37082,Homer,"uh, say, listen, portia. how would you and mav feel about... um, swinging?"
14522,Homer,where'd you get the money?
19541,Homer,"no, i refuse to share a bed with someone who thinks i'm crazy. unless you're feeling... amorous?"
18063,Homer,starland vocal band?! they suck!
20247,Homer,so do i.
28975,Homer,why you little...
26356,Homer,"okay ziff, you get her for the weekend, but no funny stuff."
14133,Homer,"well, i'm afraid i had some great plans, too."
22328,Homer,sorry.
25655,Homer,thanks a lot. now i gotta walk to shelbyville.
32947,Homer,"son, the healthy thing is to get rid of everything that reminds you of krusty...which appears to be everything. hey, maybe we should give lisa this room. you know she works for krusty now."
17633,Homer,remove the girl.
21489,Homer,"honey, my shoulders are separating."
33545,Homer,can't someone help me with this puzzle?
36679,Homer,one more time.
35860,Homer,"he froze himself because he was sick, and there was no cure."
16320,Homer,"hey, krusty! i'm bringing back the..."
35665,Homer,yeah i was on today. scary on.
26882,Homer,just think of them as twinkling stars.
39551,Homer,okay. here we go.
33028,Homer,you hang onto resentment like a confederate widow.
27907,Homer,"hey, mister? if you like my song so much, would you like to buy a tape? it's already rewound."
40724,Homer,"hey, yeah, yeah. i think i can."
21256,Homer,do we want old man patterson here with his finger on the button?
29739,Homer,"well, i'll get a lawyer on that. no, a whole team of lawyers. who will dine on mustard flown in from the orient."
31853,Homer,that's a red card. you're out of the game!
27078,Homer,to rock!
37390,Homer,his boringness saved us all...
28630,Homer,"hey, what gives? he's not killing me!"
25145,Homer,"hmm, i'm detecting a distinct strain of anti-intellectualism in this tavern..."
32068,Homer,liberals -- i hate them so much!
36210,Homer,"it's true! i failed the basic duty of childhood. and then when i took bart fishing, it all came back -- and the guilt made me wet the bed!"
35664,Homer,i need a nap!
37301,Homer,uh-oh.
33509,Homer,my own devices!
31889,Homer,"and remember: your most intimate secrets are safe with me. okay, who else is dead in bed?"
25523,Homer,just to get some attention.
36106,Homer,...onnneee... onnneee...
28506,Homer,uh... woo hoo! maggie's talking!
26670,Homer,"unregardless, i will no longer be a slave to this."
34961,Homer,"okay, melvin mafia."
39324,Homer,oh.
29672,Homer,"come on kids, we should go. goodbye, selma."
25185,Homer,and his fondness for the guitar.
26363,Homer,"oh god, you're right. i've gotta get her back before it's too late."
21030,Homer,"well, i'm no margaret cho, but i do a pretty fair columbo impression. ah, one more thing - one- i should get a glass of water."
26573,Homer,"way ahead of you, marge."
20499,Homer,please? it's just for as long as his mother's living here.
25850,Homer,"oh, i'm gonna enjoy this."
36281,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, save your breath."
32490,Homer,"c'mon, lisa! the tv's been off for five whole minutes!"
15121,Homer,"all right, i'll talk to lisa's teacher this year. you can have bart's."
19749,Homer,"no! no, no, no, no..."
17445,Homer,"hey, marge! this guy looks like apu!"
18891,Homer,... the dog!
23044,Homer,"wow, this plankton's only 33 cents."
26662,Homer,"oh, i could have smoked that pot. and worn that hair."
16935,Homer,woo hoo!
23248,Homer,i'm on top of it.
33548,Homer,"great time to nap, einstein!"
37804,Homer,woo hoo! who's chase?
28869,Homer,"oh my god! if i get one more d.u.i., they'll take away my license. and what will i leave when i rent rollerblades?"
25336,Homer,booo! you rot!
29666,Homer,really? then why do you still work here?!
21750,Homer,"oh, i was having the most wonderful dream. i had a hat, and a tie with no pants on."
34815,Homer,and not the good kind!
22742,Homer,i'm keeping a promise to an american roadmaster.
19356,Homer,"telemarketing, eh?"
32077,Homer,i'm afraid they might. but i will not be silenced. the truth is...
28467,Homer,"well, that's all over now. from now on, we will focus solely on important issues."
15642,Homer,pepi.
20441,Homer,"not so easy to keep your mouth shut now, is it, flanders?"
22238,Homer,"geez, i've never seen anyone so whipped so fast."
29458,Homer,"i can't go to a gay bar, i'm too fat! moe, i'm gonna help you reopen your bar no matter what it takes."
34442,Homer,they have malls on land?
14254,Homer,"oh, c'mon, honey. you know how it turns out. after all, you wouldn't be here today if i hadn't become the responsible head of a household."
30968,Homer,"well, i'm just glad i'm not a god anymore. i wanna go home. how's chief wiggum?"
19218,Homer,"oh, yes we are!"
19739,Homer,"so, do those records have ""camp value?"""
31035,Homer,"take that, liberal media."
34011,Homer,woo hoo! an unattended tap! like takin' beer from a baby!
41326,Homer,"greetings, friend..."
41024,Homer,what?
37531,Homer,"marge, i am focused on this like a laser. ""laser."" that's a funny word. it's just ""loser"" with an ""a."" and speaking of losers, i've lost my train of thought. oh, and speaking of trains, wait till you see--"
25504,Homer,down.
39486,Homer,"well, we're not licked yet. to save this family, we're gonna have to make the supreme sacrifice."
28120,Homer,"boy, that's a big staff. and still he wasn't that funny."
36337,Homer,we've had stupider!
33821,Homer,ahso sheepay to you.
26306,Homer,"so long, suckers!"
18313,Homer,hello? can anybody hear me?
16416,Homer,"watch this, guys."
32075,Homer,true -- but there's room for the truth in this household. do you wanna hear something really bad kent told me about the fox network?
21223,Homer,never!
26436,Homer,"it's just not fair. this buck fella's had all the advantages --horse-riding lessons, the finest makeup, delicious studio food..."
37824,Homer,you used to be fun.
23597,Homer,mm-hmmm.
22988,Homer,stealing is wrong.
33008,Homer,"oh, you've gotta try it. this way the pepperonis stay intact till they reach your stomach. then, bam!"
26516,Homer,that pig looks like lenny.
28096,Homer,you mean like some sort of madman?
35120,Homer,"well, i don't know... it's a lot of work."
24201,Homer,"well, i may not know much about god, but i have to say, we built a pretty nice cage for him."
33830,Homer,"heads. i mean, tails. i mean, on its side."
14909,Homer,that's okay. we're none of us perfect.
21686,Homer,"oh, man. this is the most exciting thing i've seen since haley's comet collided with the moon!"
29097,Homer,whuh-oh.
30596,Homer,"and marge, there are certain things i can do for you that no other friend can. special things."
26926,Homer,"you know, i've had a lot of jobs: boxer, mascot, astronaut, imitation krusty, baby proofer, trucker, hippy, plow driver, food critic, conceptual artist, grease salesman, carny, mayor, grifter, bodyguard for the mayor, country western manager, garbage commissioner, mountain climber, farmer, inventor, smithers, poochie, celebrity assistant, power plant worker, fortune cookie writer, beer baron, kwik-e-mart clerk, homophobe, and missionary. but protecting springfield, that gives me the best feeling of all."
15856,Homer,"ah, my high school yearbook..."
15433,Homer,whew! i was afraid it was my transmission.
21647,Homer,"oh, son, you're young and headstrong, just like thomas edison, jr. you know, he started a mushroom farm, and an auto parts company, and he sold his good name to a quack medicine company. oh, and later, he raised turkeys. that was on his turkey farm."
17157,Homer,oh sugar!
22438,Homer,"yeah, isn't it? i got it off a hair dryer."
36614,Homer,"what's that, baby?"
25023,Homer,"absolutely. we had stopped in for a quick prayer, when... bart, would you call him a crazy man?"
28650,Homer,"cool, an ambulance from the '60s! i bet a lotta hippies were denied care in this thing. injured hippies!"
22477,Homer,"oh, i almost forgot. while i was at the courthouse, i had them change your name."
27454,Homer,then we'll have to smoke her out.
35896,Homer,give me another one!
26006,Homer,"ah, whatever. just give me a duff."
18651,Homer,"he spanked you? you, bart simpson?"
34072,Homer,stomp it! crush it! kill it!
19219,Homer,"oh, yes, there is!"
13395,Homer,"you're right, i am. help me, marge. what do i do to be a good guy?"
34929,Homer,we're gonna go out for breakfast / we'll go out to eat / it'll be any place you choose / as long as it's run by jews / 'cause they don't think this holiday's so great.
13964,Homer,oooooh! that's one clean tombstone.
37323,Homer,"okay, let's see how straight it is."
14606,Homer,"take a hike boss, i'm running things now."
17438,Homer,let's never fight again.
28058,Homer,"it's okay, marge. it would have been a lot worse if i hadn't been carrying this bible in my crotch."
27465,Homer,"listen, my bulky flower, i-i have an early day..."
22301,Homer,"oh, i hope they don't reveal this is a comb-over."
19647,Homer,"oh, marge i just had a couple of beers."
17932,Homer,"i didn't do it for them. i did it for you, marge. i'd kill for you. please ask me to kill for you."
20517,Homer,and here i am using my own lungs like a sucker! and how come everyone gets a bedpan and i have to walk all the way over there?
18192,Homer,"who? lady, you got the wrong file."
30967,Homer,may firrr... seconnn... thirrr...
38205,Homer,"marge, it happened again!"
22585,Homer,is there anything that guy doesn't know?
19173,Homer,really?
37771,Homer,"oh, you know how the first few weeks are: sleep deprived, walking around in a fog..."
30828,Homer,a canoe made of country ham? you know i'll eat it.
28796,Homer,"well, what do you know? it's unkillable."
14961,Homer,i know that!
24428,Homer,"okay, but i ain't payin' for two weddin's."
18163,Homer,"so you finally learned my name, eh?"
39066,Homer,dammit!
38435,Homer,"dad, is that story really true?"
17631,Homer,so?
33420,Homer,"thanks, guys."
21881,Homer,you went to woodstock?
38708,Homer,a place that's filled with sun and sand / a desert steampunk disneyland / keep expectations lowww... / swing low sweet chariot...
14058,Homer,"hey, i know a good drink. really hits the spot. i invented it myself..."
23154,Homer,"oh! mel, it's the most boring piece of garbage i've ever seen. and it's not easy for me to say that."
32600,Homer,"and when you pushed me off the bridge, it's 'cause you knew about the party and wanted to make sure i got here."
14315,Homer,just promise me you won't play anymore practical jokes.
33178,Homer,yeah.
23910,Homer,nothing you can say will diminish this honor.
14802,Homer,"oh lisa, that's a load of rich, creamery butter."
31968,Homer,"moe, i can save you but you have to let go of the clock."
31851,Homer,"when i put on these shorts, i'm not your father anymore. and judging by how tight they are, i'm never gonna be anyone else's either."
24165,Homer,"i guess so, but that first month was pretty rough."
14670,Homer,mmm...
21158,Homer,"that'll do it, apu. so just--"
26167,Homer,i did it. i found our dog. now our christmas is complete.
14160,Homer,"well, ah, i wish the candy machine wasn't so picky about taking beat-up dollar bills... because a lot of workers really like candy."
18870,Homer,i won't tell anybody.
31710,Homer,look at those morons -- they sing because they're stupid!
21025,Homer,i'm a freak!
23930,Homer,damn!
23444,Homer,'cause i'm trying to think! what would zorro do?
30608,Homer,that flag is mine! don't mess with texas!
20424,Homer,do it.
41359,Homer,"okay, just imagine she's a bond girl."
39001,Homer,"i've got him cornered, boy! bag him up!"
32451,Homer,okay.
23223,Homer,got my whole week in there.
40805,Homer,"thanks, mr. b."
19529,Homer,yes.
35597,Homer,come on! god does crazy things! check your old testament.
21855,Homer,no!
18030,Homer,"how do you explain the culottes, boy?"
23473,Homer,"i'm only one man, marge."
19448,Homer,marge! thank god you're here! where's the car?
27957,Homer,stop it!
38514,Homer,i'm dropping the anchor!
15955,Homer,so goodbye...
19470,Homer,"hi, honey."
35718,Homer,i've waited my whole life to hear that!
26155,Homer,'cause he's all man.
22248,Homer,a lion!
34497,Homer,no...
14907,Homer,"kids, back me up."
19224,Homer,so lazy.
14960,Homer,"okay, okay, okay, okay, okay."
18805,Homer,"mr. smithers, wait!"
32975,Homer,flanders!
23315,Homer,oh... it's a special time in a boy's life when... gotta go!
34352,Homer,sorry!
37925,Homer,you? how could you? you're my own flesh and blood!
28437,Homer,"son, can i have cuts?"
17671,Homer,"yes! with my bills paid off, i can finally quit this lousy job."
22779,Homer,"ohhh, my dear, sweet eve. i love you even more than the butterscotch pond or the porno bush."
32665,Homer,"yep, that professor couldn't keep me and marge apart."
17458,Homer,kids-here's-fifty-dollars-why-not-go-to-the-movies-then-take-a-cab-to-your-aunts'-house-stay-there-phone-call-you-later-now-now-now.
17070,Homer,"marge, you'll never guess what. my whole class is here. they're going to observe the human peep show that is our lives."
40829,Homer,"boy, what's this world coming to?"
31603,Homer,are you gonna torture me?
36350,Homer,"lousy marge... ruining the delicate relationship between a man and his tv show... i'd tell my best friend, but that's marge too..."
21771,Homer,"ooh, look at it go."
37366,Homer,wait a minute! this has oats in it!
20888,Homer,i hope he tells us to burn our pants. these things are drivin' me nuts!
18531,Homer,ants!
15620,Homer,have a good time! wait a minute.
36751,Homer,"aw, come on chief, i've had a rotten day. can't you help me out?"
25712,Homer,did you say anterior?
13533,Homer,print name?
15842,Homer,"now, come on. you're gonna learn how to shave."
32351,Homer,now i'm mad!
25851,Homer,"yeah, yeah, these kids are pretty special..."
37071,Homer,"oh, how very kind of you. i am not giving our kids to these gravelly-voiced super hags! one lump, please."
29357,Homer,"bart, can i ask you an important question?"
35534,Homer,"of course. i mean, how long could it be?"
16308,Homer,"oh no, you don't! that trampoline is mine."
39420,Homer,i'll get to work. but first i have to say goodbye to some friends.
30150,Homer,"what are you kids laughing at? and if you say jimmy fallon, i'll know you're lying."
24345,Homer,"all right, i'm comin'."
32417,Homer,brown? no. orange? no. elm? rake? guessing?
26888,Homer,"this whole thing was a joke? oh, i've never been so relieved! relieved and angry."
41213,Homer,what? where're your going? i--
23359,Homer,"you know, i've never liked that little wiener milhouse."
23799,Homer,gotcha! gotcha! / i'll show you!
38591,Homer,"oh, i love canadian on canadian violence. oh baby, this is so great! thank you so much!"
24221,Homer,caveman brow...
40212,Homer,"oh, marge. what's the big deal? i bet before the papers blew this out of proportion, you didn't even know how many eyes a fish had."
17279,Homer,fading... rising!
36015,Homer,"we show girls love on valentine's day, and they let us blow stuff up on the fourth of july. i just pray they never fall on the same day."
28582,Homer,i'm confused! which is it?
36852,Homer,"well, you won't be laughing when you see how many pickpockets this thing catches."
19309,Homer,that's a door?
31751,Homer,spooky.
32177,Homer,"everyone just act cool. if anyone asks, tell them we're plumbers... and then start plumbing until they go away."
40712,Homer,"""oooo, as read by larry king."""
38208,Homer,he makes me sick.
37545,Homer,"and what better way to spend it than commemorating the glorious words you spoke ten years ago: ""for worse."""
14290,Homer,"yeah!!! whoa! excellent, marge!"
23583,Homer,"hello, everybody!"
25570,Homer,"yeah, it's like the allman brothers!"
25832,Homer,yep. everything worked out for the best.
20277,Homer,"hmmm, two bucks... and it only transports matter? umm... well, ah... i'll give you 35 cents."
26220,Homer,talk about what? sports? bigamy?
23085,Homer,shimatta baka-me!
35602,Homer,why you little!... /
37600,Homer,no one.
32609,Homer,happier!
16540,Homer,"marge, i want you to admit you have a gambling problem."
14676,Homer,stupid marge tell me to shut up.
14593,Homer,"bart, i need some lucky numbers, fast! how old are you? uh-huh, and what's your birthday? no kidding. and what's lisa's birthday?... what? you don't know your sister's birthday? what kind of brother are you?"
24747,Homer,"oh, praise god, you're alive! unless..."
17834,Homer,"no, i'm gonna ask marge."
13502,Homer,"well, i'm still gonna run!"
26752,Homer,she likes you! put in a good word for grape.
25112,Homer,"yeah, but aren't those experiments dangerous?"
37229,Homer,"you grandson-ruining fiend! look what your ""number one fan"" did at show and tell!"
34266,Homer,"what, they come here on saturday night to clean the ice? losers."
19715,Homer,"you're right, marge! it's not my fault! i'm not gonna let 'em treat poochie like dirt anymore just 'cause he's the new guy!"
29314,Homer,woo hoo! i don't know the difference!
16601,Homer,we'll be right back.
30756,Homer,"i don't enjoy it. being a father is just a job. long hours, no pay, and at the end, all you get is someone yelling ""you screwed me up""!"
26804,Homer,...i get knocked down / i get knocked down again / you're never gonna knock me down!
41054,Homer,yeah.
36761,Homer,i don't wanna.
33034,Homer,"aw, dammit!"
24116,Homer,"oh, why did i register with insta-trace?"
27571,Homer,"crawling! oh, he's really gone. he's gone!"
19685,Homer,"oh, that poor woman."
16546,Homer,"well, you have a gambling problem!"
31802,Homer,"first amendment rules, privacy drools!"
33341,Homer,is it some place i have to put on a tie?
23074,Homer,hmmm...
17935,Homer,"debt's off! let's go, marge. woo hoo!"
33549,Homer,"okay, maggie, dog, poison, you're all involved, so listen up. first i row maggie over, leaving the dog and the poison. then i row back alone, take the poison over and bring maggie back. then i take the dog over, come back, get maggie, row across, and before i know it, i'm back at home!"
18186,Homer,we leave you the kids for three hours and the county takes them away?!
26054,Homer,"let's see. ""you will invent a humorous toilet lid."" ""you will find true love on flag day."" ""your store is being robbed, apu."" are you getting all this, lisa?"
13398,Homer,gotta be a good husband... gotta be a good husband... gotta be a good husband.
29182,Homer,"oh yeah, she's always trying to improve mankind."
38741,Homer,"great practice, guys. what do you say we give it another six hours then call it a day?"
15125,Homer,woo hoo! u.s.a! u.s.a! u.s.a!
34836,Homer,"it may not be a boy. it could be anything: scrap-booking, high-stakes poker, or the santa fe lifestyle. just pick a dead end, and chill out till you die."
32426,Homer,"marge, i wish you well, but why would women want to go to a gym if there were no men there watching them and judging them?"
39594,Homer,"quiet, marge. this is my big moment."
24594,Homer,get it.
36590,Homer,let automobile von bismarck give it a try.
40254,Homer,"oh, no. marge, sitting next to the boss -- the best night of the year, and it's ruined! of all the lousy, rotten... this stinks..."
26357,Homer,"and by funny stuff i mean handholding, goo goo eyes, misdirected woo -- which is pretty much any john woo film--"
14674,Homer,duff please.
15078,Homer,i will get you one now!
31939,Homer,is that one?
14495,Homer,stupid lumber...
33947,Homer,that could work.
38235,Homer,get outta here!
14838,Homer,"i feel so empty. so alone, so... couchless."
41030,Homer,"i want a horn here, here and here. you can never find a horn when you're mad. and they should all play ""la cucaracha."""
20942,Homer,"hurry, moe. at three o'clock they're going to put us in the exercise yard. the exercise yard!"
16906,Homer,he likes peanuts.
13372,Homer,"hmmm, bait."
19468,Homer,"hi, kids."
25744,Homer,see for yourself.
20209,Homer,"our family was suffering through its worst crisis ever. bart was miserable at school, and lisa's gifts were going to waste."
30161,Homer,well that's obvious. he doesn't even know.
26486,Homer,turn that down! you call that music? i-- i just don't know what to do.
40184,Homer,"be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!"
39396,Homer,i think we should put a stop sign at d street and twelfth. the other --
33134,Homer,marge?!
34310,Homer,so that's why i love drinking so much.
36697,Homer,what?!
31063,Homer,but what if we...
22705,Homer,piece o' cake. just need a little truck-driving music.
29430,Homer,hold on. we're just innocent tourists.
37821,Homer,fine. you're mike singletary. enjoy your mediocre coaching career.
14562,Homer,"well now that you're a little bit older, i can tell you that's a crock. no matter how good you are at something, there's always about a million people better than you."
30432,Homer,"i'm really sorry, but our family just can't handle both of you boys. i hope that somewhere deep in your data banks, you process fond memories of us."
25205,Homer,"patent pending... patent pending... patent pending... hey, who's this guy?"
13492,Homer,why did you do that?
22595,Homer,"hey, marge, what's your favorite radio station?"
28245,Homer,no! i can't lose my mother again! don't take her away!
14360,Homer,whoo-hoo!
28861,Homer,you can just nurse it.
14475,Homer,"well, i gotta go."
33035,Homer,make it life and you've got a deal.
26963,Homer,were they now?
19533,Homer,"you are one fine-lookin' woman, lady. if i wasn't married, i'd go out with you like that."
26862,Homer,don't worry. you're gonna be just fine. i--
14397,Homer,"all right. if you must know, lisa and i have been gambling on pro football."
39262,Homer,"ah, son, you don't need all that junk. i'm sure you've already got something much more important, a decent home and a loving father who would do anything for you. hey, i couldn't afford lunch. gimme a bite of that donut."
28345,Homer,"oh marge, i am so sorry. i should've listened to whatever it was you were saying."
36443,Homer,"ooh, nice and roomy. our lord sure knew how to keep 'em cool."
28911,Homer,"i sure am. here you go, son. i brought you a lollipop from the guards' lounge."
17960,Homer,prove it.
14528,Homer,step aside everyone. sensitive love letters are my specialty.
41018,Homer,because you think i'm a genius?
21403,Homer,"oh, lisa, thank god you're okay!"
30113,Homer,i'm comfortable like this.
23674,Homer,"boy, that hansel sure can eat."
28438,Homer,sweet.
21597,Homer,"you look at this table and what do you see? just a table. now, a creative person, like me, looks at this table and sees all kinds of creative things -- but no tables."
14985,Homer,god?
38256,Homer,"i repeat, no penalty!"
28373,Homer,"marge, you're gonna love my present. it is so thoughtful it makes the kids' gifts look like crap."

27064,Homer,"oh, i don't resent you, sweetheart. what i was trying to say, and maybe i didn't use the right words, was that marriage is like a coffin and each kid is another nail, but as coffins go..."
30911,Homer,"god, we have fun."
14720,Homer,"marge, you're standing in the way of my boyhood dream of managing a beautiful country singer."
36937,Homer,"okay, but i'm a little out of practice."

31834,Homer,"what'sa matter, buddy? the american flag not good enough for ya?"
20751,Homer,"now who's the filthy sleezebag, uh marge?"
13459,Homer,"bart, it's not like i'm asking you to give blood for free. that would be crazy! you're a little young to understand this, but when you save a rich man's life, he showers you with riches. don't you know the story of hercules and the lion?"
22854,Homer,now you're making sense. good night.
15558,Homer,"and i'm a college student! heh, heh."

30437,Homer,you wanted to believe the lie!
32005,Homer,"say, is your butt numb from all this vibrating? mine is. still, i wouldn't describe it as unpleasant. well, let's get some shut-eye."
39896,Homer,sector twelve?

14628,Homer,"whattaya got, marge? insurance scam?"
18804,Homer,"i just feel terrible about getting mr. smithers fired. that job was all he had. imagine how you'd feel, marge, if you got fired from the... those things... that you do."
29751,Homer,"hey, i couldn't leave you kids. you're like my own family. now check this place out!"
40870,Homer,good boy.

33971,Homer,i couldn't help it! she knew my one weakness -- that i'm weak!
17642,Homer,"hm... i could help others. i'll get a bunch of monkeys, dress them up, and make them reenact the civil war ."
32531,Homer,"maggie? has anyone seen anyone?! oh, of course, they must all be taking a family bath. without me!"
38450,Homer,can i pitch something?
37751,Homer,"um... i don't know how to tell you this, but your baby doesn't have any legs--"
18679,Homer,sit down! / you're breaking -- / don't touch that--
33822,Homer,i can't afford this place -- it's way too fancy.
21351,Homer,la la la la la la la la...
30874,Homer,y'ello.
39233,Homer,well... i want to do the christmas shopping this year.
33294,Homer,flowers -- the painted whores of the plant world.
17605,Homer,oh really?
29435,Homer,"dad, you tried your best. for the first time in my life i can say, without being drunk, that i truly admire you."
18690,Homer,"uh, c'mon, kids, let's go sit in the car 'til your mom's done fitting in."
22818,Homer,"come on, you..."
41159,Homer,"hey, hey, now you're talkin'!"
39077,Homer,"i have so many questions for you. first of all, is this floor reinforced?"
41361,Homer,oh my god... is she flirting with me?
28220,Homer,you have no choice.
41294,Homer,"when your wife looks at you, full of hope, with an idea that would destroy life as we know it..."
17680,Homer,and now the final phase of my plan.
30569,Homer,"you're like all easter bunnies -- can't take a punch to the crotch! maybe next time you'll think twice before you volunteer to help children. oh, hey marge."
32240,Homer,singing opera made me good at painting.
35526,Homer,completing each other's... sen... ten... cesss...

40837,Homer,it's funny 'cause it's true!
39739,Homer,"oh, no. come on, come on! open up!"
19044,Homer,"ooh, captain of the football team! he's a dreamboat! don't wait up, marge."
39528,Homer,now here's that bully of yours. show me your stuff.
28568,Homer,you've probably heard a lot of bad things about families come first.
31367,Homer,hmm... i must be supposed to remember something.
33348,Homer,"the guy owns a few local businesses and everyone treats him like he's god. well, god doesn't need his own special day!"
24637,Homer,that'll play great in the sticks.
14646,Homer,or... to put it another way... there is.
38534,Homer,"oh marge, once again you've taken one of my screw-ups and turned it into food. man, if only you could do that with bart."
28785,Homer,i am so there!
32641,Homer,"no, no. this candidate has to be unbelievably ridiculous."
32218,Homer,hua-hua!
21122,Homer,walk? that wasn't part of the deal.
22382,Homer,"gee... i never thought i'd say this about a tv show, but this is kinda stupid. hey, ""policecops."" that sounds like a lethal combination."
36111,Homer,"normal, normal, normal, normal... uncharacteristic?! hm, a chew-through. what could have..."
30763,Homer,i bet this looks cool from overhead though.
30060,Homer,"this movie will haunt me for the rest of my life, just like cannonball run two."
33408,Homer,"uh, yes. that must be it. this is the best of all possible worlds. blah, blah, blah."
32681,Homer,"hm, it seems like a lot..."
23478,Homer,wait a minute.
40995,Homer,"you mean, if i want pork chops -- even in the middle of the night -- your guy'll fry 'em up?"
28495,Homer,"oh god, it's so unnecessary!"
26830,Homer,"aw, the poor thing's in pain. what he needs is a visit from kindly old dr. foot."
32557,Homer,"ow. ow. ow!!! three, two, one. owwwww!!!"
30901,Homer,"oh marge, thank god you're back! she made me spend time with the kids. and not just tv time. talking time!"
25044,Homer,"wait a minute. you're telling me the police force, the tv news, a courthouse full of people, and a popular entertainer had nothing better to do than to teach me and bart a lesson?"
36625,Homer,"they just leave the maple syrup on the table, huh? how about that? that's trust, huh?"
13657,Homer,"fun? where is this store, flanders? the merry old land of oz?"
22902,Homer,"well, you said i couldn't do it, but here it is! meet abby the olympic tabby."
27685,Homer,"so kids, its valentine's day, and you know what that means -- you get to stay downstairs watching tv with the sound turned way up."
36713,Homer,oh my god! you want me to help you escape?
33487,Homer,bart! don't forget to turn the chicken!
26827,Homer,"hey, hey, hey, no peeking."
20574,Homer,"ahh, i love these lazy saturdays."
28527,Homer,good-lookin' group.
39108,Homer,what albert taught us is that all people have pride and no group should ever be insulted. he knew what was important was how you lived your life every day...till he was taken from us too soon at the age of...
29137,Homer,"talk about boats! then when he asks you if you hate this country, you just start crying and pretend you don't."
18462,Homer,"mom, there's something you should know about me. i almost always spoil the moment."
13348,Homer,could you... give me a handful of peanuts... maude?
20912,Homer,you dropped somethin'.
33694,Homer,"aw, sweetie, you saved me. well, i promise that wherever you go in this world, i will always be there for you."
35395,Homer,is there anyone in here that just wants a haircut with no chitchat?
39724,Homer,"oooh. look at this one. ""the hammer of thor. it will send your pins to valhalla."" lisa?"
35562,Homer,"aww, that's what i call closure!"
17515,Homer,"uh, but i am a pilot."
36130,Homer,"boy, you like this necklace i just bought?"
40644,Homer,"marge, why did you let me sleep so late?"
27507,Homer,can and will. now to un-stop this sink.
20718,Homer,"hey, that's not fair! i wanna be a carny, too! can i, mister? huh? can i? please?"
27687,Homer,"children, so naïve."
22774,Homer,"i gave a rib to eve, and now she's gone forever."
18275,Homer,"i don't need any serving suggestions from you, you barbecue-wrecking know-nothing know-it-all."
32308,Homer,"and if elected president of our small community, i will determine once and for all how far we can go without being gay."
13335,Homer,no.
32910,Homer,"aw, ma. you always knew just how to make everything all right."
14996,Homer,"guys, please, could you give me five minutes?"
37849,Homer,dick fiddler!
29376,Homer,"sweetie, that's orphan talk."
24508,Homer,"hello, mister lobster."
38713,Homer,"hey man, can i bum a tent?"
35350,Homer,"um, i take a special size."
13697,Homer,i'll give you twenty bucks for it.
21398,Homer,lisa? lisa? lisa!
15173,Homer,i like stories.
21180,Homer,what do you want? his cholesterol's through the roof.
37208,Homer,those are pretty cute...
13300,Homer,"hey, just because i don't care doesn't mean i don't understand."
24352,Homer,"ooh, my first issue of ""self-test monthly."" finally i get to find out what makes me tick."
41291,Homer,i'm doing the best with what i got! all you feed me is reality shows!
18413,Homer,"hmmm, i can feel three kinds of softness."
22819,Homer,"well, of course. any kid would love to have this, uh... activity center. it teaches them while they learn."
34513,Homer,everything.
25067,Homer,marvelous! marvelous! enough! i grow weary of your sexually suggestive dancing.
14289,Homer,and not a day goes by that we don't thank god for all three of you.
23779,Homer,"hey, let's go skiing right now!"
18947,Homer,"now that you're all relaxed... most of us here were born in america. we take this country for granted. but not immigrants like apu. while the rest of us are drinking ourselves stupid, they're driving the cabs that get us home safely..."
26034,Homer,nobody's gonna kill you.
27125,Homer,can't you do it?
29080,Homer,"mr. simpson, do you think it's appropriate for a ten-year-old boy to steal a beer with intent to kiss?"
17505,Homer,"wow, classy."
14463,Homer,maggie?
14086,Homer,"if there was any justice, my face would be on a bunch of crappy merchandise."
39311,Homer,hmmmm. how could anyone make a word out of these lousy letters?
36675,Homer,wait a minute!
31990,Homer,"now that he's had a taste of human flesh, the dog will be a slave to its succulence! look at him eyeing me -- he knows i taste best."
28973,Homer,"so, um, you're not in the mood anymore, are you?"
39591,Homer,oh! oh! block it.
16954,Homer,"bart, you're coming home."
37585,Homer,"if you are a cat, prove it. do you hate mondays like garfield?"
37725,Homer,"aw, he probably sees a mouse he wants to tear in half."
40045,Homer,"marge, weren't you listening? this is a miracle breakthrough. not one of these cheapo sucker deals."
14573,Homer,"they're gonna win the championship, no thanks to me."
18355,Homer,"i'm not saying it isn't sleazy, honey. but try to see it my way. all my life i've been an obese man trapped inside a fat man's body."
40404,Homer,"ohhh, so you're gonna welch on our bet?!"
31314,Homer,"hey, i'm not done dancin'! this bulletin better swing!"
40622,Homer,"oh, i couldn't possibly."
18513,Homer,somebody ate those cookies.
34581,Homer,"ooh, a baby whale. my diet is working."
31565,Homer,terrible.
13518,Homer,"what did i tell you? i'll bet it's filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls..."
33773,Homer,"and to show you how this book works, i will demonstrate on some rats..."
37074,Homer,"all right, marge. maybe we're being a little too choosy about who our kids spend the rest of their lives with. we'll take what we can get."
38428,Homer,lots of pizza.
39826,Homer,"it won't happen again, sir. i promise. may i get out of your sight now?"
34685,Homer,you can't close! i'll have to go home and drink better beer at half the price in natural lighting!
27647,Homer,"look, flanders. i'm always interested in talking about free milk. and if there's cookies involved, so much the better."
39452,Homer,marge!
24115,Homer,"eh, how're they gonna find me?"
31044,Homer,"marge, i'm gonna take care of you until your amnesia goes scram-nesia. i got you flowers a fluffy pillow...and a nice, relaxing private room."
34194,Homer,"...yo no creía en fortunas, pero entonces me salió una galleta..."
32480,Homer,"now ignore all the fancy-shmancy thingamajigs, boy. we're just gonna get a camera battery and go home."
25725,Homer,"well, i can still hang out with you guys."
31794,Homer,that photo's mine. that photo's mine. that photo's mine.
36347,Homer,spoil-er!
24715,Homer,c'mon! get in there!
35314,Homer,y'see? you see how that boy pushes your buttons?
33983,Homer,marge simpson reporting for duty!
21111,Homer,does this make me look fat?
17829,Homer,krusty! oh thanks! thanks a lot! you came here to save me!
14473,Homer,hmmm.
27839,Homer,"no, the voters will decide that in november. i was talking about this."
41434,Homer,i never realized you had so much work done.
28758,Homer,"i'm sorry we wasted your time, your lordship."
36409,Homer,what the? am i losing my marbles?
41320,Homer,"hm... what to do, what to do?"
18549,Homer,hey! i don't remember saying that!
21817,Homer,"a, uh... division of, um... homer-co."
38427,Homer,yeah. nothin-- nothing's going on.
13974,Homer,"oh sure, great idea. i'd love to -- did you hear that?"
18100,Homer,"c'mon, we're family."
26876,Homer,mrs. bellamy's necklace!
31032,Homer,"okay weingartens, what else is in your mail?"
29309,Homer,"open-ended! c'mon, lisa. say everything's fine. everything's fine."
23636,Homer,"oh, you do love me!"
30194,Homer,"boy, i can't believe you got expelled. well, don't expect to spend all week lying around on the couch like a bum 'cause that's my thing!"
23031,Homer,see? even after all my cyber-squandering we've still got twelve hundred dollars.
26705,Homer,you name it.
15811,Homer,you guys must have been pretty worried about me.
36744,Homer,give it to me! / i can imagine it. / give me the gun! /
34742,Homer,yes! i mean no! i mean... you'll never get me!
33716,Homer,"ooh, lamb-kebab!"
28147,Homer,what are you screaming about? did you discover my snake farm? 'cause i can explain. i'm going to farm and sell snakes.
28998,Homer,"i knew if we got up early enough, we could sneak away from bart and lisa. kids don't beat me, i beat kids."
16992,Homer,i don't like this new director's cut.
27963,Homer,"don't be scared, you can do it!"
23336,Homer,"oh, lisa... you saved me! and after all the bad things i said about you."
38015,Homer,is she having an affair?
41155,Homer,likely story.
14219,Homer,"you know, i had this very same discussion with your mother ten years ago."
36091,Homer,and brace yourself: i put some thought into it.
33358,Homer,please! you've gotta have some secret agony! i bet those fancy shoes hurt your feet.
32438,Homer,that will never happen!
35388,Homer,"marge, when someone loses their hair, they miss it the most. it's like a beloved dog that died on your head."
18009,Homer,the man at the stand said it was a record!
19314,Homer,i sleep in a big bed with my wife.
28777,Homer,"marge, i've always loved you. bart, you were a worthy foe."
18905,Homer,now to drop gracefully through the windshield.
40962,Homer,herbert. herbert powell. great! where can i find him?
37562,Homer,a whole weekend away from my family. i can't believe i have to miss taking the kids to buy gym uniforms. send me a picture?
34112,Homer,"i know you miss him, boy. so let's you and me spend some quality father and son time."
37273,Homer,every time i try to fix things it just makes things worse. but i'm gonna fix this!
39380,Homer,i'm fine. i'm just thinking.
32675,Homer,"you'd think so, but..."
19947,Homer,"hey, why don't you try the old folks home? they practically live in their own filth!"
35888,Homer,i regret nothing... except this part!
40503,Homer,it's no trouble. i've got a whole garageful of tools i never use.
37987,Homer,"squeeze here. rotate there. pause for sweet talk. oh glasses, you're so wonderful."
39962,Homer,"one, please."
36095,Homer,yeah.
16816,Homer,"aw, uncle homer. ned, since you've let me spend time with your family, i want you to get to know my family."
18005,Homer,"aw, no..."
36848,Homer,"honey, i'm not cool. i was never cool. i didn't go to college. every cd i have i bought at a carwash. black-and-white films make me angry. i can't pronounce ""artis-anal."" i only know david cross from the chipmunks movie. not only do i like van halen, but i think they keep getting better..."
23063,Homer,whew. all that seizing made me hungry.
14649,Homer,let me pet him again!
39963,Homer,"marge, i uh... love you. marge, honey, i love you. ohhh... marge, i love you, baby. hmm, marge, sweetie, hooney, honey... aah, this'll never work."
14970,Homer,is that what i think it is?
37494,Homer,"okay, let's see what this thing says."
27870,Homer,you noticed! i've been using lancôme.
22324,Homer,football's so great.
18136,Homer,"that's okay, son. i'll take care of him."
35598,Homer,"hey bart... i mean, jesus. hey son, you want flanders to kill anybody? he's totally in my power."
23447,Homer,"yeah, it'll be fun. fresh country air, apples for the pickin'... sing-along hayrides..."
38431,Homer,"oh god, oh god, i'm the smart parent."
31471,Homer,you used to love it!
27481,Homer,yes...
35840,Homer,"good one, boy."
19982,Homer,yes. this is homer simpson from america. who may i say is speaking to me?
25322,Homer,"no, of course not. now aim for your mother's heart."
18517,Homer,"quick, down to the fallout shelter! the bombs are dropping!"
23458,Homer,now we're talkin'!
17274,Homer,daaaa-vid lettermaaaan!
32236,Homer,d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh / woo woo woo woo woo woo hoo / stu stu stu stu-pid flanders...
34835,Homer,"hey, if it hadn't been me, it would have been someone or something else. sooner or later, everyone meets their ""homer."""
18406,Homer,"y, y... what the heck are you doing over there?"
29903,Homer,"all right, then you can just look at the portrait i painted of him."
24692,Homer,"oop, wait a minute..."
30604,Homer,do i have to hang out with them?
15420,Homer,"y'know, maggie, the sooner kids talk, the sooner they talk back."
29876,Homer,"wait, did i add that right?"
19426,Homer,but i need it!
32018,Homer,"oh, i'm just glad you taste like hot dogs!"
26281,Homer,that wasn't part of the deal!
25386,Homer,"yep, a shiny new apple."
36418,Homer,you know what wood makes the best ventriloquist dummy: maple. how many hardboiled eggs do you think i can eat?
16381,Homer,heh heh. you don't have a son.
29867,Homer,a sign!
35242,Homer,"come on, surrender to the moment! don't make the mistake i always do of thinking too much before you act!"
13410,Homer,to those weirdos in the worm store.
21346,Homer,"homer simpson here. i've sent the sherpas home and i'm heading for the top, solo."
16838,Homer,whatcha doin'?
28396,Homer,why does a bear need a crowbar?
38826,Homer,"you're all right, stupid flanders. you're all right."
37480,Homer,it's no use. we're perfectly matched.
22533,Homer,i am so sick of that damn code!
31446,Homer,marge's show!
31805,Homer,"ten and two, einstein!"
34576,Homer,shark week just got cancelled.
15867,Homer,"homer's not here, man."
22845,Homer,all right.
27772,Homer,"c'mon, boy. you're not too old to kiss your daddy's monitor."
18740,Homer,"no tongue, eh? how did he talk and eat and laugh and love?"
23567,Homer,"in your face, to-do list!"
20041,Homer,"good morning, fellow employee. you'll notice that i am now a model worker. we should continue this conversation later during the designated break period. sincerely, homer simpson."
13615,Homer,ooh... and miss? just one more question --
22780,Homer,"oh, there, there, i'm sure he's gone to a better place, lord."
33697,Homer,and i'm good at beginnings.
15401,Homer,"ah, homer j. simpson, you're a genius."
39670,Homer,honey! honey! we're saved!
24760,Homer,"okay, so we can't pay for your precious food. what are you gonna do about it?"
13562,Homer,okay. five times nine.
37796,Homer,can i just say goodbye to him quick?
31165,Homer,cancellations require twenty-four hours no-tice.
30421,Homer,i guess we should count our blessings he's not dead.
39576,Homer,"marge, are you all right?"
21708,Homer,yoink.
22172,Homer,and you are how old?
21695,Homer,"if anyone wants me, i'll be eating alone in the basement."
15949,Homer,"who cares? anyway, it all happened during that magical summer of 1985... a maturing joe piscopo left ""saturday night live"" to conquer hollywood... people express introduced a generation of hicks to plane travel...and i was in a barbershop quartet..."
31268,Homer,"to daddy, the real world gets fainter and fainter every day."
36867,Homer,fine. keep 'em. but you have to give back... lisa?!
21510,Homer,"okay, this bacon's done."
23955,Homer,"help, pirates!"
33252,Homer,"up-bup-bup! don't eat that, sweetie, it's poison."
18994,Homer,i'll never be part of the scene again!
14673,Homer,"ooh, a redneck bar."
37488,Homer,carl spent all our money on this stupid page from a stupid saga.
27784,Homer,quit crowding the plate!
21075,Homer,bart!
27298,Homer,don't look at me!
20222,Homer,"what, flanders."
23586,Homer,"hey, i thought you never talked."
24791,Homer,little help?
23566,Homer,woo hoo! this is the greatest day of my life!
40022,Homer,"burning the candle at both ends, eh boy? go get 'em."
18769,Homer,"uh-huh. but this is the chair, right?"
21099,Homer,"oh, no you don't!"
15568,Homer,"don't hassle the dead, boy. they have eerie powers."
38106,Homer,"okay. you know, i love him too. in a manly way that never shows itself."
27584,Homer,"psst, mr. hawk. may i have a word with you?"
35374,Homer,"fine, whatever."
36466,Homer,"why you little... they're both bad, and i suspect you know it!"
19091,Homer,"marge! i've got a new job! it's with globex corporation. i get more money plus health benefits, for me and my life partner. and they'll move us and give us a nice house and..."
27918,Homer,"well, i guess we could afford one nice trip."
20771,Homer,they mushed it all out of shape.
33512,Homer,"well, i guess we can take a quick walk. we'll keep grampa occupied with this dvd of dwight eisenhower talking about golf."
32556,Homer,bo-ring.
19520,Homer,"oh, yeah? well, when i came to, i was covered with a sticky translucent goo! explain that!"
28793,Homer,"hey, i paid for this popcorn and i'm eating it."
30545,Homer,"today marks a new dawn for springfield. this salamander is sitting on eggs labeled ""elder care"", ""flex-time,"" and ""downtown pedestrian mall."" and those eggs are ready to hatch!"
28710,Homer,"rollin', rollin', rollin' / toxic barrel rollin'"
20302,Homer,they're in my hair! they're in my hair!
32021,Homer,perfecto. everybody smile. i'm going to set the automatic timer.
24367,Homer,i've only got three more years to live!
34877,Homer,"all finished, boy."
36220,Homer,woo hoo! thank god it's t.g.i.f!
19130,Homer,"sir, i need to know where i can get some business hammocks."
14887,Homer,check... mate.
21397,Homer,these are for you if you let me use your cherry picker.
14097,Homer,"oooh! look at me, i'm making people happy. i'm the magical man from happyland in a gum drop house on lollipop lane!"
22219,Homer,"slave girl? oh, slave girl?"
22711,Homer,"great. i'll write your mother and tell her the marriage is off. and then when the paperwork is done, i'll make gwenn my wife."
15975,Homer,i stuck him somewhere.
18613,Homer,because i'm trying to reduce my boredom.
37321,Homer,where can i find a better voice-activated search machine?
40501,Homer,"you know, marge, you make the best pork chops in the whole world."
15889,Homer,not me!
19118,Homer,doh!
27996,Homer,"aw, it was probably that stupid cat."
18503,Homer,"jump, boy! i gotcha!"
40439,Homer,"well uh, we did kinda yell at him... and sent him to his room... and tried to force him to apologize to his sister."
23470,Homer,move the handbrake...
33265,Homer,i want to apologize for being such a jerk at dinner. and i thought the best way to do that would be to come to your house and poke around.
20918,Homer,"you're a genius, moe. all your troubles will soon be over for a couple months."
15362,Homer,daddy.
36214,Homer,"woo-hoo! i'm dry! come on, everybody! feel daddy's underpants!"
19791,Homer,well... but... wait a minute. bart's not fixed yet! he hasn't even --
19656,Homer,"didn't he lisa? didn't he? hey, wait a minute, he didn't!"
18691,Homer,"you should've held out longer, boy."
18632,Homer,and for the man who has everything: a tie rack motor!
23352,Homer,"hey maude, i'm home. uh-oh. i think i'm having a heart attack."
30360,Homer,and you won't... unless you can leap through fire!
35710,Homer,"here's fifty bucks. for the next two hours, i don't want to know you exist."
31747,Homer,"a thousand, eh?"
36864,Homer,what? no one judges my wife's thunderbags! well maybe i was wrong about these people. who ever thought a cool person could be a jerk?
13339,Homer,bart! come over here.
33049,Homer,"is that him? no, it's just a bush. clearly the work of wirakocha, the trickster god."
15389,Homer,"eh, you don't want to hear that story. i know! i'll tell you about the time i got locked in the bank vault with mr. mooney. it was another one of my hair-brained schemes."
15278,Homer,"but marge, alan thicke is throwing knives at ricardo montalban."
22859,Homer,"all right, how about a million?"
22891,Homer,"that's for the courts to decide, son."
18899,Homer,where are you two going at this hour?
40354,Homer,flanders! what are you doing here?
35187,Homer,"now, let's chain him in the basement until the circus gets to town."
28353,Homer,"hey, this place is amazing. it's fit for a duke, or even an earl..."
15047,Homer,"how about you, barney?"
13819,Homer,"marge, don't flake out on me. that monkey's paw is gonna make our dreams come true."
32888,Homer,"that's what your mouth says, but my ears are too smart to believe it. in fact, i don't even want your pie."
23605,Homer,"oooh, morlocks... chuds... mole people!"
33070,Homer,"talk louder? you bet. naturally, i threw my old chair in the dumpster right away. but then lenny said ""no, that was the new chair. that memo was two months old!"" so now i'm sitting on an orange crate. i never felt so--"
23847,Homer,"remember my love affair with ali mcgraw? she used to call me ""preppy."" then she died."
17441,Homer,enchiladas.
33758,Homer,aren't you the one that usually worries about stuff?
30953,Homer,"uh... duh... uh... um... uh... duh... did i say ""um""?"
30698,Homer,and my dream is to someday wear a real wetsuit instead of one that is just painted on.
34883,Homer,danica patrick in my thoughts!
33712,Homer,big deal! i could juggle five pins if they let me use a unicycle.

19032,Homer,i only get two weeks of vacation a year -- and you want me to spend it in your lousy beach house?
20369,Homer,"oops, guess it already was on."
30015,Homer,"well, moe's getting a big screen tv in february. just in time for the pro bowl. maybe this time my beloved blue shirts will win."
40859,Homer,whooo!

22555,Homer,shut up! screw you guys!
16820,Homer,"hiya, flanders! oooh... dinner! may i join you?"
39846,Homer,"i also want my boy to find out that you're more than just a belly. i want him to meet the woman behind all the spangles and glitter and find out that she has thoughts and feelings, too."
14448,Homer,good bye? where's my clean underwear?
28306,Homer,i still don't know why you had that photo enlarged.
35188,Homer,it better be tonsillitis.
28887,Homer,"i have an awful confession to make: you didn't crash that car, it was me. i put you behind the wheel and i'm so, so, so sorry."
38276,Homer,then that makes me the jackie robinson of the sport. and you are the racist philadelphia manager!
31306,Homer,"marge, to keep you in my life, i'd do anything. there must be some way to turn my problem into a positive for the community."
17599,Homer,you outrank mr. burns here?
21728,Homer,ooh. how are bart and lisa gonna get out of this one?
15732,Homer,when i was 17 / i drank some very good beer / i drank some very good beer i purchased with a fake i.d. / my name was brian mcgee / i stayed up listening to queen
39465,Homer,"look at that, kids! no fighting, no yelling..."
34027,Homer,"hey carl, why aren't you high-fiving?"
21618,Homer,"now, here's my ""everything's okay"" alarm."
35035,Homer,"hey, marge. partaking of the grape, were we?"
23980,Homer,"it's b.t.o.! they're canada's answer to e.l.p. their big hit was ""t.c.b."" that's how we talked in the '70s. we didn't have a moment to spare."
19341,Homer,ooh! you're feisty. i'm gonna give you a madonna cut.
26071,Homer,you're going to ask her to marry you?!
41560,Homer,"gimme a beer, moe."

16013,Homer,go home.
31991,Homer,"oh relax, marge, i'm just messin' with ya. i know i'm not a dog. i'm a people, like you."
23253,Homer,who cares? that man can really slug.
31591,Homer,ah! nothin' beats taking a family drive with our new satellite radio.
28633,Homer,keep me focused.
20855,Homer,"welcome to the internet, my friend. how can i help you?"
14898,Homer,sounds interesting.
28106,Homer,"oh, it's too tight! take it off! take it off! take it off!"
13506,Homer,"lisa, i don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange and your father is trying to worry."
29241,Homer,and check this out.
25106,Homer,"all right, first item: i lost our life savings in the stock market. now, let's move on to the real issue: lisa's hogging of the maple syrup."
31381,Homer,moe's the princess of lollipop land! he lunches on lavender and potpourri!
36434,Homer,"well, i better get going -- this is startin' to feel a little churchy."
19759,Homer,you! i should have known!
34951,Homer,"chief, this is just a big misunderstanding. i meant to write ""bride."" it's a wedding present."
21078,Homer,uhhh... it's my first day!
33135,Homer,marge? is that you?
37023,Homer,"goodbye, my electrical friends. i can't afford to use you, so i'm doing what any good american would do -- throw you away."
32826,Homer,"okay, they bought it."
40566,Homer,five hundred thousand dollars!
32919,Homer,"to spare, eh?"
20978,Homer,everybody hates birds! ...right!
21627,Homer,"in the olden times, if you were watching tv and nature called, you'd have to get up and walk to the bathroom. it was the hardest thing in the world to do. but now, with the lazy man reclining toilet chair, you can just lean back and let 'er rip."
38266,Homer,hey! look at me! i'm going up a slide!
41327,Homer,"hello, this is homer simpson, a.k.a. ""happy dude."" the court has ordered me to call every person in town to apologize for my telemarketing scam. i'm sorry. if you can find it in your heart to forgive me, send one dollar to sorry dude, 742 evergreen terrace, springfield... you have the power."
31245,Homer,...annnd done.
40179,Homer,"though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou --"
13302,Homer,i don't think you realize what you're saying.
36074,Homer,all right! you caught us. what are you gonna do about it? throw us out of town again?
26707,Homer,come on... unfold you...
35094,Homer,step away from the traitor!
16456,Homer,"i, as well. are you happy, jeeves?"
14210,Homer,... ...
23644,Homer,and these bean bag chairs look so comfortable.
24605,Homer,not a single word of warning.
37695,Homer,i was gonna be king of cheeseburger mountain. did i change or did they stop making mountains out of cheeseburgers? probably a little bit of both.
20025,Homer,it is. it is. but first let me introduce you to my family. my perfect family.
26277,Homer,i'm only doin' this one more time.
28624,Homer,the business of being a dad. can you hand me that magnet?
26175,Homer,"oh, we'll see about that."
13514,Homer,"okay, here's the plan. you can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. and i'll... die in a gutter. it's practical and within our means."
30700,Homer,"hey guys, we found the treasure! when i get to shore, i'm bringin' it right to the bar."
23282,Homer,"how about ""screw flanders""?"
18215,Homer,yeah! gimme all the dirt!
35103,Homer,do you have plans for tonight?
33651,Homer,"marge, i hope this day is as perfect for you, as the day we met was for me. you always find the one grain of sugar in the salt shaker that is i. with each marriage i get a little better -- maybe after a thousand, i'll be worthy of you."
27045,Homer,"hey, you want my keys?"
19450,Homer,"aw, i hate this place! why am i here?!"
20414,Homer,game's out there! made you look...
37450,Homer,"and i'm sixty-nine, because people always laugh when you say sixty-nine. no one knows why."
14099,Homer,moe... moe... moe...
22970,Homer,can you believe i'm a size four? woo!
15682,Homer,can you believe flanders threw out a perfectly good toothbrush?
25287,Homer,"so barney's like ""you're on your own, dude,"" and i'm like ""not even."""
31855,Homer,"son, i'll never understand women if i live to be forty."
36813,Homer,old man... i'm not an old man... this drawing doesn't think i'm old.
32343,Homer,"the problem is, you don't share my interest in not being with you."
18277,Homer,lisa! lisa!
35442,Homer,"so long, suckers!"
39905,Homer,"honey, i'm home."
18959,Homer,"but this is grand funk railroad! you guys back there know grand funk, right?"
21307,Homer,uhh... don't you have anything healthy here?
29551,Homer,have you tried checking the oil filter?
14427,Homer,"marge, can you take my ball to nick's today? a bottle cap got lodged in the finger hole."
38858,Homer,prove it.
38590,Homer,woo hoo!
16138,Homer,i'm writing a delicious send up of mr. burns for his birthday party. is poo poo one word or two?
13848,Homer,how hard can it be?
28530,Homer,"and i filed down all the sharp corners. see, your eye is completely safe."
30593,Homer,"oh, well... i try to have a good time."
13149,Homer,i couldn't see her through the flaps. but she's my kinda girl...
26934,Homer,"you're pushing your luck, pal."
41135,Homer,"all right, everybody stick together. we don't want to get separated..."
19694,Homer,i prefer to listen to cheap trick.
17866,Homer,"marge, we had a deal. your sisters don't come here after six, and i stop eating your lipstick."
37921,Homer,"yeah, and why don't they make a sequel to ""taken"" where the ""hangover"" guys get taken and the only ones that can rescue them is ""fast and furious."""
27098,Homer,"well, whaddaya think?"
40736,Homer,"so, what are you in for?"
14553,Homer,ha ha. cops can't win!
29602,Homer,"two hundred bucks a couple, eh?"
26726,Homer,"oh, i am..."
32983,Homer,"ned, i never thought i'd say this, but we make a great team."
29324,Homer,more!
29971,Homer,"that freeloading fatso! marge, could you cut back on your makeup budget?"
35974,Homer,"and that, kids, is how you stick it to the towne centre real estate investment trust. no, no, no. woo hoo!"
39400,Homer,"ah, what a great family! but come on, we all know this is small potatoes. there is a danger in this town that is bigger than all the dips put together."
17990,Homer,"so, hugh. have you heard all the latest american jokes? uh, here's a good one. pull my finger."
27570,Homer,that's right! crawling on your knees!
21548,Homer,"uhhhh... we're, uh, new foreign exchange students from, uh... um... scotland."
16093,Homer,really? but nerds are my mortal enemy.
36814,Homer,"don't you, drawing?"
35794,Homer,"please, lisa. i had eighteen martinis today."
15280,Homer,"well, i got him as good as he got me."
22315,Homer,they won't?
34620,Homer,"i hear what you're saying, lisa -- nothing."
35054,Homer,but you do like comic books.
13664,Homer,"keep your pants on, flanders! i'm wishing as fast as i can!"
24979,Homer,"what have you done, you clumsy little ox?! that cake was for your deaf sister!"
39706,Homer,"oh please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please."
38636,Homer,"you don't know anything about hydraulic fracturing! you've just been brainwashed by liberal tv shows who use ""fracking"" as an easy bad guy. but it can save this country!"
34844,Homer,that would be one weird-looking kid.
27489,Homer,the grass is actually greener on flanders' side.
22412,Homer,"hmmmm, i guess i could... but while i'm gone, keep an eye on that weird-looking kid down there."
35427,Homer,"uh, first the good news... two of your kids are not locked in the car."
40101,Homer,no.
14227,Homer,"finally, the big day came. we didn't have much money, so we went to a quaint little chapel just across the state line."
22000,Homer,i'm done.
30000,Homer,"i don't miss meat at all. this portobello mushroom eats like a steak. a rubbery, fungus-like steak."
14721,Homer,"marge, lurleen's gonna be a big success and whether you like it or not, i'm going to be there."
40881,Homer,get out of my house! i don't wanna associate with criminals.
31584,Homer,"well, handsome here was in big trouble...when suddenly..."
41010,Homer,"all right. wooo, what's that doohickey?"
33029,Homer,"yeah, but you hold onto the big things! the point is, the more i got to know you, the more i got to like you."
37326,Homer,"yes, my love?"
28068,Homer,"sorry, i got a lot on my mind."
36390,Homer,"honey, it's me again. i can't work knowing that you're mad at me. i just wanna hear your voice. and i'm counting the minutes till the whistle blows, then i go to moe's, then i rush home to you."
37110,Homer,"sure you wanted the fun parts, but do you want to go to their little league games and recitals?"
26602,Homer,i'll regroup at red lobster!
25151,Homer,"it's bill pullman, you fool!"
40550,Homer,"you don't have to do that, mr. burns. i can throw myself out."
18997,Homer,"i don't think i have a choice, marge."
39716,Homer,"here you go, son. share the wealth, that's what i always say."
31260,Homer,"now as i see it, the problem with this roller coaster is there are too many boring ""going-up"" parts."
18542,Homer,"young man, in this house, we use a little word called ""please""..."
16712,Homer,"thank you, thank you very much!"
23350,Homer,"wow, it sure is slippery up here."
23398,Homer,you're right. i gotta let it go. all that counts is we're alive and rubbing elbows with the greats.
19478,Homer,"hey, barney! soul mate! let me buy you a beer."
21245,Homer,aren't you tired of having to peel that last snotty kleenex from the bottom of your wastebasket?
21363,Homer,hi.
18480,Homer,hey!
16281,Homer,hi guys!
28646,Homer,we'll clean out those stupid americans.
39581,Homer,where's the video boxing?
27974,Homer,hmm... needs beer.
36874,Homer,what happened here?
19354,Homer,"well, it was like that when i got here. it really was."
13530,Homer,you! you did this to me!
37027,Homer,"parking meter, you're workin' for me now."
20603,Homer,what about me? you didn't thank me.
36463,Homer,i sure envy him.
24058,Homer,i know. no more being a jerk.
22608,Homer,good ol' government.
33951,Homer,"okay look, there's a big football game on tonight, so we can get this thing over real quick. show me some of bart's artwork, give me a little false hope, and here's a little something to help with his grades."
16002,Homer,and i did.
25491,Homer,we don't need your high-priced safety junk!
18354,Homer,"yuh-huh, that's the deal. no more exercise program! no more traffic! no more blood drives or charity walks!"
26358,Homer,"this round's on me, moe. i got a big payday comin'."
15814,Homer,"oooh, ahh. ha! got him!"
22521,Homer,not entirely.
25026,Homer,"anyhoo, the whole nightmare has really made us sleepy. let's hit the hay."
38488,Homer,eat your broccoli.
16408,Homer,"son, there's something i was gonna give you at the end of this trip, but since we may not survive, i want you to have it now."
23984,Homer,work out!
17289,Homer,look at that! i'm the first non- brazilian person to travel backwards through time!
15455,Homer,"well actually, we gave it all up for a pinball machine in the lounge."
26475,Homer,"dad, get up."
33924,Homer,"what'd you think, kids?"
16031,Homer,"relax, marge. i tied up all the loose ends before we left."
27043,Homer,i've had just about enough of you.
18018,Homer,"don't worry. we'll catch him, or run him over tryin'."
41073,Homer,"oh, so that's your little plan! get us addicted, then jack up the price! well, you win."
27613,Homer,that sounds like a magical family moment. i'm sorry i won't be there.
15451,Homer,spare me your medical mumbo jumbo.
32569,Homer,right.
22401,Homer,i can't understand what happened. why did they change homer simpson's character from cool to stupid?
33674,Homer,"moe, what are you doing?"
38120,Homer,fine. your generation did its part when it won world war two and created the rockford files. i've got this one.
15507,Homer,i guess this is the time to tell you...
41265,Homer,oh glory of glories! oh heavenly testament to the eternal majesty of god's creation!
29562,Homer,today we're working on poor sportsmanship.
37665,Homer,overstay my welcome for forty years?
40097,Homer,you did?
35327,Homer,"lisa, don't feel bad. judas betrayed jesus but he still got paid."
34423,Homer,water!
31154,Homer,let's compromise and say nobody said it.
36119,Homer,what?
28240,Homer,"look mom, look! i'm riding by myself!"
31666,Homer,bart! this is a matter of life and death: what is the difference between ketchup and catsup?
25514,Homer,"yeah, you know down the line, you might want to switch to a nice round buddha."
19454,Homer,"yeah, that's me all right."
26422,Homer,"there she is, boy."
21132,Homer,"c'mon... where are you?... here, trilly, trilly."
37995,Homer,only five pancakes? you're trying to kill me!
20129,Homer,"oh, i can't take it anymore. all right, i'll only be gone for a second."
31477,Homer,"son, we all have to do things we don't want to. like have jobs and families and responsibilities, and having to be mr. funny all the time -- you think i wouldn't rather be living nude in the forest? like some ancient pagan! just dancing around playing the pan flute! and here we are!"
21721,Homer,"i'll show you, hair!"
25329,Homer,did you hear that? she said we're goin' down!
21870,Homer,"well, there were script problems from day one."
31049,Homer,why you little...
41301,Homer,"there he is. the fat, pathetic slob i'd be with four kids."
34647,Homer,"today's the first, which means it was last month, which means you're being ridiculous."
35498,Homer,"time the cameras just right,"
36594,Homer,"wow, an auto mechanic who tells the truth."
32185,Homer,"my back! it hurts, and not in a good way!"
32705,Homer,"sorry, maggie."
28117,Homer,"oh my god, that's my wife, and she's crying."
21760,Homer,"well, way out in the sticks like this, it could only be hillbillies."
20205,Homer,i'll give ya fifty bucks.
19543,Homer,"oh, i suppose you're going to mock me, too."
35128,Homer,"well, i guess i do have a ""type."""
13693,Homer,"sorry, flanders."
33063,Homer,"well marge, you did have that one sip of alcohol while you were pregnant..."
27453,Homer,"listen kids, your mom is going to be living in the basement. but with our love, she'll get better soon."
35180,Homer,nerd.
35830,Homer,and people will see my tattoo of donald duck smoking a doob! that was for marge's eyes only! oh my god!
31944,Homer,any moment...
22842,Homer,"good work, honey. keep it comin'."
35948,Homer,congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes... no new states shall be formed or erected within the jurisdiction of any other staaaate...
21613,Homer,"thanks, sucker!"
19155,Homer,"aw, those jerks. always walking over the small businessman. don't get me started about the government."
31685,Homer,"now that i'm super-wealthy, i can buy them whatever their hearts desire. that's why rich kids turn out so well."
31503,Homer,now lisa won't know about death till it strikes someone close to her.
26519,Homer,those were my friends?!
21807,Homer,yes?
40188,Homer,"come back here now, raven"
35679,Homer,"fine. blow off ""fun dad,"" go eat your walrus mustaches and deep-fried pixie wangs."
30046,Homer,lisa.
21909,Homer,ohh... we're never gonna freak anybody out with this music. i brought something from my personal stash that'll blow some minds.
29202,Homer,what kind of bread?
30183,Homer,"oh, i was just driving around the mid-atlantic states, ringin' doorbells at random, and i just... oh, who am i fooling with my awesome lies? i want you to come back to springfield."
19826,Homer,going to that fancy waterfront party tomorrow.
16521,Homer,"marge, we need to talk. you're spending too much time at the casino, and i think you may have a problem..."
33067,Homer,you ruin everything! /
28170,Homer,ow! i'll reap! i'll reap already!
17502,Homer,i'm not going to dignify that with an answer.
28196,Homer,this counts as a bath!
19676,Homer,"come to bed, marge."
33395,Homer,"hey, debbie, um... wanna go to prom with me?"

35110,Homer,so... chicken.
33460,Homer,no problem.
38920,Homer,"no. marge, if i lose my job in this economy, it's a death sentence. oh, i guess, as a fallback, i could direct films like angelina jolie. how many properties do we have an option on?"
18294,Homer,hello? yes? oh! uh... if you're looking for that big donut of yours... uh... flanders has it. just smash open his house.
16410,Homer,thanks boy. now be careful when you...
30211,Homer,that's my favorite game. i just can't remember what to yell out when you win.
13433,Homer,are you?
24253,Homer,"let's go, marge. c'mon, c'mon, c'mon!"
27679,Homer,"beat it, waxie."
26625,Homer,"okay, let's see: ""toke as needed. caution: objects may appear more edible than they actually are."""
19351,Homer,it doesn't matter. all i want to know is: will you make me the luckiest guy in the world... again?
26176,Homer,"one, two, three."
32412,Homer,cha-ching!
33492,Homer,yes.
23925,Homer,"just a second, marge. hello! thailand? how's everything on your end? uh-huh. that's some language you got there. and you talk like that twenty-four seven, huh?"
34939,Homer,sh!
25568,Homer,you have failed.
25824,Homer,when did that happen?
25431,Homer,"you're moving the team to albuquerque, aren't you?"
20585,Homer,open a window.
19569,Homer,"what do you need to make money for anyway? as long as i have my earning power, this family's got nothing to worry about."
23939,Homer,"marge, you know i normally listen to you, but i've gotta seize this opportunity. just in case i never become a real billionaire."
38191,Homer,"sounds delicious. it's not. hey, a friend of mine, uh, bought a painting here."
15046,Homer,"moe, have you ever felt unattractive?"
39520,Homer,"come on, bart, we don't want your mother to see you crying. here, let me help you dry those tears."
31145,Homer,"shut up, my ten o'clock's here."
32930,Homer,i don't think so.
38988,Homer,the best. wonder what ever happened to him.
18051,Homer,"man, these are primo seats. i could really go for a hot dog."
40952,Homer,"this makes me feel special, dad. since i'm the one you kept, that must mean you really love me."
27168,Homer,let's hear it.
14421,Homer,"please, please, please..."
21682,Homer,"all right, young lady. i want you to march yourself directly to the kwik-e-mart and get me some chips and a beer."
24646,Homer,you're right. we've got to block them from our sight with a giant wall.
34167,Homer,they took away our donuts at work! all i've had are my meals!
35967,Homer,we got america fever / we got america fever!
28425,Homer,"don't worry, i'll find you someplace safe."
17193,Homer,shut up. i'm over as far as i can go!
28822,Homer,"inseminate myself? dudes, i think this guy's comin' on to me."
17442,Homer,"marge, there's just too much pressure... what with my job, the kids, traffic snarls, political strife at home and abroad... but i promise you, the second all those things go away, we'll have sex."
35092,Homer,where is he going?
22378,Homer,"dog, cat?"
18207,Homer,oh no! in the eyes of god they'll be flanderseseseses!
18198,Homer,garbage in garbage can. makes sense.
19409,Homer,"yeah, it's a lazy dog-dangling afternoon. but something's a little off..."
22870,Homer,with ham!
26575,Homer,"look marge, i'm brazilian."
20076,Homer,i guess.
36810,Homer,grampa?!
18961,Homer,"for more information on grand funk, consult your school library!"
37186,Homer,your hair is growing back! tell me your secret!
38822,Homer,"flanders, are you crying?"
19523,Homer,"yes. remember, it's the same day as the dog's?"
30383,Homer,"goodbye, thanks for coming. if my party made you sick, tell your friends!"
27139,Homer,i hate reality shows...
16357,Homer,"it means he gets results, you stupid chief."
34217,Homer,why you little...
25088,Homer,"i'd like to withdraw my life savings, please. and hurry!"
29193,Homer,"see, lisa? instead of one big shot controlling all the media, now there's a thousand freaks xeroxing their worthless opinions."
30054,Homer,"oh, i love you, dumpster-bons."
33518,Homer,"see, i told you, it's not raining. so we're just homeless."
36464,Homer,"i mean i envy flanders, once again enjoying the joys of marriage. let's put it to a vote, america."
15500,Homer,"oh, my little maggie, i may never hold you again... ew, stinky pants."
41190,Homer,"shut up, boy."
30965,Homer,marge?
28384,Homer,"goodbye, old friend. i'll think of you whenever i have a stroke or a heart attack."
30833,Homer,springfield high football rules!
33140,Homer,okay.
15133,Homer,are you kidding? lisa turned out perfect. i won't stand here and listen to you bad-mouthing lisa!
13975,Homer,how much?
21488,Homer,gil! thank god it's you. you gotta help us.
39704,Homer,maybe.
33871,Homer,"marge, i need some bribe money!"
24606,Homer,joan collins? that girl sleeps with everybody!
20346,Homer,"hey, it's a handgun! isn't it great? this is the trigger... and this is the thing you point at whatever you want to die..."
36584,Homer,would you go to the prom with me?
21086,Homer,ask your mother.
36757,Homer,"get him! i mean, woo hoo!"
39313,Homer,hey! no abbreviations!
28701,Homer,in marge's book i was so mean and you were so nice. how can i be more like you? just give me some advice.
18996,Homer,i'm fine.
20399,Homer,now wait a second. you doctors have been telling us to drink eight glasses of gravy a day!
36720,Homer,could you please not sound like you like it so much?
19765,Homer,homer storms out.
29138,Homer,"there there, save your lies for the american public."
20405,Homer,"fun, too."
18848,Homer,donut?
20964,Homer,bo-ring!
32182,Homer,will the tragedies that stalk this family never cease?
25364,Homer,"all right, now here's the 411: i'm a record producer, see. i'm starting a new boy band and there's a place in it for bart."
30125,Homer,uh-oh.
20901,Homer,"oh, it's probably due to your ugliness. but that doesn't mean we can't find you a woman. come on, we're goin' to the darkest bar in town."
27866,Homer,way ahead of you.
27340,Homer,michael jackson just told me to shut up!
39299,Homer,"ah, forget it. let's go."
20417,Homer,"no, no. no, no, no. it's just that, well, like i was yelling earlier, it seems like anyone with half a brain could coach better than you."
23172,Homer,no time talk! need steal car! must save powerful but controversial movie!
21555,Homer,seventy-six point two?! but i'm already thirty-eight point one! i've wasted half my life!
27841,Homer,quit changing the subject. how do you feel about me right now?
26850,Homer,"...so i threw the super ball so hard it hit the ceiling twice, then broke a lamp."
19482,Homer,huh. what's that blinking light?
29375,Homer,"honey, all you need's a little help from your dad. remember, i did used to work at a science factory."
31386,Homer,"ah, a family trip with the family bartender -- what could be better?"
32008,Homer,ol' betsy'll get us there.
39112,Homer,can i ask you something? what is it that keeps you with me?
16278,Homer,two.
13347,Homer,all right then.
13602,Homer,"marge, look at them staring at that idiot box. god forbid they would ever read something and improve their minds."
30680,Homer,"so, i infer from all the knickknacks you're some sort of fruitcake."
15695,Homer,"yeah, syrup is better than jelly."
27404,Homer,"hello, this is a phone survey. if the election were held today, would you vote for ""a"" the cops are there, or ""b"" you are free to talk?"
29785,Homer,cool.
14120,Homer,that'd be great.
15497,Homer,"gee, thanks, guys."
16022,Homer,i got ya.
40948,Homer,the hospital? y'ello... oh my god!
34987,Homer,"well, i guess i could tell him he could improve his phone etiquette."
24035,Homer,"son, go get me a trash bag."
20905,Homer,"let's get out of here, moe. this is goin' nowhere."
17856,Homer,"yeah, there's a lot more mucus!"

34895,Homer,oh baby! well whaddaya know! oh come on!
35531,Homer,it's best to concentrate on what you do have.
16562,Homer,"aw, honey. i didn't realize how much that horn meant to you. don't worry. daddy's gonna get it back. i don't know how, but i'll figure out something."
29663,Homer,"that's it, mister. i am disgruntled. and up until now, i was relatively gruntled!"
28255,Homer,"geez, pal."
32744,Homer,"thanks, son."
14736,Homer,"that's great, honey. say, have you seen my rattlesnake hatband?"
22271,Homer,losers.

36965,Homer,america can't collapse! we're as powerful as ancient rome!
38262,Homer,cleats.
21673,Homer,i rolled up all the socks.

29452,Homer,smoked salmon... shrimp... crab legs!
18452,Homer,"""youngest daughter..."" well, how about this? this thing says my mother's still alive. she died when i was a kid."
26149,Homer,"now all we need is our astronaut. bart, where's america's newest hero?"
41038,Homer,ooo.
36892,Homer,just call me deforest kelley. i gotta write that down and send it to conan.
35995,Homer,you never showed it to me.
21467,Homer,"if there's anything more exquisite than queen anne's lace, i haven't found it."
25109,Homer,"i have a great way to solve our money woes: you rent your womb to a rich, childless couple. if you agree, signify by getting indignant."
30998,Homer,woo hoo! it's almost new year's! ten... nine... eight...
22936,Homer,there are some dogs. we could all ride dogs.
26426,Homer,"oh, right."
36022,Homer,"well, your arms are lanky. it's kind of a long trip down there."
30344,Homer,"you see, sweetie, when a mommy and a daddy are married for years and have nothing new to talk about, they bad-mouth their closest friends."
36032,Homer,then you have a serious reading problem.
17351,Homer,"okay. all right, pie, i'm just gonna do this."
40306,Homer,"well, i get up, i dance, i spell out the name of the city... all to the tune of baby elephant walk."
19362,Homer,"oh, no you don't!"
20298,Homer,that cost me 35 cents!
15238,Homer,"homer, you're not listening!"
29105,Homer,"and now that my special girl has heard the truth, i know she'll forgive me."
32542,Homer,marge had a black eye?! i could never do something like that! could i?
27556,Homer,but not too crispy.
23697,Homer,woo-hoo!
24317,Homer,"lenny and carl suck. please don't tell lenny and carl i said that, 'cause if i ever lost them as friends..."
18522,Homer,"there you go. now that's not so bad, is it?"
23819,Homer,"sweetie, if we didn't turn it down for the cops, what chance do you have? he hit her again."
18808,Homer,you're on.
40147,Homer,"marge! oh, marge!"
25222,Homer,"son, i know it hurts. i still remember my first lifetime banning..."
27905,Homer,everybody in the usa / hates their stupid neighbor / he's flanders and he's really really lame / flanders tried to wreck my song / his views on birth control are wrong / i hate his guts and flanders is his name.
18475,Homer,then why did she leave me?
19923,Homer,"no! bart had his turn, let me! i can't resist his charms."
28814,Homer,all of them.
21359,Homer,"my dad's a disgrace, just like bart's dad. me."
24482,Homer,take your time!
35167,Homer,i'm a seat filler.
21599,Homer,"uh, this isn't working. i've got to try a different approach."
28712,Homer,a lot of that went in my lungs.
26236,Homer,"ooh, here's a good one: the world's most overrated saint."
35721,Homer,i demand to speak to my paleontologist!
25920,Homer,i admit it.
30085,Homer,"exactly. it came to me in a vision. or maybe it was a drunken haze. or, possibly, an ice cream headache."
21995,Homer,"come on, come on, come on. start, damn you. start!"
30948,Homer,are you kavi?
30438,Homer,those were my good pants.
37318,Homer,i think it would!
20042,Homer,"oh. design your own power plant, eh? this is my chance to show everyone how professional i am."
19337,Homer,"good morning. you know, marge, i was thinking about how much i enjoy your interests, so i wandered over to that theater you went to last night. and i bought tickets to their entire season."
36217,Homer,"look at it go! all right! hey, since it's a dream, let's ride our bikes naked around town."
17571,Homer,shut up.
22037,Homer,blow up the hospital.
26803,Homer,"aww, she must have dreamt about hitler again."
29870,Homer,how did it ever come to this? i'm the first man ever to feel depressed in a bar. i don't have a friend in the world.
39254,Homer,you both look well.
15100,Homer,"... so then, his wife comes through the door!!!"
30137,Homer,"prison overcrowding, i've got a solution for that. oh my god! u-s-a! u-s-a!"
35488,Homer,"i know, i know you're not comfortable with all the guys edna's seen around town."
36129,Homer,"not now, marge!"
20930,Homer,"homer, you genius."
35647,Homer,"i won't say, but his initials are s.f."
14836,Homer,pfft! heavyweight championship. there's like three of those. that couch was one of a kind.
16787,Homer,y- no.
34161,Homer,not funny.
28782,Homer,zing.
22304,Homer,yeah! / you're only here 'cause marge forgot her pill.
18674,Homer,former president gerald ford? put 'er there! i'm homer simpson.
40152,Homer,not to worry. i'll just turn on the trusty bug zapper.

21378,Homer,"frankly, i do. i know you had your heart set on a limo, but sometimes daddies have to say no, honey. i'm afraid you're gonna have to take the bus."
17042,Homer,"can't talk now, flanders. i've got a class to teach."

32289,Homer,i guess i'm more powerful than god now.
24135,Homer,quick! you've got to hide me from pbs! their bloodthirsty pursuit is made possible by a grant from the chubb group!
33835,Homer,the heat is off. the hissing from the radiator is a snake.
17254,Homer,"i know what you're up to, mayor terwigajer. and no one in my family's gonna stand for it!"
17979,Homer,i've eaten eight different meats. i'm a true renaissance man.
15661,Homer,"first, you gotta shriek lika a woman, and keep sobbing till he turns away in disgust. that's when it's time to kick some back."
22872,Homer,i'm just gonna rest for a minute.
16364,Homer,uh oh. something's wrong.
16244,Homer,"phht, that's just an old wives tale."
29084,Homer,i thought we were gonna play fun games at camp.
32606,Homer,"listen carefully. i have taken your wife hostage. if you don't have a wife, i have kidnapped your brother. nod if you understand."
23054,Homer,"that's not how i remember it. besides, if we want to see japanese people we could have gone to the zoo."
29773,Homer,"oh, this is a parent's worst nightmare! they've stolen a car and they're home alone."
27825,Homer,t-shirt from our first rock concert...
27736,Homer,"moe, we've been complaining about him every night for eight years."

14762,Homer,"hey, wiener boy... where do you think you're going?"
27723,Homer,go on ahead. i'll just slow you down.

14830,Homer,don't i get some kind of trophy? at a big award ceremony?
35378,Homer,what happened to you?

17112,Homer,i got the idea when i noticed the refrigerator was cold.
30086,Homer,"no, flanders. it's... uh... a meeting of gay witches for abortion. you wouldn't be interested."
35785,Homer,"god, what a great game! and you too can be on the winning team, mr. mayor. the springfield nuclear team."
28939,Homer,wait a minute. i thought you didn't wanna get married.
15625,Homer,uh... revenge.

13540,Homer,look at him!
24186,Homer,"friends -- when i came here one month ago, this seemed like a strange and frightening place. but now i've learned to love this island as my second..."
29786,Homer,"look, we'll compromise. we'll go see a play...that lisa doesn't want to see."
17645,Homer,"brothers, i've learned a wonderful lesson. helping others makes our own lives better and makes us better people. so instead of just shooting pool and drinking beer, let us stonecutters use what we have to help the less fortunate."
29447,Homer,"great news, honey! burns made me a freelance consultant!"
35321,Homer,"masseuses: the half-doctors, half-hookers who solve everything."
35628,Homer,what the-- this is a gentleman's club!
24562,Homer,who's up for a merry jig?
37920,Homer,"i can't go back to jail! there's no shampoo, just soap!"
28546,Homer,"you're a hero, homer j. / you're as crafty as a skunk / they'll thank you in the morning for stealing flanders' junk / homer jaaaaay! / you're a double-bacon genius-burger... and just a little drunk."

36266,Homer,"okay, i'm up again."
32119,Homer,i've really enjoyed paying you to yell at me and say i suck. but it's no use -- i'm a hopeless loser and always will be.
16121,Homer,whatever. either way is good...
30145,Homer,makes sense.
23091,Homer,is the answer japan?
22532,Homer,"hey, you with the scarf! stop skywriting!"

30740,Homer,you know who would really like this place? bart. wait a minute... where the hell is bart?
24991,Homer,"here's for the repairs, and a little extra for you."
40484,Homer,"you were on your way to jump the gorge, weren't you?"
27396,Homer,you'll regret the day you went to the expensive coffee place!
28642,Homer,oh no! i hit the grief counselor!

24043,Homer,see? animals can get used to anything.
19752,Homer,"oh, and i'm not."
19701,Homer,"oh, now i got the job, huh? oh. thank you."
30652,Homer,"look at 'em, with their bright, airy narthex and light, flaky eucharist. i wouldn't mind dipping my hand in their font."
36645,Homer,oh god! it hurts worse than the burns!
23703,Homer,"remember to rebel against authority, kids."
36423,Homer,and i spent all that time learning how to be a better husband. the kind of husband you deserve.
38832,Homer,oh my god. is that girl really doing that?
32642,Homer,no. but you're close.
20996,Homer,"you're the man, ralph!"
16579,Homer,"bart, give me that megaphone of yours."
19283,Homer,"hi! now, marge, you're going to hear a lot of crazy talk about bart working in a burlesque house..."
15924,Homer,"now, come on! i'm your best customer."
34659,Homer,...initial the radon disclosure... and done.
41451,Homer,"stay with me, marge, and i promise we'll travel the world... and perhaps outer space."
37118,Homer,"ladies, please! you can boss me around, just one at a time!"
28751,Homer,yeah!
22369,Homer,y'ello...
20605,Homer,seat belts?! pfft! they kill more people than they save.

26317,Homer,krackle was my favorite.
35402,Homer,excuse me.
32460,Homer,"welcome home, marge."
23406,Homer,not fast enough!
25183,Homer,"oh god, my back! it hurts so much, and my job is so unfulfilling!"
19825,Homer,i'll have to ask her.
20423,Homer,"i'm tired of watching you dog it on that football field. from now on, i'm gonna work you like a dog. now go fetch me twenty laps."
34868,Homer,"yeah, i've done all i can do in that medium."
26395,Homer,"ten-four, princess. is that your beer tent?"
28081,Homer,so i threw you a fancy banquet / and now you can't stay mad / how 'bout a make-up snuggle? / it would be so rad.
30897,Homer,"uh, okay."
29794,Homer,sometimes i go to the movies alone.
23200,Homer,"hey, that looks like bart."
40051,Homer,"they call this a portion? hey lenny, are you gonna use all your tartar sauce? dry fish sticks. this sucks."
30685,Homer,i'm sure my listeners would love to know the story behind that name.
23476,Homer,"sorry, boy. going back to springfield would be a coward's way out."
33988,Homer,woo hoo!
30706,Homer,dad...

25443,Homer,let's see those double a baseball honchos ignore this.
39063,Homer,woo hoo!
14666,Homer,i think that guy's a spy.
39386,Homer,"oh, no, what have i done? i smashed open my little boy's piggy bank, and for what? a few measly cents. not even enough to buy one beer. wait a minute, lemme count and make sure..."
30216,Homer,"wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. no matter what i did, no matter how many people lost their pensions, it's forgiven like that?"
21316,Homer,i have been working out secretly at night. and look at me now!
28958,Homer,"okay marge, i hear ya. now that krabappel has made her decision, it's time to whitewash over our problems."
20764,Homer,"i've got a proposition for you, cooder."
20080,Homer,"hey, go on, boy. go get it! answer the phone! be a good boy!"
41149,Homer,bart!
24106,Homer,"it's about a hard-drinking, yet loving family of soccer hooligans. if they're not having a go with a bird, they're having a row with a wanker."
28039,Homer,"i said, ""bishop to queen four."""
38653,Homer,"listen, i-i know you're a robot and incapable of emotion..."
40182,Homer,wretch --
40451,Homer,truckasaurous!
26791,Homer,can i lick your fingers? meet me at the mail slot.
28893,Homer,"all right. for you, i will give up all clear liquors."
19310,Homer,"g'night... thanks for coming... we'll see you... ba-bye... well, i think that went pretty well."
21645,Homer,taking-bart-across-state-lines-back-soon.
35305,Homer,these are my keys.
19427,Homer,"aw, lousy wiggum. now the whole town thinks i'm a chili wuss..."
15786,Homer,woo hoo!
22871,Homer,"no, these guys are geniuses. i could never think of something like soup or a pencil."
25968,Homer,maybe we'd tip you if you'd smile once in a while.
27188,Homer,"that's not true, lisa, there are a lot of complicated issues here, that can only be explained through song."
29673,Homer,i know. that was for the other patients.
23768,Homer,"hey, it is christmas. we'd better get home."
31784,Homer,her name is marge.
13380,Homer,hmmmm. gentlemen: i am going to catch general sherman!
19499,Homer,"hey... we do! oh, marge!"
26672,Homer,y'ello.
19526,Homer,the alien has a sweet heavenly voice -- like urkel! and he appears every friday night -- like urkel!
26577,Homer,"hey, and a mini-bar hat."
19937,Homer,oh good.
17994,Homer,"so this driving on the left makes you feel more at home, huh hugh?"
41016,Homer,"uh, yeah, i think i did."
28986,Homer,"and tonight, we'll finally, and romantically, hump."
20601,Homer,"i don't know, marge. trying is the first step toward failure."
22645,Homer,"give it a try, honey."
32290,Homer,who said that? i'll kill them with my power!
18929,Homer,"hey, you got rid of that goofy sacred elephant statue."
35906,Homer,finally. but i want to do it my way: classy and sophisticated.
18839,Homer,"i know! i know! it's selma, right?"
33409,Homer,i wanna live in the sauce!
36292,Homer,"guys, thank you. the words ""prime directive"" get thrown around a lot these days, but i'm glad yours was saving me. the saddest part is none of this had to happen, if mr. burns had simply trusted the human worker. or if someone, anyone had told me that robots were incapable of human feelings."
22325,Homer,me? nah. unless there's a coupon for it. nah.
19917,Homer,"wow, i gotta start going to church."
35583,Homer,where's that spider?
38035,Homer,"i don't need to know, marge. you deserve to have your secrets."
36108,Homer,this yolk-separating camera-hog was supposed to call you and say happy birthday! from her show!
21697,Homer,"i'm proud of you, boy. mmmm, loganberry."
23639,Homer,"well, all i care about is that my little girl loves me. and we're gonna spend a lot more time together from now on."
34322,Homer,"until your homework is done, the only place your butt is safe from my foot is in that chair."
15412,Homer,"please, please, please, please, please..."
24462,Homer,"yeah, that pressure we put on her really paid off!"
23217,Homer,"way to guilt him, marge!"
23432,Homer,"hey, i'm not dead yet."
13467,Homer,marge! lisa! maggie! let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors can see!
22188,Homer,congratulations! welcome to the homer simpson program.
22580,Homer,"oh, i'm gonna die! jesus, allah, buddha, i love you all!"
39906,Homer,"oh, just some blueprints adil wanted. i'm telling you, he's such a curious little dickens. i bet he could build a nuclear power plant if he wanted to."
25910,Homer,because i... ow! you--!

18258,Homer,"wow, barney! you brought a whole beer keg."

13565,Homer,"gee, i gotta call my family."
31418,Homer,remember that crappy ice cream truck i bought?
15700,Homer,"i gotta think of a lie, fast."
18741,Homer,"yes, that'd do."
31553,Homer,"oh ma-arge, we have a surpri-ise! come to the win-dow! and look down at the stre-et!"
32631,Homer,die hard two!
25198,Homer,"one, two, better-not-sue..."
34756,Homer,...then pete rose plowed into his friend ray fosse...
27701,Homer,"that's it! thank you, outdoor advertising! you saved my marriage -- and not for the first time."
32489,Homer,my what now?
28401,Homer,"finally, science has joined forces with revenge."
34360,Homer,woo hoo!
14185,Homer,"yeah, but i have to hear about it."
13251,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa. i'm just trying to get in. i'm not running for jesus."
20137,Homer,"aha! i've got it! brain, how can i ever thank you?"
34881,Homer,you can race pigeons?
37839,Homer,"well, i'm sure our town's police force will handle this competently."
17744,Homer,"a girl! oh marge, we have a wonderful baby girl! not just a girl, the most beautiful baby girl in the whole world!"
21927,Homer,that's it! somehow!
39611,Homer,no.
37508,Homer,we don't get together to share our emotions. we get together to escape them.
19215,Homer,can't they get a pole for that sign?
19603,Homer,huh?
16009,Homer,yeah.
37106,Homer,women and their horrible thoughts.
27831,Homer,let's go to ihop! i'm drivin'.

23202,Homer,what? time to go?
40624,Homer,"""try something new, homer. what'll it hurt you, homer?"" i never heard of a poison pork chop."
24778,Homer,whopping?
21895,Homer,"well, at least lose the bra. free the ""springfield two,"" marge! free the ""springfield two!"""
29196,Homer,"oh, there's the frisbee."
13884,Homer,no wonder she hates me. i never even noticed that she was alive.
23523,Homer,they're after the tomacco!
22473,Homer,right after happy hour!
34388,Homer,they're okay with applesauce.
16134,Homer,every time mr. burns has a birthday all his employees have to help out at the party. and i always get some terrible job.
35564,Homer,i don't want people to know my kids go to this lousy school.
19293,Homer,take it off!
14057,Homer,could i get a beer?
34568,Homer,it kills me to see her like that. and if there's one thing i can't stand it's being killed.
22347,Homer,"aw, get lost, ya bloodsucking parasite. wally and i have all the tickets we need."
36262,Homer,let's go!
38846,Homer,turn it off!
41340,Homer,"lord, this is a dire emergency. if you could fix my house, or make a new house from one of my ribs..."
19408,Homer,"lenny? aw, well. if it was big and annual i'm sure they'd have mentioned it in the newspaper."
16021,Homer,check.
33087,Homer,nobody shuts out my blather!
41225,Homer,bravo!
27012,Homer,isn't vacation sex always the best?
19248,Homer,"it'll be okay, honey. there's lots more oil where that came from."
14767,Homer,"wow, my concert going jacket still fits. and this is where i used to hide my beer."
23199,Homer,"yeah, he's somethin' else, all right."
36228,Homer,i feel sorry for people without willpower. i truly do.
24182,Homer,"hey, that's great. now let's get to work!"
26300,Homer,"come on, show the movie!"
14922,Homer,fine. i will!
24765,Homer,i had to sell it for gas money.
33959,Homer,"great. go nuts. but remember, we never had this discussion."
20416,Homer,"hii-hi-hi-hi, hi, flanders. go wildcats!"
14319,Homer,"well, it's more than you did!"
31132,Homer,really? you'd kiss an ugly old man like me?
16160,Homer,"well, burns isn't gettin' this back cheap, i'll tell you that. he's going to have to give me... my own recording studio."
35134,Homer,mix it in.
31389,Homer,"they got an open bar at this thing, right?"
24014,Homer,"man, i got more trophies than wayne gretzky and the pope combined."
36703,Homer,he's a good boy.
16036,Homer,"c'mon, let me cut you a brownie while they're still hot."
36574,Homer,"hey, marge."
31054,Homer,"see that ball of fire? that's the sun. it goes by many names: apollo's lantern, day-moon, old blazey. the important thing is never to touch it."

38284,Homer,"okay, okay. we'll make it fun. i'll take her to that crab place. all the crabs you could smash."
25056,Homer,"ahh, why does that always happen?"
38704,Homer,"you know, alarm code three six seven nine. three six seven nine!"
33444,Homer,"me too, baby. but we gotta get real."
15722,Homer,"then, yes."
19804,Homer,"bart, look! it's santa claus!"

37079,Homer,"wowww. your house is perfect. no sharp corners, no unsafe balconies, a cool grampa..."
19082,Homer,you heard me -- they're alien replicons from beyond the moon!
21847,Homer,step right up and see the world's greatest mobile collection of alec-and-ron-and-kim-arabilia.
38084,Homer,"marge, teens can't control their urges. it's why there's never been a teenage president."
20937,Homer,why you little...
24647,Homer,good idea. we should call the guys they used.
16855,Homer,"get lost, flanders."
25489,Homer,three dollars? that doesn't seem so bad.
29918,Homer,"ned, are you okay?"
36361,Homer,"yeah, for you kids maybe. for dads, a family vacation is a twenty-four-hour-a-day babysitting job! ""are you wearing enough sun block?"" ""is that splashing or drowning?"""
36100,Homer,would you sign this for my wife marge? she's a big fan and her birthday is tomorrow.
28038,Homer,psst. bishop to queen four.
14550,Homer,"check it out, boys. my magic bat."
15933,Homer,woo!

25174,Homer,"it was great, all right. but all i wanna do right now is hit the adjustable sack with a good juice box. because when all is said and done... prison rodeo!?"
20334,Homer,marge kicked me out.
29184,Homer,"well, if that's your custom."
22713,Homer,it ate everybody.

38531,Homer,here ya go. have some more.
18600,Homer,welcome aboard. it wasn't any easier.
28548,Homer,"they don't sound happy... but here comes a mob, shaking their fists in gratitude."
21433,Homer,yeah. seems like the thing to do.
22541,Homer,"oh, no let me out! let's get outta here!"
14048,Homer,"boy, they've got better things to talk about than you. sheesh, what an ego."
19031,Homer,"wait, marge. maybe if you're truly cool, you don't need to be told you're cool."

18743,Homer,"i believe you, honey."

19845,Homer,i'll come with you.
31081,Homer,"oh no! he's marge's, and my, dream man! i've gotta make a play for her now or i might lose her forever!"
36005,Homer,marco!
17223,Homer,"now remember, we're in the itchy lot."
19730,Homer,fifty bucks for a toy? no kid is worth that.
31590,Homer,"so, that's our story. oh wait, we were attacked by a giant whale. he turned out to be pretty cool."
27886,Homer,"i've learned a lot living here. it doesn't matter what someone's sexual preferences are, unless they're a celebrity, in which case it's dish, dish, dish!"
24096,Homer,"beautiful! and star-wipe, aaaand we're out."
28817,Homer,investor confidence? perhaps this affects me -- i own two hundred and thirty million shares of ziffcorp stock.
30327,Homer,"okay, how about this? seven, four three one... oh wait, that's my pin number. everyone forget that."
14471,Homer,hello... i'd like the department of missing babies.
22660,Homer,me too.
33637,Homer,who would do this to me?! it would have to be someone who could afford a chain.
38862,Homer,potato chips!
34164,Homer,no pink box?! wha -- what's going on?
30639,Homer,"mr. burns, we may be experiencing some technical difficulties."
39636,Homer,"well, heh heh, now we get a chance to be real pioneers."
27175,Homer,can i help you?
19684,Homer,you'll find it's even more fun if you get it for me.
25015,Homer,"okay, thank you, sir."
37697,Homer,"if you're my wife's secret lover, come in. there's nothing i can do for her anymore."
35108,Homer,"oh marge, don't worry, a lot of movie stars have gray hair, like all those women we loved in the eighties."
13424,Homer,no.
40385,Homer,oh man. fine.
20136,Homer,shut up! shut up! shut up!
25149,Homer,i don't understand. that wasn't funny.
15825,Homer,mmm... chocolate.
40836,Homer,cable. it's more wonderful than i dared hope.
22121,Homer,"okay, we'll call it even."
16524,Homer,"aw, sure... you just lie down and tell me all about it."
26921,Homer,"good, 'cause i need directions."
28587,Homer,"for true, son."
17801,Homer,"uh, can't. i've got to go distract bulls at a rodeo."
27241,Homer,this comes off.
29788,Homer,"hey cat, get your own pants!"
19490,Homer,"come here, people!"
23499,Homer,look at my babies. this tomato will be heinz ketchup. and this to-mah-to will be hunt's catsup.
34033,Homer,"not an option, big fella. either you're my assistant, or you find a job elsewhere -- and in this economy, elsewhere ain't hirin'!"
35087,Homer,let's see if this works.
21399,Homer,stay there! i'll come down and save you!
20103,Homer,i can't feel my legs!
39731,Homer,"c'mon, son. let's take the head thing back to the authorities."
38237,Homer,where's your mother?
17706,Homer,"well, it was my major."
35736,Homer,"wait, you're gonna be all the guys? how would that work?"
17910,Homer,"in that case, i'll just have french toast with double butter and a side of bacon. but no powdered sugar, i don't deserve it. maybe a little powdered sugar."
28197,Homer,whom? whom?
26553,Homer,let's try the red one again.
32877,Homer,"don't worry -- i'm ready for this. bart, fetch ""the defender."""
14221,Homer,they'll call him screwy louie.
38635,Homer,gravy thursday.
15885,Homer,"all right, brain, you don't like me and i don't like you. but let's just do this and i can get back to killing you with beer."
35190,Homer,"walther, let's not be so hasty. who would begrudge them a few years of shambling, dope-fogged, into the grave? besides, our generation's got everything under control! now, if you'll excuse me, i was supposed to be drunk an hour ago. to moe's!"
36260,Homer,could you give my wife a few lessons?
14812,Homer,disingenuous mountebanks with their subliminal chicanery! a pox on them!
27872,Homer,how much do you tip a leg waxer? i need to know by tomorrow!
26813,Homer,"good night, maggie."
17914,Homer,i'll never pay off that debt.
31353,Homer,"moe, moe, you gotta hide us from the army!"
30516,Homer,"yeah. now, i'm off to bring safety to springfield elementary and win back your love!"
38580,Homer,i can't believe you wasted our money on fruit.
20403,Homer,"hey, flanders. you're the worst coach this team has ever had."
19654,Homer,but how am i supposed to pay for that?
30943,Homer,a cow took my ipod and i punched it!
37523,Homer,"kids, i've only had three great ideas: marrying your mother, using a hot dog as a straw, and this romantic train ride anniversary. sir, i need this train!"
41056,Homer,"so what does my little girl want? what? let me write this down. copies of ""teen dream... teen scream... and teen steam magazine."" well, okay. you're the sickie. goodbye, lisa."
17786,Homer,homer.
37762,Homer,"aw, that's sweet."
38567,Homer,"no, boy. i want you to do it."
21921,Homer,b-b-but the poncho...
29150,Homer,"okay, kids show off your pipes..."
37193,Homer,ooo! jail music!
37618,Homer,"anyhoo, this canister is full of spoiled milk and utility-grade chicken."
27090,Homer,sorry mick!
30070,Homer,"marge, the rapture is nigh. these books will help me figure out how nigh."
40524,Homer,"you know, some of these stories are pretty good. i never know mice lived such interesting lives."
30171,Homer,"don't worry, marge. i've taken every precaution."
38984,Homer,"marge, sweetie, i'm not gonna lie. i must have tied one on at moe's. if you have it in your heart, could you forgive me and totally blame my friends?"
28192,Homer,let the baby have her bottle.
40650,Homer,"you know, bart, after me, you're the man around the house, and that means you're gonna have to help out with --"
14321,Homer,"don't worry, son. just 'cause you're trapped in a hole doesn't mean you can't live a rich full life. i brought you your krusty doll..."
26352,Homer,"yeah, i..."
35573,Homer,"bart, your mother thinks there's something suspicious about all you boys having a meeting in this treehouse."
16996,Homer,"well, marge, it was horrible. everyone was against me in that jury room. but i stood by the courage of my convictions and i prevailed. and that's why we had chinese food for lunch."
24393,Homer,we built this city / on rock annnd roll! uh-oh.
39780,Homer,"you know, i've been thinking... everyone makes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, but usually the jelly drips out over the sides and a guy's hands get all sticky. but your jelly stays right in the middle where it's supposed to. i don't know how you do it. you've just got a gift, i guess. i've always thought so. i just never mentioned it. but it's time you knew how i feel. i don't believe in keeping feelings bottled up. ...goodbye, my wife."
24076,Homer,"okay, from here we star-wipe to a glamour shot of flanders paying his bills..."
37126,Homer,how can something that applies to bart apply to me? i'm so much older and wiser.
27920,Homer,sweet.
21786,Homer,wait! tell me over breakfast. who's for pancakes?
36054,Homer,not you! him!
30841,Homer,but she'll leave the rest of him alone?
34982,Homer,"oregano, basil, rosemary..."
17472,Homer,"your whole life, you never said one nice thing to me."
20208,Homer,ah so.
32956,Homer,this is a classic nineteen seventy-eight pizza hut! mmm... terrible.
28450,Homer,you broke our deal -- we had an oral contract!
36360,Homer,"oh, marge... your names..."
31382,Homer,"seriously moe, i think you have a gift."
15381,Homer,you didn't build this house. you won
28825,Homer,"aw, it's no use, son. by the time i get out of here you'll be grown. turn around / turn around / turn around and you're a young man / and you're too big to choke."
38695,Homer,not you.
38188,Homer,i wish i knew how.
23402,Homer,so we're all gonna die?
17244,Homer,that's better.
21364,Homer,"oh, marge, i never thought you'd see me again."
36542,Homer,at least the pennant works both ways.
15314,Homer,so remember...
32800,Homer,where you going?
19384,Homer,the living and dining rooms... with a lovely flow for entertaining...
33274,Homer,springfield mall?!
40164,Homer,"oooh, a feast."
36354,Homer,why don't you talk to mrs. steak?
34941,Homer,"sweetie, relax. let's just watch some tv."
23471,Homer,"ohhh, that's heaven."
15209,Homer,"forget it marge. we already live together; we shouldn't work together. as the bible says ""thou shalt not horn in on thy husband's... racket."""
17585,Homer,then why don't those stupid idiots let me in their crappy club for jerks?
24223,Homer,"well, it's time to get some closure. extreme closure."
25127,Homer,it's a date!
39318,Homer,i'll show you a big dumb balding ape!
31246,Homer,listen... what would you say if i told you a woman did most of the work?
16137,Homer,hee hee! i'm so funny! this is gonna be great.
28405,Homer,"rub a dub dub, i'm washin' the blub."
20317,Homer,"oh, let's get that."
31473,Homer,"and, as always, have fun watching."
18844,Homer,mmmm... pointy.
26185,Homer,"don't blame me, blame tinseltown and its second golden age. may it never end."
41093,Homer,"absolutely. our third sunday of every month should be a pleasure, not a chore. where's some place fun we can take grampa next time?"
38347,Homer,"come on! hug your grampa, boys!"
22739,Homer,"i think we lost 'em, bart."
24502,Homer,you're almost there.
27392,Homer,"oh yes. well, let's take a look and see-- a thousand dollars! how did you spend a thousand dollars?"
38716,Homer,"aw, let me get a picture of that."
26621,Homer,"look, man. i don't do drugs."
36514,Homer,"i was thinking about you. it's your birthday in like three, four months? would it be weird if i threw you a party?"
37670,Homer,"aw, don't cry."
27364,Homer,"good morning, honey. did you cry out all your angries?"
39234,Homer,"marge, marge, marge. let's see. oooh, look! pantyhose. practical and alluring. a six-pack... oh! only four ninety nine."
35961,Homer,what? my emotions were so powerful...
29436,Homer,there are other ways to get into canada...
38987,Homer,"y'know, i used to have this friend... i told him all my dreams. really, really great kid."
31929,Homer,i have three kids and no money! why can't i have no kids and three money?
18340,Homer,nooo! nooo! nooo! nooo!
32996,Homer,the biggest one in town.
15712,Homer,gulp.
20070,Homer,"no, no! your room is full of toys. you're going to the, uh, garage!"
33834,Homer,when do i get to move back home?
24218,Homer,just kidding. remember my face.
26209,Homer,"look, i did marry her, but i abandoned her. amber, tell her how i abandoned you."
20556,Homer,"get your own angel, ya moocher."
37216,Homer,then how do you explain this?
31628,Homer,you guys liked him?
39900,Homer,cheese!
30607,Homer,a buncha stupid cables.
29418,Homer,i declare that you have the most beautiful brown eyes.
15493,Homer,bed goes up. bed goes down...
25377,Homer,smelson! it's funny 'cause you smell.
14744,Homer,at least could i have my dollar ba...
23800,Homer,"and you're ""interferon"" with our good time!"
22841,Homer,"so i'm giving you kids permission to get me mad. c'mon, gimme what you got."
28070,Homer,"we've gotta help her. if marge isn't happy, i'm not happy. and if i'm not happy moe is very happy. but for once, this isn't about moe. what should i do, dr. hot dog?"
24974,Homer,interesting.
18687,Homer,but sipowicz does it.
27451,Homer,"dad, we're canceling the rest of the play."
33884,Homer,i can't wait for the reviews!
37693,Homer,my old pen pal from spain. eduardo.
17931,Homer,"please, on top of everything else, don't make me picture your hides."
34133,Homer,"oh dad, i got you some scotch. one of those fancy ones the checkout lady had to unlock the cabinet to get."
16142,Homer,"okay, stupid!"
21393,Homer,lisa... lisa...
24983,Homer,"a singing rubber fish, of course."
31412,Homer,"yeah, this economy is tough on everyone. change a hundred?"
40150,Homer,"mr. ploot? homer simpson here. when you sold me this house you forgot to mention one little thing. you didn't tell me it was built on an indian burial ground. no you didn't! well, that's not my recollection... yeah! well... all right, goodbye. he says he mentioned it five or six times."
27844,Homer,that was a muffin!
33803,Homer,"whatever happened to ""boo?"""
41524,Homer,"well, i aims to please. hey, let's stop by that dumpster and make out. hold that thought."
17847,Homer,"--alia! america, australia, ameri-- ow!"
16847,Homer,neddie? neddddieee!
36953,Homer,crawling... so painful...
36828,Homer,tell me everything about you.
30650,Homer,"hey, knock it off."
35320,Homer,"when we get home, the peaches will be gone."
35473,Homer,"yeah, isn't this place great? if you're single you can come here every night."
30490,Homer,no father's day eve... does this mean there's no such thing as... daddy claus?
15652,Homer,"oh... it's you. so, you're looking well."
30079,Homer,"here's my angle: there's no way in god's heaven i should get into god's heaven. but maybe he'll let me in, if i warn others the apocalypse is coming, as i previously shouted."
19671,Homer,"marge, do we know them?"
40186,Homer,"take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"
29348,Homer,i wouldn't say that.
21644,Homer,"aw, to hell with him!"
24892,Homer,"oh, don't worry about the mr. x thing. i'm just here for a beer."
24184,Homer,"come on little friend, make a wisecrack. you know, ""it's a living,"" that sort of thing."
31492,Homer,ow! i can't read ahead -- i promised lisa i wouldn't!
39857,Homer,i told that boy a billion times to pick up his jun--
38793,Homer,"okay, okay!"
17386,Homer,"so, a graduate student, huh? how come you guys can go to the moon but you can't make my shoes smell good?"
26818,Homer,"oh, come on--"
14361,Homer,fifty big ones!
20463,Homer,"oh. well, then, just give me a six-pack and a couple bags of skittles."
29969,Homer,"wow, he's just the kind of weirdo bart needs."
34480,Homer,"awwww, want a bite?"
24459,Homer,"now honey, what were you trying to say before we kept interrupting you with our loving proudness?"
18774,Homer,just my luck.
28244,Homer,now get out of my house.
40750,Homer,"oh, yeah."
15176,Homer,but then i won't be watching tv. you can see the bind i'm in.
29104,Homer,i just blew my first chance at true love.
39646,Homer,"that's nice, lisa, but we're not in astronomy class. we're in the woods."
13239,Homer,"yeah, falls'll getcha."
23177,Homer,they are my only escape from the drudgery of work and family.
39723,Homer,then run along you little scamp. a boy without mischief is like a bowling ball without a liquid center.
22204,Homer,"he's a daredevil, ned. he laughs at death."
15822,Homer,"what a lovely surprise! you're here to see me, right?"
33529,Homer,"don't worry, honey, i'll be your ""seeing-eye homer."" we're in some kind of doctor room, bunch of stuff on the walls... it's kind of hard to describe... um, i'm gonna take my break now."
39019,Homer,ditto.
16608,Homer,asleep at the switch! i wasn't asleep! i was drunk!
16096,Homer,"c'mon guys, look at yourselves. all you do is study. i'm gonna show you the true meaning of college!"
37613,Homer,"lisa, i've never prayed to a city in my life, and if i did, it would be hershey, pennsylvania. i was kneeling on the affirmation rug they gave me."
30796,Homer,"wait, wait, wait, wait..."
22771,Homer,usually a mink massage makes me feel better. but something's missing now.
35036,Homer,great. that's great. but i have to get to work in the morning.
38952,Homer,ask for boogers on bart's half!
21886,Homer,i'll treasure this poncho forever.
22358,Homer,let us outta here!
30126,Homer,i'm sorry. but heaven isn't heaven without my family in it.
24267,Homer,searched for lincoln's gold.
34890,Homer,"marge, listen to the man -- he pays bart's salary."
26173,Homer,quit trying to control me.
25730,Homer,quitters!
33909,Homer,fine. i'll give back the oscars i stole from the lobby.
35012,Homer,he took me to a fight that he fixed. but he never let on. not even when i bet five hundred dollars on the wrong guy. then he said he would dope a horse for me.
17272,Homer,noooo!
14968,Homer,yesss!
16358,Homer,"oh, i'm sorry."
14549,Homer,let's see... we play thirty games... ten at bats a game... three thousand.
18858,Homer,great! ya wanna get some lunch?
16719,Homer,i'unno.
17170,Homer,hi.
16196,Homer,all right. stay calm. remember your training.
27781,Homer,i don't know why you're trying to steal the plant back. i don't even want it.
30108,Homer,stupid family... won't even come to my rapture... i went to lisa's school play -- which had serious pacing problems.
27330,Homer,gator gulch?
31605,Homer,i swear revenge on meaux! even if it takes me the rest of my life! can you loosen my arm so i can shake my fist?
40866,Homer,"oh, too bad. it's gonna be a great fight."
40192,Homer,like getting washington's birthday and lincoln's birthday back as separate paid holidays. president's day! pfft. what a rip-off! i bust my butt day in and day out --
21524,Homer,"uh-uh, think. is that what alex would say?"
32976,Homer,"this case is ""in the bag."""
25945,Homer,"hey, how ya doin'?"
37177,Homer,licking the wrapper.
33980,Homer,i'll bash him with this book!
14615,Homer,well... of course. there couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell.
38660,Homer,but we bowled together.
15877,Homer,i see.
19488,Homer,"alone! i'm alone! i'm a lonely, insignificant speck on a has-been planet orbited by a cold, indifferent sun!"
17172,Homer,i made it the whole day without seeing her again.
29211,Homer,it sure is taking me a long time to reach this button.
39514,Homer,"yeah, right, lis. it's the three roads to success, bart. work, brains, and..."
16324,Homer,"if this were a cartoon, the cliff would break off now."
29168,Homer,"here's a poem: ""run fast, or lose your ass""!"
32733,Homer,move or die!
40446,Homer,"you know marge, we're great parents!"
20849,Homer,mmm... memo.
30787,Homer,"earning us a hundred bucks a week, that's what. except the maine potatoes one. it's just a reminder to myself."
23363,Homer,"no, it's homer."
31143,Homer,"now let's remember: no one's right, and no one's wrong, till i say so."
24238,Homer,"what? let me see that! ""interior coroner's office. close-up on dr. winslow's mangled corpse. coroner: 'let's get that brain out and weighed, and call it a day.'"" yep, that does sound kinda bad."
14015,Homer,"thank you, bill cosby, you saved the simpsons!"
34398,Homer,that is going right on stupidflanders.org.
24567,Homer,"oh, i'm no dunce. i was born an oaf, and i'll die an oaf."
40511,Homer,"hey, how come you can watch cartoons but the kids can't?"
24610,Homer,"it's not fair! i've been a fan of the who since the very beginning, when they were the hillbilly bugger boys."
19338,Homer,"look -- ""mostly madrigals."" hey, that might be good. ooh, ooh, ""an evening with philip glass."" just an evening? ""voices of the elderly poor."""
26128,Homer,and someone has eaten the flesh.
26623,Homer,"for me, the sixties ended that day in nineteen seventy-eight."
40386,Homer,"i'm game if you are, flanders."
40158,Homer,hey! get a load of that spread.
34658,Homer,marge... get loan pre-approved... offer over asking... waive inspections... two-day escrow!
35282,Homer,who do you have next period?
13206,Homer,"when i grow up, i'll have a giant mansion, my own pinball machine with infinity quarters, eight pairs of peanut butter and jelly pajamas. how many wishes do i have left?"
19252,Homer,"it's a party, marge. it doesn't have to make sense."
22827,Homer,i'll handle this.
33394,Homer,...debbie pinson.
16516,Homer,this late? through the bad neighborhood?
32715,Homer,"well, they say muscle weighs more than fat."
24241,Homer,i am an angel from the future.
35400,Homer,"sorry sarah, i'm retired."
26094,Homer,"hello. this is chad sexington, the model for burly paper towels."
40418,Homer,"see, maggie? those silver and blue guys are the dallas cowboys. they're daddy's favorite team, and he wants them to lose by less than five and a half points. understand?"
28537,Homer,and here's another act of christian charity i pulled out of my butt.
20438,Homer,"not any more. from now on, you're my main man. okay, now everyone give me five laps, and hit the showers. oh, rod, you don't have to. you're cut."
16910,Homer,thank you.
15518,Homer,heh-heh... mule.
21947,Homer,"why? we're following the rules -- if it has a toothpick in it, it's free."
29712,Homer,ling!
37133,Homer,"you're saying it like it happens all the time. and by the way, the paint's a little faded on my parking spot. you call this a platinum club experience?"
37674,Homer,"hey book, are you expecting this?"
24674,Homer,now these are the tunes i want you boys to play.
22954,Homer,"wait a minute... because i brought the check, they named a wing after me? oh, you must be mad."
18734,Homer,hear ye! hear ye! ye olde town crier proclaimed crappy by all! chooseth homer simpson and he shalt rock thy world!
23215,Homer,"geez, what's the big deal? look, i'll even eat some."
40988,Homer,holy moly! the bastard's rich!
37004,Homer,society will not have to start from square one.
28682,Homer,"so, how much bleach did you drink? not a talker, eh?"
25485,Homer,you...you really scared us.
30807,Homer,you didn't think it was so horrible when you were falling down the hole.
40760,Homer,"debate? like, arguing?"
20177,Homer,i'll practice you!
38731,Homer,i'm not set at all.
37474,Homer,"just say he's black, moe."
18551,Homer,uh-oh. somebody's got tired little legs.
26492,Homer,ever!
26378,Homer,what did carl think?
22217,Homer,"oh, that. that can be treated with our good friend alcohol. you might want to write that down. where the hell's your notebook?"
30632,Homer,"yeah, i tell marge everything! not necessarily in words, but in body language -- you know, sneaking around and such."
40471,Homer,kids say such stupid things.
39526,Homer,"aw, marge."

19612,Homer,"yes, lotta hysteria..."
37401,Homer,how deep is your love... how deep is your love...
27428,Homer,woo hoo!
23815,Homer,"anyway, where were we? hello? hello? they hung up."
17490,Homer,dad? this photo is a blessing. it eases my pain.
31283,Homer,where do you think you're going?
32124,Homer,"dr. fredrick j. waxman, you're a genius!"
31788,Homer,what are the first three?
25258,Homer,that's tennis?! then what's the one where the chicks whale on each other?
38824,Homer,um. maybe.
24931,Homer,what a horrible four months. now to warn everybody.
18656,Homer,"oooh? hiding behind your goons, eh, bush? oooh! well, you are a wimp."
34723,Homer,"after bart, that bag's the best mistake we ever made."
32834,Homer,"just fish... chicken... burgers... veal on fridays... deer, but only in season... and if necessary, the sweetest meat of all... human."
19877,Homer,"""make it,"" eh?"
28634,Homer,"son, did you ever suspect it was me?"
25208,Homer,next!
24157,Homer,"craig and amy, craig and amy. why don't you just marry craig and amy?"
28532,Homer,"all right, now you're startin' to creep me out."
21039,Homer,you're a disgrace to this family and its proud naval tradition!
36643,Homer,this one's cold.
21920,Homer,"yes, b-b-but the poncho..."
37451,Homer,i'll get mini-dumpsters of wings from garbage wings!
37315,Homer,marge was so happy when i made those promises. what changed?
31210,Homer,what?!
17339,Homer,"oh! ooh my - oh, the hell with it."
40310,Homer,"i was graceful. i was witty. brother, i was somethin'."
17183,Homer,go to hell!
29054,Homer,you're all so wise... i wish i could eat each and every one of you.
25583,Homer,this flower saved our lives.
17541,Homer,oh.
31681,Homer,the light from your eyes could guide a ship at sea.
21443,Homer,look who's here!
37629,Homer,all good.
36964,Homer,"i guess despite all our so-called civilization, anarchy lurks around every corner, like a racially-diverse street gang on a network cop show."
38210,Homer,i'm so glad i was forced to come.
14806,Homer,forbearance is the watchword. that triumvirate of twinkies merely overwhelmed my resolve.
33143,Homer,"now let's spend the rest of the night making sweet, sweet--"
31534,Homer,then forget it!
40175,Homer,sir --
35310,Homer,"oh, that's ridiculous. how could two people from the same family need therapy?"
23372,Homer,"hey, foamy, i want the news, not the weather. marge, did you hear me zing werewolf flanders?"
15030,Homer,i can't wait that long.
15543,Homer,i locked my keys in there. get a rock.
16422,Homer,"yeah. another day, another box of stolen pens."
17174,Homer,"that's okay. i'll just push the button for the stimulator, i mean elevator."
28288,Homer,"on my chess set, the pawns are all hamburglars."
27960,Homer,"watch your step... don't panic... by going down the ladder, you are agreeing not to sue."
16388,Homer,"uh, i dunno. but lucky for you somebody here is responsible."
14364,Homer,"well... you know... you like ice cream, don't you?"
20742,Homer,okay.
14440,Homer,"what? but marge, we just had a vacation. remember mystic caverns?"
19376,Homer,relax. can't you see how eerily calm it is?
29571,Homer,go to hell.
38836,Homer,hm?

38998,Homer,"uh, pittsburgh thirty-five, dallas thirty-one!"
23423,Homer,"baby, glove slap..."
15174,Homer,"i know my punishment might seem a little harsh, but i can't go back on it. you're welcome to watch anything you want on tv."
38413,Homer,"uh, nice night for a walk."
26312,Homer,nicely done.
37943,Homer,what?
14632,Homer,mmm... snouts.
29890,Homer,"one, two, three, four -- i declare a nail war!"
38513,Homer,are you crazy? we'll never make it! drop the anchor and wait out the storm!
27672,Homer,"eh, i'm still undecided."
23517,Homer,get the... get outta... bad animals! go home!
13558,Homer,because i wore a pink shirt.
36055,Homer,"we found a new home! when god shuts a door, he opens a window."
21658,Homer,let's just say i'm sitting in the right chair.
24890,Homer,they're with god now.
39149,Homer,all gone. but in their place we have five hundred channels of television. all awesome. sit down and i'll show you.
41188,Homer,the museum!
24741,Homer,"well, moping won't make it better."
32741,Homer,i said secret.
35958,Homer,really? that made sense? then i'm definitely doing it.
18753,Homer,"no, it's homer."
16424,Homer,"so uh, what do you guys think of mindy?"
38465,Homer,why you little! i'll show you who's a flabbi!

16662,Homer,"oh, that i'll wear."
18395,Homer,pro: i'm drought and famine resistant.
14630,Homer,"marge, i've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer. basically, we become a family of traveling acrobats..."
21446,Homer,i love that dog.
16498,Homer,the sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining sides.
38057,Homer,ten minute rule.
17805,Homer,oh no.
19040,Homer,i'll take that.
20459,Homer,so...
26651,Homer,"and ""otto"" is ""otto"" backwards."
33229,Homer,what does it do?
14610,Homer,"dad, you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not."
28621,Homer,i wish i had bullies like you growing up.
24897,Homer,all named 'morton'... or... 'mortonson'...
32242,Homer,throw my hands up and
26677,Homer,"oh, man. oh, man. we killed mr. burns. mr. burns is gonna be so mad."

21913,Homer,"what's in your brand new bag, mama?"
26907,Homer,"marge, doesn't lisa have a human face?"
37666,Homer,i'm thinking about it!
17879,Homer,"gosh, moe, i use these all the time. couldn't you just bash my head in?"
17007,Homer,"well, i'm opposed to the whole thing! damn opposed!"
40473,Homer,ewwww.
22604,Homer,"oh, no! ho, ho. i'm not falling for that again. if it doesn't have siamese twins in a jar, it's not a fair."
35953,Homer,springfield colonial village?!
16494,Homer,mmmm... marge.
23619,Homer,there you are.
16295,Homer,that's them!
16683,Homer,everything really wrapped up nicely. much quicker than usual.
32065,Homer,"i'm willing to change my mind, and that makes me great. you can stay. but you have to give us an eight-by-ten for our wall of casual acquaintances who came to stay for a while."
38166,Homer,i guess. you're funny! no wonder lisa's in love with you.
39190,Homer,are you gonna put my head in a vise?
21012,Homer,but i'm not a h--
26027,Homer,"bar? i see no bar. this is a hunting club...which is permitted by state law ""to serve beverages of a refreshing nature."""
15790,Homer,we're going back to work!
32640,Homer,"why don't we all pick the most ridiculous candidate, and write him in?"
38511,Homer,"i love this boat, with all its pullies and flappies and... everything has a name."
39306,Homer,"number eight. i mean, santa's little helper."
14056,Homer,"yeah, things are tough all over."
17825,Homer,how 'bout if i just squirt you in the face with my boutonniere?
21916,Homer,woo hoo!
20983,Homer,"fine, fine. what do you do... ""dr. simpson""?"
36197,Homer,"oh, lighten up, marge. i take you to the disneyland of me, and you just wanna go to the lost and found. well guess what? we're stayin' in this dream forever!"
33171,Homer,"six cups, please. and put it on my tab."
30121,Homer,"lord, you got a first-class destination resort here. really top notch. but i can't enjoy myself knowing my family is suffering."
15569,Homer,"it's just not fair, dammit!"
28717,Homer,home sweet home. now to watch some tv.
39732,Homer,"you know, bart, when i was your age, i pulled a few boners, but i think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half... oh, oh."
23238,Homer,maarge. i think bart's gone crazy!
38136,Homer,fighting tweakers rule!
35041,Homer,guess i'll put these tools away. put 'em on hooks and stuff.

27083,Homer,here you go.
14417,Homer,my daughter.
19924,Homer,crowds give him gas.
34342,Homer,we can't let bart drive us apart. he's the reason we had to get married.
21431,Homer,"another super year with a super lady. good night, honey."
26188,Homer,"look, the thing about my family is, there's five of us. marge, bart, girl-bart, the one who doesn't talk, and the fat guy. how i loathe him."
23115,Homer,we didn't? that's odd. seems like we would've done that right after we left the car place.
21338,Homer,"aww. goodbye, everyone. don't touch my stuff."
14783,Homer,"yes, but doesn't the bible also say, ""thou shalt not take moochers into thy... hut""?"
39020,Homer,"aw, man, i wish those were white meatballs."
28387,Homer,"marge, please. i'm too upset to talk about it."
15742,Homer,don't think about beer... don't think about beer... don't think about beer...
41022,Homer,"ah, unky herb, i don't know anything about cars."
16966,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, let me get this straight. they let everybody out of school early, just because you brought a dog?"
20515,Homer,"please. also, i think i'm getting a bedsore. what do you have to do to get turned around here?"
37776,Homer,"shake it! now, roll over on your tummy, just like i taught you."
36687,Homer,i was alive when my dad knew you?
34761,Homer,"oh man, i'm never comin' down."
20395,Homer,"i know i said that, but what i secretly meant was..."
24753,Homer,"oh, here we go."
21168,Homer,simpson residence.
27106,Homer,never!
35071,Homer,"and if you do it, son, you'll get the same."
21192,Homer,"you're pushin' me, baby."
22405,Homer,"people are laughing at me, marge. let's get outta here. forget the baby's medicine."
17534,Homer,"lisa, the important thing is for your mother to repress what happened. push it deep down inside her... so she'll never annoy us again."
30450,Homer,"well, are you gonna talk about it, or are you gonna do it?"
15952,Homer,"bart, what did i tell you?"
25328,Homer,"well, look who's here. you two are goin' down."
25613,Homer,comin' in from the left.
35133,Homer,okay... i'll take some of... that.
13991,Homer,then he has no hobbies.
37959,Homer,"i know, mr. sparkle."
27676,Homer,stained with the blood of american patriots.
29259,Homer,so that's what that white noise was.
30514,Homer,"okay, lisa. time for daddy's big surprise!"
19498,Homer,...but our sames go right down to the bone. maybe we do have a...
33384,Homer,"virgin? what are you, a girl?"
22458,Homer,"woo, privilege!"
15660,Homer,"sure, boy."
25420,Homer,"say no more. i'll help you, lenny."
18700,Homer,"oh, this game could mean big things for me, marge. if i beat mr. burns, i mean really wallop him bad... i'm sure to get that big raise i've been gunning for."
15169,Homer,"yummy, yummy, yummy/ i've got love in my tummy/ and i feel like lovin' you..."
28578,Homer,i am rudy giuliani. you must forgive homer. i am rudy giuliani. you must forgive homer. i am.
24955,Homer,step right up! see the magic boy! witness mystifying feats that will leave you scratching your head until it's raw and bloody!
23643,Homer,yes it is. it's very good and you're a good little baby. yes you are.
35105,Homer,drive my kids to school?! never!
37107,Homer,"marge, let me set your mind straight about something -- that spectacular young couple is definitely better for the kids. but those kids are ours, because we made them, by accident. and now, we're gonna take them back because we love them, especially now that we've had a little time apart from them."
35758,Homer,"hey, you wouldn't say that... unless there was a need to thank you."
18292,Homer,get what?
27739,Homer,wait'll he steps on this flaming bag of... lisa's college fund?!
17725,Homer,"steve -- i mean al, i think i deserve a raise."
26840,Homer,woo hoo! he's alive. now you can't punish me.
21790,Homer,"a gallon of wheat grass juice, a five pound wad of tofu, some jellied zinc, and a couple-a pairs of $600 sunglasses."
34559,Homer,coming!
40721,Homer,"shut up, boy. cheap chinese tvs... why did i every buy... is that better?"
31067,Homer,the heart is the symbol for love.
37116,Homer,i win!
21636,Homer,i did it! i'm gonna be rich!
40924,Homer,must find man. must find man. must find man.
15522,Homer,what's it to ya?
15212,Homer,"marge, you're making a big mistake. i'm going to see you all day at work and all night at home..."
19085,Homer,"i'm homer simpson, sir, and i'm gonna get you back to washington before it's too late!"
22300,Homer,"well, at least they've already done me."
17689,Homer,i've got sand in my underpants.
31727,Homer,he was a great dad! every year he got so mad when santa didn't bring me presents.
34552,Homer,"man, who are these belts made for, french supermodels?"
23580,Homer,flavor of the month? me?
35520,Homer,wayne!

36275,Homer,"hush, bionic prince, as i cradle your waning form."
36790,Homer,which of you is the youtube of the kid high on dentist's gas? is it you? is it you? is it you?
14594,Homer,you'll never guess what happened marge! are you ready? i... have... a feeling... that we may win... the lottery!
39688,Homer,no!
35459,Homer,i thought i was.
31228,Homer,this doesn't taste like i thought it would.
33553,Homer,i see--
30668,Homer,or a place run by a hindu!
22868,Homer,it's glorious! the streets are paved with water. you could ride a walrus to work!
31642,Homer,or my wife!
26547,Homer,why didn't you call me?
37861,Homer,"well, this crazy scheme is the kind of impulsive behavior i want to encourage in you. i'm in. a hundred percent!"
25203,Homer,"not ""trash can,"" son. dr. homer's miracle spine-o-cylinder! patent pending."
33011,Homer,there he is!
22455,Homer,"so i said ""if this is the house of pancakes, how come i can't eat the walls?"""
32268,Homer,some of those were pretty funny.
36312,Homer,but i can't afford this...
28171,Homer,"jasper, your time has come!"
40839,Homer,that's right. sixty-eight channels. mtv for the kids. vh-1 for us. sixteen hundred hours of quality programming every day!

26794,Homer,whee! whee!
16957,Homer,you idiot! he was the most talented one!
23809,Homer,"that's not true, he left it on the bus."
25784,Homer,now let's all enjoy the snack table while we still have it.
36780,Homer,"sweetie, in the future all you'll need is this."
26217,Homer,can't panic! must remain calm.
13860,Homer,"whew! just in the nick of... mmm, beer?"
24054,Homer,"that's a damn lie, and you know it! gimme a shirt!"
29327,Homer,it's a conversation starter!
30622,Homer,"stupid italy... wish you'd never been unified by victor emmanuel the second... if only you'd stayed a loose confederation of city-states, trading with each other and occasionally warring."
37932,Homer,"but when times seemed darkest, one minute ago, she was there, and gave me the strength and courage to fight for what i believe in."
30180,Homer,when are you gonna stop poking me? will it be soon?
31670,Homer,"it's a tragedy, a real tragedy. i mean, what kind of tramp gets knocked up before she's even married?"
16526,Homer,"bart, i don't want to alarm you, but there may be a boogeyman or boogeymen in the house!"
41421,Homer,what kind of afterlife is this? can't even strangle my dead kid.
37788,Homer,"oh man, i really overdid it tonight."
26790,Homer,"uh, we didn't order that."

15309,Homer,"hello, i'm mr. plow. are you tired of having your hands cut off by snow blowers, and the inevitable heart attacks that come with shoveling snow?"
39177,Homer,what are the skits about?
24593,Homer,"it's a badger all right... or possibly a griffin. bart, do you have any dynamite in your room?"
15384,Homer,about three weeks.
41128,Homer,you'll be a bonehead. come on.
38709,Homer,"homer simpson, i love you."
33878,Homer,"he who laughs last, laughs dead."

32281,Homer,you're hovering over a hydrant!
35059,Homer,"i liked the producing, the executive producing and especially the co-producing. but the supervising producing was the best i've ever seen."
15325,Homer,"barney, you stole my idea!"

27197,Homer,"gentlemen, say hello to springfield's newest supermodel!"
34137,Homer,it's a father-son commitment band that i bought and never told you about!
20314,Homer,"relax, marge. if someone tries to get in here, my burglar alarm will let us know."
26985,Homer,ned...

32790,Homer,i was having the most wonderful dream. i always wake up just before the good part.
36880,Homer,"your organic, all-natural lifestyle has doomed us all!"
34943,Homer,fifty bucks?! that used to cover two public nudities and a poop in the park!
23193,Homer,"well, whatever it is, we've got to get rolling on our next picture."
15978,Homer,i meant the statue.

19420,Homer,"five-alarm chili, eh?"
13814,Homer,"why at that little shop, right over... there."
19305,Homer,"you know what you two need? a little comic strip called ""love is."" it's about two naked eight year olds who are married."
21742,Homer,"is there anything you can prescribe, doctor?"
23145,Homer,"okay, while mel and i are working, why don't you guys do the town? i hear all the stars eat at a place called planet hollywood."
26369,Homer,"oh guys, it was horrible. i saw marge kissing a far superior man."
35907,Homer,"welcome to ""gut check with homer simpson""! where the truth is served, with a side of in your face!"
27642,Homer,"who the hell is mr. flanders? oh, flanders."
20961,Homer,that makes 22 to 16.

19383,Homer,"hope you like it, neighbor. we didn't have the best tools or all the know-how, but we did have a wheelbarrow full of love."
27824,Homer,"aww, marge saved all this stuff from when we were going out. the fake business card i made up to impress her..."
21337,Homer,"that's right, brad and neil. i only eat power sauce -- the bar with apple-saucicity."

25168,Homer,whuzzit... my juice box!
35439,Homer,hm. is it drinking and driving if you're flying a blimp? maybe i can find the answer by texting.
33732,Homer,i still taste over-tones of pink!
35165,Homer,"hey, they're like five bucks on ebay."
31832,Homer,i'll be your ref!
18078,Homer,you did what?!!
27218,Homer,don't worry. we'll just hang out in front of the house beside these garbage cans. the time will just fly by.

23620,Homer,"hi maggie! i'm homie-womie, the teletubby. and i'm all man, in case you've heard otherwise. let's see what's on tummy-vision!"
34673,Homer,"uh yes, i'd like... um... how do you say taco in mexican?"

21651,Homer,"look, son. edison was just like me."
31170,Homer,i'm going back to the stadium to bring those two kids back together. and i'll do it with or without you!
36922,Homer,he's still my dog!
26481,Homer,in real life he would die.
24725,Homer,"sorry you're such jerks! ha, ha!"
26975,Homer,hm...
24671,Homer,"but those olde springfield squares are just gonna make you cut your hair, turn down your music and wear frilly shirts like keith partridge."
19033,Homer,"deal. see, flanders, you give a little, you get a little."
33636,Homer,what the? i'm chained up like a common bicycle!
36222,Homer,well... i didn't really feel like going to moe's today... thought i might hang out here for as long as i can take it.
25902,Homer,no!
13841,Homer,"i love you, son."
25246,Homer,okay!
40475,Homer,"oh, hi, kids. thanks."
35761,Homer,this party is so much better than the crummy ones we plan.
23424,Homer,coming through... challenge... duel... hi lenny... how dare you... demand satisfaction...
18245,Homer,"so, ned, you're having a family reunion and you didn't invite me?"
22749,Homer,"well... the last time i saw him, he was in a big plastic bag."
39095,Homer,we never dreamed.
40878,Homer,"it's coming down. my foot is, that's it, marge. it's coming down. the cable stays. the foot has spoken."
19273,Homer,"i told you last night, no! where is bart, anyway? his dinner's getting all cold and eaten."

40034,Homer,whoo hoo! all right!
20100,Homer,"lousy bart... his money... all right, new york, i'm coming back. but you're not getting this!"
14491,Homer,"marge, you're a tool of the dog house makers."
21120,Homer,"well, i'm just glad it's all over."
28241,Homer,"you weren't around for the birth of your grandson, and i want you to see it."
32565,Homer,bring it on.
35929,Homer,just an innocuous little symbol like a smiley face or a like an i.o.u.
29442,Homer,don't dump me out! i can lose weight! just give me a chance.
35384,Homer,"a hundred dollars?! marge, how much is that in smackaroos?"
33926,Homer,"this life is the greatest. i get paid a fortune, i've got a closet full of free sneakers and watches, and i get to hire my friends."
21530,Homer,"hey, hey, you're taking our grease!"
37611,Homer,and they also gave me an alcohol detox.
29306,Homer,"and lisa, what have you learned?"
31222,Homer,"uh, no. sorry if it sounded like i did."
32597,Homer,marge put so much work into that party. the least i could do is be surprised. if only i could forget what happened today.
16890,Homer,i know. he's grooming me. mmm... elephant fresh.
36853,Homer,wearing scarves in non-scarf weather is the essence of cool. the. essence.
15809,Homer,"i love you too, son. you know, boy, i don't think i've ever felt as close to you as i do right --"
30938,Homer,"thanks, sweetie. i've never been less angry to receive a book."
18172,Homer,"hey, didn't you direct ""unnatural discretion""?"
16651,Homer,what kind of catchphrase is that?
31721,Homer,"no, no. this place is too expensive. i saw you doing a ""five-hundred piece"" jigsaw puzzle in there!"
31828,Homer,"hey, lisa, self-conscious about your shins? in my day, girls were worried about their boobs."
30136,Homer,ah... this is heaven.
15145,Homer,"bart, did you take out the garbage like i asked?"
18233,Homer,let me get a pad....
27418,Homer,i'll just hide here.
30331,Homer,"i, uh, needed them for my remote control helicopter."
39220,Homer,"what is it, flanders?"
39542,Homer,"where the hell are my keys? who stole my keys? come on, i'm late for work."
24183,Homer,"now, if ""the flintstones"" has taught us anything, it's that pelicans can be used to mix cement."
41346,Homer,wait a minute. these guys don't know me. i can be whatever i want.
16904,Homer,"sorry, bart. i'm gonna have to sell him."
39197,Homer,i'm not leaving this casino until you stop punishing people for counting cards. they're just playing the game by the rules!
32100,Homer,why are you applauding them? we wrote it!
23135,Homer,"listen, gibson, i'm tired of hollywood pretty boys like you and jack valenti thinking you can have any woman you want. you see this?"
27136,Homer,"nah, i've got something to remember 'em by."
26548,Homer,that's it. they have awoken a sleeping giant.
17946,Homer,"oh, that should..."
29727,Homer,"sure, if it'll give you peace of mind. but i'm not gonna die for many, many years."
36490,Homer,voop! voop! voop! voop!
37411,Homer,"no tents, no barrels, no kiddy pools. thank you, fashion police."
39372,Homer,those perfectionists? forget it.
40874,Homer,"look, look, marge. i can't afford it. when i can afford to pay for it, i will. but i can't, so i'm not going to."
16860,Homer,"push her down, son."
21022,Homer,"oh, he did, did he? i'll show him! i'll bring you a weapon of unimaginable destructive power!"
18212,Homer,"oh, bartholemew, i feel like st. augustine of hippo after his conversion by ambrose of milan."
36016,Homer,thanks for reading it to me.
20329,Homer,five days! but i'm mad now!
23926,Homer,hey!
35897,Homer,almost a winner!
15051,Homer,"hey, barney, will you give me 250 bucks for this blimp ticket?"
18489,Homer,at least this time i'm awake for your goodbye.
37427,Homer,it's not even noon.
24831,Homer,baby made a boom-boom.
14592,Homer,one hundred and thirty million dollars!
33390,Homer,"i would've been a winner, instead of some idiot spending his saturday night staring into a bowl of sauce. why did fate do this to me?"
30451,Homer,marge isn't home.
16094,Homer,"oh, not souter... oh, no."
18176,Homer,"marge, there's a spider near my car keys."
23503,Homer,"aw, thanks honey."
24939,Homer,absolutely.
26189,Homer,"okay, why are we in the woods? is this heaven?"
26482,Homer,"hey, watch the movie."

30428,Homer,"david, you're by far the best son i've ever had. uh-oh."
38422,Homer,"well, if that's how you think it has to be."
22612,Homer,where? i don't see that.
16974,Homer,"how do you do, sir?"
19386,Homer,"your beautiful kitchen, ned. just as you remember it."
19413,Homer,i'm missing the cook-off! it's going on right now and i'm missin' it!
29166,Homer,"there's a lot you don't know about me, marge. a lot that would shock you."
25654,Homer,abra-ca-thumbra.
23391,Homer,that's us!
17399,Homer,"do your worst, protesters you can't stop me from living my life!"
32337,Homer,"oh marge, i was afraid i was going to lose you! ohhh! now let me help you make your slow transition back to society."
32720,Homer,"i, uh, i have to count the atoms at the nuclear plant. conservation of mass -- it's the law."
14585,Homer,stupid fingers.
21330,Homer,"overshoot the extreme, max the envelope, and so on."
15239,Homer,"come on, marge. maybe i'm not getting enough ...estrogen."
40522,Homer,"hey, tomorrow night, how about making some of your patented pork chops?"
16693,Homer,are we in india yet?
17434,Homer,and ted koppel is a robot.
16846,Homer,"neddie, neddie... let's get in a quick nine down at the pitch and putt."
24335,Homer,look out!
28017,Homer,"come on, transmit. transmit!"

38541,Homer,"well, you woke up the right man in bed."
27529,Homer,we'll just see about that.
24399,Homer,"hey, where is everybody?"
35069,Homer,"well in that case, lisa was using her solar calculator yesterday so i opened the drapes to let in more sun."
33235,Homer,sir? that's the kind of respect you'd have to strangle out of an american kid.
23066,Homer,"hey, you know, i once knew a man from nantucket."
29026,Homer,you've hurt your last feeling!
33209,Homer,i wanna change my bet... i'm going against my daughter.
16821,Homer,"oh, yeah. a judge made me do that once, too. stupid lack of public urinals. hey, just so you don't have to suffer alone, i'm comin' with ya."

23451,Homer,"hello, kitty."
38705,Homer,"marge, i have a confession to make about this trip."

30610,Homer,"now we have to drive it straight to rome, where it'll be shipped to mr. burns in springfield."
31326,Homer,wouldn't that take me away from my family for two whole years?
16527,Homer,"oh, nothing, marge. just a little incident involving the boogeyman. of course, none of this would've happened if you'd been here to keep me from acting stupid."
25413,Homer,"either you honor my wife's coupon, or a lot more lids will be unscrewed."
14367,Homer,yeah!
30772,Homer,"marge, i ripped my pants! the only pants that understand my complex hiney."

40695,Homer,"oh, it was busy. moe, another last beer, please."
32651,Homer,"oh, it was a wonderful time. the iraq war was over once and for all, a struggling matt groening created ""futurama,"" and young people believed in their dreams, thanks to a tv show called ""melrose place""..."
28702,Homer,uh-huh.
28487,Homer,that evil old bone bag... smelling of death... nose like a vulture... followed everywhere by that kiss-ass smithers...
29473,Homer,"whew, that's a relief!"

26802,Homer,"are you okay, lisa?"
38223,Homer,it's okay. i'm an american!
28059,Homer,too hot! too hot!
32148,Homer,"we're manufacturing a new pipe diameter, five-eighths inch. the company wants you and me to take the private plane to new york for the premiere! so meet me at shelbyville airport in an hour."
40591,Homer,we have meatloaf!
38875,Homer,you're the doctor.
28843,Homer,"ow, my ankles snapped."
34888,Homer,"dearly beloved. i'd like to open this service with the words of emily dickinson: ""hope is the thing with feathers..."""
16366,Homer,"oh, twenty dollars. i wanted a peanut."
34674,Homer,"yes, that's exactly the word i want to translate."
33537,Homer,"no, you stupid dog -- that's maggie's bunny!"
16761,Homer,wow! former president james taylor.
38369,Homer,fat tony?
18659,Homer,then we're agreed. there'll be trouble.
19217,Homer,and what if he's not? then we'd look like idiots.
14981,Homer,"marge, come to bed."
20750,Homer,"oh, it won't be long. once their resume gets out, they'll have all kinds of offers. the older one can pull out his left eye."
32646,Homer,"oh, the patriot act is so terrible! the government might find out what library books i take out. what's next -- finding out what operas i go to?"
20869,Homer,a rest home for pirates?
28627,Homer,affirmative.
35881,Homer,but i have to go to the bathroom!
36346,Homer,spoiler!
25594,Homer,anything for these noble animals.
20867,Homer,it's not enough to want a cracker. you have to earn it!
40899,Homer,"oh, sure, sure. be my guest."
40103,Homer,why you little...
35095,Homer,the boy's flash drive may be in there. but i've got a lifetime of nuclear secrets up here.
29425,Homer,"wow, this is just like hawaii, but you don't get beaten up if you leave the hotel. what gives?"
14394,Homer,not quite. they were out of the malibu stacie lunar rovers.
41012,Homer,"oh, okay."
27153,Homer,put pie here.
25679,Homer,ahh... is that a fact? and you think you know someone.
39565,Homer,i am not. it's just that i couldn't concentrate with that infernal racket. lisa! lisa!
29898,Homer,"you know son, my dad used to take me down to johnson's hardware. old man johnson knew everything about fixin' stuff. when they built this place, he hung himself."
29565,Homer,"where's the remote! this is not a drill, people!"
34588,Homer,keep guessing...
36158,Homer,a common misconception.
33064,Homer,"stop it, both of you! don't make me drive into that tree! you know i will!"
24721,Homer,i have a plan.
29950,Homer,at what time?
37064,Homer,stop being blasé!
24137,Homer,"sure, sure, bob's your uncle. let's just get outta here!"
16373,Homer,egghead likes his bookie wook!
23405,Homer,"ooo, you don't want to get zorro mad."

40062,Homer,"ah, dinner with three beautiful women. i must be in heaven."
39364,Homer,march your butt right out here. now!
20974,Homer,"marge, get me your address book, four beers, and my conversation hat."
27688,Homer,i didn't say anything. so naïve.
39449,Homer,"snap out of it, marge. you've got to come with me--the boss is going to make a toast!"
36110,Homer,the phone's dead.
14040,Homer,"great, thanks."
37789,Homer,"no. i'm exhausted from ""head, shoulders, knees and toes. knees and toes."" it's the ""toes"" that get ya, marge. it's the toes..."
39422,Homer,...and i'm gonna have to live with out your respect and awe. the only reason i'm telling you this is i'm going to be leaving you.
13396,Homer,no.
30222,Homer,"look, marge, i know i was supposed to yell at that priest, but he's so cool. he plays drums in a band with a bunch of other priests!"
27597,Homer,"i put you in humiliating commercials for money, which i spent on myself. i just wish i had an opportunity to make things right."
23684,Homer,"okay, this is gettin' weird."
20741,Homer,no. he's bart.
16732,Homer,i can't! i can't!
33647,Homer,"what's fun about fire ants? they're-- oh, you're being sarcastic."
18747,Homer,"i've been called a greasy thug too, and it never stops hurting. so here's what we're gonna do: grease ourselves up real good, and trash that place with a baseball bat."
41118,Homer,"yes, i do."
41555,Homer,now why would i be angry and bitter? because i'm paying for you to make goo-goo eyes at some smooth-talking professor?
33083,Homer,no.
25362,Homer,"i can't believe it! i'm actually running a marathon! oh, i hit the wall! this is so painful! hey, i got my second wind. another wall! i ju-- woo hoo! third wind!"
35548,Homer,hey! wha?! wha?! wha?!
20058,Homer,"marge, have you ever imagined what it would be like if we really were beavers?"
29607,Homer,"...and do you, julio, take thad to be your lawful wedded life partner, in massachusetts and vermont... maybe canada... stay outta texas... as long as you both are gay?"
23539,Homer,"nope. nope. this would be a lot easier without all these people. nope. nope. it's there-- uh, nope."
33399,Homer,"a lot of great things have happened to me lately, but they're nothing compared to meeting you. may i have this dance?"
17542,Homer,"every since you started therapy all you can do is talk about yourself. well what about me, marge?"
34695,Homer,uh-oh. what kind of ventilating is that?
19369,Homer,"what is it, boy? fire? earthquake? hippies?"
35049,Homer,huh?
21587,Homer,... and then he worked on a machine to communicate with the dead. some kind of scary telephone i guess. or maybe he planned to just stick his head under the ground and yell.
25456,Homer,dancin' away my hunger pangs / movin' my feet so my stomach won't hurt / i'm kinda like jesus / but not in a sacrilegious way...
16067,Homer,"no, ma'am."
38954,Homer,"go get it, boy!"
38366,Homer,"wow. i've gotta take that in. while i do, have some bar nuts."

15025,Homer,"no, don't tell me, i'll get it... oh, i know! the lord is vengeful! o spiteful one! show me who to smite, and they shall be smoten!"
19649,Homer,"marge, i was just watching women's volleyball on espn..."
32409,Homer,"good idea. i'll drown my sorrows in anchor steam beer! oh, i'm sorry!"
37717,Homer,"well, we've gotta do it! i never leave a job unfinished. it's as true now as that week i worked on the high school yearbook. so much infighting. i had to get outta there!"
32647,Homer,"don't worry, kids. these wool socks and down parkas will keep you warm."
19921,Homer,do you think he noticed?
35372,Homer,"actually, dad, as the supervising parent today, you'll get your share of the blame, too."
29595,Homer,the lie is love.
17493,Homer,we're both screw-ups.
33313,Homer,yep.
20210,Homer,you do that.
21140,Homer,"wowww, that must be worth a fortune."
18306,Homer,"oh yeah? well it's my house, so it's my spot."
25867,Homer,tethered?!
29553,Homer,"yeah... you help me, and i, in turn, am helped by you."
19473,Homer,okay.
21791,Homer,you shouldn't have to survive on dry crumbly muffins from... the gersh agency. you should let me do your shopping. i know where i can get you some great muffins.
28480,Homer,"oh carl, you remembered i like tv!"
15612,Homer,"marge, when kids these days say bad, they mean good. and to shake your booty means to wiggle one's butt. permit me to demonstrate."
28235,Homer,"i mean, i'm due back in this same courtroom three times today. hell, i torched a blood bank. one cookie my ass! please, please, give me back my mommy."
19922,Homer,who?
27587,Homer,"yeah, i make up words too. anyway, i was wondering if you could pretend to lose to me in a skateboarding contest so i can be a hero to my boy again."
15585,Homer,but i love solids.
18291,Homer,"hee hee hee. i've got your donut, lard lad! and what are you gonna do about it?"
14326,Homer,"don't worry, you'll grow into it."
26003,Homer,cecil is a girl's name.
27133,Homer,"what am i, the lost and found?"
20088,Homer,"shut up! it's my car, and i say we're going to the lost city of gold!"
19327,Homer,'cause marge and i have one thing that can never be broken: a strong marriage built on a solid foundation of routine.
17928,Homer,i'll never forgive myself for this.
24354,Homer,are you a good driver?
35835,Homer,how would you know?
23536,Homer,did somebody say num num?
32221,Homer,what? that's how guys talk.
14862,Homer,"i try, but i can't."
25524,Homer,pound that nerd.
38467,Homer,"yes, son. we can."
23749,Homer,no dice!
41382,Homer,...lisa simpson.
17202,Homer,no no no no no no no no no. ask your mother.
19201,Homer,"aw, c'mon, i'll make a fortune for one night's work! we could have all the things we always dreamed of: a snooty butler, carpeted car ports, those blue cupcakes they sell sometimes --"
18843,Homer,"hey, look what i snagged, marge -- the candy bride and groom from the wedding cake."
35295,Homer,why you little...?!
40842,Homer,marge --
20099,Homer,and that's when the chuds came at me.
23393,Homer,uh... shiny mcshine?
38049,Homer,"seriously, do you have my money?"
22951,Homer,"well, you don't have to call me slovenly."
20577,Homer,absolutely.
35203,Homer,i thought they'd do bits -- but their most famous bit?!
32992,Homer,daddy's home! i brought you kids some stuff from work!
36547,Homer,"a black hole? i'm sorry, can we call it that?"
38682,Homer,"oh, thank you."
38452,Homer,come on. let's go. i can't stand to see my family unhappy on america's holiest day.
18953,Homer,when are people going to learn -- democracy doesn't work!
38379,Homer,"hey, you know, i don't think this guy likes girls."
17883,Homer,"well, good luck finding it because i'm gonna take the numbers off tonight."
37443,Homer,did she really say that?
20282,Homer,"oh, man that's good."
38152,Homer,whoa! whoa! whoa!
32551,Homer,done.
25470,Homer,me so hungee.
18039,Homer,"lisa, if you don't like your job you don't strike. you just go in every day and do it really half-assed. that's the american way."
39938,Homer,wait a minute. bart -- you know that guy on your lunch box?
32123,Homer,is this going somewhere?
21615,Homer,"first, my all-purpose electric hammer. ""for all your pounding needs."""
34273,Homer,"sweep! sweep! left, right! left, right! back-and-forth!"
34255,Homer,and you like tomato...
22403,Homer,i wish i hadn't bought a hundred of these.
16997,Homer,"great, marge. i wanna hear all about it."
26250,Homer,we're going to build the world's tallest human pyramid!
15737,Homer,"t.v. have you turned on me, too?"
29524,Homer,"honey, i bet you're wondering why daddy's not at work again. the answer may surprise you. i have a new job choreographing end zone dances for a professional football player."
33733,Homer,hm. it feels like food. but it has no flavor whatsoever.
27478,Homer,"yeah, well, nachos are nachos."
29237,Homer,"marge, i don't want to buy this house. i'd have to live next door to myself."
36453,Homer,"mmm, historically inaccurate."
34894,Homer,i got the idea from a show where people regret these.
29363,Homer,"oh, i see what's goin' on. you can't stand to be around a guy who's got total financial independence."
36739,Homer,i knew you were weak.
16574,Homer,woo hoo! woo hoo hoo hoo!
41483,Homer,wheeee -- i'm sort of rich! i can rent anything i want!
21793,Homer,"please, homer. c'mon, if you let me hang around a while, i can do all kinds of stuff for ya."
18648,Homer,hey! my taxes paid for that horn!
16949,Homer,how come bart gets to do that and i can't spend one night lurking in the bushes outside chef boyardee's house?
37304,Homer,"and uh, how was your day?"
21234,Homer,"quiet, you! i know you youngsters wanna see these rockin' rockers. but i also know you care about the race for sanitation commissioner. so, let me give ya the 911..."
35933,Homer,only one hundred percent?
22519,Homer,"not yet, i'm not. you'll know when i'm driving. and it'll..."
37853,Homer,snow?! snow!!!
30906,Homer,you make me laugh / you make me cry / without you i'd just / want to die / for the rest of my life / you'll be a fixture / now let me enjoy / your picture in picture...
32648,Homer,i thought global warming would take care of it. al gore can't do anything right.
17190,Homer,"oh, baby."
24142,Homer,"jebus, where are you?! homer to jebus!"
29946,Homer,on what channel?
26014,Homer,suckers!
24407,Homer,let's go!
14214,Homer,"oh, i wrote down what i was gonna say on a card. stupid thing must have fallen out of my pocket."
27286,Homer,"mardi gras, eh? didn't last year's king have to abdicate because he married a commoner?"
24878,Homer,"hey, moe, can you keep a secret?"
32806,Homer,get back here so we can put our love on a shirt!
34814,Homer,come and get it.
19599,Homer,"i think i won, mr. burns."
27789,Homer,talking won't get you there.
31966,Homer,"moe, can we talk?"
15074,Homer,will you remember this the next
19873,Homer,"hey, boy, get crackin'! moe upped his order to twenty balls a night!"
34988,Homer,oh no! no! i... was uh... just thinking how cheap this crime would have been in the seventies when gas was thirty-five cents a gallon.
35441,Homer,what was that?
22835,Homer,"lisa, all great artists love free food. check out jasper johns."
27011,Homer,"what's up, honey? want a little lovin'?"
17248,Homer,"yes, ma'am. sideshow bob. yakkin' it up on the ol' yak-box."
37283,Homer,"okay! i'll pay for your damn band candy! what was it, seventeen hundred dollars?"
18389,Homer,venting prevents explo-si-on. this is hard. where's my tab? okay then -- yes. vent the stupid gas.
29278,Homer,"would you excuse us, milton?"
40303,Homer,"omigod! i don't believe it. it's really you, the capital city ""goofball."""
14657,Homer,"look who's oinking! ""look who's oinking""!"
37088,Homer,worrywart marge. you don't look a trojan horse in the mouth.
15442,Homer,"hey, c'mon, quit it."
27567,Homer,i'll show you worse!
39073,Homer,this is it.
24861,Homer,"yep, you can't go wrong with mr. x."
33052,Homer,"stupid shopping list, turning food into work. bart!"
25516,Homer,canceled.
29539,Homer,i wanna see him too. maybe he can tell me how to get this off.
22263,Homer,"oh, stupid isotopes. hurry up and lose so we can get out of here!"
23047,Homer,"well, let's see what's in the ol' vacation fund."
33058,Homer,that kid has become a dennis-level menace!
24961,Homer,a good son would come through for his dad!
39989,Homer,don't forget to tell me when you see the off-ramp.
16777,Homer,oh stupid sheep.
40689,Homer,"you gotta help me, barney. i'm in jail."
23354,Homer,try not to look too sad -- it'll seem suspicious.
32332,Homer,"an hour and fifty-four minutes to spare. with my free time i can finally work on my ""superman"" novel."
20755,Homer,carnies took over our house. you've gotta help us.
26335,Homer,but bold moves are no longer my forte!
15935,Homer,yeah.
29523,Homer,"""l"" is for ""loser,"" which describes you, sir. don't try to stop me. just enjoy the view, sir."
26253,Homer,mm-hm.
34788,Homer,this proves nothing. roger could've been the one that killed them!
32223,Homer,"marge, when i'm onstage i can only sing those love songs by picturing your beautiful face. so in a way, my groupies are really our groupies."
35027,Homer,"ooh, i got a text!"
17250,Homer,uh-huh.
38918,Homer,"yes, sir. yes, sir. can i get a four fifty-five wakeup call?"
33038,Homer,huh?
27657,Homer,tissues please!
34376,Homer,"well, don't worry, boy. i know a wholesome way to take your mind off girls."
15372,Homer,my cousin frank did it.
36538,Homer,"aw, look at that -- my little guy's finally realizing how complicated grown-up feelings can be."
20604,Homer,i like being thanked.
14459,Homer,"go to sleep and goodnight/ da da da / da da da da da da da da/ dee dee dee / dee dee / may your christmas day be nice. goodnight, my little pork chop."
29369,Homer,"lisa, basic cable said i should nurture you."
41172,Homer,"all right, scale. you don't like me and i don't like you, but i've been very good, so you better treat me right."
36025,Homer,"did you say ""ultimate frisbee?"""
36579,Homer,"you, me and marge?"
32416,Homer,"oh, i'll never remember what color marge's eyes are!"
35312,Homer,i dunno. there's something about this noose i just don't like.
38545,Homer,"marge, come on, let's celebrate! it's your first day!"
34077,Homer,what happened?
39600,Homer,bart! i suppose it has..uh..various features?
14250,Homer,me! me! me! me! me! i said it first!
18533,Homer,don't mind if i do.
35904,Homer,"yeah, that's what i'm talkin' about! those real people out there who buy their coffee from the mini-mart, and grab enough sugar packs for a week! honest, hardworking, sugar-stealing americans!"
23176,Homer,"before ""lethal weapon 2"", i never thought there could be a bomb in my toilet, but now i check every time."
39185,Homer,if anything happens to marge... we'll all be orphans!
16849,Homer,"hey flanders, over here. i got us some kick-ass seats."
24248,Homer,"yeah, you were..."
35338,Homer,and we've got front row seats!
32792,Homer,"homer simpson. i know a lot of you from church, and the market and such. and i'm not much for talkin' -- but seems to me, in hard times like these that we americans come together."
16857,Homer,"hi, mom."
15566,Homer,"all right, i'm almost there."
29220,Homer,"oh, mag... no wait, this is yours."
16639,Homer,"it's okay, son. who cares what a bunch of fourth graders think? you're doing what you want to do with your life. nothing else matters."
33119,Homer,what a cute couple. she's gonna take him for a lot of money.
24400,Homer,fine. be nerds. i'll find some people who know the true meaning of the words par-tay.
38110,Homer,"wow, never had breakfast at six in the morning before."
19724,Homer,"nine hundred dollars? well, we'll have to dip into the retirement fund again."
13983,Homer,"oh great, you made me miss joe theisman."
41411,Homer,why you little!
39281,Homer,"sorry, barney. i may be a total washout as a father, but i'm not gonna take my kid to some sleazy dog track on christmas eve."
22922,Homer,"don't answer yet. watch how easy it is to flip hamburgers with the help of god's greatest creation, the spring."
29268,Homer,adult themes? what are you talking about?
30814,Homer,i realized i could never find the gold without your help. so i made it this week's family outing.
35700,Homer,just like marge said -- chemicals and test tubes. the open kitchen is a nice touch.
20156,Homer,fair enough.
24515,Homer,"hey, they can't take our house. my pot-bellied pig is in there."
27277,Homer,"so, which one of these psychos is gonna help me catch my killer?"
15099,Homer,"yeah, dogs like to bury old junk."
25605,Homer,"no, lisa, but i sure don't want to eat this crappy breakfast."
21534,Homer,"emus? really? oh, that's pretty crazy... nah... i'd only fail just like i fail at everything."
20061,Homer,"okay. now, before my boss comes, there's something important you should know --"
28445,Homer,"on our way to the clinic, i decided to give him a night his wang would never forget."
32591,Homer,"don't worry honey, i'll get you an ice pack. where's the ice pack?"
40040,Homer,"hey, i'm still beating you, boy."
34846,Homer,run!
24483,Homer,"becky, i think i speak for all of us when i say ""when's the ice cream gonna get here?"""
15767,Homer,that's-a-nice-a-donut.
14582,Homer,"so what're you gonna be, boy?"
31077,Homer,"well, the rest of your life for sure."
28857,Homer,"you got it. and when i feel weak, i will draw strength from the bible."
40507,Homer,wowww....
25353,Homer,a world without krusty -- what would that be like?
27846,Homer,"oh, so you don't like it when i drink. what other secrets have you been hoarding to use against me?"
35593,Homer,"...i want you to find out what's making that funny noise in homer simpson's car. it's, uhhh, you know, it's like a chigga-chigga-chigga-chigga. but you only hear it when you're driving over thirty. and you never hear it when you take it to the shop."
29260,Homer,"get lost, crook!"
31174,Homer,great. but enough of the baseball analogies. they sicken me.
38321,Homer,two at a time! heart exploding.
27317,Homer,"hey, i know you. you're my mechanic, junior."
20703,Homer,it's carnival time!
31762,Homer,or we could just resolve to be more careful with our open flames.
32997,Homer,evidence that i love my little girl.
24404,Homer,you'll have to catch me first.
34043,Homer,"all right, i put in a hundred-hour work week, but i took a power-nap while i was driving us here and now i'm rarin' to go!"
13933,Homer,no.
32563,Homer,"i've gotta find out who that guy is, but i need help. someone like bart, only smart. lisa!"
15959,Homer,"the next day, we started auditioning for chief wiggum's replacement..."
37465,Homer,wait a minute! something's reflected in the lenses of carl's sunglasses!
24517,Homer,who told you about those laws? was it marge?
13733,Homer,"aha! cigarettes, just as i thought."
35294,Homer,"oh come on, bust your daddy's chops."
35446,Homer,"bart, take the controls!"
30915,Homer,so... homer do good?
19591,Homer,so what are we gonna do?
39348,Homer,who's the lard butt?
26181,Homer,you got that right.
37815,Homer,"hey, what's this marching band have to do with homer junior? what? there were cheerleaders in our house? and nobody told me?"
41464,Homer,"huh... well, two can play at that game!"
33763,Homer,"time to take control of my son's life. let's see, what can he build..."
30563,Homer,i can't believe i lost after ben affleck campaigned day and night for me.
33363,Homer,so there's a chance i actually won! i've got to dig up that ballot box!
15792,Homer,"haw, haw. april fool's! i've been keepin' that carton of milk next to the furnace for six weeks! sucker!"
41084,Homer,"oh lisa, if they're ever going to pull the plug on me, i want you in my corner, honey."
27273,Homer,do not use steam room if you are overweight or have a heart condition.
22544,Homer,"c'mon, mom / flanders, woman!"
39897,Homer,"oh, that sector twelve."
35558,Homer,so cold. warm me up.
15085,Homer,can i go now?
30581,Homer,why does every woman i try to talk to run into cans?
40635,Homer,so you're going to die... 
35819,Homer,this family time is so precious. gotta go.
20791,Homer,who the hell is that? some kind of leader?
16451,Homer,who are you?
18850,Homer,"uh... oh -- this is a map of nuclear sites around the country. as a safety inspector, i am responsible for changing most of these light bulbs."
29583,Homer,the bad news keeps on coming.
18752,Homer,"oh, sure i do. i always believe in helping the little guy, and you're the littlest guy i know."
32150,Homer,"okay, so this should be enough money to get me up in the air, have a frank talk with marge then maybe eat a devilled egg."
39537,Homer,"what about you, boy?"
30802,Homer,i'm-so-stupid! i'm-so-stupid!
28381,Homer,cats!
32892,Homer,i'm fine -- it's my feelings that are mad.
23561,Homer,woo hoo!
13163,Homer,i found this stone earlier. i was gonna use it as a nerd-smasher... but i want you to have it.
33550,Homer,were you listening at all?
34019,Homer,i recommend / our dear old friend / bartender moe szyslak!
31613,Homer,"so this map leads to a treasure, huh?"
28833,Homer,"hey, my car insurance expired. quite a while ago."
19985,Homer,ow!
40433,Homer,"okay, out you go!"
37240,Homer,okay.
29682,Homer,"you name it, oh wise mountain ape."
35155,Homer,i have many people to thank...
21529,Homer,"hey, what the...?"
32128,Homer,"i'm gettin' that job. bart, i'll need some clean urine. stat."
30169,Homer,what's this? goodbye springfield...
32307,Homer,"once upon a time, there was a hilarious ogre named shrek three. he lived in medieval times, but sometimes he'd say things from today times..."
16863,Homer,all done.
26786,Homer,u.s.a.! u.s.a.!
26063,Homer,you're right.
38668,Homer,start with flanders... start with flanders...
25793,Homer,"man, buffalo are easy to kill."
18006,Homer,i found them on the night stand this morning. i guess they weren't his cup of tea. don't worry about it.
17764,Homer,get out of there. my family needs to use your bomb shelter.
15714,Homer,"your honor, i'd like that last remark stricken from the record."
15185,Homer,"oooh, give it here."
26747,Homer,"i need some supplies: a keg of beer, and a six-pack to hold me till i tap the keg."
14547,Homer,i put my homemade football on hold and set to work making the world's greatest bat.
20496,Homer,"oh, that yodel was so good. i wish i was eatin' it right now."
27059,Homer,"yeah, i'm pretty great..."
33069,Homer,"so at work today, we got a memo saying everyone's getting new chairs."
38350,Homer,"lookin' good, santa's little hybrid."
17937,Homer,woo hoo!
35554,Homer,"oh look, here's a coupon for scissors that you have to cut out. think, geniuses."
15277,Homer,moe! don't throw out that brine!
34933,Homer,i got the week off by telling mr. burns i had a neck injury!
18347,Homer,"hmm, probably better that didn't hit me."
16152,Homer,unghhhh!
15153,Homer,"me, me. i was here first!"
40773,Homer,so... you wanna go out with me?
32470,Homer,did someone order a super stud?
27019,Homer,fine.
14174,Homer,"nobody loves you. nobody loves you. you're old and you're ugly. nobody loves you. yea, yea, yea yea!"
20389,Homer,"oh, marge, there's so many things i want to yell to you!"
38968,Homer,"i'll eat in bed. not just snacks, messy stuff like lasagna... oh, and tv would be on. loud."
23425,Homer,huh?
23446,Homer,rural route 9? that's it! we can hide out at the farm where i grew up!
37800,Homer,stupid monkeys.
15855,Homer,"i don't know. i flunked latin, too."
26089,Homer,"marge, a bee almost stung me today. i felt the wind go right by my ear."
38701,Homer,skunk canyon?
23124,Homer,bo-ring.
30578,Homer,hmmm. i bet she'd be a good friend for marge. she looks defeated too!
35392,Homer,"i'm sorry, honey. all day long i have to listen to women talk."
17677,Homer,"oh, i hope i haven't upset you... bongo head!"
36974,Homer,"honey, everything's fine. there's nothing to worry about."
34088,Homer,again!
15991,Homer,but we were about to learn an iron law of show business: what goes up must come down.
29748,Homer,"no, i spent our savings on the down payment for a motor home. i need a castle where i can be king!"
32038,Homer,"absolutely, all the time. i go to the floss store and they're like, ""whoa, there he is again."" 'cause i buy so much floss."
30826,Homer,hey... that's the same thing you said to bart after he choked in that soccer game. and we both know he sucked.
22427,Homer,nobody snuggles with max power. you strap yourself in and feel the g's.
18862,Homer,"boy, lisa, with you here this hardly seems like work at all. i don't know how i'm gonna make it through my nightshift without you."
19691,Homer,i'm sure we will.
14861,Homer,"herb, this is the stupidest thing i've ever seen. i can't believe we blew two thousand bucks on it, when right now rollers could be kneading my buttocks."
25051,Homer,"oh, yeah, that's way better than fun and excitement."
22415,Homer,it better have.
19683,Homer,shary bobbins! i want another beer!
27572,Homer,"look out, son. this one's got a little mustard on it!"
19069,Homer,"ahh, the ole fishin' hole. so peaceful and relaxing, it doesn't even matter if i catch a single fish."
17084,Homer,"keep up the rough-housing, son. without a strong male presence in the house, you could turn sissy overnight. oh, these stubborn grass stains."
41353,Homer,"play it cool, homer. don't let her know it's perfect."
21594,Homer,"at my age edison had already invented 203 things. ohh, i've got a lot of work to do to catch up to him."
29387,Homer,i never complain about your frilly pillows.
34640,Homer,"go ugly up someone else's house, you penis-curling she-devils!"
36565,Homer,"i swear, i am not filming."
41333,Homer,"yeah, the legend of the dog-faced woman!"
33162,Homer,"marge, i don't want to die with us mad at each other."
36063,Homer,"pipe down, boy. i'm sneaking you back into springfield."
31194,Homer,you monster! just cut his achilles tendon with this knife.
20453,Homer,"don't listen to them, son. i have total faith in you."
26584,Homer,"we'll do our best, honey. now let's get goin'."
21734,Homer,i just lost my appetite.
22346,Homer,"scalping tickets to the super bowl. have you no shame, sir? i should give you a royal caning."
16806,Homer,professional athletes. always wantin' more.
16937,Homer,"that's it, boy. you're our last hope."
31209,Homer,"sleep tight, my angel!"
21727,Homer,mama took those batteries / she took 'em away / mama took those batteries / size double a...
41418,Homer,"well, i traded it to a kid for a bite of his sandwich."
22670,Homer,hi sweetie.
30825,Homer,a living duck! i wished too hard and he became real!
30571,Homer,we throw those out anyway.
27113,Homer,"wow, all-access. all-access..."
18867,Homer,"what?! how dare you! if i find out who this is, i'll staple a flag to your butt and mail you to iran!"
28404,Homer,"i know. if i get really scared, i don't want to ruin the suit."
30414,Homer,"bart! we're all disappointed there's no potato salad! but for god's sake, don't jump!"
40718,Homer,that makes two of us.
16661,Homer,"no way, man no way, man. get yourself another patsy, man. no way am i wearing a freakin' wire."
15995,Homer,"meanwhile, the group was having problems of its own..."
33204,Homer,"she won! and like any prudent gambler, i know when to walk away: never!"
21757,Homer,"eat my dust, suckers!"
31624,Homer,i have returned!
17039,Homer,"look, everyone! now that i'm a teacher, i've sewed patches on my elbows."
28492,Homer,"first we'll buy gifts for each other. then we'll spend the rest of the cash on a christmas tree so large, its absence from the forest will cause mudslides and flooding."
18058,Homer,"remember, honey?"
19431,Homer,"well, chief, don't quit your day job... heh, heh, heh... whatever that is."
35351,Homer,"come on, bart. we've been out here for hours."
13487,Homer,"well, it's somewhere! it didn't just get up and walk away!"
17870,Homer,"hello vegas? give me 100 bucks on red. all right, i'll send you a check."
40739,Homer,what?
41355,Homer,"wait... if i tell marge i won, she'll know i was buying the ticket when i was supposed to be onstage with her. i'm rich and i can't even tell my own wife!"
29681,Homer,hey dragon! you fly like a girl!
15698,Homer,"roll in at nine, punch out at five. that's the plan."
32575,Homer,what if you just moved the bottle?
13751,Homer,what a movie. and that blonde cutie. does she have assets.
38810,Homer,wow.
22684,Homer,they like me because i'm brave.
18067,Homer,they're butchering the classics. could that bassoon have come in any more late?
21795,Homer,absolutely. if you promise to keep mine.
32538,Homer,"a ""forget-me-shot?"" never heard of it."
41003,Homer,"well, then give me one with lots of pep."
21348,Homer,"hey, deng xiao-ping died."
38028,Homer,"uh, i'm here to check in for the three o'clock."
32396,Homer,of course i know!
15436,Homer,thank you.
39263,Homer,"i will when mrs. claus's sisters get out of town. thanks for listening, kid."
14825,Homer,"well friend, you're going back where you came from. the curb in front of flanders' house."
41556,Homer,"well if you feel that way, maybe you can find someone who wants to nurture the new you, maybe someone a little older and more sophisticated, who can take you to europe during the summer."
28119,Homer,that's because there were seven apostles.
40815,Homer,what?
30683,Homer,"that is small, right?"
23484,Homer,"from the producers of ""waiting to exhale."""
23310,Homer,"well, i hope you cut me better than you did these string beans. hm, i seem to be missing a piece of my ear. touché!"
32532,Homer,save some suds for--
31453,Homer,well excuse me for having enormous flaws that i don't work on!
31327,Homer,woo hoo! where do i sign?
25457,Homer,i'm soooo hungry.
23433,Homer,"save me, marge. i saved you!"
32041,Homer,i don't even have a special tooth problem! this is just a routine check-up! the bib is choking me!
25370,Homer,"wait a minute, bart's band is brainwashing kids with subliminal messages? that's pretty farfetched, lisa."
25905,Homer,what's the big deal? he sees a thousand times worse on that animal channel.
41503,Homer,"wow! look at me, er uh, mom! i am, 'er uh, president kennedy!"
31266,Homer,maybe i can sneak home without them seeing me.
17011,Homer,now what's that rule?
32506,Homer,yet another new restaurant fails.
36048,Homer,i mean a thousand-year flood!
19014,Homer,that was odd.
25634,Homer,"well, i really shouldn't, what with my massive blood loss and all... although i do like the occasional beer..."
36413,Homer,sometimes marge says i turn it into a trashcan.
41040,Homer,"what is it, boy?"
33223,Homer,yessssssssssssssss!
19477,Homer,"...i always just figured my wife was my soul mate. but if it's not marge, then who is it? where do i begin looking?"
34897,Homer,"oh, that's pretty sure. subscription rate, right?"
16046,Homer,what the hell are you talking about?
27427,Homer,how the mighty have fallen... into my price range. i wanna go there!
39816,Homer,would a motel be okay?
34313,Homer,what the... you're a month behind on homework?!
15376,Homer,wow. how much? how much?
38156,Homer,i don't know what you're talking about. hide the treasure!
32063,Homer,did you know that every day mexican gays sneak into this country and unplug our brain-dead ladies?
39308,Homer,lisa!
32040,Homer,"i know, but a breeze from that window went in my mouth."
40543,Homer,"well, the fiend who did this to my boy is my boss. and besides, the doctor says it's just a bump on the head and a broken toe. nothing serious."
16219,Homer,it was the boy!
18955,Homer,"so how 'bout those rainbow suspenders, huh?"
14151,Homer,"fit, damn you! fit!"
40873,Homer,unhook it?! but i love cable.
40356,Homer,luck.
30795,Homer,no unicorns.
30676,Homer,his hobbies are philandering... writing letters... and making up for lost time!
33153,Homer,and i suppose you and maude will be coming along as well?
16636,Homer,"hello, everybody. i'm archie bell and i'm also the drells. we got a new song called, 'tighten up' and this is the music you tighten up with."
37546,Homer,"it's working. she's gone! all right, everyone, magically appear!"
36462,Homer,i'm talkin' about this guy.
32484,Homer,hmm...
13307,Homer,this isn't going well at all.
41362,Homer,"she is flirting with me. okay, homer, let her down easy. don't go breaking any hearts."
38130,Homer,"circle ""other."""
16637,Homer,"yes, son, you can have an electric guitar, just like your old man."
19522,Homer,oh. it's bart. i can't believe it. i'm being mocked... by my own children... on my birthday!
40975,Homer,from the shelbyville orphanage?
18704,Homer,"mmm, open-faced club sand wedge..."
22669,Homer,i told the witch doctor there's tightness in my chest. bom-bom-bom-bom... i told the witch doctor he had to run a test...
36973,Homer,impending doom...
24966,Homer,is that a steak?
15827,Homer,"mmmm, chocolate."
20422,Homer,wipe that smile off your face.
38951,Homer,oops.
35001,Homer,poor tony. he didn't deserve this. he was just a soldier in a war he started.
23008,Homer,"gee, you said you were gonna to make me look sexier, but it's awfully dark in here."
14084,Homer,"i'd rather have a ""flaming homer""."
25460,Homer,they're moving the team to albuquerque!
22619,Homer,"ya gotta admit, marge, that's a lot more roaming."
16512,Homer,no!
15380,Homer,"dad, i don't need advice, i need $15,000 to buy a home."
23396,Homer,and there's nobody guarding it. let's go!
25703,Homer,you got that right
16004,Homer,"there are perfectly good answers to those questions, but they'll have to wait for another night. now off to bed."
35559,Homer,just let me put my hands under your armpits.
41002,Homer,why not?
25600,Homer,"hey, look! our tour guide got a new job."
21940,Homer,can't you just prune some of the leaves so i can watch tv?
19994,Homer,can i have this one?
16888,Homer,that bird! he's killing the elephant! stop him!
39939,Homer,"he's sort of a hero of yours, isn't he?"
13859,Homer,"wow! and after them, out of all the people in the world, you chose me. uh huh, yeah, number four and a half reed."
32093,Homer,"beer beer, beer beer / beer beer beer beer beer..."
20215,Homer,unless what?
19114,Homer,yeah.
31445,Homer,"sorry, i'm all out of ice cream."
19455,Homer,but what should i do? should i meditate? should i get rid of all my possessions?
28818,Homer,i sure am -- with all the inherent legal liability.
40003,Homer,"oh, these things are heavy."
25021,Homer,what?
19063,Homer,"lisa, please. yes, bart, you have a twin brother. you see, when you were born, there was... an irregularity."
35316,Homer,"pretty sweet, eh boy?"
23649,Homer,"pay up, marge."
23996,Homer,huh?
41085,Homer,"no, we have to commit ourselves. now take this down. ""free to loving home. world's most brilliant dog. says 'i love you' on command."""
33916,Homer,"oh, that song's a little on the nose. can we do it to david bowie's ""heroes?"""
29790,Homer,make it seven!
35148,Homer,it would be an honor!
41214,Homer,oooh.
16359,Homer,"ah, finally a little quiet time, to read some of my old favorites."
21379,Homer,"atta girl. i love you, sweet --"

34113,Homer,that's so fake. that's so fake. i don't know how they-- too real!
17471,Homer,"dad, how come you never gave me any encouragement? maybe i could've been something more than i am, like a travel agent to a great scientist, or the inventor of a hilarious refrigerator alarm."
31413,Homer,nooooo!
34652,Homer,painting supplies?!
27881,Homer,i don't know... date a chick with kids...
30220,Homer,right. and how do i join? do i whale on some unitarians?

36700,Homer,i'm payin' for 'em.
28104,Homer,"uh, i'm giving it back to the earth."
19285,Homer,"i was trying to punish him exactly like you would. so, in a way, you really dropped the ball on this one. this is your mess and i'll be damned if i'm gonna clean it up!"
13893,Homer,mm.
38356,Homer,"why are you doing this to me, booze? i drank every kind of you!"
31101,Homer,woo-hoo! weapons!
32954,Homer,"the one on the left looks into it, but the one on the right is just experimenting. son, we are getting that coin!"

23401,Homer,tom arnold?! what the hell's going on?!
19297,Homer,yoink.
34464,Homer,i don't have a thing with my kid tomorrow!
25676,Homer,"man, this is taking forever. i know how to speed things up."
14132,Homer,you heard?
31201,Homer,"yeah, put a leash on him, lady!"
30885,Homer,"oh really? bart, when did you get your tenure?"
30984,Homer,beer? i thought you guys didn't drink on the gayflower.
19604,Homer,"hmmm. your ideas are intriguing to me, and i wish to subscribe to your newsletter, but i think we have to go on the retreat anyway."
40287,Homer,you mean -- ?
28460,Homer,"so did i, son. and look where i am today."
36057,Homer,helmet? that's springfield talk.
18241,Homer,"out of the way, you."
14241,Homer,there's a problem with the reactor?! we're all gonna die!!!
41287,Homer,you idiot! mr. fatso is you!
14112,Homer,"ooh, that's a lot of money."
38603,Homer,lisa! motorcade!
30933,Homer,i'll miss you kids too.
31106,Homer,"aw dude, i was totally here. you calling me a liar? in front of my kids? 'cause i'd take a bullet for you, man. right in my mouth!"
34759,Homer,"if he makes it, that's my son!"
26964,Homer,the hammock man! i'm glad he's a little early today.
23431,Homer,"he's out there, isn't he?"
29659,Homer,"sorry, boy. this is the only place that's two hundred feet from lisa but still on our property."
22040,Homer,"yeah, but all these skulls and crossbones on here... i don't usually sign stuff like that."
38604,Homer,woo-hoo!
36653,Homer,"it's a classy operation. see, the little dealer's wearing a bowtie. cute."
20230,Homer,"so what do you like, lisa? viomalin... tubamaba... obomoboe?"
15038,Homer,oh my god!
40492,Homer,bart!
33807,Homer,i'm sorry. i got carried away. from now on the only thing i'll ever do for you is co-sign if you want a gun. but at least i made lisa popular.
17363,Homer,"no, wait! i love lisa!"
34215,Homer,"catch, boy!"
24005,Homer,"hey, what's with the attitude? i just want some dealies."
29015,Homer,i'm going to find that golden ticket and win that tour! the only thing that can make bacon more delicious is seeing how it's made!
24104,Homer,"i toileth not on ye sabbath, woman! a pox on thee."
29232,Homer,"boy, when god closes a door, he opens a window."
23783,Homer,don't hurt me! here's my wallet.
20547,Homer,lemme through! i got here late!
41308,Homer,"this simulation has been brought to you by your brain, a subsidiary of your penis."
34905,Homer,"ooo, unknown caller!"
15582,Homer,i don't care. i'm going to duff gardens.
20020,Homer,this dinner has to go absolutely perfect if grimy and me are going to be friends. lisa -- be perfect.
13264,Homer,why you little...
16430,Homer,barney. that is so insightful. how did you come up with that?
13471,Homer,"all right, there's no check, just a card. but don't panic. i'm sure it tells us what we're getting and where we can pick it up. ""dear bart... thank you kindly for the blood. yours truly, montgomery burns."" it's just a card!"
35006,Homer,fat tony?
36175,Homer,"thanks, guys. tomorrow morning my sheets will be as dry as the surface of mars except for the poles."
31951,Homer,"hey, it's the least they can do after we saved them from being melty-faced weirdoes."
41259,Homer,you will find happiness with a new love.
24669,Homer,"that's right. and i implore you to move your concert to our town. don't play olde springfield, or as it is sometimes known, sun city."
24713,Homer,"maybe so, but dawson's gonna be bummed."
27005,Homer,"oh, how to explain this to a child... hm... future daddy needs to double-kill these corpses so they won't come back as zombies, and-- get 'im!"
19244,Homer,stupid economic recovery!
19230,Homer,it's so unfair. you're everything a dad could hope for.
18801,Homer,"would you like me to shred those environmental reports for you, sir?"
41253,Homer,"""you will find happiness with a new love."" oh, even the chinese are against me. what's the point. i can't fight fate."
32362,Homer,i just get to keep whatever's in the guy's wallet.
35225,Homer,better shut up / cheech is really mad / i wish that i had gone with cho-ong...
29121,Homer,cool!
18868,Homer,"okay, your turn."
36768,Homer,"so, which do you prefer, m'lady? tom selleck, rollie fingers or pringles man?"
19997,Homer,i don't know. i'm kind of dizzy. i should probably go home sick.
14226,Homer,i don't know.
38645,Homer,stupid dog!
37325,Homer,"i'm planing down that door that always sticks. i put training wheels on bart's bike, and made an appointment with the dermatologist to see about my slowly-receding hairline."
20576,Homer,"ahh, i love these real saturdays. they're so relaxing. not like that fake saturday that almost got me fired."
25962,Homer,"yes. eventually, i became king of the morlocks."
29056,Homer,"it's not a rubber band, it's a scrunchie!"
32352,Homer,now i'm .
28523,Homer,i just saw the greatest cartoon of all time. it was about a miser who was visited by three ghosts at christmas. and get this: he learns a lesson!
24170,Homer,"oh, really? well, if you'll excuse me, i've got some civilization to spread like butter on the english muffin that is these people, with all their little nooks and crannies..."
20349,Homer,tv said that? but i have to have a gun. it's in the constitution.
39222,Homer,"spill it, marge. where have you been hiding the christmas money?"
26499,Homer,"oh yeah, i checked that out when bart was born. i was gonna read to him every day."
27079,Homer,are you ready...to receive professional training in rock?!
21770,Homer,here we go!
24019,Homer,why are you talking like that?
21148,Homer,woo hoo! we can gamble!
33105,Homer,how many times do i have to say i'm sorry?
16899,Homer,"look at this, marge! fifty-eight dollars! and all of it profit! i'm the smartest businessman in the world!"
39649,Homer,a rattler!
41241,Homer,why is mr. burns being so nice to me?
31779,Homer,"okay boy, this is that snooty supermarket all the celebrities shop at. you're gonna help me ambush them. look at this place. imported beer? seedless grapes? chewing gum?"
22838,Homer,"hey, i've always had an interest in art, dating back to my schoolgirl days when i painted portrait after portrait of ringo starr."
36436,Homer,"maybe it was once, but now there's lots of better stories..."
22249,Homer,the moody blues!
33724,Homer,"i held up two, for ""peely!"""
22224,Homer,the what now?
39188,Homer,do you know where she is?
34670,Homer,"man, that dude does not like bart."
35353,Homer,i'll dispose of those for you.
18978,Homer,"i went to the record store today, and they were playing all this music i'd never heard of. it was like the store had gone crazy."
13292,Homer,i do!
14335,Homer,twenty big ones on denver.
20655,Homer,"is this car $15,000?"
25781,Homer,uh oh.
14703,Homer,"well hi, lurleen. we were just talking about you. uh... i think i can come over. let me ask my wife."
29477,Homer,"well, i might as well use this pucker for something."
14883,Homer,"thanks son. now, you've got little hands. can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate?"
37456,Homer,i hope our friend wasn't in an accident.
33515,Homer,how could this have happened?
32060,Homer,"marge, the couch is lumpy!"
26779,Homer,"okay, this isn't easy, so i'm just gonna come out and say it."
30153,Homer,wait'll i tell everyone about this! i'll feel important without drinking! that'll be weird.
28883,Homer,feed my pets and tape my shows!
38649,Homer,a robot with a catchphrase!
21580,Homer,i think it's pretty obvious that i am.
25533,Homer,stack it in the order i'll eat it driving home.
40148,Homer,"aw, come on, marge. you said you'd sleep on it."
26416,Homer,cockfight.
15474,Homer,bo-ring.
27414,Homer,it's full of cigarette butts. so is this one...
19347,Homer,"yes, we do. i got us a divorce this afternoon."
38762,Homer,i want his fame and fortune so much! why must the lords of rock be so cruel?!
32868,Homer,i know! kinda miss it.
34373,Homer,well maybe you guys should look for easier jobs.
29850,Homer,exactly.
14346,Homer,yeah!
17293,Homer,"but that was just one little insignificant mosquito. that can't change the future, right? right?"
33334,Homer,"oh, i get it. here's ten bucks."
19238,Homer,just a second.
35728,Homer,tween-lit gang-write. but this babar needs a zephyr.
20626,Homer,...punk!
27316,Homer,not anymore!
13655,Homer,that was a joke?
31417,Homer,"why, doesn't he need it? oh, right."
34054,Homer,but i have to get back to marge.
29024,Homer,but i've gotta do something! i'll need a disguise.
19456,Homer,"you know, i have been meaning to take a spiritual journey, and i would -- hey!!"
28209,Homer,"""peace talks break down."" no. ""for sale, ford festiva..."" i'll put that in the ""maybes."" i gotta get that t-shirt."
34304,Homer,i got an idea: you can march to selma -- and tell her she's ugly!
30512,Homer,i don't know. what happened to the last safety salamander?
35753,Homer,british fonzie is right. our story is actually more important... than money.
19681,Homer,you've changed me as well. i'm no longer the money-driven workaholic i once was.
26958,Homer,i must have a guardian angel -- with a rifle.
25893,Homer,since when?
14118,Homer,sure...
35837,Homer,would i!
19081,Homer,stop! those candidates are phonies!
32791,Homer,"i'll see you later, honey."
21550,Homer,"wait a minute, there's no angus maccloud in north kilt-town. why you're not from scotland at all!"
41425,Homer,young me? what brings you to the present?
15812,Homer,"this is a trap. it's going to catch us our dinner. come on, boy."
20712,Homer,"ow, my heart!"
40220,Homer,"please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please."
15483,Homer,uh... he sold poison milk to school children.
37997,Homer,"anyway, i'm giving them up... ...to whoever dares take them."
32376,Homer,who is it?
21152,Homer,nice to meet you.
34570,Homer,"aw, look. he's doing his business."
13482,Homer,cheap son-of-a...
35462,Homer,"oh, absolutely, ned. sorry."
14189,Homer,"yes, sir."
36915,Homer,"a minstrel has composed a roundelay mocking me?! torture, torture, torture!"
36238,Homer,comicon nerds!
36498,Homer,"lisa, can you come down?"
21827,Homer,i might have.
31922,Homer,"nappien, you did it again! and everything is as it should be."
13836,Homer,i'm not nodding. it's the air conditioning.
34175,Homer,you can't win us back with mere donuts.
21380,Homer,"my daughter's at that egyptian dealy right now. she wanted to take a limo, but i made her take the bus."
30277,Homer,"oh, marge. what a pleasant surprise."
25326,Homer,don't listen. it's a trick!
31123,Homer,the isotopes are winning? to the bandwagon!
13706,Homer,"oh, i know i need to pay them. but there's just so many."
25552,Homer,"i want to shoot a lion in the face, fight muhammad ali, and ride in a convertible with two happy zebras."
29573,Homer,"i love you too, jerry."
22065,Homer,"all right, i'm gonna..."
23128,Homer,"oh, that's it! i'm telling mr. stupidest man alive what i really thought of his movie! hey, gibson!"
22365,Homer,"hey, it's the beer copter!"
20783,Homer,"it's free, right?"
40498,Homer,"i love you too, son. you know, boy, i don't think i've ever felt as close to you as i do right --"
36858,Homer,i thought it made blimp tires!
26017,Homer,beautiful.
35771,Homer,woo hoo! no more church!
14868,Homer,"what do i get? what do i get? it's not another punch in the face is it? because if it is, i don't want it."
13639,Homer,"bart, are you ready to go to... i'll room service you..."
39654,Homer,his lucky red hat! oh dear god! no! bart!
35744,Homer,"we know, we wrote it."
31803,Homer,"now maggie, i had to use your car seat to hold the new tv guide...so i'm gonna hang you from the mirror."
30284,Homer,it was hard enough gettin' you in there. i'm not lettin' you out.
15936,Homer,i figure it's some guy's name. some guy named gabbo.
38245,Homer,i carry my own.
37530,Homer,uh... anniversary? that comin' up?
16660,Homer,"shhhh, lisa. the dog is barking."
32593,Homer,"oh, right."
40728,Homer,"ugh, gross. ecch."
28536,Homer,"being unselfish is a natural high, like hiking or paint thinner."
24477,Homer,it's settled. the stranger stays with us!
39321,Homer,"yeah, it's a crummy system, but what are you gonna do?"
36323,Homer,totally scripted.
37802,Homer,"okay, i've got to impart all my fatherly advice in this one walk. the sky is blue, but no one really knows why. don't believe what they tell you. girls are great and terrible at the same time. get used to it. and, most importantly-- oops, we're here. you'll have to figure it out on your own."
27411,Homer,"okay, i'm coming right out the door. dammit! these windows are so hard to squeeze through!"
17897,Homer,but you're already smoking cig...
39914,Homer,adil! oh... there you are.
41240,Homer,don't think about beer.
34325,Homer,"hey, why aren't you doing your homework!"
14905,Homer,"well, this is the first i've heard about it."
39946,Homer,"no, i'm not. i'm hopping on the bandwagon. now come on, son, get with the winning team."
26591,Homer,gimme a drink with all your sweetest brazilian fruits mixed together.
35254,Homer,"looks like it's up to me. let's see, target at two o'clock... adjust for wind ..."
13311,Homer,"it's true. now, you'll have lots of special people in your life, lisa. there's probably some place where they all get together, and the food is real good, and guys like me are serving drinks. oh well, maybe i can't explain all this, but i can fix your doll house for you. at least, i'm good at monkey work. you know... monkey. you know what i mean?"
30285,Homer,rugged? is that the same as handsome?
34623,Homer,moe is running off with one of our wives?!
41148,Homer,don't you ever do that to me again.
14685,Homer,that's a pretty name.
27583,Homer,"so, do you think you might see your way clear to moving back in with your maw and me?"
24655,Homer,guess it's just us and the tumbleweeds.
30881,Homer,are you kidding? take a look at my dvd.
22356,Homer,woo hoo!
29909,Homer,ray wouldn't fit in my head -- he's a human man.
37467,Homer,he's looking at a geyser! and there's a sign in front of it!
34781,Homer,berry-peach?! that's my favorite!
33638,Homer,but i have to marry marge!
18350,Homer,thank you.
33810,Homer,"lisa, a light bulb is either on or it's off."
26019,Homer,'cause moe's a big jerk and a she-male too!
28474,Homer,will you make my sundae for me?
19717,Homer,no i am not.
17162,Homer,"there you are. thought you could get away, huh?"
39361,Homer,what?
26611,Homer,"hey, cut it out! put her down!"
40529,Homer,i was watching that.
33737,Homer,"son, from now on, i'm eating all my meals here at school -- with you!"
14941,Homer,"yeah, like when i pick my teeth with the mail and stuff..."
37884,Homer,emily-beth? we can't afford emily-beth! she brings her own puppets!
14546,Homer,"something told me this was a very special, very magical, piece of wood that i could make a bat out of."
24698,Homer,"oh, come on. tell us how we can make it up to you. hey, pretend it's your birthday."
26694,Homer,and life just gets more exciting.
27386,Homer,"so sad, yet so sexy, yet so delicious."
13735,Homer,"son, i'll never doubt you again."
16995,Homer,souvenir.
29568,Homer,why must i be so voluptuous?
15850,Homer,"marge, it happened again!"
21207,Homer,that's not the way she tells it.
13391,Homer,sorry.
24672,Homer,somethin' wrong with your legs?
34006,Homer,who's an unproductive worker now?
39650,Homer,"run, you fool!"
13352,Homer,where-where are we going?
13403,Homer,"okay, fish, you're probably wondering why i'm still here. catching you will make me the most famous fisherman there is, right up there with... that... the a... bald guy on that cable fishing show."
38215,Homer,coming! i haven't forgotten about the sausage.
26098,Homer,"so, how was your day? did anything unbelievable happen? phone calls, things of that nature?"
26612,Homer,"oh, thank god you're okay."
14088,Homer,"i said, you just lost yourself a customer!"
17413,Homer,not with that attitude.
13755,Homer,"gotta think! gotta think! okay, somewhere there's a thingee that tells you how to work this stuff. the um... the, uh... the manual! the manual! right."
29528,Homer,"you're goin' down, you potato-eatin' pansy!"
23774,Homer,come on!
29136,Homer,"just buy some ice cream and walk around the pier. but don't go in the bathrooms, they're filthy."
15976,Homer,"look what i got for you, dad."
15016,Homer,"marge, turn down the heat. that's better."
27056,Homer,and that's why you're my favorite.
39792,Homer,"no, no, marge. it's gonna be very classy, a tea-and-crumpets kind of thing."
27004,Homer,i come to deliver a terrifying message of hope. grab your guns and follow me!
15042,Homer,"heh heh heh... oh, lisa, this isn't real. it's just how you might look if you were a cartoon character."
29835,Homer,"she'll realize she was a fool, when..."
13817,Homer,okay.
33382,Homer,"yes! i want him to know that if your life doesn't turn out the way you want, there's someone else to blame."
25463,Homer,"oh, i'm wasting away. i'm down to a b-cup."
31826,Homer,"not naked, i haven't."
19308,Homer,"ooh, here we go!"
41459,Homer,no fair!
26708,Homer,ow!
21765,Homer,"c'mon boy, let's get me a six-pack."
17195,Homer,marge?
14012,Homer,"hmm... ""cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity: no matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite."" huh?"
39239,Homer,gimme that!
32756,Homer,"i thought this might happen, so i brought the best weapon to operate while drugged: a crossbow."
19837,Homer,"did you see that, marge?"
39456,Homer,"oh come on. that cornball routine. ""i love you, daddy."" give me a break."
23743,Homer,"no! my wife is not a doobie, to be passed around. i took a sacred vow on my wedding day, to bogart her forever."
35514,Homer,"well, maybe he just doesn't like fist-bumping."
28692,Homer,just tell me how much of this is true!
30570,Homer,"ladies. marge, is there a small rip in my pants?"
20366,Homer,"mmm, you probably left them at work. on another topic, guess who was picked to host the next nra get-together?"
32056,Homer,"well, the important thing is we got through this crisis together. that makes us friends, right?"
24446,Homer,why you little...
23679,Homer,marge... they've turned into jerks.
30459,Homer,"yeah, sure. whatever you want. ninety-five, ninety-six, thirteen, sixty-four, banana..."
23802,Homer,i don't know.
34896,Homer,"nicely done, boy."
38509,Homer,what the?
26833,Homer,are you sure god doesn't want it to be dead?
21731,Homer,hee hee hee hee. look how cute they are.
40299,Homer,"we would talk about it always. for the first time in our lives, marge fell asleep before i did."
30970,Homer,"i'm so bored, i figured out where the wallpaper pattern repeats."
28138,Homer,... daddy feels rejected / he's gonna eat some cake.
18391,Homer,"well, why don't you live in it then?"
32009,Homer,cops! act natural!
24084,Homer,shush.
25653,Homer,"did you ever see that ""blue man group?"""
40745,Homer,"i'd reached step one: she knew i existed. the only problem was, she didn't care."
30313,Homer,catch me if you can!
25637,Homer,"where's marge?! that is so rude. i know, i'll hitchhike."
35909,Homer,america's latest teller of truth with a book deal on the side.
24375,Homer,sometimes. but the guy i really hate is your father.
37316,Homer,"how do i win marge over? i could get her kids to like me! no, that ship has sailed."
16118,Homer,"no problem, guys. the important thing is that we wrapped up all the loose ends."
29200,Homer,do me! do me!
20943,Homer,"hurry up, moe, for the love of god! hurry up!"
31544,Homer,i was talking to the cat!
18944,Homer,what?
17641,Homer,"what do you mean, isolated? ...ated...ated..ated..ated."
22354,Homer,"gentlemen, i have an idea."
19751,Homer,"how'd it go? tell me everything that happened! he didn't give you gay, did he? did he?"
38163,Homer,it's kinder never to tell them.
16617,Homer,i caught the cat burglar. i caught the cat burglar. that means you. you are the cat burglar.
26954,Homer,i need you guys to help me. why'd you lock yourselves in?
15962,Homer,"barney, how'd you like to sing for our group?"
34938,Homer,"no, it's not. i just told a lie so we could go to hawaii."
35152,Homer,"oh okay, uh, lenny, hit me with that chair."
23175,Homer,"movies aren't stupid! they fill us with romance and hatred and revenge fantasies. ""lethal weapon"" showed us that suicide is funny."
34545,Homer,but we haven't read the minutes of last week's meeting!
41422,Homer,not again.
17746,Homer,absolutely.
30760,Homer,woo hoo! vegas here i come!
21238,Homer,"i hate the public so much. if only they'd elect me... i'd make 'em pay. oh moe, how do i make 'em like me?"
14813,Homer,"marge, where's that... metal dealie... you use to... dig... food."
30584,Homer,huh. i was wrong.
15319,Homer,"how do you think he'll do, moe?"
34010,Homer,"ooo, mouth."
24533,Homer,"yes, go on."
15005,Homer,where are we going?
25358,Homer,go. blow.
40794,Homer,allouette jaunte allouette / allouette jaunte...
30931,Homer,"yeah, well while i'm gone, you'll do what he says."
32943,Homer,pee?!
14587,Homer,good for you. maybe this'll straighten the boy out.
32327,Homer,i'm gonna make it! i'll be on time for lisa's thing!
38661,Homer,you don't have to announce it. just do it quietly and blame the dog.
27333,Homer,"oh, god!"
14092,Homer,you just lost yourself a customer.
17444,Homer,oh. all right.
26260,Homer,"yeah, you can't improve on nature."
19232,Homer,pho-ny kid-napping...
18188,Homer,"oh, marge, don't blame yourself. i'm the terrible parent. the boy bugs the hell outta me, i can't help lisa with her homework. the only thing i'm fit to take care of is a houseplant."
38538,Homer,yeah! and aren't!
36926,Homer,"now granted, i was just a kid, but i say..."
28383,Homer,"maybe you're right, marge. or maybe you're right, candy ball. no, marge. then again... no, marge. definitely marge."
40135,Homer,i don't know.
33570,Homer,maybe it's beef stew!
21919,Homer,i'm sensing some negative vibes here. but i promise tomorrow's freak-out will go a lot smoother.
17461,Homer,yeah... where are my pants?
13532,Homer,you don't understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry...
21527,Homer,"my god, you're greasy."
18564,Homer,"no, i want roast beef, you clod!"
17099,Homer,"marge, i figured out what i can give you that no one else can."
24153,Homer,what was that?
19445,Homer,"get moving, you stupid... when i'm kicking you, that means ""hurry up"". come on!"
41412,Homer,"okay, hold still. this is the last picture on the roll."
41460,Homer,"""color my world,"" ""disco sucks"" and butthead the goat."
27552,Homer,jesus?! i thought it was gepetto!
36863,Homer,you? sticking up for your old man? you've never done that before.
15107,Homer,but the car is okay?
28776,Homer,damn it!
34634,Homer,flanders?!
34969,Homer,"hey, you're that guy from the f.b.--"
17539,Homer,"now marge, ""dear abby"" says seeing films about air travel can calm your fears. ooh, here are some upbeat titles. ""hero."" ""fearless."" ""alive."""
26162,Homer,wha?! that's it. no more chat rooms for you.
41263,Homer,"i'm a big four-eyed lame-o and i wear the same stupid sweater every day, and..."
39568,Homer,let's hear it.
17992,Homer,me and bart'll take hugh out on the town this afternoon.
34989,Homer,this is horrible! i keep smelling my own breath!
38142,Homer,"well, to me, it looks like... garbage salad, but that's the great thing about art: everyone can have their own opinion about why it sucks."
16934,Homer,woo hoo! what do i get?
36782,Homer,"now, maggie let's find a good game for us. hm, ""krusty's kosher karnival""...""words with enemies""...""don't burn the toast!"", ""lenny dykstra's prison break,"" ooh, ""pizza clock""!"
22573,Homer,"back! back, i say!"
16984,Homer,"so ""if"" we don't all vote the same way, we'll be ""deadlocked"" and have to be ""sequestered"" in the springfield palace hotel."
16892,Homer,"oh. good luck. look at these bills. ""chain for elephant,"" ""shots for elephant""... ""oversized decorative poncho""."
26487,Homer,"no, he's gotta learn, marge. the way my dad made me learn."
36494,Homer,wow. wow. this is like the night hillary won the new hampshire primary.
15072,Homer,i don't know. was i drunk?
22753,Homer,"oh, man. this is the hottest easter ever."
30728,Homer,it's no use.
22208,Homer,bo-ring.
22431,Homer,you remembered my name!
32049,Homer,uh... cone!
14220,Homer,"marge, we can't do that! all the kids'll call him larry fairy."
22446,Homer,for all of us. look.
14102,Homer,"fools! you poor, pathetic, misguided creatures, choking down your flaming moe's. all the time wondering, ""how does he do it?"" well, i'm going tell you. the secret ingredient is..."
33013,Homer,"hey, it worked, didn't it? okay smart guy, you're going in the bag."
37202,Homer,you won't be laughing when these boxes are full of priceless treasures.
37817,Homer,"y'ello! lisa, you got a call from someone named isabel."
39966,Homer,"it matters not, mon frere. and after desserts, we'll adjourn to our second-floor room at the off ramp inn."
26480,Homer,"you're slow to react, dad."
38034,Homer,"ow! where'd you learn to cut hair, idiot?"
40422,Homer,"come on, dad. let's get outta here."
33391,Homer,why? why?
38725,Homer,it's like some kind of guitar central.
20522,Homer,"you know what you could do, apu..."
21143,Homer,"take that, uncle sam!"
25808,Homer,"and it's important to feel good about yourself... okay, spread your toes. do you know how much glass is in here?"
18736,Homer,"woo hoo! hear ye! hear ye! the homer broadcasting system is on the air! all hollering, all the time! i'm gonna make the..."
24110,Homer,finally.
36144,Homer,"five hundred dollars? woo-hoo! thanks, boy."
15734,Homer,hm. alcohol fueled car.
30283,Homer,gotta find your mom. gotta find your mom.
39154,Homer,and you gave it to him?
30043,Homer,we are!
34549,Homer,"be careful! if you see a downed power line, do whatever it is people are supposed to do in that situation."
34285,Homer,"i'll do it myself. when we do things together, they always turn out badly -- for me!"
41202,Homer,you are smooth. i'll give you that.
39415,Homer,what?
25197,Homer,"hey, it feels a little better."
20592,Homer,then what are you complaining about? you got yours. mm-hm-hm.
29124,Homer,"bart, pass the corn. bart, pass the corn!"
39157,Homer,she's gone!
39908,Homer,"i'm his neighbor, what'd he do?"
26521,Homer,this truly is hell!
15669,Homer,"apu, you gotta help me! i need a valentine's gift for my wife."
36394,Homer,"no, this is really good. i..."
26282,Homer,has everyone keistered their personal supply?
26454,Homer,here you go. just stop this bank robbery and you'll be a hero again. i'll wait in the car.
26068,Homer,no problem.
38625,Homer,"well, i'm no carl when it comes to this stuff. but i ain't no lenny neither. and i would say... no matter how much you try to keep things casual, someone always gets hurt."
23950,Homer,"c'mon, bart. the coast guard is covering the doobs!"
38934,Homer,oh for god's-- now? do you have to?
39909,Homer,oooo.
19011,Homer,"we've got a little rule back home: if it's brown, drink it down; if it's black, send it back."
32285,Homer,"marge, when you're married to a midnight towboy, you might not see him for days on end."
13331,Homer,what are all our friends names again?
35298,Homer,can't hurt the boy. can't hurt the boy.
30008,Homer,"here you go, honey. sing this."
14936,Homer,"marge, you were terrific."
39561,Homer,"you're right. bart, vacuum this floor!"
35568,Homer,"here's one thousand dollars... two thousand dollars... three thousand dollars... ooh, i need more cash. better go to my invisible atm."
33845,Homer,i'll get us some brewskies.
22114,Homer,they're milking rats! milk-ing rats!
15058,Homer,"well, if i could gouge out somebody else's eyes and shove them into my sockets, i would. but to me, she's beautiful."
23795,Homer,uh... better than that.
39851,Homer,about a million girls.
34110,Homer,uh-oh.
24877,Homer,no!
18022,Homer,"you're lucky you got looks, marge."
37646,Homer,the poor lonely fellow is about to die.
18967,Homer,oldies?
37601,Homer,heere's the climax
20198,Homer,get the hell out.
20154,Homer,"or ""crapweeds""."
19796,Homer,"c'mon, bart. be a sport and kill blitzen, okay?"
34205,Homer,i'm alive! and surrounded by the...people i love the most in the...
19254,Homer,someone found my keys!
37018,Homer,"out of our way, corn! the starving people of springfield are desperately in need of our delivery of canned corn, corn flakes, and flash frozen corn nibblets."
31987,Homer,"""to my wife marge -- in case i don't make it, here are my oscar picks for next year: best sound effects editing, the team from--"""
38816,Homer,any uplifting holiday movies?
28382,Homer,flanderses!
14536,Homer,don't tell me how to eat donuts --
39118,Homer,i need it now!
34494,Homer,"drunk and disorderly? that's a little redundant. hey, uh, mind if i do a little ""spring cleaning?"""
23149,Homer,"okay, here you need a musical montage where you try on lots of funny hats. it'll let us see your playful side."
29615,Homer,"ooh, look at me. i'm straight as a one dollar bill. la de da. ooh."
32346,Homer,"marge, i'm gonna be home late tonight. i'm going to... midnight monkey madness at the zoo."
16596,Homer,y'ello.
17237,Homer,"yoo hoo, mr. robot..."
18973,Homer,"but most of all, i remember the music."
21298,Homer,i've never seen bart so ashamed of me.
41363,Homer,grampa?!
27323,Homer,"yeah, it's every parent's dream to outlive their children. goodnight, son."
30200,Homer,"that'll straighten you out, boy. there, you don't just get bad grades -- you go to hell!"
20803,Homer,"oh, my mistake."
36438,Homer,...and lenny's story about cancun.
25486,Homer,that's a pretty big caboose for a baby.
35478,Homer,"ned, i have a confession to make: i may not have come here solely with the noble intention of getting drunk. but now, from the bottom of my heart, i wish you and edna the best."
38865,Homer,look at all these knobs and buttons. they are clearly a superior race. but maybe that means they'll be nice to us.
16557,Homer,yep. it's on here.
37588,Homer,"hanging up the receiver, eh?"
13534,Homer,"honey, do me a favor. fill out this form."
26112,Homer,"oh, that's better..."
33129,Homer,marge?
14625,Homer,what?
39143,Homer,"okay, sweetie, open those baby blacks!"
25715,Homer,"oh, yeah. now i remember it like it was yesterday..."
17827,Homer,i'll never be able to do this trick... never.
35661,Homer,no problem.
14886,Homer,oh yeah?
36090,Homer,"you know sweetie, there was a time when i would've killed for that information, but i'm pleased to announce i've already bought your mother a present."
31012,Homer,which goes great with another male invention -- the car.
27889,Homer,sorry i'm late -- the velvet mafia made me a margarita i couldn't refuse.
13355,Homer,i put it there.
16237,Homer,"all right, but remember it's mine."
18980,Homer,i did? i must be getting forgetful in my old age. open the glove compartment and fetch me my brain medicine.
23933,Homer,"mmmm, danish."
39982,Homer,why?
14333,Homer,"whoo hoo! denver, yeah!"
30429,Homer,replace is such an ugly word. we upgraded.
24154,Homer,great. now my testicle's got ants on it.
33163,Homer,"i know parts of our marriage are based on lies, but so are a lot of good things: religion, american history..."
35981,Homer,do-over!
14022,Homer,"bart, the car had a few bugs in it, i admit that. but we're team simpson."
26588,Homer,"mine keeps disappearing. oh, well."
22087,Homer,homer simpson -- nerd buster. and i'm gettin' you out of here!
26398,Homer,wee! wee! wee! wee!
23564,Homer,why won't they come over? i'm so lonely.
15378,Homer,"dad, i have a problem."
20060,Homer,"it's not a plant, marge, it's a tree, and i've nearly chewed through it. now remember, my new boss is coming home for dinner tonight."
37619,Homer,both sold to me by apu this morning.
40013,Homer,"honey, can we make up again?"
15370,Homer,marge that's...
33877,Homer,a prop knife!
32689,Homer,"what's the matter, son?"
36951,Homer,who the hell are you?
18077,Homer,"easy now, sweetheart. homie's here."
20694,Homer,"see? all this singing scared him away / if we just talked like normal, he'd probably stay."
24556,Homer,did you see that? i did the deed! open up!
34644,Homer,i don't know.
34992,Homer,"tony, you've gotta get outta here -- now!"
25549,Homer,ow! what the hell?
16803,Homer,"hey, somebody sign an autograph. please, somebody!? sign an autograph. hey, would you sign... you fat, stupid jerks!"
37203,Homer,feather boas?
40402,Homer,"come on, bart. remember what vince lombardi said: ""if you lose, you're out of the family."""
34420,Homer,there's sand in my shoe!
21763,Homer,"okay, remember where we parked."
14404,Homer,"look lisa, i bought you a malibu stacey chinchilla coat."
18166,Homer,say it burns. say i never shot you... before.
35389,Homer,"now that my soft, chestnut mane is gone, i dream of cutting hair, styling hair, making hair shorter in exchange for money... maybe i should open a hair salon."
17925,Homer,"nagging the driver, minus ten points for you."
19188,Homer,just a second.
20197,Homer,"when a boy doesn't want to play catch with his old man, something is seriously wrong."
36159,Homer,"suck it, karma! yeah! i'm talkin' to you, karma! karma's a bitch, karma!"
41228,Homer,don't tell him you were at a bar! but what else is open at night?
22503,Homer,gimme that!
16833,Homer,"okay, let's go boating!"
16037,Homer,"why? oh, right. the sideshow bob thing. sorry, boy."
25843,Homer,"yep, a machine."
38925,Homer,dammit! this circus wi-fi is a joke!
13228,Homer,"let me down, chief. i'm begging you. i'm a human being. let me have my dignity back."
14992,Homer,"so i figure i should just try to live right, and worship you in my own way."
31837,Homer,so... tired.
38843,Homer,no!
32047,Homer,"what the hell is a ""fundae""?"
33543,Homer,"oh, we're too heavy."
17503,Homer,"yes. cris-a-tunity. you're right! i've been wasting my life away in that dump for years. that's it. i'm going to find a new bar to drink in. and i'm gonna get drunker than i've been in my entire life! bart, where's my wallet?"
13303,Homer,"did you hear that, marge? she called me a baboon! the stupidest, ugliest, smelliest ape of them all!"
32457,Homer,"kids, your daddy underwent a special procedure so he can be more attractive to your mother."
24592,Homer,milhouse? milhouse?
37550,Homer,hall and oates? what's going on here?!
29031,Homer,"what's wrong, son?"
34816,Homer,woo-hoo!
26535,Homer,it's cold outside. you'll need a sweater. a sweater!
28802,Homer,okay. you have the right to remain sexy. anything you touch can and will be held against you in a court of sex. if you cannot afford a sex-torney--
27720,Homer,don't do so much homework!
37645,Homer,"hey marge, you wanna marry moe?"
24230,Homer,you're gonna get even with that lottery guy that never picks our numbers.
23429,Homer,oh.
20568,Homer,you damn well better!
15360,Homer,homer is what grown ups call me. call me daddy.
21404,Homer,ow! ow! ow! oww!
21135,Homer,"no you don't. heh, heh."
39689,Homer,"son, we're in this mess together. no matter how tempting it might be, i can't let my only boy get ripped limb from limb by a blood-thirsty mob."
29806,Homer,"who? oh, that ""my mother."" tell him thanks."
29441,Homer,really? in america we do it four times a week. you come on down and i'll get us front row seats.
18864,Homer,eh... truth. ask me anything.
28556,Homer,"oh. wise guy, eh?"
23968,Homer,that was my plan all along. now relax and the currents will take us home.
38399,Homer,"because couples friends are a myth, started by restaurants with tables for four."
14355,Homer,oh...
20038,Homer,no he won't. he hates me.
17636,Homer,i'm out.
23532,Homer,"hey, are we duellin' or what?"
13155,Homer,"all right, how should i get there?"
22079,Homer,"well, i'd rather get a message than see another lousy commercial."
32291,Homer,oh my god... multiple tickets... handicapped spot... parked by a hydrant... incomprehensible vanity plate...
24037,Homer,"yeah, she's the best. ooo, can you imagine her face on her body?"
16726,Homer,nobody respects me at work.
14984,Homer,i can wait all --
28389,Homer,choke on your candor!
27682,Homer,you call this a bicameral legislature?
25268,Homer,and how about that stephanie the weather girl?
15081,Homer,"ooh, that's bad."
38744,Homer,"guys, are you feeling this? are you feeling this?"
17844,Homer,sweet land of liberty... of thee i sing.
14770,Homer,i hear ya. come on boy.
14104,Homer,"hi, moe. where's that waitress of yours?"
24397,Homer,"my insomnia, it's gone! check it out, marge. i'm sane again! and i owe it all to... spring break!"
39363,Homer,you can't stay in there forever!
40875,Homer,"marge, i never put my foot down about anything."
14665,Homer,what?
24641,Homer,oh yeah?
37103,Homer,"like all childless couples, they troll the beaches waiting for the egg-layers to wander off from their young."
24485,Homer,"don't worry, she'll show up here sooner or later. to finish off becky. then we'll have mommy back."
31621,Homer,"monsieur meaux, i would be honored if you would be the first to enjoy the evening's entertainment."
31501,Homer,the end.
18979,Homer,"that's fine for you, marge. but i used to rock and roll all night and party ev-a-ry day. then it was every other day. now i'm lucky if i can find half an hour a week in which to get funky. i've got to get out of this rut and back into the groove!"
39152,Homer,can i try it?
35797,Homer,"you can't touch electricity, marge. you can't feel it."
25875,Homer,"come on, these kids are never gonna use that stuff."
26942,Homer,woo hoo! i'm chief of police.
29702,Homer,"ooh, you're curing me with acupuncture."
17998,Homer,"hey, how are you. nice to meet ya."
39536,Homer,"you, up in the tree! the tall gray­ haired kid! get your butt down here right now!"
38061,Homer,"more like ""at your six-pack,"" am i right? it's okay if you need to take a little nap."
18295,Homer,he came to life. good for him.
37453,Homer,"guys, i got big plans for these winnings. i'm going to build... a swimming pool."
34791,Homer,the pie you baked us killed that shark!
27893,Homer,"oh, yeah. the night that destroyed my marriage."
38908,Homer,walkin' down a corridor / usin' both my feet / wish i was in floridor / now i will repeat / oh i'm walkin' down a corridor / usin' both my feet...
28540,Homer,ewww.
27169,Homer,"you know it's gonna be bad, but you just can't prepare yourself."
28468,Homer,"every year the gulf between rich and poor nations gets larger. yet, the imf insists on unrealistic debt-repayment schedules."
28781,Homer,how'd you get in here?
36193,Homer,um nothing... typical dream nonsense.
30732,Homer,"so, i see you're also traveling with your son. what boy prison are you taking him to?"
31620,Homer,"madame, you have the shapely, hairless knuckles of a queen."
23948,Homer,"ow, ow! oh, real mature, lenny."
20360,Homer,or would i?
30704,Homer,i drew this picture of you.
15875,Homer,i never graduated from high school.
33974,Homer,"yeah, marge. he'll knock your block off. your beautiful block."
34696,Homer,"wow, marge. i can't believe you're taking me to a sports bar."
26338,Homer,quit banging my wife!
41404,Homer,now remember -- steer into the sculptures.
20164,Homer,"hey, everybody, look! armin tamzarian's back and he's gonna take over the school again!"
26665,Homer,never!
21019,Homer,see ya in a week.
24362,Homer,according to this you're both idiots.
35626,Homer,don't tell my wife.
27037,Homer,lick 'em. go away.
18168,Homer,which one were you? the ugly one?
40809,Homer,"hey, i paid for this car. i paid for this tuxedo and i paid for the two dinners. we're going to the prom."
13437,Homer,are you?
33792,Homer,"hello, little girl, who do you belong to?"
39765,Homer,"ooh. clean up. now don't worry, everybody, this'll be a breeze if we all pitch in."
34029,Homer,"hey carl, look how i messed with the names on the softball sign-up sheet. it's delicious! you know how smitty's name is smitty? well, not anymore -- i changed the ""m"" to a--"
17263,Homer,i'll kill you! i'll kill all of you!
14432,Homer,hello? hello? is this thing on? hello?
26690,Homer,"things started out great. i ate what my mother ate. and my mother loved chili. then, suddenly:"
21174,Homer,come on. come to poppa.
35432,Homer,no.
36075,Homer,we hate opera!
35640,Homer,is this her?
15235,Homer,mmm... no.
39805,Homer,"what are you on, pal?"
31854,Homer,"lisa, sweetie, i was just following the rules."
14283,Homer,"hey, as long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes, he's fine by me."
35140,Homer,"i legally forced him to say ""semi""."
23106,Homer,"yeah, it's got a lot of other problems too."
39153,Homer,"well, i'm mad i'm not doing it."
21080,Homer,woo hoo!
20846,Homer,ever heard of a little thing called the internet?
14618,Homer,but it'll be okay... we'll get him a new dog... one with an untwistable stomach...
15343,Homer,"well, i guess he just doesn't respect his customers."
25586,Homer,"i told you, yes. now bart, go to the top of that hill and see if you can spot our hotel."
37981,Homer,the rearview mirror was invented in nineteen eleven for just this reason...
27416,Homer,dexter colt. the man who framed my daughter.
21333,Homer,"okay, mountain-climbing supplies: rope, ice axe, heart medicine..."
39973,Homer,"you know, one day you'll learn to move like your old man."
17141,Homer,sugar man!!
40862,Homer,"we could do that, hmm, yeah, or... we could go over to my house and watch the whole thing live on cable tv."
19744,Homer,right...
29828,Homer,what'd i miss? what'd i miss?
35764,Homer,"c'mon, just pick a popular song."
29263,Homer,i was thinking of chicken wings.
26232,Homer,oh my god! wow. now that's a goiter.
33838,Homer,that was great. you mind if i use that at work?
18667,Homer,bingo.
29605,Homer,"let's see, ""name"" ""homer simpson""."
30848,Homer,i fell asleep before the monkey.
34071,Homer,it's daddy's turn!
33160,Homer,help! fat man hanging from a tree!
37909,Homer,one of you turned me in? who was it?
21320,Homer,"no, here. try my foot. no, not that foot. just feel my biceps."
16391,Homer,"wrong again, flanders."
17797,Homer,that's the spirit. never give up.
28586,Homer,"son, would you like to ride your new bike out of the store?"
40369,Homer,it just is. that's why.
16951,Homer,that was the end piece. that's it! being abusive to your family is one thing but i will not stand idly by and watch you feed a hungry dog. go to your room!
13811,Homer,eeuhgh. what is this thing?
26879,Homer,can't you do anything? surprise witnesses? evidence tampering? play the race card. play it.
22561,Homer,"marge, you've been out there all morning."
39266,Homer,"i want a word with you in santa's workshop, little boy. cover for me, elfie."
38195,Homer,who?
16652,Homer,woo hoo! cheap meat!
32145,Homer,"brands like ""miser's choice"" and ""day-old delights?"""
14438,Homer,"well, all's well that ends well. goodnight, marge."
25277,Homer,"ohhh, well that's bad news for dingbat charlie. he's gonna be crushed."
30259,Homer,where are you going?
15941,Homer,"hey, moe, can i look too?"
13568,Homer,"that's all right, son."
29109,Homer,what about now?
26968,Homer,"hm, no belly-button."
38029,Homer,"that's ""fake name."""
16561,Homer,"lisa, never, ever stop in the middle of a hoe-down."
26337,Homer,"ah, this beer's deliskous. i'm gonna saves me wife! now let's get this show on the road."
24007,Homer,"you can do it, duncan. i don't care if your odds are... five million to one!?"
27705,Homer,aren't you gonna chuckle?
40285,Homer,it won't be so bad. you'll die someplace else.
17611,Homer,jealous?
34551,Homer,all right -- let me get my tool belt.
38749,Homer,"okay, this crowd is about to experience the special magic of the cover band -- the thrill of live music without the fear of hearing anything new."
39892,Homer,"well, i'll have to pull a few strings with the boys in security, but sure, you bet."
27167,Homer,not if i can stop that inauguration!
22575,Homer,you throw your peanuts!
27554,Homer,"well, i'm not opening the door."
19281,Homer,"helen, as a responsible parent, i was already well aware of that."
16247,Homer,must... get to ballet...
25008,Homer,you're right. we'd better just take this check back for shredding.
34558,Homer,"that whale's not gonna die! we're busting him out of prison, no matter what you say, escobar! god, this thing writes itself."
21000,Homer,"gentlemen, there's only one solution. we place this last donut in the reactor core, exposing it to radiation, thereby making it big."
28116,Homer,you talk pretty tough for a man without health insurance!
38638,Homer,"hey, a couch is a couch."
39039,Homer,more of what?
25908,Homer,"hey, shut up."
24924,Homer,"no, sir."
37893,Homer,"what happened to the movies? first they got worse than tv, and now this!"
32981,Homer,angle on: greeting card
13563,Homer,wowww.
29151,Homer,"because if they catch us, we may have to do it again. and this time i want it tight!"
16552,Homer,"oh, you've probably got a whole drawer full of 'em."
34740,Homer,how do you know my name?
24180,Homer,"oh, who am i kidding? the truth is, i'm no missionary. i work in a nuclear power plant."
26717,Homer,what kind of a monster would humiliate me like this?
28105,Homer,"marge, you were an excellent peace-time chief. but these times call for men of cruelty."
32796,Homer,"don't worry, you can stay with us. i'm sure marge will be cool."
14177,Homer,woo-hoo! i got my job back!
27174,Homer,my real ring's inside a turtle.
39741,Homer,too salty...
21589,Homer,"marge, that's it! that's why i haven't done anything with my life! i need to be more like thomas edison!"
31981,Homer,"hey, this maze is made of corn!"
15989,Homer,"they took the foam off the market because they found out it was poisonous. but if you ask me, if you're dumb enough to eat it, you deserve to die. bart!"
14010,Homer,"what was that? ah, who cares. son, please let me help you."
30647,Homer,"i am the gayest super-villain ever! beware my scented candles! oooooo, scented!"
14087,Homer,"business, eh? well let me tell you something. you just lost yourself a customer!"
39103,Homer,"marge, it's not your fault that you can't win against a superior being like albert."
19643,Homer,"marge, kids."
27282,Homer,"pbs, stephen hawking, the fat little dixie chick..."
33844,Homer,"eat butt, skyboy-ninety-four! i'm sorry, marge. where are my manners? did you want to taunt my kill also? press the x button."
35584,Homer,"squeeze, squeeze... squeeze, squeeze. a real spider would get so mad if i did this! i wonder if this thing has batteries."
17889,Homer,"mmmm, slanty."
37910,Homer,you!
32685,Homer,none.
33857,Homer,why can't i have it now? you got your present here. basic fairness dictates... ...oh!
25441,Homer,that's it! i'll go on a hunger strike.
16878,Homer,wee!
36166,Homer,"now, i'm sure yesterday's incident of urination domination was a one-time deal. but just to make sure..."
20527,Homer,c'mon. you shouldn't be spending your last hours of bachelorhood in a dump like this.
18617,Homer,it's easier. duh.
22883,Homer,killer umbrellas? of course. exquisite.
17215,Homer,"the whole trunk's full of 'em, marge."
40361,Homer,"son, this is the only time i'm ever gonna say this. it is not okay to lose."
24601,Homer,"i'm not gonna stand for this. i'm gonna call the newspapers, the tv stations, the gas stations, everybody."
38611,Homer,useless left-handed crap.
18208,Homer,"okay, okay, don't panic. to find flanders, i just have to think like flanders!"
33342,Homer,is it a place i'd look overdressed if i did wear a tie?
35755,Homer,kansas city.
16742,Homer,less shame?
25204,Homer,"and as you can see, the unique dents in my invention perfectly match the contours of the human vertebrains."
36400,Homer,"honey, i'm off to work!"
20563,Homer,"oh, no. oh, no. we could lose out on bags and bags of money. it's sacrilegious, i tell ya."
35675,Homer,"all the food in those pictures is poop by now. minds blown, you're welcome."
39942,Homer,"sorry, son. you'll understand one day."
33907,Homer,"time's up! okay, maggie: ""suck, suck,"" that takes us to... me."
25519,Homer,"dear god, what have i done?"
14772,Homer,"boy, some of the best times i've ever had were in the back seat of a car."
14791,Homer,that's it. he's outta here.
30473,Homer,"gee, she didn't seem angry, or anything. maybe she doesn't care anymore!"
38201,Homer,"oh, great. the painting is worthless...this was all for nothing. and when marge finds out she's gonna kill me."
41337,Homer,she's so cute...
39500,Homer,"oh, yes, doctor."
34608,Homer,later. later.
38392,Homer,here's a blanket they can borrow
16132,Homer,lobo! lobo! bring back sheriff lobo! lobo! lobo!
38676,Homer,"hey, i haven't had a drink in a thousand years."
38845,Homer,damn technology!
35461,Homer,"little help... little help... flanders, little help?"
30528,Homer,safety... safety... die for safety.
18120,Homer,"no, what i was wondering is..."
29540,Homer,it soaked through to the other side!
35515,Homer,"as god as my witness, this fist will be bumped."
41439,Homer,bart! can the chatter and fetch me a baloney sandwich!
39209,Homer,marge!
35083,Homer,"""tv guide offer, one world trade center..."""
39463,Homer,"i'm sorry, marge, but sometimes i think we're the worst family in town."
16470,Homer,"oh, this is the worst crisis my marriage has ever faced. colonel klink, why have you forsaken me?"
28208,Homer,this is what happens when i go for six hours without sleep.
27734,Homer,"thanks for trying, but i'll be at moe's."
24151,Homer,"no, i'm good."
18087,Homer,but you thought they were.
32866,Homer,no.
26776,Homer,apu is cheating!
24093,Homer,"...step up to the best. ned flanders, the man with the chest."
39333,Homer,"sorry, boy."
39250,Homer,"and what would you like, little boy?"
29752,Homer,i've got gameboys and caramel apples!
22130,Homer,"it's my duty, marge. besides, those mobsters don't scare me. bart, would you go start daddy's car?"
32006,Homer,"ooh, it's that bar i like! wait here in the car."
21327,Homer,hm.
39458,Homer,"look everybody, yesterday was a real eye-opener. we've got to do better as a family. so tonight we're not going to shovel food in our mouths while we stare at the tv. we're going to eat at the dining room table like a normal family."
36151,Homer,"mr. burns! save me, panic!"
34534,Homer,i'm starting to regret it already.
23232,Homer,"marge, this is the greatest gift any wife has ever given her husband."
27192,Homer,forget it kiki. you're not putting your brain into her body.
17113,Homer,"marge, can you set the oven to cold?"
13805,Homer,"hey, aren't you a little old for this? you're not even wearing costumes."
34976,Homer,can i have any of the steaks?
35683,Homer,"when i'm sad, i make baseball bats."
21036,Homer,then i'll whomp him with my hat.
23719,Homer,if you'd've been awake you would have said no. you can see the bind i was in.
26091,Homer,"hey, you're looking at that spokes-jack! well i can fantasize too."
14340,Homer,over.
22423,Homer,"dynamic, isn't it?"
37289,Homer,it's amazing how much exercise i've gotten from those words.
21702,Homer,"later, chickie-pie."
17853,Homer,"you sold us out, conover!"
30168,Homer,oh yeah.
19712,Homer,"well, at least i liked it. didn't i?"
24542,Homer,"ow! oooh! paper cut, paper cut!"
24975,Homer,i could ask you the very same question.
18112,Homer,okay.
36649,Homer,that settles it. no banks for me.
20153,Homer,"look, lady, you obviously have at least one son."
29464,Homer,i had to! or moe's would stay closed forever!
36024,Homer,"so, dad, what kind of stupid idea did you put in lisa's head?"
40978,Homer,"oh, sorry."
36544,Homer,two stray dogs?

32076,Homer,"i know, 'cause this one's really, really bad. for years now, fox has been--"
14656,Homer,"ooh, they all look great."
33940,Homer,"apu, i have to lose weight now. do you have anything that'll make me vomit?"

19594,Homer,"you heard her. she said ""no."""
35315,Homer,"son, you and i are gonna be closer than ever as we spend the rest of our lives suing that therapist."

18262,Homer,"okay, everybody. it's the moment you've all been waiting for! the pig de résistance!"
32482,Homer,all i want is a battery.
20652,Homer,"lisa, do you have to practice that stupid song now?!"
35430,Homer,"stop who, marge? be specific."
40424,Homer,"oh, well, i'm sure it's a blast once you get used to it. let's go."
25507,Homer,"yeah, but this is me talking. look, i already encased the telephone in concrete."
33485,Homer,"he what?! flanders, landlords like you are the scum of the earth! you lounge around in your egg macmansions and we never see you unless the rent check's late!"
15070,Homer,i know.
27609,Homer,one ribwich please.
14805,Homer,"lamentably, no. my gastronomic rapacity knows no satiety."
38259,Homer,no penalty.
18049,Homer,"kids are so naïve. lisa, when you get to be our age, you'll learn a few things, like when a sign says ""do not feed the bears,"" man, you'd better not feed the bears."
20002,Homer,"hiya, stretch! what's the good word?"
14732,Homer,uh-huh...
22864,Homer,you can call him ray / or you can call him j. / or you can call him ray j. / but you doesn't have to call him...
28850,Homer,"hey, you do a great me, marge. you gotta show the guys at moe's."
17888,Homer,"well, lisa, i managed to solve a little problem today. and to celebrate, i'm going to tilt my chair."
31599,Homer,i don't want the kids to see me this way!
23755,Homer,where are the refreshments?
25136,Homer,you see? it's cool to be smart.
33811,Homer,that's what the dimmer switch companies want you to think.
21922,Homer,uh-oh.
30392,Homer,"right... right... right... right... okay... right. i love you, bye!"
27515,Homer,it wouldn't be the first time.

29244,Homer,and i kept that vow.
35696,Homer,"east oak street, is that it?"
30253,Homer,"guys, get out of here!"
40330,Homer,"well, beggars can't be choosy."
36349,Homer,"thanks, marge. you ruined my show. now i'm going to give you a spoiler about our marriage: it's not great right now."
24790,Homer,do i get paid now?
26477,Homer,"oh, no. i'm not giving you my car. you'll probably drive it."
21609,Homer,you stay here and guard the sandwich.
36664,Homer,you take that back!
20075,Homer,that's not so disciplined.
26593,Homer,ahhh...
26572,Homer,wow. it's like he's on the dashboard of the entire country.
19602,Homer,so burns is going to make us all go on a stupid corporate retreat up in the mountains to learn about teamwork. which means we'll have to cancel our plans to hang around here.
37166,Homer,but i just did that!
20641,Homer,"okay, but they'll have to be pretty damn miserable to make me happy."
32836,Homer,"the real reason we americans put up with sports, is for this..."
22997,Homer,who told you?
27053,Homer,couldn't you come up with a less embarrassing lie?
18807,Homer,"okay, i gotcha covered."
25512,Homer,"savin' those babies. and the soft spots on their heads do, do, do, do do..."
27544,Homer,i needed it. i had to buy back some incriminating photos.
33332,Homer,"when they make a movie from his books, does he get one, or two free tickets?"
16549,Homer,oh yeah. i forgot already.
22425,Homer,"yes, briefly."
35382,Homer,and stay out!
13725,Homer,"it's all here, and it's all backwards. that's right."
37463,Homer,"i know, me too. it's the ultimate screw-over."
20990,Homer,"then me and my friend were about to press it, but the man said not to press it. but we pressed it anyway and we ran and we hid in the giant tire. oh yeah, and my other friend was already there."
28798,Homer,that's my girl.
28929,Homer,"yeah marge, it looks like you got the last perfect man. oh uh, by the way... can i borrow your car tomorrow? mine's acting up."
40756,Homer,far out!
14105,Homer,"moe, sorry i lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars."
22367,Homer,the game! we're so close!
20052,Homer,"ah, grrrreetings!"
24364,Homer,"fine. i'll take the next quiz. ""how long will you live?"""
33419,Homer,really? sure.
39757,Homer,"well, if that's how you feel, i'll take it back."
14880,Homer,you know a d turns into a b so easily. you just got greedy.
27025,Homer,maggie!
37317,Homer,hm. would it make a woman happy to do the things she asked you to do?
24139,Homer,south pacific?! i didn't agree to...
17035,Homer,"well... i can tell the difference between butter and ""i can't believe it's not butter."""
23419,Homer,"no tommy tune, eh? oh, that's it. you insulted my honor."
26391,Homer,no. the olympics have preempted my favorite shows for the last time!
27422,Homer,how ironic. now he's blind after a life of enjoying being able to see.
38339,Homer,"son, can you put me in 3-d for a second?"
16055,Homer,"is ""tv guide"" a book?"
13915,Homer,i know you love me. so you don't get squat. hee hee hee hee.
33050,Homer,the computer says bart's standing on the computer. all i see is a stupid bird with a tracking chip on its leg! it doesn't add up!
37058,Homer,can always use... a good babysitter.
16495,Homer,"oh, margie, you came and you found me a turkey, on my vacation away from workey..."
20375,Homer,"but marge, i swear to you, i never thought you'd find out!"
25795,Homer,"oh, this'll be good."
41292,Homer,i really wish i had fixed that faucet.
17816,Homer,oh yeah. speed holes.
35689,Homer,food dad! food dad! food dad!
35253,Homer,hey! mr. burns needs our help!
18246,Homer,i can't believe you didn't invite me after i painted those cool stripes all over your car. i know! i'll throw my own barbecue - the greatest barbecue this town has ever seen! and i'll only invite who i want. that'll show ya.
24478,Homer,ch-ch-ch-changes / time to change the oil / yeah / changes / don't wanna be an oily man /
19481,Homer,where? where?!
28516,Homer,oh mcgrew. once again you've mistaken something for something!
30980,Homer,"stupid flandish. uh, listen, since all the other fun stuff is out of bounds, how 'bout a little bible-thumping in the crow's nest? what do you say, miss..."
22171,Homer,but it seems to me that a senior citizen has to be over 55. isn't that so?
14977,Homer,"no! no, no, no, no, no, no. well, yes."
20722,Homer,"yeah, he's telling the truth."
21409,Homer,"feel your heart pumping a mile a minute? that's what my heart's doing all the time. bet your left arm's tingling too, huh?"
35122,Homer,i do keep it together.
28110,Homer,wait a minute. how could those stupid jar-heads win?
19140,Homer,no?
16407,Homer,"here fishy, fishy, fishy. we're waiting."
29231,Homer,"i'm saying goodbye to everything i ever loved. ooh, a marshmallow!"
33861,Homer,i went to a movie.
21581,Homer,go school!
35899,Homer,"well, if i could explain myself..."
35910,Homer,audio book read by lenny. i'm not just another loudmouth. i'm a loudmouth who says things you're afraid to say but not racist things!
25423,Homer,"well, is that it?"
15170,Homer,"... love you, such a sweet thing/ good enough to eat thing..."
38662,Homer,what the?
21171,Homer,"honey, he's clearly marked his territory."
32602,Homer,oh yeah.
29039,Homer,"no trap can hold homer simpson! but i'm not homer simpson. i'm the pie man. homer simpson away! i mean, the pie man!"
41183,Homer,a book made him cry! boo hoo hoo!
40752,Homer,"hi, i'm homer simpson. i need some guidance, counselor."
37811,Homer,i do.
32058,Homer,the happiness swept me away!
23511,Homer,one hundred and... may i speak to my family for a moment?
29665,Homer,"now, we'll get all your chips out, go to the police, and shut this place down!"
35657,Homer,"wow, video games sure have changed since i was a kid. how many points does it take to get an extra life these days, son? thirty thousand? certainly not fifty."
15759,Homer,"and gummy joe, where would you be without the dental plan?"
29627,Homer,give it back!
41443,Homer,why you little... i'll teach you to make fun of my socks...
16068,Homer,"woo hoo, i'm a college man! i won't need my high school diploma anymore."
22407,Homer,"uh-oh, spaghetti-o's."
33427,Homer,who taught you that language?!
29271,Homer,but she'll still win the contest?
33365,Homer,ballots... stolen... real winner unknown... what is the truth?...
26587,Homer,how did you know?!
37199,Homer,"there's other p.o.s? uh-oh, better put on my game shades."
30996,Homer,nooooo!
31646,Homer,two.
37976,Homer,look at these jerks.
32179,Homer,"mmmm, au jus! not quite gravy, not quite blood..."
38829,Homer,the nutcracker! every child's favorite christmas character! is this a dream?
21280,Homer,"now, uh, you were saying how great i was...?"
18113,Homer,"herman, how could you? we've all thought about counterfeiting jeans at one time or another, but what about the victims? hard working designers, like calvin klein, gloria vanderbilt, or antoine bugle boy. these are the people who saw an over-crowded marketplace and said, ""me too."""
16735,Homer,shut up. and another thing - how come i can't get no tang 'round here? and also... hold on a second.
40669,Homer,dad --
41316,Homer,"oh man, i want to kiss her. wait -- i just thought of the greatest move ever!"
36132,Homer,"hey bart, check this out."
18927,Homer,yeah. those are exactly my sentimonies.
25735,Homer,"daddy's not here, is he?"
16223,Homer,"oh, lisa, you and your stories. bart is a vampire, beer kills brain cells. now let's go back to that... building... thingee... where our beds and tv... is."
33779,Homer,enough to build a washington monument.
40054,Homer,"nothing... well, that newsletter."
25482,Homer,i got it!
36102,Homer,"wait one sec, marge. before you open it, you're gonna get a phone call that will make this your most awesome birthday ever."
23295,Homer,"look, marge, i'm making a difference in people's lives!"
26520,Homer,"that's it, i'm going home. which way to ithaca?"
33962,Homer,"not everyone has a deathbed, son -- you could die suddenly."
13158,Homer,i got it!
30096,Homer,please don't go! please? please? i command you!
36300,Homer,no... no...
15189,Homer,can't talk -- busy.
23673,Homer,"ooh, look at that. ooh, gingerbread house. hansel and gretel are set for life."
18367,Homer,"hey, flanders, bad day at the rat races?"
18227,Homer,"bart, you didn't finish your spaghetti and moe-balls!"
17257,Homer,"hey, mr. smithers!"
24249,Homer,"let's see... judging from the bug build-up, we're gettin' close."
18426,Homer,marge?... lisa?... flanders?...
28862,Homer,nurse it! nurse it!
15359,Homer,when the working day is done / girls just wanna have fu-un / that's all we really wannnnt...
36646,Homer,"well, thought bubble marge said we should put it in a college fund for lisa."
39495,Homer,good idea.
23353,Homer,and that's the end of that chapter.
30448,Homer,what was that for?
40564,Homer,"mr. burns, are you trying to get me drunk?"
29502,Homer,and you're my margie-wargie-bargie-fargie-gargie-margie-targie-glargie.
19575,Homer,"hey, what's all that commotion outside? why, it's one of those pretzel wagons the movie stars are always talking about."
40108,Homer,karl! so that wasn't just a sweet voice i heard inside my head. what are you doing here?
22168,Homer,"that's right, it's my sad duty to rat out this man for defrauding a car wash. how, you ask? with a phony senior discount card!"
13439,Homer,"hee hee, i win! in your face! yeah! how do you like them apples? woo hoo hoo!"
39978,Homer,"bart, get the door!"
32634,Homer,dear god. what have i done?
18718,Homer,"they have beer and gum, right?"
24011,Homer,"not anymore. ladies, say hello to..."
28511,Homer,can't you yell at me now and get it over with?
22538,Homer,roses. so many roses.
23141,Homer,guilty as charged.
26986,Homer,"twenty-three. now, today i'm gonna mow the lawn, do my taxes, shoot hoops with bart and girl it up with lisa."
28193,Homer,lisa!
32029,Homer,you watch your mouth you little smartass.
30348,Homer,"okay, marge. but don't be surprised if a snuggle monster shows up."
39006,Homer,"okay. bart, think of a name. make it great. insanely, unbelievably great!"
28859,Homer,"don't worry, honey. i don't even know if they serve alcohol at this thing."
23181,Homer,"great idea, mel. now it's my turn."
35066,Homer,"wish i could, son. i really wish i could."
23888,Homer,i forgot my float!
26627,Homer,"they burned down the gambling house - it died with an awful sound / i am hungry for a can-dy bar / i think i'll eat a ""mounds""..."
13702,Homer,"i changed my mind. it was a passing fancy. although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest."
27309,Homer,they're not for dudes!
37015,Homer,"okay, everybody, keep your eyes peeled for an unlit mile post marked twenty-three of thirty-six or something. if we miss it, we're dead."
37799,Homer,look! shiny keys! jingle jangle!
18655,Homer,you owe me an apology!
24901,Homer,what's going on?
20300,Homer,"that sounds like witch talk to me, lisa."
37425,Homer,what are you talking about?
25622,Homer,come back with my thumb!
34232,Homer,"look at me! i'm flying, like superman's dog!"
34677,Homer,that is disgusting.
40096,Homer,what?
36150,Homer,"attention, lovers of free office supplies! come and steal things you can easily afford!"
33043,Homer,we're doing laundry.
15674,Homer,all right. but i'll never shop here again.
19157,Homer,nothing big. it's just a lot of little things.
18132,Homer,i'm okay.
15876,Homer,"oh, you have a job?"
34094,Homer,"girls are easy: girls love daddy, girls make birthday cards with glitter on them, girls can marry a hockey player and get me seats to hockey games, girls don't steal my knives...and i don't have to tell girls how their bodies work, 'cause i don't know."
29733,Homer,my hemophilia!
16875,Homer,"heh, heh. stick it to the man. no, wait!"
33775,Homer,"see, it works. and un-sults are just the beginning. there's also envy-tations, hate-hugs, spamming with faint praise and... hey everyone, wanna go get frozen yogurt?"
23840,Homer,i figured it out after i ate one of my chest sores.
25280,Homer,uh-oh.
38443,Homer,"now let's see... which pants have that card? board shorts, interested shorts, here we are."
29657,Homer,but i'm a u.s. citizen.
33392,Homer,"come on, stir! i must see more!"
39402,Homer,"what did you say, son?"
36064,Homer,"oh, ""smithers""!"
26861,Homer,are you all right?
23740,Homer,"okay, we kinda got off on the wrong foot there. long story short, my ""old lady"" was..."
36392,Homer,"eight weeks paid vacation, and all because of a little bump on the noggin."
20594,Homer,you're the boss.
31462,Homer,"i'm laughing in the last one, but it's only 'cause the cat fell down the stairs."
18330,Homer,"oh, there's so much i don't know about astrophysics. i wish i'd read that book by that wheelchair guy."
14722,Homer,i'm sure lurleen will love it.
25704,Homer,"pick me! pick me! i've got hoop dreams, coach. i've got 'em bad."
18329,Homer,"help me! are you helping me, or are you going on and on?"
22493,Homer,"""i cherish you, my precious."" mm, nah. ""to a heckuva blacksmith."" nah, i already got him one."
18920,Homer,let the bears pay the bear tax. i pay the homer tax.
29968,Homer,"overeating. and if there's time, we'll get to my drinking. but there won't be time."
20434,Homer,"congratulations, the rest of you made the team."
16269,Homer,i can't believe your mother went out to have fun without me.
29494,Homer,"you gotta get me closer, chief!"
38167,Homer,we had a deal. and now we've got nothing...
34030,Homer,"...to a ""p"". spitty... 'cause he spits when he talks."
16932,Homer,mmm. caramel.
34475,Homer,no! i wanna go to jail! free food! teardrop tattoos! library books that come to youuu!
17654,Homer,"but marge, knightboat. the crime solving boat."
38386,Homer,"we're not lost, boy. not by a longshot. we just have to set the mood."
26699,Homer,kathleen turner!
21094,Homer,"marge, how many kids do we have? oh, no time to count, i'll just estimate. uh, nine."
39674,Homer,pleehhh! hnnnn! plem! feh!
24074,Homer,you'll see...
38575,Homer,the power of chrysler compels you!
33967,Homer,"now listen, son, i know we saw some awesome beat-downs tonight, but remember: don't try this at home. do it at the schoolyard. someplace where, if you get hurt, we can sue, not just them, but the school, the county, the state, and that jackass joe biden."
39182,Homer,"just tell me one thing, marge. why did you lose faith in the revue? i mean, ""cats and dogs"" writes itself. cats and dogs on capital hill / they don't get along and never will"
31435,Homer,it's good to see you smile again. i was lonely being happy all by myself.
40288,Homer,it's not that simple. i've got to convince my supervisor to give me a leave of absence.
17402,Homer,uh-huh?
21182,Homer,"lisa, don't you ruin another love day."
28132,Homer,"it's patty, chump!"
23096,Homer,"well, at least we'll die doing what we love... inhaling molten rock."
40770,Homer,with pleasure.
31060,Homer,"here's me fighting with former president bush, me fighting with current president bush, and here's me showing a bag of apples who's boss."
26407,Homer,"wow, what kind of mileage does it get?"
32530,Homer,or yourselves?
19517,Homer,"it was an alien, marge! it appeared in front of me and said, ""don't be afraid!"""
39974,Homer,"son, there's not a woman alive who can resist a man who knows how to mambo."
35828,Homer,bart! thank god i had this in my pocket.
30907,Homer,"and marge, you're pretty great too."
18002,Homer,"little lisa. lisa simpson. you know, i always felt you were the best thing my name ever got attached to. since the time you learned to pin your own diapers, you've been smarter than me."
28390,Homer,it's a deal!
16812,Homer,now you got a law suit on your hands. just kidding.
21465,Homer,"nah, it'd just be awkward... what with the sex and all."
33176,Homer,seymour... edna asked me to talk to you.
16569,Homer,"marge, we're responsible adults and..."
17640,Homer,"lisa, you were right. my happiness is fading."
29686,Homer,"okay, i'll do it. because your sweet love is the one thing that saved my life from being an unmitigated disaster. ha-ha, now we're even!"
37510,Homer,...keg-pools!
33595,Homer,why you...
36662,Homer,"okay, remember the plan. apologize to grampa. then when he wants us to take him out to lunch, point to the leftovers, tell him we already did, but he forgot."
19185,Homer,lousy democrats.
36532,Homer,"you've learned a very valuable life lesson, boy, which is that love doesn't exist except briefly between a man and a woman before marriage. after that, it's just hanging out with someone who kind of hates you, but you can't get it together to leave. i'll get us some ice cream."
32851,Homer,where'd everybody go?
32214,Homer,but i need my childhood friends to help me keep it real. would you have me keep it fake?
30972,Homer,my life's work ruined.
23542,Homer,over there.
40032,Homer,"and if you don't, at least you'll be bigger than the other kids."
13338,Homer,you should see the look on your face. it's priceless.
37567,Homer,"more free stuff, more free stuff, more free stuff..."
14454,Homer,"c'mon, maggie. nummy, nummy num."
13824,Homer,"come to think of it, the guy that sold me this thing did say the wishes would bring grave misfortune. i thought he was just being colorful."
18634,Homer,"hey, big spender!..."
25303,Homer,traitors!
15571,Homer,thank you.
30726,Homer,stupid bart... makes me drive to oregon... home of unspoiled forests... birthplace of matt groening ...
25900,Homer,"well, that's a pretty big ""if,"" honey."
30118,Homer,i could.
35553,Homer,"oh, well way to make me feel obsolete."
14879,Homer,"a+? you don't think much of me, do you boy?"
35869,Homer,finally. the only thing i wait in lines this long for are for slightly-better cell phones.
19652,Homer,"now sweetie, don't worry about a thing. i'll teach you to comb it over so no one can tell. just like my hair!"
19806,Homer,i've been tenderized.
16238,Homer,that's what ballet is?
19678,Homer,not till you're fifteen.
34076,Homer,bonk it. twist it. smack it.
31547,Homer,"i didn't say ""stop."""
38916,Homer,they have a lot of funny words for not-so-funny things.
30240,Homer,"a scam? not according to ""eddie f. from tucson,"" or ""football millionaire in beloit, michigan."""
26583,Homer,"but you're on vacation, honey. i'm not wearing my wedding ring!"
32567,Homer,i'll teach you to beat up yester-me!
33657,Homer,i love to see this!
17083,Homer,"don't mind me boys, just scrubbing my undies."
31065,Homer,"oh no, bart and lisa are gonna tell me something horrible!"
23808,Homer,"oh, but lenny just got some bottle rockets."
17337,Homer,"well boy, you won. so i'm gonna live up to my side of the agreement. here's your turtle, alive and well."
25692,Homer,stupid grill!
24264,Homer,i'm still cool.
15540,Homer,i call the big one bitey.
30583,Homer,i bet you can't throw a cat over the house.
14743,Homer,my whole romantic life is flashing before my eyes.
27906,Homer,he's the man that i hate best / i'd like to see his house go up in flame!
20342,Homer,potentially dangerous?
20806,Homer,"batman! / i mean, leader! i love the leader!"
37495,Homer,"""when the barbarian invaders came, the carlsons met them with their weapons ready""..."
33729,Homer,"doctor, why is this happening to me?"
13716,Homer,oh.
39566,Homer,"lisa, what did i tell you about playing that saxamathing in the house?"
29512,Homer,easy... gentle...
36912,Homer,it's amazing how many things they can make taste like cheese.
40790,Homer,fenetre.
34409,Homer,porky pig?
22044,Homer,even those guys look too civilized for me.
31694,Homer,i'll tell you why.
22226,Homer,"hey, smooth move, flanders!"
20473,Homer,i knew i could count on you.
13843,Homer,"well, okay then... ... four o'clock... coupla hours i have to get up and go to work... gotta go to work... go to work."
36078,Homer,"well, i've tightened the bolt! i think we're good!"
20315,Homer,"watch the fish, marge."
26568,Homer,"so it's opposite land. crooks chase cops, cats have puppies..."
34147,Homer,i have a column i'd like to submit. pay me whenever.
31180,Homer,why can't you do anything?
22894,Homer,"people of springfield, behold my latest work!"
40253,Homer,"let's go now... sa-winggg, batter!"
16692,Homer,are we in india yet?
37256,Homer,we really appreciate that.
24915,Homer,wow.

32779,Homer,don't worry. i have a perfect way to conceal his identity.
35349,Homer,"hm. so, should i bring a towel?"
33438,Homer,"i'm not in good hands! i'm in no hands! like a bad neighbor, no one is there!"
28989,Homer,"marge, i won't let that happen. we have to grab this chance for romance now, or we'll never be alone. not 'til lisa's in college and we've lost contact with bart."
35450,Homer,"i'll save you, honey!"
30309,Homer,"okay. to save the manatees, i guess i could donate my time and money and help them build a... eh, screw that."
16479,Homer,mmmm... foot long chili dog.
29852,Homer,"don't worry, marge -- hot wheels to the rescue!"
30681,Homer,"oh, that is so cool! ooh, a dish of shrunken heads!"
41299,Homer,"eh, how bad could it be?"
33753,Homer,"oh my god, my son's a loser and my daughter's a loner. way to go, marge!"
33530,Homer,wolves are taking all our women.
20889,Homer,don't you hate pants?
41423,Homer,ow. ow. ow. ow. ow.
18491,Homer,that sideshow mel thinks he's so big. whatever happened to sideshow bob?
21876,Homer,no! homer simpson does not lie twice on the same form. he never has and he never will.
34136,Homer,that's it! here's your ring back.
21610,Homer,"look, i just want to know how to invent things. tell me."
38240,Homer,why so quiet?
16336,Homer,and that sends me into a shame spiral.
39176,Homer,one am lovin' and two am steak? night marriage rules! i guess nothing gets the heart pumping like a church revue.
32658,Homer,"i was so depressed, i spent all my time in a bar."
28012,Homer,dvd player? check. snow-cone machine? check. lite brite?
19980,Homer,thank you. may i please use your phone?
27246,Homer,"marge, i'm off to the blacksmith to get my tooth pulled."

23092,Homer,why are you so cruel?
31378,Homer,"moe, you live in a hotel? you're just like ""eloise""!"
37595,Homer,okay.
32448,Homer,"you guys gotta help me! if marge leaves i'll have nothing except my many friends, and half the fortune she is now making and will continue to make."
33429,Homer,"absolutely. insurance is the greatest deal ever. if i get hurt, i get paid. and man, do i get hurt."
24589,Homer,"hey, you gotta hand it to those dolphins. they just wanted it more."
14272,Homer,i got the job. i got the job! whoo hoo! only in america could i get a job!
38706,Homer,"once again, i've been saved from any consequences. it'll keep happening till one day i create a mess so enormous it can't be cleaned up. thanks, boy."
16466,Homer,"mindy, because of our uncontrollable attraction, i think we should avoid each other from now on."
28327,Homer,"mr. macbeth, i'm really sorry."
27697,Homer,shot down on valentine's day. that's supposed to be a gimme. everybody's gettin'some but me.
34236,Homer,"boy, i am through spoiling you. first thing tomorrow you're going back to the rotten life you've always enjoyed."
36978,Homer,maybe.
14323,Homer,"why, you little --"
32972,Homer,stop -- in the name of a private citizen with no connection to the law!
16510,Homer,twenty- one? do that card-counting thing again! come on. do it again.

31778,Homer,"okay, how 'bout an autograph for my kids?"
36966,Homer,sweet.
15136,Homer,chief justice of the supreme court. what great men he would join. john marshall... charles evans hughes... warren burger... mmm burger.
14345,Homer,"huh, they both make a good case."
39225,Homer,mmm-hmm. mmm-hmm.
28711,Homer,"to old man burns, who's paying us to drink because we're embarrassing!"
39662,Homer,"no. this is a trap. it's going to catch us our dinner. come on, boy."
35603,Homer,"""in the event of a primary core breach, you have fifteen seconds to avoid a complete--"
14644,Homer,"that was his dish, and that was his leash, and that's where he took a whiz on the rug."
20950,Homer,"i... also sleep... g'night, mommy..."
28918,Homer,let's go.
17723,Homer,check.

23018,Homer,"now's our opening. come on, you idiots, we're taking back this town!"
34704,Homer,it's four am -- you kids should've been in bed a half hour ago!
30657,Homer,a carpenter named joseph was about to get some frankly preposterous news...
14425,Homer,after i catch my breath... can we... go... home?
32518,Homer,i remember.
22312,Homer,do you like piña colonics / and getting caught in the rain...
22099,Homer,the pig is in the poke.
23694,Homer,"oh, no. you're not gettin' me on that dance floor. don't try and make me. if i have to get a divorce i will."
23691,Homer,nah. we'll go next month.
40525,Homer,take that you dumb squirrel.
32876,Homer,it didn't have to go down like this!
34339,Homer,"oh my god, i killed her!"
23466,Homer,"yeah, i hope i can grow some like that."
34435,Homer,"attention christians, muslims, and jews. i have come to gather you into a new faith. from now on you shall be called chrismujews."
40317,Homer,"hey, you guys are hanging on my every word. i've become the center of attention."
36225,Homer,why did i do that? / it sounds so dull and boring. / what was i thinking?
35269,Homer,whoo!
21083,Homer,"boy, i guess i was wrong about that earring. it saved us all."
34111,Homer,"well, welcome, charlie! nice to meet ya! no glasses -- way to go! this one's a keeper!"
25546,Homer,that amos burke made his own rules.
24410,Homer,there's no good place!
17142,Homer,and you didn't think i'd make any money. i found a dollar while i was waiting for the bus.
27737,Homer,revenge? on mr. burns?
20310,Homer,bo-ring!
19148,Homer,well...
36473,Homer,not according to the internet!
26118,Homer,something else happened in that quarry... something... else...
15090,Homer,don't leave me alone with him.
39315,Homer,we got one?
34524,Homer,"it's time to unplug these vampire appliances that plunge their prongs into our creamy white outlets to quench their unholy thirst for electrons. lamp, computer, jacob's ladder..."
21215,Homer,"and to think you wanted me to crawl, marge! well, this man doesn't crawl. he stands tall. that rhymes, marge, and you know it rhymes. admit it!"
24109,Homer,you're mad? where's my show!?
37621,Homer,just like when i smell up the toilet.
40949,Homer,"what is it, da --"
27851,Homer,"no, no. this is nothing like milhouse's parents. now if you need me i'll be staying with milhouse's father."
20744,Homer,"well, ain't that somethin'."
20836,Homer,woo hoo!
21021,Homer,no.
27086,Homer,mr. seltzer?
27512,Homer,you was hiding behind the drywall. yes you were! i'm glad social services didn't see this. yes i am!
33523,Homer,i really hate this neighborhood.
38893,Homer,what about my family?
31243,Homer,"oh, uh... you know what they say, ""hammer with the wood and it's all good."""
30701,Homer,"oh, which way did mason go? that must be him over there."
27095,Homer,i got 'em!
20072,Homer,"well, i'm sorry if you heard ""disneyland"", but i distinctly said ""military school."""
17173,Homer,i mean hello!
15190,Homer,all part of god's great plan.
40765,Homer,wait a minute! that word you keep calling me --
37032,Homer,"oh god, my back! suckers! my discs are grinding! easy money!"
36742,Homer,i don't want to see it!
23525,Homer,"no, i'd rather die!"
40348,Homer,"okay, okay, all right, all right. she's right! let's do something together. what does everyone say to some miniature golf, followed by a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?"
24954,Homer,he couldn't breathe.
28367,Homer,"yeah, i love sprawl-mart. they've got everything. even christian videos with talking vegetables."
29304,Homer,"well, that explains a lot. who's hungry?"
30762,Homer,"i'm comin', boy!"
30358,Homer,"now marge, when our little girl's happiness is at stake..."
26218,Homer,"ah, the sweet couple of seconds before i remember why i'm sleeping on the lawn."
19211,Homer,"eh, not mine."
25284,Homer,"lisa! lisa, beer me."
15296,Homer,fine. i'll never ever do another stupid thing. good night!
18526,Homer,"oh, by the way, i was being sarcastic."
32491,Homer,"i spit on your corpse, advertiser-supported television!"
17260,Homer,john denver.
27368,Homer,but i'm full of questions. what's your favorite cigar size? is it robusto? is it?!
34331,Homer,"that was last week, and you're still bringing it up!"
32089,Homer,i'm aroused and confused.
18933,Homer,"hey marge, look what i brought home."
18106,Homer,"i have nothing more to say to you, marge. i'm drawing a line down the center of the house à la ""i love lucy"" -- you stay on your side and i'll stay on my side."
38289,Homer,feels weird.
32859,Homer,a documentary?!
28184,Homer,y'ello?
29295,Homer,"nice try, loser. i bet you made up a fake test."
35928,Homer,"great show, people. great show. um... not a big deal, but next time can we use real gravy instead of brown paint? not a big deal."
22836,Homer,"woo hoo! look, marge, my first sale! in your face, jasper johns!"
18050,Homer,"now get to school, boy."
15861,Homer,"no, they weren't all happy days. like the time pinky tuscadero crashed her motorcycle -- or the night i lost all my money to those card sharks, and my dad, tom bosley, had to get it back."
28491,Homer,"hey, everybody! we're going shopping at the springfield heights promenade!"
13715,Homer,why not?
13455,Homer,earmuffs.
40084,Homer,"i love you, karl -- marge."
37163,Homer,"whatever you say, sir."
28182,Homer,woo-hoo!
20678,Homer,"hey, she's getting away with the washcloth!"
34703,Homer,that was awesome. i feel like the tiger woods of sex.
28545,Homer,"i've got it... when everyone's asleep, i'll take away their presents. then they'll be happy! thanks, buddha."
38773,Homer,"well it's not enough anymore. when something great happens to one person, everyone else's life gets a little worse. look it up, it's called physics."
41111,Homer,"oh dad. oh, i knew you'd forgive me."
29675,Homer,"great, another job lost to a foreigner."
23263,Homer,i'll have you know i wandered off from the tour.
14230,Homer,i am?
14502,Homer,what the hell are you talking about?
39630,Homer,don't worry. this is an all-terrain vehicle.
17076,Homer,"all right, we're breaking early tonight, class. for tomorrow, you should read pages seven through eighteen in lisa's diary."
20752,Homer,that's weird. the key doesn't fit.
33751,Homer,"yeah, you don't see many presidents doing that. maybe l.b.j. -- you know, at the end."
28074,Homer,gotta go.
19505,Homer,"tgif! guys, i'm off to moe's."
35529,Homer,"oh c'mon, stay for dessert!"
13850,Homer,sheesh. what a slave driver.
24752,Homer,read it!
33278,Homer,everyone get out!
18880,Homer,"well, maybe we could order something from oak ridge..."
22685,Homer,oh yeah? what do you know about it? y--
36691,Homer,holy moly.
17736,Homer,i've never been so miserable in all my life. but i can't take it out on marge and the kids. i've got to carry the burden all by myself.
20101,Homer,don't you start.
30243,Homer,"hey, i didn't bet any of our money. i just borrowed some from him."
31662,Homer,bart... buddy! it's your dad! i need a ride! i think i'm in chinatown. not our chinatown.
20391,Homer,"oh-ho, confused, would we?"
20579,Homer,we do?
18720,Homer,"well, luckily, there's no such thing as ghosts."
31489,Homer,"oh, of course. whatever you say, sweetie. nighty-night."
40143,Homer,it's got great high ceilings.
14320,Homer,you must think we're the worst parents in the world.
28359,Homer,"okay, mother's day gift check. let's see what you got."
41484,Homer,"oh marge, if only i knew what these paintings meant."
37791,Homer,yes. we'll be back by three. homer has a very tight nap schedule.
29621,Homer,which will lead to a lot more impulsive marriages. which will put more green in the blue. the blue being my pants.
17626,Homer,oh that. it's just a birth mark and i'll thank you not to stare.
25748,Homer,"i owe it all to my rewarding work with children, and not picking at it."
39003,Homer,oopsie.
28725,Homer,"marge, i'm not gonna lie to you..."
14437,Homer,"look marge, i can tell something's bothering you. but if you come out of that car, i promise to do whatever it takes to make it better. please, honey?"
33428,Homer,so you did learn something.
30513,Homer,i can do that!
33692,Homer,i'm telling!
19906,Homer,"wait a minute. bart's teacher's name is ""krabappel?"" i've been calling her ""crandall."" why didn't someone tell me? oh, i've been making an idiot out of myself."
37714,Homer,we do that every night! come on! jump on the bed!
15870,Homer,i discovered a meal between breakfast and brunch.
25063,Homer,"i hope it's flanders. i'm just kidding. hey, you're all right."
36581,Homer,"now, before we start, what's the safe word?"
41059,Homer,"oh, a hundred and twenty-five bucks!"
15503,Homer,"bed goes up... kids, i want to give you some words to remember me by in case something happens. let's see... uh... oh, i'm no good at this."
24422,Homer,but i was just...

13726,Homer,to ned flanders... the richest left- handed man in town.
22391,Homer,and that's the end of that chapter.

19072,Homer,oh my god... space aliens! don't eat me! i have a wife and kids! eat them!
37269,Homer,"fear not, people. i will lead you safely across."
18919,Homer,bear patrol tax: $5?! what?! this is an outrage! it's the biggest tax increase in history!
30333,Homer,no soldier left behind.
34975,Homer,oh. that beating.
27243,Homer,"you've been in there over an hour, boy! other people have to confess too, you know. oh, i can't hold it in. i hate this house!"
30518,Homer,salamander awayyy!
29144,Homer,who are you?
28079,Homer,"tonight, we're here to serve you. sit back and enjoy the finest foods springfield has to offer."
33804,Homer,now we could smash the real westminster abbey so it looks like this.
19212,Homer,where are you going?
15089,Homer,that doll tried to kill me!
29779,Homer,"bring back our children, you cyprus-splitting jerks!"
30206,Homer,"hey! i'm bart simpson's father, and i'm sick of you teaching my son your time-tested values! hey, what's that smell?"
36685,Homer,"but we need to know everything, no matter how shameful. and fast!"
35834,Homer,they were so childless and miserable.
32112,Homer,"wait, wait. uh, this is some of what i do, i think. sometimes i go places."
22808,Homer,"oh, yeah. that's a fine looking..."
27468,Homer,ow... ow... ow... oww...
32042,Homer,it's over? that wasn't so bad.
24441,Homer,too late.
40474,Homer,"amen! well, bart, has dr. hibbert made his point?"
36402,Homer,"i get it. you need your marge time. well, i'm off to work."
27072,Homer,"you guys are the best. i love you, i love you, i love you..."
31075,Homer,i know. i just thought maybe... boo!
38523,Homer,"my one weakness: the third ""really."" come with me."
40305,Homer,"right, mr. goofball."
29422,Homer,"hola, señor. we are gringos who wish to spend mucho dinero in your country."
38324,Homer,somebody kill me.
38631,Homer,"wait, mr. burns! i'm here to man up -- it was all my wife's fault! sometimes i think she and i have nothing in common."
28321,Homer,"now, now, let's just look... there's big ben, there's piccadilly circus, there's jimmy page, one of the greatest thieves of american black music who ever walked the earth. bup, there's the kids."
16268,Homer,"man's best friend, indeed."
41191,Homer,"marge, you don't understand. i can't do it because... you're trapped. if you were smarter, you might think of something, but you're not so you just might as well... all right! all right! i'll take her. lousy brain."
30722,Homer,i don't tell your mother how much i've lost.
20385,Homer,"this gun cost me everything. my wife, my kids... everything but my precious, precious gun."
15813,Homer,shhhh! just watch.
30210,Homer,bingo? that's my favorite game. i just can't remember what to yell out when you win.
33678,Homer,"ooh, maggie made some new friends."
24205,Homer,fire! fire!
13890,Homer,"see, even when you yell at me, i can see love in your eyes."
23481,Homer,"well, marge, have you ever seen a field glow like that?"
36126,Homer,"don't just stare back at me, come up with a theory! geez, it's all over the place. holy moly."
19333,Homer,'cause there's lots of stuff she doesn't know about.
31954,Homer,well... most of it.
29937,Homer,that's a given! there's something else. something much more else.
32594,Homer,oh my god! i'm not dead!
39872,Homer,"wait a minute, skinner. how do we know some principal over in france isn't pulling the same scam you are?"
38957,Homer,hey! ow! ow! i thought you were my best friend! ow! ow!
24689,Homer,"listen, do you want the job done right or do you want it done fast?"
39545,Homer,rumpus room. great idea!
23369,Homer,"now, flanders, i want you to..."
30506,Homer,"i'm sorry i made you feel bad, honey. but i'm gonna show you just how much i care about your feelings. one adult and one baby, please."
20324,Homer,baby.
38930,Homer,"'scuse me, pardon me, what the hell?"
36985,Homer,do not question the wisdom of tom skerritt.
26004,Homer,um... the rabbits are cute.
14334,Homer,"moe, i'd like to bet twenty dollars on denver."
40597,Homer,"okay, okay, okay, okay. where do you want to go?"
24453,Homer,"oh, here we go with the add ons. no thanks."
32990,Homer,let's roll.
14975,Homer,"i, on the other hand, have been having the best day of my life. and i owe it all to skipping church!"
14310,Homer,"marge, we need some more vanilla-chocolate-and-strawberry ice cream."
27834,Homer,"nausea... cravings... knocked-up feeling... she was pregnant with bart! and that's the reason she stayed with me.,nausea cravings knocked-up feeling she was pregnant with bart and thats the reason she stayed with me,17

37178,Homer,waldo. waldo. waldo.
30191,Homer,maybe. we don't know that for sure.
38715,Homer,we got a new tent from a guy who o.d.'d!
25621,Homer,nobody's gonna tackle you.
15035,Homer,"ho-mer, ho-mer, ho-mer.."

40647,Homer,have man-to-man with bart.
19125,Homer,i can't buy that. only management type guys with big salaries like me can afford things like that. guys like me? i'm a guy like me!
17938,Homer,mmmmm.
14107,Homer,"ahh. thanks, moe. you're the greatest friend a guy could ever have."
30888,Homer,"because we'll be on tv, and earn enough money to buy a tv. tv."
17486,Homer,b-but i'm using my whole ass.
23911,Homer,"look at me, i'm a billionaire!"
35767,Homer,"...so he says, ""bigamy is having one too many wives."" to which i replied, ""so's monogamy."""
34886,Homer,stupid dog! let go of that delicious bird!
13694,Homer,huh?
29108,Homer,what about now?
39354,Homer,"can it wait, son? it's getting kinda dark."
29684,Homer,"but marge, i don't want her to be happy."
23982,Homer,"no talking! no new crap! ""takin' care of business!"" now!"
26498,Homer,"overdue book?! this is the biggest frame-up since o.j. wait a minute... blood in the bronco... the cuts on his hand... those jay leno monologues... oh my god, he did it!"
26855,Homer,"y'ello! hi, mrs. bellamy. no, i'm not doing anything. i can mow your lawn."
16290,Homer,my wife's having a girls' night out.
21427,Homer,"but marge, the gilded truffle is an intimate, elegant place."
22530,Homer,"we're putting an end to your insane valentine's rampage. never again will good, lazy men have to... what the--?"
36923,Homer,"i don't know what you just said, but it's wrong! wrong, wrong, wrong!"
40027,Homer,i have hair!... i have hair!
14429,Homer,alley balls...
23708,Homer,"you know, if you want to be in the gang, eventually you're gonna have to get motorcycles."
16171,Homer,"the deal's off, mr. burns. the bear stays here."
32543,Homer,flanders!
39700,Homer,catch it! catch it!
32429,Homer,"oh yeah, marge, i love these business trips of yours. the tv remote isn't nailed on. my whole life, i've never been in a hotel that trusted me."
19180,Homer,wow! i've never been in here before!
40380,Homer,that's right!
16472,Homer,"stop that. i love my wife and family. all i'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. that's it."
35010,Homer,i worked for fat tony. and he was the best boss i ever had.
15635,Homer,i just press this button and the door opens like magic.
33832,Homer,thank you.
22510,Homer,everybody's marriage is falling apart except ours. see the problem's communication. too much communication.
31770,Homer,"oh, captain janeway! your mission ended too soon! too soon..."
27574,Homer,"of all the sites on all the web, i had to click onto his."
29515,Homer,sure do.
30426,Homer,and he's great with the neighbors.
29257,Homer,"there it is, nice and smooth. i'd like to see your boyfriend the contractor do a better job."
18141,Homer,--son!
16057,Homer,"katharine hepburn's ""me""?"
16531,Homer,ow...ow...ow...ow.
23357,Homer,"we'll miss you, buddy."
23312,Homer,"sorry, marge. i'm afraid this gets my lowest rating ever, seven thumbs up."
28265,Homer,nooo!
29536,Homer,nicely done.
34309,Homer,and that's why i earn less than my white co-workers!
22390,Homer,local man has same name. a tv character has the same name as springfield resident homer simpson.
18784,Homer,"yes, sir, i did."
28675,Homer,"all right, ""chapter one."" hm, that makes sense. ""there once was a girl from nantucket..."" good, good... ""her name was temperance barrows and her heart was heavy with feeling. she..."""
24579,Homer,"... two krusty shakes, a donut burger with cheese and a party-size bucket of flan."
39887,Homer,"nice and cozy, adil?"
39162,Homer,"um, yeah, sure. hello, this is the princess. i'm with homer simpson and i do declare he's wonderful. oh, that's right, i'm from south africa. fiddle dee dee."
16845,Homer,o-okay.
39841,Homer,forget that. i'm teaching my boy a lesson. is she here or not?
27854,Homer,"stupid flanders with his misleading silhouette. well, i guess i have no choice but to go back home and... hey, i never noticed that newspaper box."
34641,Homer,i'm doomed.
29001,Homer,this way!
18441,Homer,"thank you, mr. burns. it was pretty scary up there. but... for a while i feared for my life."
40512,Homer,because why?
37031,Homer,"all right, now to drag the meter to the next idiot."
33506,Homer,"don't worry, marge."
31474,Homer,goooo... lovemaking!
30187,Homer,"...and your infinite patience with a big, dumb jerk like me. oh, ned, i don't deserve you as a neighbor, but will you forgive a young, handsome fool and come home?"
32687,Homer,wanna take a ride with your old man?
27144,Homer,"come on, kids. daddy knows a way to get the money... with no risk."
28358,Homer,"lady, you're gorgeous. you make dame edna look like a dude!"
33765,Homer,gotta be something from earth.
34547,Homer,now we're cookin' with wind!
19708,Homer,what the hell are you talking about?
34607,Homer,"everyone in this town is sick and tired of you looking over their shoulder. ""don't leave your sprinklers on in the rain!"" ""don't burn that pile of ventriloquist dummies!"""
13508,Homer,twenty eight minutes till burns comes. time for operation mail take.
29335,Homer,ladies! there's no need to fight over me.
38466,Homer,all muscle. in minnesota i'd be a supermodel!
32330,Homer,woo hoo!
17048,Homer,no talking.
20873,Homer,oh i get it. i get jokes.
18144,Homer,"that's all well and good, but it's not really your idea, is it now marge?"
29482,Homer,"well... i'm worried about marge and moe. they've developed an intimate bond of thoughts and feelings completely separate from me. but it's not physical. so everything's great, right?"
35138,Homer,"wealthy? hey, remember the guy who drove you to school that one time. eh?"
31470,Homer,yeah? well i wish i'd married patty and selma!
31935,Homer,oh my god! what have i done?!
22468,Homer,tree-huggers...
25943,Homer,"oh lord, guide this cinder block..."
13513,Homer,me and my big... letter writing pen!
22214,Homer,"way to go, flanders. the bible's finally pulling its weight. got any more holy numbers?"
31634,Homer,wow. that had what i really like in a story: an ending.
20014,Homer,"hi, grimy, old buddy."
30959,Homer,you're giving me absolute power?!
30315,Homer,poor dumb country mouse. can't even count.
18563,Homer,"i don't think so, stupid!"
37765,Homer,i think i'll be good tonight and stay in with you.
23158,Homer,"mel, you're coming off desperate. roll it, louie!"
31177,Homer,"he's talkin' like the guy in ""fat albert."" howba areba youba?"
28557,Homer,nyagh-nyagh-nyagh-nyagh-nyagh.
39810,Homer,"i-it's meaningless, marge. don't even attempt to find meaning in it. there's nothing between me and princess kashmir."
15551,Homer,batman's a scientist.
33561,Homer,are you sure you don't want me to do it? 'cause i can do it. i got the outfit right here.
16611,Homer,"oh, this doesn't work any more."
34487,Homer,"i'm there every day, five to eleven."
40222,Homer,"marge, get back in bed."
34156,Homer,really? me? you mean it?
41052,Homer,"look at that get-up. heavy hands, ankle weights, that's cute, and ... assassins!"
19474,Homer,"that coyote said my soul mate would understand me, but marge doesn't understand me at all. maybe we're not kindred spirits. we don't have anything in common..."
22082,Homer,nooooooooooo!
30435,Homer,no toys!
13528,Homer,"oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!"
37089,Homer,"i swear to you, marge, when i have the time, i will google them both."
15194,Homer,hmm.
29349,Homer,"oh yes you are. why, in the right light, you're starting to get your own muzzle."
19013,Homer,"anyway, get ready, beer belly! we're gonna show springfield what we're made of!"
28159,Homer,beat the lumps. beat the lumps. beat the lumps.
30757,Homer,"hey, i enjoy you plenty."
32922,Homer,made it!
33679,Homer,"aw, burrowing your head into your daddy. a sign that my baby is happy and confident."
34199,Homer,no time to pretend we're friends! lotto me!
18815,Homer,okay.
39638,Homer,will somebody help her?
38659,Homer,a boxing glove!
21774,Homer,higher!
19828,Homer,can you see the pie stains?
19963,Homer,who cares? this is the best part of the week!
18724,Homer,hey marge -- what were your gambling losses last year?
30129,Homer,"no, i'm in a good place with that."
15223,Homer,i'm used to seeing people promoted ahead of me... friends... co-workers... tibor... i never thought it'd be my own wife.
35224,Homer,cheech is sure a lot less cool / than i imagined...
17451,Homer,"oh, here we are. the ""utility room."""
24702,Homer,idiots.
31422,Homer,butter-brickle!
28733,Homer,mr. bo-jangles / mr. bo-jangles / we're all bo-jangles / who killed bo-jangles? / maybe it was you...
18977,Homer,forever... forever... forever...
36115,Homer,no backtalk! in the cage! now!
18495,Homer,"heh, heh. why jerk my neck around like a goon when tyranno-vision decides what i should look at?"
25125,Homer,"dr. joyce brothers may be well known, but her psychological credentials are highly suspect."
28434,Homer,bah-dah-dah dah-dah dah-dah dah-dah dah-dah...
32707,Homer,just gimme a minute. but feel free to go nuts on me.
28181,Homer,come on!
39940,Homer,"the reason i look unhappy is that tonight i have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters -- or as i call them, ""the gruesome twosome."""
32628,Homer,"c'mon, marge, it's primary fever -- catch it!"
19942,Homer,now i can't remember every little thing that happens in my day.
16650,Homer,that dog can sell anything.
16528,Homer,aw. just like on tv.
34472,Homer,no food allowed in bank?
36767,Homer,i'm sonny bono. watch out for that tree!
19858,Homer,"hang on, son!"
13998,Homer,i'm homer simpson. i just took your test. i got a zero.
33632,Homer,why not?
16225,Homer,kill my boss? do i dare live out the american dream?
24957,Homer,black arts?!
20864,Homer,"well, maybe if he had better arch support, they wouldn't have caught him."
29347,Homer,whew!
16961,Homer,"son, i know you're upset because you thought you saw us on tv saying we didn't want you in our family. but those were just actors playing us."
25532,Homer,"wait, i changed my mind."
39733,Homer,"good going, son. but remember, most lynch mobs aren't this nice."
21650,Homer,"invent your way out of this, edison."
26028,Homer,"which i'll be doing tomorrow morning, smart guy."
19680,Homer,"blood, uch! i'll just stick to the brain and kidney pie, thank you."
29460,Homer,put up my house? but i just paid it off... what would marge say?
24289,Homer,i'll be at moe's.
25314,Homer,"you're right. but just to be safe, maybe i should chain him up."
28688,Homer,"i'll have to read marge's book. and i swore never to read again after ""to kill a mockingbird"" gave me no useful advice on killing mockingbirds. it did teach me not to judge a man based on the color of his skin, but what good does that do me?"
38129,Homer,emojis. now she's gone too far.
31146,Homer,"interesting, interesting...."
31998,Homer,"hey, get your own yogurt!"
36092,Homer,it's a state-of-the-art food mash-'em-upper.
33147,Homer,"hmm, all right. the trick is to ease them off--"
34750,Homer,"hey, let's hold hands and skip inside!"
25856,Homer,"end of the line, boys."
39696,Homer,"this isn't gambling, marge. it's a lead pipe cinch."
24158,Homer,"so, how's the tv reception here? excellent, or...?"
17164,Homer,hm...
27305,Homer,"now bob, i know you're concerned, but don't worry. i have operatives working the crowd."
39837,Homer,"oh, he does not!"
17111,Homer,"it's cool in here, boy. for the rest of the summer, we can live inside the refrigerator."
24440,Homer,nah. i want to enjoy this show before the network retools it.
35555,Homer,"hey, hey! what are you doing?"
18097,Homer,"that's okay. i'm supposed to be workin', too."
15655,Homer,look! there's another disadvantaged boy.
40925,Homer,"boy, a good man really is hard to find."
29421,Homer,"i could just wear gloves. nah, they're upstairs."
29778,Homer,thank god for that turkish freighter. now we'll just go get 'em and...
39340,Homer,"well, there is nothing wrong with a father kissing his son, i think. now go on, boy, and pay attention, because if you do, one day you may achieve something that we simpsons have dreamed about for generations. you may outsmart someone."
20707,Homer,oo! oo! me first!
27028,Homer,"manimals, invertebroads! you must fight back against the one who did this to you!"
41370,Homer,wednesday?
22663,Homer,"heyyy, this piece of junk is finally doing something."
29443,Homer,"one... two... eh, i'd rather die."
25821,Homer,"marge, that ""curse"" is just a lot of silly superstition. right lisa?"
36736,Homer,huh? what?
37559,Homer,"okay. i'm ready for the nuclear workers convention! it's a little sad. the guys who did the funny skit last year well, they're all very sick."
18068,Homer,"laser effects, mirrored balls. john williams must be rolling around in his grave."
19731,Homer,"no. how can you love a box, or a toy, or graphics? you're a grown man."
32280,Homer,i'm doing my job!
25048,Homer,circus?
24707,Homer,"just a second, honey. daddy's on his high horse."
25173,Homer,"heh, heh. ""grill power."""
41533,Homer,"okay, all right! time's up!"
37142,Homer,"that's it? well, then let's ""power"" this party up!"
34114,Homer,"oh, c'mon! look out! what would that guy-- look out! that's funny."
37607,Homer,i'm not blowing up the plant. just harmlessly stopping it from doing more damage to mother earth.
32820,Homer,"son, a lot of these youth organizations encourage parents to get involved in the activities--"
14829,Homer,"wait a minute. i'm not signing anything until i read it, or somebody gives me the gist of it."
39501,Homer,arrrgh!

37759,Homer,"hey, gretchen!"
31657,Homer,"hold on there, boy. if you wanna keep using that car, you'd better start pullin' your weight."
16905,Homer,"what do you mean? it's an elephant, isn't it?"
38309,Homer,"marge please, control your jealousy. this is your daughter!"
30417,Homer,okay.
14470,Homer,barney! you're gonna pull her arm off.
29781,Homer,noooo!
25537,Homer,"no, i can handle it. i'll get you, squealer."
37886,Homer,"two adults, two kids, and one senior with the mind of a baby so he should be free."
31629,Homer,"but marge, i did it all for you!"
36223,Homer,yeah... but a weekend without drinking is no big deal. i did it when i was in that alcohol-induced coma.
22436,Homer,just takin' care of business.
41136,Homer,the hell with this.
14682,Homer,"hey... hey, lurleen! i've gotta say somethin' to ya."
32296,Homer,you... let... go...
13546,Homer,the devil with his fly open.
36802,Homer,"hope is here, people, and it's real. it's not just inside the house of god, it's outside the house of me! so come and see the sticky brown truth!"
35567,Homer,"why of course! even if i don't have a legal obligation to pay, it's clearly the right thing to do."
38246,Homer,"if i bet it, i could double it. but on who?"
33977,Homer,how can i control her?! i have nothing to withhold!
19883,Homer,"ka-boom! blam! oh, excuse me again, dear."
32932,Homer,just what are you guys up to?
37996,Homer,"look, honey, i know these glasses are a radical new technology and should be worn in moderation. isn't that right, glasses?"
35920,Homer,why? oh why?
39505,Homer,wow! five hundred smackers!
17258,Homer,"well, it was a long trip, but we're almost there."
23407,Homer,i have to go to ze lobby!
13767,Homer,"eenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go... eenie meenie minee... moe."
28510,Homer,that's not true. i cared what you thought once you found out.
30544,Homer,"marge, without this outfit, i'm just homer simpson, multiple felon. with it, i'm a costumed hero like george washington or dame edna."
28053,Homer,and when i hear...
14637,Homer,my quarter!!!
38801,Homer,maybe marge would forgive me if i won the lotto. give me a scratcher.
15926,Homer,"marge, i'm gonna miss you so much. and it's not just the sex... it's also the food preparation... your skill with stains of all kinds. but mostly, i'll miss how lucky you make me feel each and every morning."
41471,Homer,don't act like i'm the first person that ever said that!
30669,Homer,"oh, it's just what i wanted. here, marge, this is for you."
41485,Homer,"i know the woman i loved is still in there somewhere, behind all this nonsense."
37011,Homer,"now we're going to leave this place. i'm sorry, bart -- i know you've made a bug-out camp girlfriend..."
19747,Homer,"whoa, not me. and not because john's gay, but because he's a sneak. he should at least have the good taste to mince around and let everyone know that he's that way."
34505,Homer,you saved my life. and i came here every day to make sure you pulled through.
21201,Homer,"siddown, honey. the men will clear the table!"
29111,Homer,"marge, i'm really sorry i hurt you. but i've done way worse stuff since then: there was the gun i hid from you, the time i sued the church, ruining lisa's wedding in the future... remember that?"
29698,Homer,"nice chair toss. good one, skinny. / you guys get these chairs from regal rents? / boy, you're a great stacker. / hi, lisa. / now that's precarious."
36397,Homer,uh... i got... shelbyville radio in my car for a few minutes.
24160,Homer,"no couches either? oh, man. i need a beer."
30294,Homer,"now if you'll excuse me, i have to use the outhouse again."
38997,Homer,"go ahead, boy."
16468,Homer,oh no! i'm sweating like roger ebert.
17435,Homer,"oh, that man is sick!"
36621,Homer,"emotionally, financially, the boy... i just didn't know how to tell you."
26984,Homer,"yeah, but you'll have to leave a credit card."
27248,Homer,marge! throw me an old-timey rope in an old-timey way!
26290,Homer,"no marge, i love when you do that. you're a regular carin' a-lot-ovich."
31772,Homer,marge! this isn't like you.
19775,Homer,roscoe here runs this mill. he's gonna show us around and let you get a first-hand look at real all-american joes doin' what they do best.
20583,Homer,i went yesterday.
21440,Homer,"no, no. don't do that."
17687,Homer,that night your mother and i went out for a romantic evening to celebrate the start of our new life. we began with dinner and dancing... followed by a stroll on the beach...
22965,Homer,good. good. one more.
30542,Homer,"expand my brain, learning juice!"
24904,Homer,wuzzah?
35324,Homer,let's see what else you've been hiding in there.
23824,Homer,yes...
34430,Homer,"i'm more than okay! i am the messiah, come to save the world! look upon me and shudder!"
28598,Homer,"robot, i command you: do something cool!"
14342,Homer,"lisa, please, i can't hear the announcer."
30133,Homer,"but what are these wings? oh, it's just a seagull stuck in my back."
24667,Homer,"whatever. the point is, i'm homer simpson."
32273,Homer,"uh, that's still too sexy for my wife."
21538,Homer,"all right, screw it. let's roll."
31926,Homer,you're confusing drugs with druuuuugs.
35297,Homer,why you... i'm gonna... maybe this time...
29857,Homer,lousy cat.
30267,Homer,"you mean ""homer's famous marinara sauce."""
20220,Homer,"all right, all right, i promise. there must be another way to get an air conditioner..."
27353,Homer,now what am i gonna get lisa?
29554,Homer,"we now take you back through the ages, to a time before tv, before cowboys, before dinosaurs. the time of the bible!"
35735,Homer,"relax, with the team we put together, our book'll fly off the shelves, and we'll be sipping mai tais on a beach in shelbyville."
13667,Homer,okay. ready.
21418,Homer,"oh, so now it's we, eh."
34109,Homer,"oh, sweet meerschaum, take me away."
25002,Homer,oh... my... god.
35919,Homer,"great question. i know you children have never seen your father cry before... marge, do we have any more gravy?"
33216,Homer,you sure you're not mad?
41306,Homer,just for that i'm not going to help you.
35127,Homer,probably.
36784,Homer,how long have i been playing?
20321,Homer,"i couldn't agree more, marjorie. you deserve peace of mind and peace of mind is what you shall have."
35408,Homer,suck! of course!
28983,Homer,"and look at me, i'm reading ""the economist."" did you know indonesia is at a crossroads?"
37504,Homer,but i ask you to put aside your stubbornness while i tell you about carl carlson...
32906,Homer,"i mean, do you think my mother's out there somewhere? does she know i feel bad about things i said?"
30251,Homer,i swear.
25576,Homer,leeches!
14167,Homer,"lousy german know-it-alls, who are they to say i'm not safe? oh what's the matter with this thing."
33322,Homer,"uh, 'cause no one's making me. buh-bye."
34580,Homer,"sharks, innocent? please. every year they kill a couple of people who do a series of stupid things. the shark's reptilian brain understands only one thing: the crime of murder..."
33727,Homer,too much cherry!
27014,Homer,and i've never seen you use your tail like that.
17273,Homer,heeeeere's johnny.
31238,Homer,"yep, it'll do that."
20672,Homer,there's only one way out. we've gotta give this greedy town its money back.
24081,Homer,"now, the audio needs some tweaking, and there's some footage of maggie being born that i couldn't get rid of... anyway, enjoy."
20354,Homer,"learnin' somethin', marge?"
15752,Homer,i hope they kill that iron yuppie. thinks he's so big.
29768,Homer,that was my woodstock!
31589,Homer,then they brought us home...
35494,Homer,"also, if you wanna find the real shooter of mr. burns, go back and look for more clues. they're all there!"
37642,Homer,with an emerald that big i could buy anything -- a jalopy! an icebox! a steamer trunk full of fedoras! but how do i get my hands on it?
28764,Homer,"so our kids keep getting smarter! if we have another one, it could build a time machine, which we could use to go back in time and not have any kids."
21469,Homer,"um, no time like the present."
41494,Homer,spooky. hm... hm...
32316,Homer,"wow, bart! lookin' good!"
32408,Homer,"i want to, but i can't!"
28236,Homer,"oh mom, i'm so happy! i never want to let you go!"
26353,Homer,"honey, did you get any sleep?"
34508,Homer,fine! i'll stay a little more.
17068,Homer,"well let's just call 'em uh, ""mr. x"" and ""mrs. y."" so anyway, mr. x would say, 'marge, if this doesn't get your motor running, my name isn't homer j. simpson.'"
17462,Homer,"hoo mama! this is finally really happening. after years of disappointments with get-rich-quick-schemes, i know i'm gonna get rich with this scheme! and quick!"
22803,Homer,mmmm... hippo...

14614,Homer,"in doggie heaven, there's mountains of bones and they can't turn around without sniffing another dog's butt! and all the best dogs are there. old yeller... and about eight lassies and..."
24181,Homer,"look, the point is, i want to help, but you don't need a well, or a chapel, or an immunization center. what you need's a little razzle dazzle. qtoktok, are you thinking what i'm thinking?"
20238,Homer,will you get off my front lawn?
36661,Homer,"what the?! stupid calendar. first you put the fourth of july on sunday, and now this! ooh, we're gonna discuss this later!"
23589,Homer,that's right. you've got a special daddy.
32334,Homer,"oh, hello, marge. i'm at the most important event of our daughter's life, and you're totally late. am i disappointed? yes. am i surprised? no."

35233,Homer,it's disrespectful to the high standards people have come to expect from cheech and chunk.
20987,Homer,what'd he say? what about my car?
20749,Homer,"cooder, spud. get off that hog. you're coming to stay at our house."
27576,Homer,"for your information, i've been taking steps to become a better father."
20488,Homer,oh... oh... ooo... oh... yodel.
32372,Homer,"how about a little neck rub, baby?"
30293,Homer,"it wasn't all bad. as part of the settlement, her funeral was air conditioned."
19819,Homer,"well, i hope bob fed you, 'cause i ate your dinners."
40985,Homer,"marge, this can't be the right address."
19989,Homer,that was fast.
15219,Homer,"don't worry, baby. that tube'll know what to do."

28296,Homer,i'unno. how 'bout a horse whisperer?
38112,Homer,oh my god! this counts as exercise? i'm barely moving and i'm smelling cinnebun. sometimes you have to wait till you're thirty-eight to discover who you really are. i'm a seventy-nine-year-old man!
32763,Homer,gimme that!
34334,Homer,i was too! the words were in my brain!

31970,Homer,we sent it to skid row where it would do the most good.
37298,Homer,what? what? you're interesting. why would you say that?
38515,Homer,you've never done what i say! ever!
41403,Homer,and we're off!
38372,Homer,"well boy, if there was ever a good time for you to find out where babies come from, in the grossest way possible, with your life on the line, this is it."

31715,Homer,"i'd like to declare bankruptcy, please!"
29397,Homer,"not so fast. i also want some dribble glasses, fake boobs, two of bart's t-shirts, and that rapping toilet seat."
14067,Homer,"hey moe, you got any cough syrup?"
35991,Homer,"aw, sweetie. hey, why don't you make friends with my new computer?"
25057,Homer,man -- everyone has a snow day but us.
19268,Homer,"no! wait! wait! madam, i run a house of discipline. the boy will be disciplined, and disciplined severely. good day."
17379,Homer,must have rare gummy. distract the salesman marge!
13556,Homer,wow. how do you do that thing with your feet?
22768,Homer,you're pretty uptight for a naked chick. you know what would loosen you up? a little fruit.
32691,Homer,"son, i know when we first met, we didn't really hit it off. but since then, i've really come to respect you. and unlike love, respect can't be bought."
41490,Homer,let's all go out for some frosty chocolate milkshakes.
15073,Homer,really?
16397,Homer,"woo-hoo! see that, boy? your old man was right, not flanders. we are doomed! in your face, flanders!"
16522,Homer,woo hoo! problem solved!
27349,Homer,watch and learn.
24640,Homer,"oh yeah? they think they're better than us, huh? bart, c'mere a minute."
18649,Homer,"all right. his story checks out. marge, would you love me more if i were president? 'cause i'll do it if it will make you happy."
15410,Homer,where's the beef? no wonder he won minnesota.
20615,Homer,"ooo, gumball."
14538,Homer,who's next?
33816,Homer,i feel like i've died and gone to hell.
30411,Homer,"you know the four seasons? well, i'm experiencing them first hand, because i'm living in the park."
27797,Homer,oh my god! space monsters are invading us!
16575,Homer,"woo hoo, hoo! take that maynard g. krebs!"
25535,Homer,hurry up. i can't stand here jabbing you all day.
40339,Homer,"okay, okay. it wasn't how he said it either, but the message was loud and clear... our family stinks!"
31256,Homer,"yeah, i hear it too. maybe we can cover it up by singing a fun song. ""we will, we will rock you..."""
40762,Homer,"fifty-five! that's ridiculous! sure, they'll save a few lives. but millions will be late!"
30419,Homer,we'll lose the first kajillion to taxes.
28775,Homer,"i know, we'll use reverse psychology. maggie, don't press the red button!"
25708,Homer,"okay guys, i've got a secret play i've been saving for the olympics or possibly the final four, and it goes something like this... uh, skinner i want you... moe, you can take ... homer, you can take groundskeeper willie. no way am i taking groundskeeper willie. yes you are. are you a team player or not?"
35379,Homer,who undid my do?

31682,Homer,eh?
40667,Homer,"this is a videotape for my daughter, maggie. hi, maggie. i'm speaking to you from beyond the grave. oooooooh. hope that didn't scare you. well, you're a grown-up now, and unless you've taped over this, you're probably wondering what kind of man your father was... he was a simple man. a kind man. a gentle man who loved his children and..."
18989,Homer,alright. yeah.
20608,Homer,"hey, skinner! wanna drag race?"
32916,Homer,"this is hard work. isn't it, boy? boy?"
31801,Homer,i also wreck bar mitzvahs!
35390,Homer,yeah. but what if i can't find any commercial rental property?
24755,Homer,"well, what do you want, a medal?"
19378,Homer,hmm. i don't remember a bowling alley being th--
27214,Homer,hm. better add some more nails.
22630,Homer,"well, well, if it isn't frick and frack, jack and jill, fred and ethel, the three..."
29035,Homer,"oh, i think you'd find his filling extremely hot."
26299,Homer,"four tickets for ""shenani-goats!""."
36518,Homer,"you're dead, j.j. get yourself buried!"
38455,Homer,who the hell is that?!
20687,Homer,bart!
21262,Homer,"yeah, that was just a lie."
13752,Homer,huh? noise. bad noise!
16153,Homer,"oh, where did i lose 'em? i'll never wiggle my bare butt in public again."
17317,Homer,probably misses his old glasses.
33305,Homer,the secret is not to swallow the stingers.
19813,Homer,"and sure, he's probably so insane with rage that he'd butcher you horribly if he could --"
29434,Homer,my butt looks so huge during perp walks.
27089,Homer,"baby, baby, baby, baby!"
39011,Homer,"you're the guy who put wheels on luggage? oh, bless you! bless you!"
36972,Homer,don't worry. i am very good at keeping secrets.
23761,Homer,"now, let's see. this will make three christmases i saved versus eight i ruined... two were kind of a draw..."
18411,Homer,"oooo! ""an urgent plea from edward james olmos!"" ""lisa simpson: can you afford to miss another issue of the utne reader?"" kids."
14312,Homer,"why, you little..."
15352,Homer,oh yeah? how dumb do you think i --
25080,Homer,no use struggling my beloved chalamela.
35783,Homer,"wow, these seats are amazing."
17823,Homer,krusty the clown.
40109,Homer,"yeah, well, thanks for the speech, karl, but i can't give it. look at me!"
34401,Homer,"okay, okay. for you, i'll try."
40070,Homer,huh?
24804,Homer,i know.
14030,Homer,no!
17869,Homer,"sweet, trusting marge. i can't let you down. i'll get some money somehow."
34008,Homer,why you...
28435,Homer,time to whiz in a foaming bowl of china...
26538,Homer,i'm pretty sure it wasn't.
36545,Homer,that was gonna be my next guess!
30185,Homer,"no, i wanna make you a respecting stock. i don't know if you've noticed, but i've borrowed a lot of your stuff over the years..."
15257,Homer,"sorry marge, this is my quest. i'm like that guy -- that spanish guy -- you know, he fought the windmills..."
19497,Homer,"oh, sure. give me the one with all the monsters."
37373,Homer,"well i'm not one for taking new jobs on a whim. but as we say in the snow plow business, ""i'm your astronaut""!"
20671,Homer,"oh great, now we have to send him a card."
34990,Homer,my neck is kind of itchy.
13922,Homer,"well you know, we're always buying maggie vaccinations for diseases she doesn't even have."
18703,Homer,woo hoooooooooo--
20831,Homer,now i can show all of you what i've come to realize. the reason we're not allowed in the forbidden barn is because there is no inter-galactic spaceship! he's taken our money just so he can...build one hell of a spaceship!
20013,Homer,he likes you.
41397,Homer,"after we eat it, can we let it go? can we catch a submarine?"
16435,Homer,"foul temptress! i'll bet she thinks ziggy's gotten too preachy, too."
32125,Homer,i wasn't talking to you.
21226,Homer,i want to register to run for sanitation commissioner. and tell the fatcats upstairs -- things are gonna change in this town!
39956,Homer,"what? hey, barney, am i a pig?"
24004,Homer,"hey, where do you get those metal dealies for his feet?"
14332,Homer,a little beer will put out that fire.
18183,Homer,"c'mon, honey, you work yourself stupid for this family. if anyone deserves to be wrapped up in seaweed and buried in mud, it's you."
36073,Homer,someone's downstairs!
35864,Homer,"to prove a point. everyone thinks their dad's a jerk and everyone's right. but when you get older, you realize how much you love 'em."
17970,Homer,"oh great, now you're going to make fun of me."
36374,Homer,"yeah, and the customer service on this cruise has really gone downhill."
31635,Homer,"no, sweetie. the lesson is: never put down your weapon."
28544,Homer,hmm. you've given me a lot to think about.
26132,Homer,"well marge, we solved the case of the haunted quarry."
33005,Homer,"so, how 'bout a little stakeout music?"
22075,Homer,"yeah, i guess you're right. gimme a hug."
30282,Homer,"does the pizza guy take a check? if so, where do we keep the checks? and lastly, how do you write a check?"
17271,Homer,can't murder now. eating.
20112,Homer,"come off! come off! oh, all right, you!"
28786,Homer,"how 'bout ""diet coke -- the movie?""... ""president air bud: tail to the chief?""... ""my big fat greek salad?"""
21065,Homer,enough of what's out! what's in?
25928,Homer,"shhh, you'll wake up flanders..."
41497,Homer,"hmmm... hey, something's blocking it."
27099,Homer,really? you really think i'm better than you?
21287,Homer,what? they had a picnic last week.
21964,Homer,"that means that you weigh... one hundred and sixty pounds! oh-ho-ho, you're doin' great!"
15633,Homer,"son, i just want you to know i love you very much."
26895,Homer,jingle bell what?
16193,Homer,"well, we didn't get any money, but mr. burns got what he wanted. marge, i'm confused. is this a happy ending or a sad ending?"
34192,Homer,"i is! oooh, what a lucky man i is! boo-weee-boo-weee-wee-doo-doo-dee-dee-doo-doo"
26624,Homer,"but isn't marijuana, or ""dope,"" illegal?"
38073,Homer,because it's his home forever.
21425,Homer,"hey, look what was in here. a program from that guy's funeral."
19027,Homer,you have a desk?
21696,Homer,stupid cards.
35680,Homer,jealous? me?! that is to laugh! the very idea... if anything you're the one who's jealous!
13593,Homer,"oh yeah? well, what makes you so damn sure?"
24596,Homer,"what am i, a tailor?"
29370,Homer,"okay! you be the girl, and i'll be the car."
19160,Homer,"aw, the denver broncos."
37371,Homer,deacon? is that like one of those weird catholic priest things?
18498,Homer,"go back to massachusetts, pinko!"
25207,Homer,"hmm. i don't know what that is, so i'm gonna say yes. now, go limp."
24094,Homer,"now, we'll just send this to the dating service, the chicks'll fall for you, and bam! the healing begins."
16697,Homer,you?
23053,Homer,"sayonara, suckers!"
22923,Homer,"now, watch this..."
36318,Homer,hmm...
16299,Homer,"but please marge, don't drive into that chasm!"
36941,Homer,"yeah, mom, you promised!"
28607,Homer,"woo hoo! i mean, beep beep!"
41317,Homer,how am i supposed to kiss those things? interrupt her with something witty!
24825,Homer,"the answer is no, mr. burns. not for any amount of money."
39163,Homer,moe szyslak!
37387,Homer,"son, i'd love to, but... i'm a deacon now. my butt's place is in my pants."
30925,Homer,i love it when mr. burns shows a movie at work.
37681,Homer,today i'm glad that i sold that stock.
18810,Homer,"i'm transferring a call into you, mr. burns."
22661,Homer,"oh, my."
13328,Homer,"hmmm. oh, baby! mmmm. yeah."
37180,Homer,because we just bought them new shoes!
19820,Homer,"marge, i'm going to look for the kids!"
28466,Homer,"y'know, we've had a great time on this show ""riffing"" on small, unimportant subjects."
38473,Homer,"now come on, give daddy a hug."
39155,Homer,eight million?
23612,Homer,"listen, boy... i was wondering if you could use a little more fatherly attention."
14727,Homer,"you, off the bench."
33006,Homer,"well, i like a.c.-d.c."
16287,Homer,"ah, young love."
38424,Homer,so... where are all the friends?
30939,Homer,"this isn't india! where's the university of notre dame, the indy 500, wrigley field, dodger dogs --?"
21856,Homer,"oh, god."
32904,Homer,i just wish she hadn't died thinking i hated her.
35344,Homer,dammit!
30379,Homer,...fifteen dollars to infect your kids!
28685,Homer,why do you keep talking that way?!
38962,Homer,"'cause if i'm sick, i get to stay home and make s'mores. all i need is graham crackers, chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire..."
36977,Homer,typical sheeple.
14093,Homer,"ah, my new watering hole."
14357,Homer,"ugh, this is ridiculous. what am i supposed to do? lisa, who do you think's gonna win? the bengals or the dolphins?"
14293,Homer,mon-ey.
40844,Homer,"oooo. pro wrestling from mexico. you know, down there it's a real sport."
35218,Homer,oh. what's it made of? hash? shrooms? lysergic acid diethylamide?
32122,Homer,"as i said, i've lost all hope."
16061,Homer,"relax, a photo can't make any difference."
19560,Homer,uh... the second one. zilliphone. next question.
34758,Homer,"...he had earned the nickname ""charlie hustle..."""
13436,Homer,are you?
18510,Homer,goodnight.
16380,Homer,stupid poetic justice...!
15023,Homer,"well, that's just great."
24577,Homer,almost. just give her another twenty minutes.
34763,Homer,"ridin' high! sinkin' low! top of the heap! down i go! on top for good! oh, cruel hubris!"
24597,Homer,area code? but it's a local call.
26700,Homer,are the proceeds going to charity?
21611,Homer,you mean like an electric blanketmobile?
18416,Homer,don't make me close the shade!
40888,Homer,"oh, didja swipe those from work?"
18820,Homer,"oh, why can't they just take the gun?"
33311,Homer,you and me?
32190,Homer,your hair streaked with sun-light /
15636,Homer,because it's a stupid piece of junk!
36050,Homer,"soda, eh?"
29805,Homer,"that's right, an unauthorized tattoo. i came here right away."
34259,Homer,it'll make a walk on the beach seem like a punch in the face.
20933,Homer,whoa! hang on a minute! the guard said i have visitors coming!
25529,Homer,"my doctor says, and my garage mechanic agrees, that..."
28505,Homer,isn't it sufficient.
30946,Homer,"okay, apu said his cousin kavi could help me out."
23109,Homer,"hey, dolphins."
34804,Homer,"man, you vamps got it made... you sleep all day..."
22681,Homer,wow. it's even more wonderful than lisa said!
30589,Homer,burns' mansion?! that's mr. burns' mansion!
24832,Homer,"hey, open up! i've been standing here all morning."
39571,Homer,"bart, go easy on me. i'm your dad."
24232,Homer,"hey, moe. beer me!"
17559,Homer,those are all normal noises. luggage compartment closing. cross-checking. just sit back and relax.
29194,Homer,you're the only one who won't shut up about it.
21449,Homer,what?
38570,Homer,nice.
22484,Homer,"i'm never eatin' chili again. ooh, chili!"
23970,Homer,"uh, mr. burns, pirates got your yacht."
30476,Homer,did she say anything else?
35760,Homer,so... why are you here? is it about that unauthorized krusty lookalike i hired for lisa's first communion? what was his name?
16420,Homer,gotta go.
28107,Homer,men of cruelty.
16953,Homer,my secret shame.
35325,Homer,i want my pot of gold!
25734,Homer,"sure, knock yourselves out, and call me homer."
28803,Homer,"i don't see any ghost. i did find this newsweek from 1986: ""why america loves saddam hussein."""
41268,Homer,mental note: steal his idea.
34518,Homer,"no, faith is what you have in things that don't exist. your awesomeness is real."
33655,Homer,"i'm sorry, honey. i wanted so badly to give you a fancy wedding."
41532,Homer,none of your business. now give me a job at your business.
19832,Homer,you've never been?
36184,Homer,what?
36630,Homer,i'd like to buy back my sample.
37138,Homer,not again!
31120,Homer,"you, stupid..."
17597,Homer,"aw, thanks, lenny. when am i gonna be initiated?"
37958,Homer,"you're kumiko's father? welcome, sensei!"
40405,Homer,i got it right here in writing.
28286,Homer,i wish i'd married a businessman. then i'd have nice things.
39119,Homer,"hey, marge. i'm supposed to help drive the kids? oh, man, i wish i knew that sooner, but i just had a beer."
38183,Homer,"what you need, my friend, is a canadian duff. beauty, eh?"
14246,Homer,oh!
36516,Homer,but they're playing the purple sox!
29255,Homer,"thanks, marge. i can't wait to read about ""sport fishing with sonny jurgensen."""
40134,Homer,probably just the house settling.
21677,Homer,"well, whatever it is, it's a two-man job. where's bart?"
38815,Homer,even the anchor store's closed.
28063,Homer,"no, it's true. the car, the soup... it's like you hate me... your own husband..."
28606,Homer,doin' it for the boy...doin' it for the boy... pain is love... to bleed is to care...
20979,Homer,"well uh, you look pretty successful."
20697,Homer,even the criminals are beginning to croon.
14672,Homer,oh no.
35525,Homer,men's room? oh my god! we're completing each other's...
25711,Homer,ow!
36531,Homer,"oh-oh-oh oh, thank god you woke up!"
39440,Homer,bart!
14508,Homer,"well what a surprise. marge sticks up for flanders! can we have one conversation where you don't bring up your hero, ned flanders?"
28318,Homer,"well, marge, you've gotta admit. i've been on my best behavior this trip."
18702,Homer,yes.
38639,Homer,woo hoo!
27008,Homer,"hey, i'm on vacation."
19489,Homer,a ship! a ship with people! i know... i'll bring them to me! and then they'll have to be my friends!
23436,Homer,"flanders, you gotta help me. is there a southern couple parked in front of my house?"
30073,Homer,"he writes ""3150518"" on the board."
20016,Homer,"oh, i can't believe it. i've got an enemy. me! the most beloved man in springfield."
22572,Homer,"don't worry, kids. i know just what to do. jumanji! does anything from the movies actually work?"
18154,Homer,"kids! kids! kids! as far as daddy's concerned, you're both potential murderers."
14849,Homer,on... off... on... off.
30234,Homer,c'mon broncos... you can do it...
25978,Homer,for what? a little splattered food never hurt anybody. now everybody shut up and dance!
21172,Homer,"marge, can i get a duck?"
23019,Homer,did you have fun with your robot buddy?
31195,Homer,but this is the only life i know!
30709,Homer,but how?
33123,Homer,i'll steal it back when you're sleep-ing.
35252,Homer,"gee, sorry, dave."
15567,Homer,please.
24470,Homer,i'm down.
28988,Homer,come on everybody have some sex-ual congress / not the kind of congress that contained paul tsongas...
27666,Homer,that's a great idea. why didn't you say something before?
32110,Homer,"the camera's not on yet, right?"
35191,Homer,flat tire? no problem!
24896,Homer,"let's see now... ""bulletin: new race discovered living six inches under... denver."""
30232,Homer,bwa?
33471,Homer,"listen, you! when you gave me that money, you said i wouldn't have to repay it till the future! this isn't the future! it's the lousy, stinking now!"
16383,Homer,"shut up, brain, or i'll stab you with a q-tip."
34705,Homer,"oooh, the nobies!"
13965,Homer,in the garage.
38906,Homer,i have such a big ass.
19781,Homer,...and the entire steel mill was gay!
29520,Homer,woo hoo! but why?
24071,Homer,"but, uh, there's no point in playing the blame game."
39773,Homer,nothing.
39609,Homer,"yeah, how much is it?"
28519,Homer,unloved by al? noooooooo!
30951,Homer,sorry i'm late. i was doing carnak with my bodyguard.
25213,Homer,we might be able to do business.
25647,Homer,"linguo, dead!"
37063,Homer,clearly the boy's in shock.
27040,Homer,oh.
23421,Homer,really? but you've never given anyone a free beer.
39632,Homer,what do you think? should we stop here?
14247,Homer,"good evening, madame. you have been selected by the good people of slash-co to reap the benefits of their new nev-r-dull knife-edge. here... shake hands with the slash-co."
28730,Homer,"close, but no cigar. just plain diamonds."
24436,Homer,fine. there are plenty of other states that are happy to have us.
15204,Homer,"marge, it'll cost eighty-five hundred dollars. we only have five hundred in the bank. that leaves... eighty- hundred we need."
21758,Homer,"mmmm. ugh, pesticides! carbomate, if i'm not mistaken. yep, carbomate."
14143,Homer,"yeah! sock it to him, horst!"
21833,Homer,uh-oh.

40890,Homer,"all right, will you... hey, go protest outside will ya, now!."
13450,Homer,how many hairs on my head? without looking!
18204,Homer,"no! i've gotta pass this class for my kids. son, let's stop the fussin' and a-feudin'."
23430,Homer,"oh, honey, i had the worst nightmare. this glove kept slapping people and i was getting blamed."
14119,Homer,not any more...
25842,Homer,"lucky, shmucky. i knocked her up. but she's stuck now -- we're married, till death do us part. but if i died, she'd be completely free. for man or machine."
30198,Homer,the smoke will wake us up.
34448,Homer,the government. taking my hard-earned stolen wine and spending it on that no-good floor.
14759,Homer,"well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies. they taste as good as they look. and they come in this delicious red sauce. it looks like catsup -- it tastes like ketchup. but brother it ain't ketchup!"
29967,Homer,"lisa, take a picture of me with all the milkshakes. c'mon, everybody get in here. hurry."
23130,Homer,thanks.
34794,Homer,"oh, come on! just a second..."
39698,Homer,where is it. the game... where is it?
23773,Homer,and the exits are sealed! go to plan b!
17537,Homer,and i don't believe in it. it breaks up families.... turns wives against husbands... children against fathers... neighbors against me. you don't have to pay some fancy psychiatrist ten bucks an hour to get top notch therapy.
31079,Homer,marge?
37610,Homer,they taught me something i found shocking: pigs aren't happy to be made into pork chops. this t-shirt lied to me!
35596,Homer,"okay, stupid flanders, first i want you to kill that guy at the ice cream parlor who gave homer simpson a cone that had a little air in it."
38081,Homer,it doesn't matter. i'm taking it pass-fail.
36640,Homer,pushy sign! don't tell me what to try!
36482,Homer,are you gonna do that every time i open one of these?
41513,Homer,bom bom bom bom
15987,Homer,oh. thanks.
19367,Homer,... is it... wah?
29564,Homer,go seminoles! cover-the-point-spread! cover-the-point-spread!
19106,Homer,wow! my boss!
27730,Homer,but the book said you would applaud my initiative.

16734,Homer,"good. listen, i'm sick of your boring space launches. now i'm just an ordinary blue collar slob, but i know what i likes on tv..."
28681,Homer,"as i've always said: ""publish or perish""!"
25335,Homer,"hm, you seem less disgusted. let's go!"
25609,Homer,i'm sorry. i thought he was a party robot.
20122,Homer,"mmmm. now, what do you have to wash that awful taste out of my mouth?"
25590,Homer,"so, i notice your home smells of feces."
13730,Homer,pfft. i make more than that.
38128,Homer,"lisa got to you. i don't know how, but she got to you."
35154,Homer,woo hoo!
16625,Homer,"ahh, the morning horoscope. ""today will be a day like every other day."" it just gets worse and worse."
36296,Homer,"oh, i believe you, but flanders' drill doesn't."
15638,Homer,what's the matter?
21218,Homer,perfect.
32694,Homer,twister! get down!

22343,Homer,woo hoo! homer simpson with the pick!
17978,Homer,"sweet maiden of the spit, grant now my boon, that i mightst sup on suckling pig this noon."
14203,Homer,"phew, good."
33207,Homer,"right, right. but will it happen this time?"
29116,Homer,because somehow you realized i was a good guy after all?
35300,Homer,"boy, get down from there!"
26459,Homer,aren't you forgettin' someone?
41027,Homer,hel-lo? hel-lo einstein? i said a place to put my drink. you know those super slakers they sell at the kwik-e-mart? the cup is this big!

39480,Homer,"now, look, you know and i know this family needs help. professional help. so i made us an appointment with dr. marvin monroe."
28873,Homer,that's my girl!
13329,Homer,how do i look?
19839,Homer,"what's the matter, marge? i thought you loved jello shooters."

24353,Homer,"yeah, but in what ratio?"
18938,Homer,please identify this object.
20526,Homer,"actually, it's more like twelve. no, i'm so stupid, seven. it's seven hours. you have seven hours. see? seven."
37723,Homer,"majestic eagle... just like me, unashamed of his baldness."
36086,Homer,forget it. we don't need some big city bartender chargin' us an arm and a leg for something we can do ourselves.
15032,Homer,"ha, ha, you lose! 36 and 239!"
20090,Homer,"so you lost my car, eh? well, that's just grand. i ought to punch you in the nose, but i have to pick up my kids at school."
26310,Homer,mm hmm.
14756,Homer,i am not.
17373,Homer,i feel like a kid in some kind of a store.
23686,Homer,not any more!
19485,Homer,earl. my new friend's name is earl!
29316,Homer,"yes, but he came here to die."
13668,Homer,yesssss! oh yessss! read it and weep. in your face. i've got more chicken bone!
37046,Homer,"we made it, boy!"
23250,Homer,why don't you just tell everybody?
39304,Homer,"i didn't get my christmas bonus. i tried not to let it ruin christmas for everybody, but no matter what i did, i just couldn't --"
38076,Homer,go! go! go!
33564,Homer,cool it -- she's getting suspicious.
39242,Homer,"what's with the crazy getup, barn?"
41020,Homer,you think i work well with others?
33997,Homer,better call dr. hibbert.
31574,Homer,watch me drive a golf ball off the bow!
37442,Homer,what the hell is that?
30366,Homer,uh... this is still part of your dream. dreaming... dreaming... now you're awake.
40738,Homer,i haven't seen you in school before.
34476,Homer,i'll serve anything but the communityyy!
15233,Homer,"gonna run out the clock in florida, eh?"
40454,Homer,"oh, cruel fate. why do you mock me?"
22409,Homer,okay.
19163,Homer,"look, marge! they opened a new high-tech gadget store! you love high-tech gadgets!"
26419,Homer,doesn't matter. they have free health care.
27058,Homer,i don't remember anybody telling me i was gonna be on tv.
18377,Homer,oh my.
28949,Homer,"why did i take it off? oh, right. to see if i could skip it across lake michigan."
15237,Homer,"hello, what's this? wire hangers! expired medicine! old newspapers! okay homer, stay calm. just quietly get this stuff inside your house."
29491,Homer,i'm off!
39196,Homer,no! an injustice has gone on here for too long.
20102,Homer,"marge, i can't feel my legs!"
27023,Homer,i can't believe it. hibbert's turned you all into human guinea pigs!
15644,Homer,he's my little brother. that's right -- you're not the only one who can abuse a non-profit organization.
24695,Homer,hmm. it's gonna take a lot of fireworks to clean this place up.
31521,Homer,we're not keeping that moocher in this house another minute!
30242,Homer,professor pigskin told me to bet on the raiders but they look awful.
24968,Homer,"really. hey, maybe we could do that again. can you look even more pathetic?"
15342,Homer,uh... all of them. they're having a party. jimmy carter's passed out on the couch.
30276,Homer,moe! will you get off the line!
24365,Homer,"""in an average week, how many braised ribs do you eat?"" marge, do you think that counts honey-braised?"
30203,Homer,"no meat?! what do they eat, light bulbs?"
41042,Homer,"no! no! no! bad dog! let go! bad santa's little helper! stop it! no, not the sports section! no!"
24275,Homer,huh?
35752,Homer,"oh, that is so untroll-y!"
26982,Homer,"i mean, four!"
17082,Homer,"honey, the door blew shut! oh. fine. that's what you want? you got it. this scene is gettin' old, man. i'm hittin' the road. maybe i'll drop you a line someday from wherever i wind up in this crazy old world."
24228,Homer,yeah!
19472,Homer,"oh, honey, i didn't get drunk. i just went to a strange fantasy world. c'mon, you gotta believe me. you're my soul mate."
21937,Homer,freedom...
32456,Homer,"hm. i guess considering all the training you've received, this is quite reasonable. i've never seen anything so reasonable! it's the bargain of a lifetime! and--"
17303,Homer,mustn't crush. mustn't kill. made it!
31567,Homer,"uh... i thought today was opposite day. by the way, you're very ugly. it's opposite day."
29070,Homer,i can't do this in front of lisa. why does she have to believe in things?
22817,Homer,"well, if you'll follow the flashlight, you'll see the receipt embedded here and here... and elements of the box here, here, and possibly here."
32827,Homer,have you got lou in your car?
22262,Homer,boooo!
33701,Homer,"you know, i think milhouse is ""el barto."" hmmmm."
16272,Homer,fine! i can have a great time all by myself!
23827,Homer,leprosy? i can't believe it! that fortune cookie was right.
19984,Homer,"well, i am mr. sparkle!"
21146,Homer,but i can't leave the country! what about my wife and kids?
26578,Homer,...i will eat this toblerone / and i will not pay!
20433,Homer,"now while i wasn't able to cut everyone i wanted to, i have cut a lot of you. wendell is cut. rudy is cut. janey, you're gone. steven, i like your hustle. that's why it was so hard to cut you."
26365,Homer,"oh my god, it's our high school prom! and once again i have no date!"
36507,Homer,"boy, if anyone needs me i'll be taking a popcorn bath. it's a thing i read about in a men's health magazine in a dream."
36816,Homer,gotta eat the rest!
35949,Homer,"no, no, john hancock! i don't need insurance! sam adams, i'm sorry i made fun of your winter ale!"
38640,Homer,what the hell was that?!
41181,Homer,"it's for you, marge. from merry old england."
27605,Homer,"mars, eh? hmmm, i see no evidence of water."
34783,Homer,"they should call this one ""recipe for murder."""
35780,Homer,"wow, i can't believe i'm eating steak with the mayor. the next time i vote for you it's gonna be on purpose."
22810,Homer,stupid lisa.
28026,Homer,"stupid walking, thighs chafing horribly, no drink holder. i miss my car so much -- everyone's driving but me!"
26718,Homer,why that little...
20040,Homer,i'll do it. to professionalism!
40142,Homer,don't be so stubborn! we're not talking about a few dollars! we're talking about a few thousand dollars!
27260,Homer,that lenny sure had a crazy apartment.
31556,Homer,"blue pinwheel, red pinwheel, big white ball, wait for the ""aaahhh..."""
30834,Homer,"no one turn on the sprinklers, okay?"
22876,Homer,ow! hey! no! no! ow! n-no! ow!
37734,Homer,"now, listen... i have to work late tonight."
14305,Homer,"listen, boy, this is a great invention! watch."

38348,Homer,threat perceived. terminate! terminate!
21476,Homer,bart! yes.
29749,Homer,dammit!
24225,Homer,"okay, now do moe."
27430,Homer,"no, i'm good."
37542,Homer,"boy, oh boy!"
26698,Homer,"all my other senses are getting sharper. bart, you had pizza for lunch. lisa, you're extremely depressed."
28361,Homer,"bart, we made her the same thing!"
19216,Homer,"ooh, let's pick him up!"
16950,Homer,okay. lisa quit getting in the way of your wealthy brother's peas.
14626,Homer,but marge! it looks so easy! just like carving a turkey.
16006,Homer,"oh my god, someone's trying to kill me! oh wait, it's for bart."
34197,Homer,"uh-oh, here comes a train."
28018,Homer,save me chaka khan! chaka khannnn!
20735,Homer,gimme ten rings.
35336,Homer,boy that's good.
37527,Homer,"hey, what could be cooler than a choo-choo with lollipops on it?"
29772,Homer,"my rv is gone! it was more than a motor home. it was a car i could go to the bathroom in. hey, a note."
35113,Homer,"i can't talk now, i'm talking to myself! no, no, homer, go ahead. thanks, homer, it'll just be a minute. what's up?"
19464,Homer,carl?
29576,Homer,"you did it on the straight, got your dad's permission / but your mom dropped a bomb, so i flipped my position"
34776,Homer,"marge, can i have a word with you in private?"
31982,Homer,i'm so sick of being lost. to hell with maze etiquette! i'm walking straight outta here!
26388,Homer,"oh, i can't take his money... i can't print my own money... i have to work for money... why don't i just lie down and die?"
16035,Homer,bartdoyouwantsomebrowniesbefore yougotobed?!
39428,Homer,"i'm trying to get at least some of the unfortunate noises out of my system while i can, marge. i don't want to embarrass myself at the company picnic."
30794,Homer,will you tell me a story?
23767,Homer,i think what lisa meant to say is...
32601,Homer,hmmm... the only thing that still doesn't make sense is why the dog attacked me.
15096,Homer,ew. dog water.
23148,Homer,i mean lisa.
23624,Homer,"hi, honey!"
15983,Homer,oh man.
29499,Homer,"oh, it's true. i don't know marge at all. i'll just go home now."
32552,Homer,how 'bout the deja viewmaster?
31083,Homer,you idiot!
37825,Homer,that's our girl.
21808,Homer,ron howard?!
30845,Homer,"oh, you're so right. i guess i should be more concerned with bart's safety than covering my own butt. and maybe i'm talking like this because i can't stop. help me, lisa! i have serious mental problems!"
27560,Homer,"why you little...! um, i'm sorry, judge. that's a rare lapse in my normally calm demeanor."
31313,Homer,writing's for nerds.
17761,Homer,"okay, if you're that worried about it, let's go down to the bomb shelter."
28978,Homer,remember our honeymoon?
22282,Homer,"hey, a baseball field! batter up!"
35697,Homer,here it is: 1501 east oak. no name on the door -- very trendy.
24456,Homer,didn't you ever go to camp? the ol' vitamin barn...
14843,Homer,"marge, there's an empty spot i've always had inside me. i tried to fill it with family, religion, community service. but those were dead ends. i think this chair is the answer."
34366,Homer,"seatbelts, kids!"
22750,Homer,"well, son. i guess it's time to go home."
26341,Homer,"that's okay, marge, you're a good wet blanket. the kind i like wrapped around me."
19929,Homer,"laddie! c'mere, boy! who want to lick a messy baby?"
38596,Homer,safety first.
36240,Homer,"mr. burns, before i leave, i've got a few things to get off my chest: one: i liked the new microwave in the break room -- just push ""popcorn"". you don't have to know how long. two: replacing us with robots is heartless and despicable. three: how about a farewell party with a caricature artist? you know, it's something both kids and adults can enjoy. so to sum up: nicely-done, we hate you, and food for thought."
16113,Homer,i got it! we're gonna fix it so you guys save the dean's life.
37739,Homer,"who's president now, alexander hamilton?"
23367,Homer,"bart, spooky roller disco."
39849,Homer,oh no.
39252,Homer,"oh, i knew that one, too."
26278,Homer,eww. i touched it. over.
14962,Homer,"hello, this is homer simpson."
18466,Homer,this is my room. this is my dresser. it's where i keep my shirts when i'm not wearing them.
27403,Homer,you're charging how much for a room?
37859,Homer,"what the-- ""the simpson bed and breakfast?"" i always wanted to stay in a place like this!"
16175,Homer,i think i'm blind.
32196,Homer,but i can only sing lying on my back.
19307,Homer,boring!
16442,Homer,arr - see ya tomorrow.
23671,Homer,"free baby cola? apu hits the jackpot, and i'm stuck with these useless one-tuplets."
20161,Homer,and why are the kids here?
15909,Homer,uh-oh.
34887,Homer,"come on out, birdie! follow the sound of my voice-voice-voice."
29298,Homer,really? frankfurter... is that anything?
15230,Homer,"gotcha. marge, we're gettin' some drive-thru then we're doin' it twice."
17682,Homer,woo hoo!
35962,Homer,it's not working... but why?
40126,Homer,homer marge
18081,Homer,"aw, thanks, honey."
35118,Homer,oh i know.
16148,Homer,"oooh, tough crowd. better bring out the big guns. here's an impression of mr. burns that you might find... a little cheeky."
16717,Homer,"i'm a white male, aged eighteen to forty-nine. everyone listens to me! no matter how dumb my suggestions are."
35892,Homer,and don't wake me up to land!
34812,Homer,"whoa, you blood-sucking freaks love your kids too?"
40255,Homer,rub it in.
20265,Homer,you want me? come and get me!!
17470,Homer,ow!
17592,Homer,huh?
24611,Homer,good idea.
24666,Homer,woo! rock 'n' roll!
37797,Homer,"okay, i know what'll cheer you kids up. seeing me out-monkey the monkeys."
34280,Homer,hm...
16105,Homer,"look! you pull its tail straight and it curls right back up again. curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight, curly, straight..."
24690,Homer,"oh, don't worry. you'll be sleeping in this beautiful new doghouse. target date: january, 2007."
35701,Homer,"i guess i'll get started before my family gets here. how much for a taste, you know, just to get me going?"
27991,Homer,"now let me think. how did that beautiful young naked lady in ""jaws"" make it out alive?"
20777,Homer,hmm. makes sense.
26667,Homer,"oh, yeah. get out."
23464,Homer,"oh, that's just superstition."
21388,Homer,hello.
41204,Homer,"hey, good evening, hezron, carver of graven images."
23222,Homer,you know it. plus he gave me this appointment dealy.
23862,Homer,"oh, that's it. you're through, dean!"
37462,Homer,"hey, what's this? ""i've gone home. goodbye forever, carl carlson."""
31068,Homer,so beautiful. i wish i could understand italian.
13891,Homer,"ha ha, you love me."
26047,Homer,"ah. and now to read my fortune. ""geese can be troublesome."" what the hell is that supposed to mean?"
40396,Homer,"hey, flanders, it's no use praying. i already did the same thing, and we can't both win."
32025,Homer,"all right, everybody. squeeze in real tight."
22873,Homer,what the?! who the?! hey!
40487,Homer,"i mean it, boy."
34782,Homer,"well, we'd better do it quick. because he's making scones!"
39339,Homer,the hook goes over the top and these things go in there.
36200,Homer,"oh death, you're a lifesaver!"
32803,Homer,later.
30300,Homer,wha...?!
36946,Homer,can't i keep an eye on that kid? he's fabulous.
15970,Homer,"baby on board / something, something burt ward... this thing writes itself!"
23858,Homer,"oh, this is gonna be so great."
32104,Homer,"i had it all for one night. now for the rest of my life i'll know what i'm missing. and all i have to remember it by is that my ears haven't popped. well, i'll make sure that i never yawn again."
26022,Homer,as soon as you finish cutting up those lemons.
33148,Homer,"you're just as bad as me. and you used to be better, so that makes you worse! i don't think we can ever trust each other again."
33085,Homer,take me with you!
19851,Homer,now don't say that! alcohol is a way of life. alcohol is my way of life. and i aim to keep it!
31091,Homer,and her?
26994,Homer,"yeah, it's a good group."
21336,Homer,huh?... wha ya?... hey! you guys are dragging me up the mountain.
36331,Homer,"the lava being! that's why they showed a clip of it on ""previously on."""
22535,Homer,lousy message.
40412,Homer,"stop it, you two! this is thanksgiving! so glue friendly, or i'll take your glue away and then no one will have any glue to glue with!"
13627,Homer,wake-up call? it's two am!
36595,Homer,umm... no thanks.
25028,Homer,uh-oh.
16426,Homer,mindy has a motorcycle.
27493,Homer,"ugh, where's the remote?"
29764,Homer,that's no marriage bed -- it's a loveless slab of bossiness!
13918,Homer,stable? that sounds expensive.
33234,Homer,"milhouse is lookin' good -- he's got contacts, changed color, got a cool new catchphrase... salaam alaikum!"
26434,Homer,"hey boy, where'd you get that hat?"
20029,Homer,i 'unno. don't ask me how the economy works.
40167,Homer,"listen, you big stupid space creature. nobody, but nobody eats the simpsons."
27303,Homer,"marge, this is a way to flush this killer out once and for all -- and get drunk on a tuesday."
40181,Homer,ouch! censer..
34414,Homer,what? but i thought we'd be neighbors in heaven. goofing on all the new dead people...
41198,Homer,she said that?
13233,Homer,"at the end of a hard day, there's no better feeling than comin' home to the people you love."
40379,Homer,"oh, yeah? wanna bet?"
36560,Homer,"and if anyone finds this footage after we're all missing or dead, remember me as a hero."
30643,Homer,everyone remember where we parked.
24040,Homer,bees!
14401,Homer,"believe me, marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this."
13280,Homer,first over cliff.
29419,Homer,dad?
32301,Homer,"okay, i get it. i'm not stupid. it's number two, right?"
15364,Homer,why you little...
25013,Homer,"yeah. we're not criminals. we're just two crazy, mixed-up kids."
23664,Homer,and that's my cue to exit.
36748,Homer,"marge, in a crisis like this, i need time for quiet contemplation."
23804,Homer,"come on, ""bikini inspector!"" ""scrub toilet?"" okay, that was a practice. practice... practice... okay, here we go. ""feed fish."""
38197,Homer,oh... crap.
16124,Homer,mora wuza?
18856,Homer,"oh, owls, eh? so you probably wouldn't want to spend another day at work with me..."
27949,Homer,only if it's an affront to god.
38905,Homer,"captain's log, star date: six-five-eight-four-eight point two. after successfully conquering the rigelians..."
33750,Homer,well i hope your son enjoys being driven around by the president of the united states.
22366,Homer,"hit the road, gramps. this is a private sky box."
29028,Homer,"whatcha doin', sweetie?"
27370,Homer,"well... if hiring this guy will make lisa like me again, then i'll do it! can i get this beer to go?"
37061,Homer,found another one.
29811,Homer,how come nobody told me before?
20293,Homer,"nobody likes a tattletale, honey."
38849,Homer,look! i see land!
35976,Homer,"marge, if you were married to da vinci, you wouldn't tell him not to da vinch."
14701,Homer,"well, right now she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress. but she's going to be a country music superstar like... uh... that jerk in the cowboy hat... and that dead lady."
15387,Homer,"all right, you win round seven."
16441,Homer,"well, this is my floor."
40640,Homer,be intimate with marge.
36708,Homer,bart! this is america. anyone can eat what they want as long as they eat too much.
13539,Homer,"son, it's no different than the time i let you vote for me. remember that absentee ballot?"
22414,Homer,"uh, so, i just want to know how come you made your homer simpson character so..."
39050,Homer,when you're sixteen i'll drive you to cincinnati. and you'll see what there is to see.
35511,Homer,"maybe i was a little hard on him, expecting him to be larry right away. by the way, where is larry?"
13164,Homer,"hey, you're right. give it back! no, i still want you to have it. but every time you smash a nerd with it, think of me."
37340,Homer,the minister's wife? what are you here for?
25038,Homer,let's see where he's going with this...
28463,Homer,"duck, mr. lincoln!"
41477,Homer,"okay, that's not so great."
35398,Homer,"all day long they tell me stupid, pointless, boring stories, and i have to stand there listening with a phony grin plastered on my face."
34959,Homer,i can't go undercover with fat tony. he's met me. i've been in his house. i was briefly his consiglieri... consugly... canolli... robert duvall.

19998,Homer,wow. you've got pencils with your name on 'em. just like a pencil company executive. i'd give anything for one of these.
30053,Homer,"kids, wanna go to the mall?! they're baking fresh cinnabons... which means they're throwing out the old ones!"
20021,Homer,marge -- perfect. bart -- perfect. other kid -- perfect.

29008,Homer,"ah, that's better. so why do they call this place niagara falls anyway?"
14413,Homer,"oh, every note is like a dagger in my heart. i gotta get outta here."
24552,Homer,"let's see, good deed..."
35852,Homer,"yeah, after i stopped drinking, this was a way to stay close to my bottles."
21818,Homer,"and lift, and strain, and hy-per-extend, keep those knees rigid, jerk that lower back..."
40863,Homer,"pass the pumice, please."
17919,Homer,"sir, today every country has a national anthem. did they have national anthems two thousand years ago?"
22470,Homer,i can't lose them!
32517,Homer,"a doctor, huh?"
22295,Homer,"so, marge, ready for another episode of ""don't go there""?"
37048,Homer,the tornado took old what's-his-name! i'm going after him!
17336,Homer,"okay, son, just remember to have fun out there today, and if you lose, i'll kill you."
19579,Homer,"marge needs help, and god knows, i'm not the man to provide it. but i know who can..."
34244,Homer,fine. let me just get my harness pads.
23787,Homer,uh-oh.
27442,Homer,"oh, like i'm gonna kick chief wiggum in the groin."
30320,Homer,yes... but i've got a friend who owes me a solid.
24563,Homer,"oh, who am i kidding? i'm not merry."

33080,Homer,"aw come on, gravity. you used to be cool!"
40273,Homer,"for the first time in my life, people weren't laughing at me, they were laughing towards me."
28133,Homer,"yeah, it's great that she's got a father-figure in her life. she--hey wait, that's supposed to be me!"
40367,Homer,"do you wanna try a little harder, son? come on, give it a girl's name."
18352,Homer,"hey, wait... ""hyper-obesity."" ""if you weigh more than 300 pounds, you qualify as disabled."""
17382,Homer,"see you in hell, candy boys."
26742,Homer,"well son, i wanna show you how grateful i am. let's go fishing."
15367,Homer,"nooo! bart, don't you ever do that again. understand?"
21780,Homer,"what? oh, already?"
33299,Homer,you're the nerd.
41068,Homer,"well, my faithful dog was bringing me my shoes and they fell apart in his mouth."
22013,Homer,you just sit back and relax. i'm not gonna let anything happen to my old dad.
17230,Homer,parents island?
14707,Homer,"thanks. you did say sugar, right?"
38007,Homer,this is a violation of our human rights.
38314,Homer,wow. wow. that looks just like the dress you wore on project runway.
18658,Homer,"no, you're gonna get trouble."
18247,Homer,sure.
16400,Homer,why couldn't i be on one of the smart rafts. i bet they're having the time of their life.
16972,Homer,that is true.
39471,Homer,"no, no. i want to be alone with my thought."
29561,Homer,"welcome to the ""homer simpson showboating academy."""
26409,Homer,"hello, gentlemen. would you care to meet my new best friend..."
19969,Homer,okay. who's up for some scrounging?
25958,Homer,i'm having chest pains!
23440,Homer,lousy show-offs.
33107,Homer,"a really fun party? full of colored cheeses and awesome stuff to do? doesn't seem like your kind of thing, marge."
17064,Homer,"now what is a wedding? well, webster's dictionary describes a wedding as: 'the process of removing weeds from one's garden.'"
30546,Homer,"now, i will take your questions."
36031,Homer,"lisa, everyone knows dragons do not attack cars. jeez, pick up a book."
36429,Homer,no one likes you!
37114,Homer,why you little...
13577,Homer,marge!
15425,Homer,you know that feeling you get when a thousand knives of fire are stabbing you in the heart? i've got that right now. ooh... bacon!
33601,Homer,ireland doesn't like pubs anymore. it's as if danish people stopped liking sleek modern design.
31708,Homer,he's lying!
38727,Homer,"oh, i don't have what it takes to play guitar. i mean, i'm no joe walsh in the brains department."
22450,Homer,and i counted the pennies in the ashtray.
32072,Homer,woo--
32255,Homer,"yeah, it's paint."
29765,Homer,name one way i'm not!
30508,Homer,how you doin'? so... is that your jacket on the back of that chair?

16326,Homer,"checkmate, mr. trampoline."
31698,Homer,"all right, you lured me to your bay. now what sick game are you playing?"
25045,Homer,"heh, heh, heh. tremendous."
17234,Homer,"but marge, i was a political prisoner."
30902,Homer,maggie? she's in her crib.
35193,Homer,and i wouldn't have to pay it back for three more years! what are the odds of that much time happening?
22927,Homer,"now if i drop her, no more tears."
26750,Homer,"oh my god! i know you must get this all the time, but can i suggest a flavor?"
40855,Homer,"oh. hm, look at it this way. when you had breakfast this morning, did you pay for it?"
23309,Homer,"ah, not bad... if lasagna is italian for ""pile of puke."""
13825,Homer,"lisa, that was very selfish of you."
17989,Homer,"oh, right."
25988,Homer,huh?
37145,Homer,"agreed, but to win back our women we need to make a grand romantic gesture."
30725,Homer,"oh yeah?! you're going to that camp, 'cause i'm gonna drive you there."
33132,Homer,"i came here once with marge. are you marge, sylvia?"
29966,Homer,"milkshake festival. look, you can see the booths from your window."
34503,Homer,"ahhh, that is so much better than hospital beer."
24636,Homer,big grins!
15149,Homer,bart! why are you doing that?
26642,Homer,i said wiggum!
17686,Homer,and only one of you kids can go to college.
34135,Homer,"stay out of this, dad!"
26971,Homer,outstanding.
33297,Homer,"worms, bees, ticks, fleas... let's go, go, go!"
32752,Homer,i know you ate my jerky. just like i ate your earthquake supplies!
39781,Homer,starving.
26857,Homer,"hello?... uh-huh. yes mrs. bellamy, i'll be right there."
30390,Homer,mmm... homer-oats.
37565,Homer,i'm gonna have forty key chains! / and i don't even have forty keys! / swag!
18885,Homer,there. done and done.
41296,Homer,...until she changes her mind.
24921,Homer,that's impossible. all my stories are bull plop. bull plop!
24838,Homer,uh... i guess i'll take that one.
21064,Homer,"damage report, mr. moe."
37568,Homer,i still haven't forgiven you for putting that dead goat in my bed!
27513,Homer,"ooh, you coughed up some dry wall."
30058,Homer,left below?! where have i heard that before?
39665,Homer,"okay, okay. this time i'll just go into those bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. when he comes out, you step on him."
27612,Homer,"hey, who doesn't?"
39024,Homer,i gotcha!
24705,Homer,"okay, that stings daddy's eyes, honey."
32727,Homer,"listen, baby. the other night was great, but it can never happen again. oh, who am i kidding? i have to see you right now!"
37194,Homer,i'll give it one marathon.
25440,Homer,"i don't mind being called a liar when i'm lying, or about to lie, or just finished lying. but not when i'm telling the truth."
15619,Homer,"hey, boy! where you going?"
16438,Homer,"that's okay. i'll just push the button for the stimulator, i mean elevator."
23365,Homer,"okay, marge, you hide in the abandoned amusement park."
34363,Homer,"thanks to our new g.p.s., i'll have you at school in no time."
32046,Homer,i'm gonna glue my mouth shut with butterscotch!
33233,Homer,disposed of them in an environmentally friendly manner!
36775,Homer,"will you kids pipe down! i'm trying to get ""churro-chaser"" to tell me where the freshest churros are. what country is mexico in?"
24795,Homer,anti-polio.
16291,Homer,"i miss you, marge."
18119,Homer,"marge, how did you know..."
33612,Homer,"but i ask you, who does smoking actually hurt, except the smokers, those around them, and the unborn children of the pregnant women we let in free on expectant mothers drink free night?"
14987,Homer,and you remember... matthew... 21:17.
18193,Homer,"oh, maggie. i got nothing against maggie."
25396,Homer,"yeah, you're right."
30461,Homer,but i'm watching television. a lot of people worked hard on this show!
18138,Homer,sorry.
19245,Homer,we've gotta find someplace no one will ever go. hel-lo!
29180,Homer,"yo, i'll tell you what i want, what i really really want... what i want what i want i'll tell you what i..."
13916,Homer,i've got it all figured out. by day it will roam free around the neighborhood. and at night it will nestle snugly between the cars in our garage.
15460,Homer,"now let me tell you something, mr. sucker... i just..."
35777,Homer,"i am really enjoying this, but, um... hello! meeting with the mayor?"
15530,Homer,do you want to change your name to homer junior? the kids can call you hoju!
34773,Homer,"o-kay, this guy's taken care of so, uh, you know..."
34159,Homer,...and that lasted about five years. but then godzilla dropped out for a while to do movies. all of the awful movies we see now today in the drive-ins that no longer exist.
33102,Homer,"eat gravel, hags!"
32907,Homer,that's it.
36194,Homer,i know this dream! it's the land of my innermost thoughts and fondest desires!
25949,Homer,"the bridge column. oh, that south. you never know what he'll do next. hm... aw. look at that dad in ""drabble."" he's like an unfunny version of me."
24414,Homer,"the only thing we can do. sit tight, and try to get some sleep."
33987,Homer,"i'll save you, marge!"
23670,Homer,mmm... ovulicious.
31570,Homer,"dear marge, how are you? i am fine. the waves here are way bigger than the ones at home. and the salt water is rising. what's next? pepper water? ha ha. love ya, homer simpson."
34817,Homer,yes! i can fly! see you back at the house!
24772,Homer,"marge, your posture looks terrible."
34925,Homer,"someday tv will be invented, and it will be free. then it will cost money."
22734,Homer,"look, son. it's one of nature's most beautiful sights -- the convoy."
30491,Homer,is there a super bowl bunny?
32514,Homer,yes.
17262,Homer,"hm, not a drop in the house. what do you know?"
24055,Homer,"hey, t-shirt- t-shirt-t-shirt!"

22991,Homer,"oh, right."
13174,Homer,snake!
40437,Homer,"hello, operator? gimme the number for 911!"
14083,Homer,"hey, moe?"
28099,Homer,"let's see. what native american activities should we do? making wallets... faking crop circles... respecting nature... jeez, no wonder these guys lost the civil war."
37464,Homer,"come on, you know how dudes are. we don't go digging into the past. we talk about guy stuff."
39399,Homer,proud. proud of what?
22430,Homer,"max power / he's the man / whose name you'd love to touch / but you mustn't touch / his name sounds good in your ear / but when you say it, you mustn't fear / 'cause his name can be said by anyone..."
16252,Homer,i'm going to have these things on my arms forever!
37880,Homer,"they're talking about the movie! hurry up, you idiot! no, no, don't stop! i'm sorry i got mad. i'll do that thing you like."
15785,Homer,who keeps saying that?
29614,Homer,"hm. well, maybe marriage isn't just for gays. what's that thing called when a guy is gay for a girl?"
15816,Homer,get 'em off me! get 'em off me! get 'em off me!
13404,Homer,whoa! holy mackerel!
23089,Homer,"do ""ow that hurts."""
14826,Homer,"yeah. you know, my life just can't get any worse."
21315,Homer,"hello, handsome. nice muscles. care for a rubdown? oh-ho, well, i'm flattered, but spoken for. oh, what the heck, give me your number."
40146,Homer,they are all against me! they all must die!
27194,Homer,wait for what? confirmation of my attitude?
30485,Homer,i was in a pie-eating contest on the way home. now let's go to bed.
36917,Homer,"that's short for ""rrright you are!"""
36639,Homer,another thing that would be harder with four kids.
19552,Homer,"yeah, me too."
32263,Homer,but it's just you and me... that must mean i'm your boss. i'm sick of you! you're fired!
36070,Homer,ever since the day we met.
22086,Homer,"mr. hamill, mr. mayor, come on!"
28841,Homer,"well yeah, legally. but if we're really best friends, how come we never play hoops?"
22475,Homer,what?
13400,Homer,"go ahead, general sherman! waste your strength, you big ugly catfish. i gotta skillet and a stick of butter with your name on it."
21792,Homer,"okay, fine. but i could do all kinds of stuff for you. i noticed that skylight in your bedroom's broken."
33597,Homer,our first sale!
27202,Homer,"not at all, sweetie. at least one of us should be able to put their arms around the other one."
30214,Homer,"uh, listen, is it true you priest guys can't ever... you know..."
32802,Homer,"and he has hair! bart, get me my suicide axe."

22524,Homer,not if i can help it. and help it i might.
15206,Homer,"march 15... i wish i'd brought a tv. oh god, how i miss tv."
32035,Homer,why you little...
15141,Homer,"all right, all right. young man, since you broke grampa's teeth -- he gets to break yours."
33715,Homer,"oh, this is great, honey. thanks for telling me about it. i hope you don't mind i invited lenny."
30142,Homer,"come on flanders, doesn't that ""bible"" of yours say to ""love thy neighbor""? why won't you love me?"
23076,Homer,"hey, that's mine!"
24339,Homer,"oh, yes i can!"

40264,Homer,c'mon! all we need is a grand slam.
35540,Homer,"your voice is so gravelly, just like lauren bacall's."
25140,Homer,"comfy, isn't it?"
41542,Homer,"hey, i worked hard all day to pay for your education. can't i get all zima-ed up and have my best girl put salve on my laser burns?"
35485,Homer,"i've got some bad news for you, marge. i'm actually not."
24729,Homer,i like your attitude. take what you need.
24731,Homer,"take that, lisa's beliefs."
29159,Homer,"well, kids, this is the first chapter of our brand new lives... in america."
31100,Homer,all right. just this once you can take a drink out of my special water bottle.
21656,Homer,yay! / all right! / woo-hoo! /
36911,Homer,"whoa, now i've gotta buy a corpse wagon. that's how they getcha."
31630,Homer,"it takes time to make a revenge machine this awesome! plus, in the middle, i had to take revenge on some of my contractors."

23770,Homer,i like the ones where the mouse kills the cat.
28055,Homer,"oh, i love to perambulate / it's standing still i really hate / so let me please reiterate / i love to..."
14990,Homer,you know what i really hate about church? those boring sermons.
28889,Homer,that woman means the world to me. would it be all right if i read from my bible?
28705,Homer,"don't worry about those losers, marge. i think it's time we went home and collaborated on a little project of our own."
16981,Homer,what does sequestered mean?
36134,Homer,what the--

23376,Homer,absolutely.
20393,Homer,"it's gone for good, marge. i finally realized, what's the point of having a gun for protection if you've got no one to protect?"
20481,Homer,not... really...
38071,Homer,at least someone in this family is using them.

35266,Homer,"son, i'm really, really sorry."
38516,Homer,"awaiting your orders, mr. midshipman!"
37668,Homer,"hello, bear stearns? i'd like to sell all my apple stock so i can buy a fancy bowling ball. you heard me. technology is a fad. heavy blue balls are the future."
26760,Homer,why do you always take the side of local merchants?
36182,Homer,"kids, there's something i have to tell you -- your mother and i are wetting the bed."
34246,Homer,not if i tell her first.
39088,Homer,"they taught me that i don't need to lose weight, i should just be proud of what i am."
41147,Homer,"this old attic's kinda spooky, isn't it boy. i said, isn't it, boy?"
26372,Homer,"i saw something terrible, and i can't even say it so i'll have these two dolls do it for me."
32477,Homer,"i sure have. plastic surgery is a mistake -- because it hasn't been perfected to where you look really good. when it is, everyone should get it."
26445,Homer,"bart, i couldn't help noticing buck is a total fraud. so i took the liberty of creating a new hero for your wall."
19374,Homer,use your main finger on the yellow side and your other finger on the orange side and turn it.
15263,Homer,so you think i have a case?
37928,Homer,all i ever had was you looking out for me. i've got nothin' now.

38199,Homer,now let's play human foosball!
15679,Homer,"let me handle this, marge. i've heard 'em all. ""i like you as a friend,"" ""i think we should see other people,"" i no speak english""..."
20932,Homer,huh?
27410,Homer,"well, all the childless drunks at moe's thought it was a great idea."
27479,Homer,"wow, i wonder what it would be like to be with a woman like that."
41435,Homer,now i'm gonna have to look at that every morning.
38922,Homer,when?!
13426,Homer,no.
31323,Homer,"eh, big deal -- by the time bart's eighteen, we're gonna control the world! we're china, right?"
16099,Homer,"but marge, we're college guys and we're up to no good..."
29726,Homer,"don't worry. if i croak, you'll marry lenny. or moe -- the winner will be determined by a card game i invented. i got all the rules written down... up here."
34315,Homer,i say this boy needs more homework.
22306,Homer,pfft. it wouldn't have made a difference.

36310,Homer,keep 'em comin'!
29938,Homer,"not if those gutters aren't clean, you don't."
39421,Homer,"friends, you have come to depend on me as your safety watchdog so you won't scrape yourself or stub your toes or blow yourselves up, but you can't depend on me all your lives. you have to learn that there's a little homer simpson in all of us."

30919,Homer,"yeah, you're right."
35503,Homer,"while i'm here, i might as well pre-punch out..."
34213,Homer,"oh barney, that's brilliant! just for that, you can help yourself to anything from this tree."
31062,Homer,"when a man and a woman love each other very much, they--"
35667,Homer,"okay, okay, how about this: next week, you take the kids on a saturday surprise dad day."
27150,Homer,"oh, it's red wire to red wire. what idiot dreamed that up?"

31726,Homer,"what are you doing here, patty-or-selma?"
31270,Homer,and now i give you... the zoominator!
33466,Homer,"because i have this magical thing called a home equity loan. i borrow all the money i want, and the house gets stuck with the bill. sucker."
38519,Homer,i got a bad sunburn and i was crapped on by a seagull / i don't see any lifeboats and i don't think that is legal
13835,Homer,"slowly... slowly... don't make a sound... don't even think, because he can hear your thoughts... then, when he's least expecting it, bash his head in with a chair. end of monster. heh heh heh."
15201,Homer,forget it. you're not the only foundation guy in town!
23038,Homer,"well, if you're not rich then how come you have a new refrigerator, an electric can opener, a milkshake machine..."
14196,Homer,but it gives me time to think.
35323,Homer,"hello, boat store? i'd like to order a boat. what do you mean, dial tone?"
14810,Homer,nah.
24858,Homer,"you'd think all the noises would be annoying, but they're not."

40775,Homer,"look, i'm not asking you to like me, i'm not asking you to put yourself in a position where i can touch your goodies, i'm just asking you to be fair."
13152,Homer,"ooh, a switchblade. i see the switch, but where's the blade?"

13743,Homer,"wait till i get you home, boy."
18883,Homer,forget the name homer simpson. have it sent care of... langdon alger.
38753,Homer,"well son, i do have the talent -- my mind is full of ideas for great songs i could write... down the names of and then cover. but then i remember: i'm just a regular guy, jamming with my buds."
35329,Homer,"hey, let me down! this is gonna leave a diamond pattern on my skin!"
27717,Homer,"tip two, ""let nothing stand in your way."""
35177,Homer,"come on, come on, make with the laffy juice! i wanna take grampa to have his bellybutton pierced."
16029,Homer,"wow, a houseboat! you know, the great thing is if you don't like your neighbors, you can just pull up the anchor and sail someplace else."
21314,Homer,"wow, wolfie. two months ago i didn't know what the word ""dumbbell"" meant. this place is great."
32230,Homer,"uh, i'm not sure she's workin' out."
26635,Homer,"oh my god, this dude does the best flanders! you got the mustache and the didilly... okay, now do wiggum."

22389,Homer,"marge, that was debbie pinson. deb-bie pin-son."
32312,Homer,"and to pay you back, i'm returning your nose."
14195,Homer,you mean like will apes be our masters?
23615,Homer,"i've been so blind. i'll lavish my attention on maggie, the forgotten simpson."
19000,Homer,"hi, everybody. is everybody... good?"

29868,Homer,"finally, a bar for men who like to drink and look at sexy women."
27951,Homer,"it's okay, bart. this track has been abandoned since nineteen -- uh-oh."
27805,Homer,"don't you think you're overreacting, talking gumball machine?"
32676,Homer,they were the bonnie and clyde of their day. their names were... bonnie and clyde.
34238,Homer,"up -- that's my chair, boy."

15534,Homer,what if i talk like this?
38742,Homer,"oh... yeah, apu, i'm sure you're a great singer. but the balance of the band is really delicate right now, and we're not really looking for a ""world music"" vibe. no disrespect to world music. i love world music."
26205,Homer,"oh, it's the woman i married in vegas!"
38096,Homer,"oh... i guess grampa's coming home with us. unless... what about that nice dog boarding place? the really good one, where they each have their own dog ""partner."""

17964,Homer,this contest is over. give that man the ten thousand dollars!
36501,Homer,parenting. it's the one job you always know you're doing right.
19151,Homer,"what?! we've got it great here. and for the first time in my life, i'm actually good at my job. my team is way ahead of the weather machine and germ warfare divisions."
38458,Homer,"then burn on you, 'cause you'll be holding onto a dead guy!"
18062,Homer,"lisa, honey, if you really want to preserve his memory, i recommend getting a tattoo. it preserves the things you love."
39607,Homer,wait till flanders gets a load of this.
28761,Homer,i'm taking you all out for tacos!
38656,Homer,"yeah! hey, uh, what's the robot version of bromance?"

31151,Homer,i stole a rack of fur coats. i sell one a year to pay for christmas.
21268,Homer,"oh no! wait, i think i've got the perfect solution."
26195,Homer,"here's how it's gonna go down. as a family, we drive away. we cover for each other -- as a family. it's what gabriel would have wanted."
22829,Homer,"uh... all right! just go ahead and sue me. everybody else does! the average settlement is $68,000."
22643,Homer,great. maybe on the way back we can swing by the demolition derby and have a nice talk.
38838,Homer,"oh, well, i've been faking the noise 'cause you deserve the best."
16354,Homer,that's what i've been saying. we're all fine the way we are.
26904,Homer,"oh. seriously, everyone says your parties rock."
32161,Homer,what? i'll show him. i'll show that guy!

28940,Homer,"don't worry, principal skinner."
37885,Homer,"bye bye, money!"
19074,Homer,"i guess you mean president clinton. he usually hangs around washington, d.c."
30838,Homer,sad? you're crazy. i feel like i'm at the oscars for the animals i forgot existed.
32957,Homer,"son, coin collecting's a lot like life. it stopped being fun a long time ago. but unlike life, i have a solution for this."
39924,Homer,"mmm, chocolate... oooh, double chocolate... new flavor! triple chocolate!"
32760,Homer,"awww, they're using the jerky to feed their family! look, there's a homer and a bart and a marge and a lisa. aww... and they even share my views on parenting!"
26666,Homer,get out.
20146,Homer,thanks for your patience!
33666,Homer,"that's ridiculous. who's your daddy, maggie? who's your daddy?"
25584,Homer,not a chance.
36909,Homer,i know what must have happened:
18494,Homer,"they didn't have any aspirin, so i got you some cigarettes."
28562,Homer,"wrong, lady! oh wait, the baby."

32553,Homer,remembrance of things fast?
23826,Homer,"help us, virtual doc! look at me! i'm on my knees!"

40610,Homer,good thing i'm open-minded.
34305,Homer,"the library? bart, can you believe we're married to those nerds?"
41544,Homer,are you by that joan miro statue?
20218,Homer,no need for potty mouth just because you can't think of one.
25337,Homer,up- bup...
34707,Homer,i would kill for that.
27986,Homer,"aww. there, there, boy. i'll help you get him back. he may have been a dirty, stinkin' coward, but show me a simpson that isn't."
24313,Homer,i'll scream.
22454,Homer,"anyway, marge. uh, how do you feel about the economy?"
38162,Homer,homer looks into marge's eyes.
16591,Homer,"lisa, the mob is working on getting your saxophone back, but we've also expanded into other important areas."
27718,Homer,"listen up, ""life obstacles."" from now on, nothing's gonna stand in homer simpson's way!"
24102,Homer,"that's right, ned. those floozies we married in vegas were crazy about you."
35089,Homer,i'll just use my eye.
16671,Homer,is he still out there?
21756,Homer,"so long, suckers!"
36137,Homer,"yes, master."

39383,Homer,"there must be some beer here somewhere... ah, maybe in here."
19129,Homer,all right... what's the number?
19172,Homer,big deal. i didn't even get my kid's belt back. the only thing a loser like me is good for is taking beatings.
32187,Homer,"well, you're always telling me i should eat more dirt."
18024,Homer,"aw, so that's what's been wrong with the little fella. he misses casual sex."
33436,Homer,this was due two weeks ago! i'm not insured! for the first time in my life i'm financially responsible for my own actions!
35673,Homer,"oh, and here's my favorite restaurant: ""la fridge!"" it's open twenty-four hours a day and there's no dress code!"

37820,Homer,"now get up here, boy! we're gonna do the super bowl shuffle."
27495,Homer,wait a minute. i'll do what flanders does.
21634,Homer,"oh, that. i stuck a couple of extra legs on there 'cause i kept tipping over when i was trying to invent stuff."
28008,Homer,"hands-free, eh? then i could give the brothers the black power salute."
37754,Homer,"for unto you is born this day, in this elevator, inspected in august 2009, a baby."
15854,Homer,"marge, ixnay on the uclear-nay ecnitian-tay."
30855,Homer,"why the hell would he want to do that... blessed sacrament that has made my life so rich? i like your hat, sweetie."
29213,Homer,"hmmm, i wonder if i could blow up heaven?"
20500,Homer,can you feel the love?
15948,Homer,"i'm surprised you don't remember, son. it was only eight years ago."
19557,Homer,"good work, son! we did it! we did it!"
27179,Homer,"aw, it sounds like all you're looking for is a little reassurance. well..."
33876,Homer,"whatever you say, sweetie."

34870,Homer,"and so the bloody hangman, his hair sticky with blood, skittered along the cobblestones, gunk dripping from his one good eye, singing his evil land chantey."
39874,Homer,he makes me crazy twelve months a year. at least you get the summer off.
29448,Homer,"hey, what's this lump?"
21684,Homer,i'unno. drug lab?
32644,Homer,i dig the wig! i dig the wig!
28000,Homer,"bart, are you okay?"
35901,Homer,not so fast!
26313,Homer,"and when i couldn't talk, i learned to listen."
34555,Homer,"marge, how hard can it be? we're just rolling it into the ocean from the beach. it's not like it's stuck in the bottom of a well or in a mexican prison."
37249,Homer,"give him one of your famous murmurs, marge."
24149,Homer,"does the word ""jet-lag"" mean anything to you people? ""jet-laggg""."
19038,Homer,"""wel-diddly-elcome simpsons."" oh, geez. he actually wrote ""diddly."""
18964,Homer,"now -- grand funk railroad paved the way for jefferson airplane, which cleared the way for jefferson starship. the stage was now set for the alan parsons project, which i believe was some sort of hovercraft..."
16437,Homer,i mean hello!
26745,Homer,"i love you, boy."

28174,Homer,"pardon me, comin' through, rest in peace, you're dead... take an dirt nap. feed the worms..."
26048,Homer,"well, i knew that before i came in here. a guy outside told me that."
19349,Homer,wait! i want one last chance to enjoy single life.
25914,Homer,why you little...
32750,Homer,this can only mean one thing.
28852,Homer,"two glasses of wine, moe."
27864,Homer,"calm down, picky ricardo. he made us a great breakfast, and you're just ridin' his butt... and not in a good way."
38102,Homer,"you just wanna see your old man trip and fall! well, sorry to disappoint you, lad, but, what the--"
26075,Homer,"well, this is my house. ah--"
28102,Homer,"but i was chosen by the great spirit to teach these young braves the ways of the antelope and the ear of corn... which we call maize... that the papoose... eh, i'll be at moe's talking normal."
39647,Homer,"well, might be a few. but don't worry about it. if you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone."
32781,Homer,"not keys, cigarettes!"
16615,Homer,"so, mr. molloy. it seems that the cat has been caught by the very person that was trying to catch him."
37922,Homer,consulate.
38503,Homer,you're my son and you will hate what i hate. angled parking. lemons. kickstarters by famous guys who already have lots of money. and this boat!
32718,Homer,wrong again.
39292,Homer,"come on, boy. sometimes your faith is all that keeps me going."
26638,Homer,now you know what i've been goin' through.
18482,Homer,"rhetorical, eh? eight."
32616,Homer,when you ask me that it's never good.
21117,Homer,"uhhhh, like those. but involving you."
37667,Homer,that's the coolest bowling ball i've ever seen.
36450,Homer,thou sayest it!
25567,Homer,"i've got more bones than that guy. if you're trying to impress me, you've failed."
30777,Homer,"mr. stern, would you make those glorious blue pants again if i whipped up public interest for them?"
41130,Homer,gimme me that money. ow! you're hurting me.

38232,Homer,thanks. i still can't believe the yellow and red cards don't stand for mustard and ketchup.
18376,Homer,woo hoo hoo hoo! i did it!
29075,Homer,was it the kiss?
40636,Homer,"hello, marge? hello? i'm the one who's dying, not you."
33237,Homer,"hey, bashir's great. if derek jeter married mariah carey, it wouldn't last, but i bet they'd have a kid like him."
21499,Homer,why don't you take a picture? it lasts longer.
41427,Homer,no.
36209,Homer,you left him because i tipped the boat over and ruined the vacation!
38176,Homer,don't worry. no one's gonna see this stupid show.
36876,Homer,i brought these people to springfield... and now they've taken over!
39518,Homer,"so you had a little scuffle, eh? hope you won."
34746,Homer,"hello, flanders. don't you have a neighbor on the other side?"
40702,Homer,there's no time to explain.
22938,Homer,clown.
35605,Homer,"assistant? well, i have been pretty overworked lately."
30235,Homer,"the broncos won?! why didn't i bet on them, like professor pigskin told me to?"
18744,Homer,"of course i do. you're always right about this type of thing, and for once, i want in on the ground floor."
28054,Homer,"i say ""of course i can -- screw you!"""
19860,Homer,nothin'.
26561,Homer,i said forget it!
35199,Homer,he's flushing his pot down the toilet unnecessarily!
31724,Homer,why are you telling me? he's your father-in-law.
32059,Homer,oh.
26722,Homer,"uh, uh... we're just rehearsing for ""angry dad: the motion picture""."
28947,Homer,because i'm successfully married.
27446,Homer,"don't worry, i'll set fire to the hive."
31311,Homer,"yeah, get him a woman. that'll end his misery!"
16433,Homer,"okay, so we have one thing in common. but you know what i hate? drinking beer and watching tv."
20976,Homer,"oh. but... you run it, right?"
39714,Homer,marge. they're only space mutants.
15768,Homer,"well, that depends on who's a better negotiator, mr. burns or me."
30022,Homer,you think i can't kill you? there's a hundred little punks graduating from syracuse this year that would beg to kiss my ass! get outta here!
26999,Homer,"it's okay, boy. you'll be shooting angels in heaven."
13645,Homer,i'll be there. not-y not-y not.
15316,Homer,"well, john q driveway has our number. now we play the waiting game."
32358,Homer,you ruined that pie!
34057,Homer,in springfield.
13737,Homer,see? it was all your imagination.
18565,Homer,the all igh-ty ollar? i get it.
32946,Homer,"fine -- but you just bought yourself ""ear piercing"" and ""strange new feelings."""
19263,Homer,knock yourself out.
21908,Homer,now your freak flag's flying! let the freak-out begin! woo hoo!
29071,Homer,"please forgive me, talking llama."
19611,Homer,"uh, not as such."
27215,Homer,perfect.
26456,Homer,you don't need that.
31046,Homer,i am! we're the same age!
14138,Homer,did you buy this car with your stock money?
31363,Homer,hmm... let's see what your hangover has to say!
33202,Homer,i want you to put it all on my little girl. and parlay with the asian kid.
31528,Homer,what the hell is this thing?
18394,Homer,i...
27155,Homer,homicidal robots... so like us.
39517,Homer,"tough day at school, boy?"
23675,Homer,my corneas! you were saying?
24155,Homer,"thanks, sweetheart. have a bible. my name's homer. what's yours?"
15248,Homer,"that's it! whew, i'm glad one of us remembered. that could have been embarrassing."
29401,Homer,"oh, i doubt it. but we'll let the seagulls at the dump figure it out."
13809,Homer,i'd like to see that.
26990,Homer,anybody else? come on...
35018,Homer,"and me? now, i'm just an average shnook like everyone else."
17957,Homer,"that's it, marge, he knows the whole hot dog song. go ahead, sleep with him. i'll just take a lock of your hair to remember you by."
36185,Homer,what about cupid? he's smokin' hot.
17861,Homer,take a guess.
33241,Homer,i guess i have no choice.
29547,Homer,"uh... uh... oh man, i have no idea what i'm going."
25141,Homer,"wait, you can't hate me. i'm your better! your better!"
22914,Homer,woo hoo! my springs! they finally came!
15447,Homer,what an age we live in!
16259,Homer,"marge, that's twice. i think you're spending entirely too much time with this woman."
32814,Homer,"and remember, you can do anything you want in the world of country music, western wear merchandising and tv movies. regular movies, don't hold your breath. but tv movies, the sky's the limit."
28022,Homer,i didn't want them to know my size.
32465,Homer,"uh, it used to be."
13626,Homer,stupid welcoming mint! y'ello.
15288,Homer,nice meetin' ya! just keep moving. don't make eye contact.

31700,Homer,"you there, boy! buy me a christmas goose! the biggest one in the shop!"
40174,Homer,'tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door -- this it is and nothing more.
37407,Homer,"okay, moe, one more surprise."
21341,Homer,"bart, this climb is the most difficult ordeal i have ever faced."
32264,Homer,"shut up! when you call in sick, who do you call?"
34540,Homer,"gentlemen, tonight's game is brought to us by something special. the kite's best friend, the flag's partner in patriotism, you've seen cherubs blow it from map corners -- the wind!"
16168,Homer,woo hoo! i'm rich! rich i tells ya. here you go.
36855,Homer,i hope t-rex likes the present i made him.
21211,Homer,attaboy!

27557,Homer,see you in court.
34184,Homer,see you at five on the dot. phone kisses!
20734,Homer,"ah, yes. how do we handle refunds?"
23409,Homer,to the top please.
32561,Homer,"oh, i miss those bygone days of earlier this week. but i'm needed in a darker place."
41408,Homer,"hey, what's going on here?!"
28649,Homer,he was my best friend.
25226,Homer,don't worry your spiky little head. i've got it all planned out.
17755,Homer,"so anyway we get in our car and take the bridge out of town, while all the while they're still going, doo-dee-doo-do-doo..."
33344,Homer,"and you know what else, sweetie? you and your friend princess nutjob inspired me to write my own fantasy novel, based on my experiences as a dad."
39691,Homer,get him!
39666,Homer,get 'em off me! get 'em off! aaah!
25695,Homer,could get hurt. could. there's a chance they won't.
28659,Homer,"fine, fine. i'll take the kids tonight, and you go to your precious hair appointment."
15887,Homer,at our next high school reunion i'll have nothing to be ashamed of.
38475,Homer,"your daughterly love saved me, sweetie!"
32605,Homer,oh no! he's talking to that mailroom guy.
36484,Homer,what's wrong with her?
28052,Homer,"the guy who got fed into the wood chipper in ""fargo""?"
16103,Homer,and then we roll him up in a carpet and throw him off a bridge.
33393,Homer,"marge, unlike c.p.r., this is something i must know."
26440,Homer,can't keep it in...
28737,Homer,i don't understand.
39692,Homer,oh no.
30611,Homer,marge... are you encouraging me to be irresponsible?
36028,Homer,"you know, i heard if a fat guy stops moving, he floats."
27147,Homer,"hey, flanders -- check out my new satellite dish!"
26564,Homer,then it's settled. the simpsons are going to brazil.
22545,Homer,"ohhh, you suck, marge."
40965,Homer,"well, if you ask me, changing the subject makes you the most worthless, heartless, excuse for a human being i ever..."
16194,Homer,"oooh, pure genius..."
20186,Homer,bart was feeling mighty blue...
34224,Homer,"lenny... and carl... a fortune cookie... i ran into the candy machine... and i found an emerson, lake, and palmer..."
39718,Homer,"now i've seen everything. black marbleized with a liquid center. the ""stealth bowler"" -- the pins don't know what hit 'em."
35302,Homer,why you little...
36554,Homer,sorry.
22989,Homer,free boudoir photography. sweet.
25325,Homer,babies.
15793,Homer,you talk better than you fool.
36230,Homer,then there's champagne in me! what am i gonna do? it's less than twenty-four hours till my drug test. maybe i can sweat it out.
25862,Homer,and a blue oyster cult medallion.
39258,Homer,no!
30891,Homer,you take forever to say nothing.
29003,Homer,"because i was saving that for my birthday. now, c'mon!"
31789,Homer,okay.
16841,Homer,"humph, your car. boy, what are the odds, huh?"
34691,Homer,after the title page it's bob dole's memoirs.
22059,Homer,"well, back on land, my name was homer simpson. and i guess it is here, too. i promised my dad one of my kidneys, but i chickened out at the last minute and left him on his deathbed."
20571,Homer,"""the end will come at sundown."" heh heh heh heh. hey, wait a second. i don't like the sound of that."
22157,Homer,"don rickles zinged you, marge."
20320,Homer,"i wouldn't have thought so either, but here we are."
22757,Homer,"'course not. there's no pain in the garden of eden. hey, you must be eve."
35456,Homer,it's worse than you think. i have to buy you a new anniversary present.
37679,Homer,what the?

13374,Homer,fill 'er up. i guess i'll go and stretch my legs.
25565,Homer,glibbie glop gloopie / nibbie nabbie noobie / la le lo lo lo.
15880,Homer,nooooooo!
16343,Homer,"well, here we are at the brad goodman lecture."
14814,Homer,yuh. yuh. yuh.
34287,Homer,"ooo, you're mad when you're angry..."
39884,Homer,"did you see that? you know, marge, this is the way i've always wanted it to be. we've become a fully functioning family unit. we've always blamed ourselves, but i guess it's pretty clear which cylinder wasn't firing."
36366,Homer,worth it to be ri-ight! worth it to be ri-ight!
23710,Homer,"the first meeting of ""hell's satans"" is called to order."
27659,Homer,i'm on my way. you man the rake.
29133,Homer,y'ello. appear on your tv show?! tell our side of the story?! you'll see us there?! goodbye?! dial tone?!
13940,Homer,i'm your man!
23913,Homer,wasteful and practical.
23030,Homer,"well, let's check the old bank account."
39656,Homer,what the--? you're alive!... and... buck nekkid.
40887,Homer,just a select circle of my friends.
27786,Homer,yeah.
32199,Homer,ho danneggiato il mio piede!
31791,Homer,"boy, i never thought i'd have my own dark room."
21812,Homer,sure. we'll all stay.
36136,Homer,shut up! i'll fix you!
33964,Homer,ask him.
28083,Homer,now i'd like to propose a toast: to a woman who's done so much for us without getting anything in return.
26228,Homer,woo hoo!
15246,Homer,"no ""all you can eat seafood."" i wore my extra-loose pants for nothing. nothing!"
30464,Homer,"hello, domino's? what do you mean, you're not open? no, you call me back during business hours! i'll show you who's a recorded message!"
28308,Homer,"marge, i'll be on my best behavior -- you have my word as a gentleman and a lady. now let's see, which rifle should i bring?"
40746,Homer,nothing.
38720,Homer,i understand. i already signed up for this place next year. i gave my form and two hundred dollars cash to that dude.
30689,Homer,possible daddy!
22968,Homer,tilt? you monster!
14698,Homer,come with me!
17067,Homer,"now, the wife of this couple has an interesting quirk in the bedroom. it seems she goes wild with desire if her husband nibbles on her elbow."
37227,Homer,no i don't. if you pray to superman.
40183,Homer,"-- thy god hath lent thee -- by these angels he hath sent thee. respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore! quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore!"
25228,Homer,for once in my life i'm tall. don't take that away from me.
23462,Homer,"i'm sorry, i believe in good grooming."
32713,Homer,three please!
14530,Homer,"i may hold you to that, marge."
27344,Homer,"one churro, please."
34032,Homer,"why can't i keep the job i have now, whatever it is?"
36233,Homer,"then i'd better soak up the alcohol with some food! oooh, cake!"
39730,Homer,"well, maybe i am a little responsible."
17771,Homer,"i'm terribly sorry. flanders is the only useless person here. if anyone dies, it should be him. i'm sorry. please forgive me. so let's kick flanders out. sorry."
22499,Homer,"goood dog! good doggie! ""tax hike approved""? bad dog. bad, bad dog."
23088,Homer,ignor-- what?
37181,Homer,waldo. waldo.
17261,Homer,"hm, cable's out... think i'll have a beer."
22897,Homer,is that our house?
38277,Homer,i will when you open your mind to change!
40929,Homer,"but enough about bart. tell me, principal skinner, are you married?"
29731,Homer,sssh! i want her to think i'm cool!
35629,Homer,this is terrible. what am i gonna do?
29337,Homer,"all right. but while i'm gone, boy, you think about what you did."
32839,Homer,what could be greater than eating and drinking for hours in a drizzly parking lot?
17281,Homer,"come, family, sit in the snow with daddy and let us all bask in television's warm glowing, warming glow."
35839,Homer,what about mimes?
30717,Homer,but i'm not tired!
27041,Homer,"ah, i don't care about the color of your skin, lenny. you're my friend!"
31742,Homer,selma!
36202,Homer,mom?!
41307,Homer,"homer simpson! do you really want to keep cheating your friends, lying to your wife, and avoiding your kids? what would jesus do?"
40214,Homer,"oh, yeah? well, i'm a burns booster. ow!"
38291,Homer,"uh, hello. lisa. i know your brother and..."
16147,Homer,i mean... you know... mr. burns... is so... old...
29276,Homer,uh-oh.
31519,Homer,lower the boom!
20313,Homer,"i'd like to buy your deadliest gun, please."
25858,Homer,judge snyder? while we're young?
16842,Homer,"marge! i think i hate ted koppel. no wait, i find him informative and witty. 'nite."
25176,Homer,"relax, they've got rodeo clowns."
38938,Homer,"ooh, patter!"
23818,Homer,marc--
22345,Homer,my spine.
24609,Homer,"hey, that's not me!"
35669,Homer,here's what i do: pick the thing that marge would hate the most...
19981,Homer,y-y-y-yes.
17619,Homer,"uh-oh. i need a bib. if i slop any on my shirt, i could lose the respect of my beloved brethren."
25031,Homer,i guess you haven't heard of chloroform.
23914,Homer,"a mechanical dressing dealy! watch this, marge."
24548,Homer,fine.
24943,Homer,truly god's country.
22476,Homer,"yes, i learned you've gotta be yourself. g'night, honey."
36731,Homer,i'll fix that later!
15326,Homer,"how could you, barney? after all i've done for you."
23515,Homer,they'll be back. we control the world's supply of tomacco and no one can take that away from...
19001,Homer,thank you. thank you very much.
29775,Homer,bart! pull over!
20654,Homer,"marge, kids, let's go buy some happiness!"
15657,Homer,this is even more painful than it looks.
22930,Homer,"of course not! ""nine hundred and ninety-six springs to flush down / nine hundred and ninety-six spriiings..."""
38787,Homer,nothing's gonna stop me now.
15778,Homer,which way to the bathroom?
36845,Homer,"check it out, flanders, us cool dads are sharing a mono-yard. guess i can't be your best friend anymore."
35677,Homer,and i've got tickets for the grand opening saturday night!
14039,Homer,"flanders, flanders, uh, uh, when should a boy start dating?"
13601,Homer,"as tolstoy said in ""quotable notables,"" ""give me learning, sir, and you may keep your black bread."""
19834,Homer,"look, marge! a restaurant owned by celebrities! i always wanted to be a celebrity!"
36248,Homer,"i guess i just met the joker of the group. better watch out for you on april fool's day, am i right? i said, am i right? am i r--"
38228,Homer,"look at you, using approved electronic devices."
34263,Homer,dude...
17069,Homer,"not tonight, marge. tonight we can eat a nice, leisurely dinner at home."
36237,Homer,"oh lord, i have once again besotted my liver with thy fermented gifts. if you can weasel me out of this physical, i will blow your mind by doing something incredibly holy, at some point. amen. now to mumble in a religious fashion. dear god, oh, lord oh god, oh, lord..."
21498,Homer,"marge, uh, can we not land here?... honey?... baby doll...?"
33330,Homer,"if you say so, m'lord."
38476,Homer,me neither.
40665,Homer,"heh-heh. the joke's on him, i'll be dead by then."
32043,Homer,this is the greatest movie ever!
16347,Homer,this is great. i can finally look like i want and not get hassled by the man.
15344,Homer,kiss my asphalt.
28457,Homer,"please welcome new panelist, barney gumbel."
34612,Homer,you can help me take out those cameras.
25668,Homer,"ohh, she wants to have coffee sometime."
38170,Homer,oh it is.
36862,Homer,he called me... a poser?
24816,Homer,"hey, what happened to...?"
37214,Homer,fine.
15065,Homer,"nope, that's it."
21681,Homer,who's nelson?
25898,Homer,moe? what the?...
21949,Homer,"nooo, nothing made of dead guys. what's in the back?"
24829,Homer,"not yet, honey."
40082,Homer,what? our anniversary? are you sure?
21784,Homer,billy baldwin!
39497,Homer,unortho what?
16111,Homer,"look, i'm sure we can work something out where we can all live in harmony. right, marge?"
41578,Homer,a hole next to the seat to hold my cup?
37764,Homer,"wow, i'd love to help, but i did kind of have plans for tonight..."
39549,Homer,must you do this every time?
14441,Homer,"i know you do, marge. but come on, you know what our vacations are like. those three monsters in the back seat. ""are we there yet? are we there yet?"" and let's face it, i'm no day at the beach either. ""marge, can i have another sandwich? marge, can i have another sandwich?"""
28314,Homer,thank you.
32960,Homer,five hundred and one!
14679,Homer,uh-huh.
25042,Homer,but what about the guy who took my car?
34274,Homer,pack your winter coat! we're going to canada's warmest city!
17824,Homer,"but, i've never been able to do the..."
18540,Homer,"bart, you're coming home."
20439,Homer,"son, you can do anything you want. i have total faith in you."
25458,Homer,what's going on? what am i doin' here?
21423,Homer,"look, honey, i clipped on my tie all by myself."
40455,Homer,"eight o'clock, but what does it matter?"
21156,Homer,god bless america!
27047,Homer,"so long, jerks."
40444,Homer,it's your fault i'm bald!
37956,Homer,"we've talked about this, marge. the hammock is a chore-free zone."
31648,Homer,now what do they want?
17449,Homer,faucet's jammed into my back... i'm stuck.
35734,Homer,you're in.
34811,Homer,pretty ironic -- a cross being used to kill someone.
38433,Homer,is that the boy you named me after?
21400,Homer,lisa! save me!
40568,Homer,i'll tell you what i think. i think he thinks i'm an idiot. the only reason he's offering us this is because he knows he's gonna lose the trial and have to pay us a cool million.
24918,Homer,"oh, they drugged the tea. they knew my one weakness."
31563,Homer,"ew, it tastes terrible!"
31355,Homer,"thanks, moe. how can i ever repay you?"
19237,Homer,don't you care about your son? this is more important than money!
22974,Homer,"but you know what? to be loved you have to be nice to people. every day! but, to be hated, you don't have to do squat."
33110,Homer,"no, i'm trying to get me drunk."
14662,Homer,"ah, this movie's too complicated... hey, the floor's sticky..."
23326,Homer,a bat! now that's a new one.
31307,Homer,"bart, there's something i have to tell you father to son. i passed out on your turtle and killed it. someday you'll thank me."
38373,Homer,anything else?
20630,Homer,stupid heater! don't make me come in there!
34458,Homer,please tell me they suffered.
20235,Homer,...and that inscription is still there today.
37091,Homer,great. and now my dad can notarize.
35653,Homer,need more butter! and not the unsalted.
19259,Homer,all right. just wake me up.
39080,Homer,who are you?
28524,Homer,"marge, tv and nightmares have joined forces to teach me a lesson. from now on, i will stop being selfish and start being good. in fact, i'll be the nicest man in town."
20240,Homer,i learned from the master.
17547,Homer,"bart, leave that man alone with his pain and sit down."
38417,Homer,"okay, i slept on the couch, and i flipped the sweaty cushions over. what else can i do?"
34619,Homer,"son, i'm a bit of an expert on the female gender, and i can tell you: women don't mean anything by anything."
38341,Homer,'bout time!
19166,Homer,"marge, look!"
20801,Homer,"ooh, look a bird."
39661,Homer,this young sapling ought to do the trick.
41226,Homer,uh-oh. i don't understand a word he's saying. why doesn't he just let me bat? i wish i was home with a big bag of potato chips... mmm potato chips.
37026,Homer,"this could come in handy. but let me check that list of things marge said never to bring home. dogs, cats, octopuses, octopi, octopuseseses..."
22242,Homer,"ooh, a friendly bee."
36445,Homer,whee! whee!
39489,Homer,ready as she'll ever be!
29467,Homer,that's because i hate her.
34730,Homer,"wait a minute, marge. don't you realize what just happened?"
26319,Homer,ostrich burgers! get your ostrich burgers!
28800,Homer,sorry. i forgot i bought the soundtrack album.
19223,Homer,"wow, that's really lazy."
25678,Homer,what? that doesn't sound like me.
26065,Homer,"yep, no one's rowdier and more youthful than old man burns."
22621,Homer,"just pretend it's a tree, honey. or as we say at omnitouch, a progress tree."
28011,Homer,i'll take 'em.
24993,Homer,in a way. but i also remembered some other stuff... like my bike that was stolen in third grade. plus the baldness.
29548,Homer,i wonder if other super bowl producers waited until three in the morning the night before to plan their halftime shows.
28919,Homer,"son, i want you to know, no matter what anyone says, there's no shame in being caught alive."
29754,Homer,we'll have christmas tomorrow!
32935,Homer,"mom, i'm so sorry. you just wanted to stop one more senseless act of madness in the world. well, if i get out of this i promise you i'll grant your last wish."
13257,Homer,i am the ghost of--
31540,Homer,i've never seen marge want to go somewhere so badly. i'm gonna take her back there... by burning that home movie onto a dvd.
19578,Homer,you could call 'em whitey whackers.
15603,Homer,pigabar? what the hell is pigabar?
40915,Homer,"oh and that sauce, barney. i could have drunk a bowl of it by itself! no barney, that's just my sister-in-law."
19208,Homer,but you stopped the fight. won't everyone be mad at you?
30193,Homer,"flanders. okay, that's it. really irritating!"
22760,Homer,don't mind if i do!
17093,Homer,"ah, your flesh mother used to bring me pudding. oh, i miss marge. lisa you're smart. help me trick her into taking me back."

17424,Homer,"i like it better when they're making fun of people who aren't me. i know - ""evening at the improv."" they never talk about anything beyond the 1980s."
40098,Homer,"karl, you saved me. why?"
30317,Homer,"marge, i'm always amazed you chose me."
19465,Homer,and that talking coyote was really just a talking dog.
33040,Homer,did he take the bait?
39046,Homer,"i could say it's the being shot at or the flat, emotionless way you talk or the fact that paypal was my idea and i was just about to do it when you came out with it... but really it's that this town isn't ready for you, and neither am i."
32537,Homer,"moe, my family's gone, my dog hates me, and i can't remember what happened last night. was i here?"
22229,Homer,"ned, no! think of your wives!"
27564,Homer,woo hoo! you're still mine! and you thought i was a bad dad before.
27036,Homer,"oh, yeah."
21957,Homer,hold on. i'm still fine-tuning.
36062,Homer,"hey baby, banned forever doesn't mean you can't go back sometimes."
16921,Homer,"son, you're okay! and you've led us to the precious ivory. and of course your lovable pet, who it's connected to..."
17166,Homer,"oh, okay."
24851,Homer,$5000 for a computer and it can't handle a simple assignment.
39227,Homer,hey! what's with this?
31961,Homer,"oh, bogus gizmo, grant me eternal life."
35751,Homer,"but the trolls were the best part! do the characters still say ""troll-y"" instead of ""cool?"""
18603,Homer,so you're saying we're definitely gonna win? -- woo hoo! i won't need this any more!

25123,Homer,"and they gave me this spiffy nerd ensemble, too."
18614,Homer,eh. i'll do it anyway.
17343,Homer,"we're laughing with her, marge! there's a big difference."
21103,Homer,help! somebody!
17066,Homer,"no, wait! uh, uh, wait!... i, yes! i do have a story about two other young marrieds."
16076,Homer,"marge, someone's squeezed all the life out of these kids. and unless movies and tv have lied to me, it's a crusty, bitter, old dean!"
17287,Homer,there! better than new! now to take her for a test toast.
34970,Homer,there was barbecue sauce on it.
18317,Homer,"i don't want to alarm you, marge..."

41349,Homer,no book is gonna make my daughter sad. time to do what i do best: lie to a child.
24584,Homer,"it was her, all right. take the one who wronged you."

30061,Homer,marge... what if the rapture is coming and i haven't led a good enough life? i could be... left below!
15158,Homer,how could you let this happen?
24344,Homer,get off! get off!
26322,Homer,i'm not proud of that clip.
27055,Homer,"oh, won't anyone pretend to believe me?"
13643,Homer,i was serious.
29091,Homer,"well, that stinks. but i still get to kiss you, right?"
22623,Homer,"nothing. they just needed a place to put all the electronic gizmos, and i know how much you like that sciencey stuff so i..."
13826,Homer,"ok, ok. i'll make a wish that can't backfire. i wish for a turkey sandwich, on rye bread, with lettuce and mustard, and...and! i don't want any zombie turkeys, i don't want to turn into a turkey myself, and i don't want any other weird surprises. you got it?"
22488,Homer,"yeah, i'm going right to the top."
22879,Homer,"oh, let's get out of here."
22712,Homer,for now...
36580,Homer,i guess it's one of those things a dad has to do...
25819,Homer,good as new.
28732,Homer,"yeah, you heard your mother."
41526,Homer,you know these ikea foam futons do velcro together.
28759,Homer,"oh, maggie will do just fine. she'll have plenty of money, 'cause she'll marry a grocer..."
15863,Homer,richard nixon.
20829,Homer,but i want to go.

35407,Homer,"i can't. they won't let me. lenny, be a pal and saw off my hands."
35136,Homer,he didn't know that!
39310,Homer,rudolph with your nose... over here... / so you can guide my sleigh today....
14077,Homer,homer simpson.
39148,Homer,"i see. you want excitement. princess, have you ever heard of studio fifty-four, c-b-g-bs, the roxbury?"

20587,Homer,can you believe it? it's already been a year.
20935,Homer,"that's my girl. you just go home, and don't worry your pretty blue head about it. moe will take care of everything."
41433,Homer,i just wanted the woman i married.
31010,Homer,they're gonna divide the school in two?
23233,Homer,that was fun. we have to get out more often.
31264,Homer,i don't know anything about struts.
20006,Homer,check.
22646,Homer,"it's true. i'm always making clever noises, and she never chuckles at 'em."
34397,Homer,"please, please, please..."
36419,Homer,"when i was in special ops, they held me in an afghan prison where all i could see was a patch of blue sky. but that blue was nothing compared to the blue of your eyes."
35307,Homer,"no, no. i'm just a kid. leave me alone!"
31876,Homer,how many?!
32478,Homer,"listen marge... i've been wondering all these years, what is it about me that you find so irresistible? let's face it... you could do better."
26714,Homer,my ice cream sandwich! then where the hell's the remote?!
16670,Homer,you can't sell that. karma can only be portioned out by the cosmos.
17132,Homer,"you're steerin' fine, boy... hard to the right!"
15724,Homer,do i ever!
31921,Homer,"mood swings? mood swings! mood swings! mood swings! mood swings! mood swings, mood swings! mood swings!"
39325,Homer,what do we need a psychiatrist for? we know our kid is nuts.
34499,Homer,"ooh, ooh! can i cuff him?!"

34065,Homer,"marge, i believe we have a little unfinished business. come with me!"
28473,Homer,"hey, where's my car?"

22341,Homer,"'scuse me, comin' through. friends of dan marino."
14957,Homer,"oooh, waffle run off."
33989,Homer,"ooo, ooo, can i go, marge? can i? can i?"

15509,Homer,bart!
38878,Homer,okay.
23364,Homer,"dear god, it's homer. if you really love me, you'll save my life now."
33196,Homer,"wow, so this is what this is."
32299,Homer,who are you guys?
25269,Homer,wow. how do you come up with such witty remarks?
23321,Homer,"""rough!"" ah, i don't know. you've been pitching that all night."
22701,Homer,that didn't sound like you meant it.
35969,Homer,leave her alone! that's my only talking daughter!
32999,Homer,"yes, for now. i guess things are workin' out pretty good at your bakery job. maybe we could order one of your cakes for lisa's birthday."
22990,Homer,hm...
33675,Homer,"hey, maggie could play out there... while i watch her from in here. whaddaya say, maggie?"
19029,Homer,"you know what the song says, ""it's hip to be square."""
17976,Homer,"marge, look. this has spring snakes inside, but the suckers will think it's beer nuts. mmm... beer nuts."
14036,Homer,three-time soapbox derby champion ronnie beck!
36807,Homer,who do you think painted the word on the tree?
41293,Homer,"okay homer, don't speak. if you must make a sound, whistle."
15111,Homer,to the book depository!
19608,Homer,"hey, this sounds like fun."
40430,Homer,"...and, lord, we're especially thankful for nuclear power, the cleanest, safest energy source there is, except for solar, which is just a pipe dream. anyway, we'd like to thank you for the occasional moments of peace and love our family's experienced... well, not today. you saw what happened. oh, lord, be honest. are we the most pathetic family in the universe, or what?"
25587,Homer,go.
32625,Homer,now for a victory cigar.
26097,Homer,"i was having a private conversation with my wife, in the guise of chad sexington. do you mind?"
30595,Homer,"listen, marge. no matter where you go in this life, you'll always have one friend who loves you body and soul."
20492,Homer,then maybe you shouldn't of told her you did.
22737,Homer,"oh, why do all my trips end like this?"
13920,Homer,oh nuts.
36460,Homer,"ooo, licorice!"
20362,Homer,"all right, put your... oh well, i'll rob it next time."
17019,Homer,ew yuuuuck!
13289,Homer,nuh-uh.
37803,Homer,"sorry, little fella. one day i'll be that guy who comes to your wedding, makes you feel a little weird, and then runs away."
38185,Homer,"not your fault, man. those parasailing guys take whatever they want."
31927,Homer,"okay, here's the solution -- i want you kids to lock the bedroom from the outside, so i can't get out and perpetrate my nocturnal mischief."
37748,Homer,"okay homer, remember your lamaze training..."
30265,Homer,"kids, i'm sure your mother will be back soon."
20305,Homer,i don't know.
32097,Homer,svetlana! svetlana!
38333,Homer,"it's not exactly fun and games for me either, marge."
19034,Homer,"lisa, let's go!"
28944,Homer,marge? are you helping her?
26808,Homer,"that's it, boy! it's time for your bath!"
37117,Homer,i forget.
39345,Homer,but i'm not a genius. why should i suffer?
15927,Homer,"marge, please. i'm having enough trouble with the lobsters."
25212,Homer,"ah, you saw our bus ad."
18393,Homer,you dragged me all the way from work for that?
37184,Homer,we've found what we're looking for.
22314,Homer,"now this wheel balancing is free, right?"
32991,Homer,"no, it looks cool!"
30997,Homer,"catch me, flanders!"
27255,Homer,"savages! i'll handle this, marge."
40261,Homer,"will you shut up, i'm trying to think of a name."
32427,Homer,we're gonna be rich! we can finally start a family!
23848,Homer,then the big game between springfield u. and springfield a & m. i hate springfield u. so much.
35682,Homer,too sad to walk! too sad and fun to walk...
33662,Homer,"the score, damn you!"
35228,Homer,what the?!
40777,Homer,what?
34399,Homer,"this really means a lot to you, huh?"
41472,Homer,shut up and go to the prom with me!
28267,Homer,your last act as a mom was to make me a better dad. but at least now i'll never lose you again.
36734,Homer,dan!
33112,Homer,"no, i'm talking to you, at this great party!"
22985,Homer,take that!
16694,Homer,this isn't very convenient.
35599,Homer,and i sayeth unto you... slay every tall boy in town!
33371,Homer,what will this box reveal? and what will i use this box for afterwards? mismatched nuts and bolts? recipes? i may never know.
38044,Homer,"sorry son, i only have twenties. and if god needs money, why doesn't he just write another bible? the first one sold pretty well."
30009,Homer,"much of the tune is plagiarized. now go, go, go!"
36439,Homer,just like me on twitter!
27610,Homer,"hm, now without lettuce."
19348,Homer,"i didn't want a hokey second wedding like those ones on tv. this one is for real. i want our marriage to be perfect, right from the start, so we don't end up like kirk and luann."
38927,Homer,what kind of insane parking system is designed so you're blocked in by everyone that arrived after you?!
13642,Homer,give her the check!
37397,Homer,...so i stayed up for the last eighty-seven hours watching all my shows.
17134,Homer,cat!... deer!... old man!
40876,Homer,...but i am severely tempted to do it over this.
39895,Homer,"hey, lenny. does this place have one of those plutonium isolation deals?"
31144,Homer,"wow, i think we've really hit on something here. unfortunately, we're out of time. how does that make you feel?"
24564,Homer,i lost my job as an oaf today.
23864,Homer,"oh, couldn't you try a non-delicious fat? oh, there's no such thing."
15059,Homer,hey there blimpy boy flying through the sky so fancy free --
33316,Homer,"your bees died days ago. these are their angry, mutant descendants. and they're tough enough to live in any environment."
23065,Homer,i can't believe they stuck us at taxachusetts.
28392,Homer,marge? maggie?
33936,Homer,"well, one thing's for sure: i'm not everyman."
39682,Homer,"avenge me, son. avenge my death."
26970,Homer,you wanna be my slave?
17795,Homer,"hey, hey."
27768,Homer,"look, there's nothing more important to me than you guys. i f..."
37211,Homer,"it's okay, dad. we know the truth, and we love you."
25846,Homer,huh?
19811,Homer,"oh, all those stairs..."
27549,Homer,now he's got it.
37372,Homer,"oh, now we're talkin'. but why me?"
29161,Homer,"ooh, that'll save some time."
17830,Homer,"heh-heh, good one, krusty."
33375,Homer,", or woo hoo?"
38004,Homer,"um, mr. burns, sir? can i get another pair of glasses? maybe two pair. one for the beach house. can i also get a beach house? two beach houses..."
23550,Homer,"oh, marge, i'm sorry. i can't make it."
39871,Homer,"yeah, but what about bart?"
14560,Homer,it's not fair. me and the guys worked so hard to get to the championship game and now we'll be sitting on a bench.
16926,Homer,"nah, that's okay. i'm pretty sure i can struggle my way out. first i'll just reach in and pull my legs out."
18684,Homer,you look great.
29879,Homer,i think that means six more weeks of autumn.
39384,Homer,damn!
40981,Homer,"but marge, i want to see my brother--"
33284,Homer,u.s.a.! u.s.a.! u.s.a.!
17700,Homer,no.
37391,Homer,compliments of the deacon!
30072,Homer,...minus the number of filipinos in the bible...and you get...
30328,Homer,"look at the bright side, marge. when i die, you can mourn me from the bathroom. that's multi-tasking."
37517,Homer,"but first, m'lady, let me escort you to heaven -- the fancy swiss chocolate store on level three!"
17497,Homer,this is gonna to be great.
37444,Homer,no.
14208,Homer,why? what's wrong?
17192,Homer,"wait a minute, marge. love isn't hopeless. look, maybe i'm no expert on the subject. but there was one time i got it right..."
26078,Homer,mmm... pistol whip.
38306,Homer,no. i mean for adult males.
31713,Homer,look out for the stairs!
14260,Homer,you want fries with that?
33177,Homer,"no, this is about you. edna wants to break up."
19907,Homer,"give me that! bart, this is your father. do you know where the remote is? i looked all over the house."
14336,Homer,"all right, denver. justify my love."
37728,Homer,"no matter what, homer simpson has done it. and soon i hope i remember who homer simpson is and his relationship to me. but i have no regrets. in fact, all this has given me a sense of calm i've never had before."
29886,Homer,impresses. what a big word! i'm gonna look that up.
14023,Homer,when did i ever teach you that?
23879,Homer,and chili fries!
29399,Homer,i'm hangin' this over the mantel.
23711,Homer,"i'm the president and the decision is mine. we're hell's satans. besides, i've already made our club jackets."
30398,Homer,"that's ridiculous! no woman would want to have sex with that loser! and, uh, congratulations on snagging him back. good stuff."
23906,Homer,"oh, why won't anyone give me an award?"
22451,Homer,maarrge... president clinton!
16897,Homer,"i don't have time to read. just give me the gist of it, son."
25797,Homer,a poor delicious buffalo. he'll be dinner for the whole wagon train.
26715,Homer,why do people keep moving it... stupid...
21091,Homer,"what is it, sweetie? did you see a scary picture in your picture book?"
38881,Homer,what the? pfft. gibberish! pure gibberish!
26092,Homer,"ooo, mama celeste."
30602,Homer,you're sending me to italy?
19853,Homer,"c'mon, boy, think of a plan."
22917,Homer,"hello, little girl, is your mommy home? you'll need to ask her for five dollars to buy mr. bouncy best-friend."
34382,Homer,"hey, my bathing suit came off!"
32318,Homer,think. think.
15441,Homer,"but i'm out of the woods now, right? i mean, whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger."
37434,Homer,"marge, i have something to show you."
30226,Homer,transubstantiation!
35051,Homer,wait a minute! your standard markup is four hundred percent?
27941,Homer,"we did it! finally, man has triumphed over a small, furry animal!"
26938,Homer,the only friend you need is springshield.
34118,Homer,do you guys know funky town?
40301,Homer,bart was strangely quiet. later he explained he was confused by feelings of respect for me. that wouldn't last.
25011,Homer,so we're under arrest for fraud?
28214,Homer,"someone, or something, knows i love oversized food and short, punchy articles. so they hid a message in the first letter of each line. see: ""homer, meet me 4th street overpass, midnite."""
13342,Homer,that thing you know how to do.
19249,Homer,"hold on, mr. burns. maybe we did fake a kidnapping, but is that really such a crime? all your son wanted was a little attention, a little love."
28331,Homer,that's it. i'm acting the way america acts best -- unilaterally.
19024,Homer,"oh, this is heavy. okay, homer, don't fear the reaper."
39987,Homer,ooops. time for a fill-up. garçon! another bottle of your second-least-expensive champagne.
15399,Homer,duh.
35258,Homer,"well, this has been great. we should get home soon -- the game's going to be starting."
20046,Homer,then i added some fins to lower wind resistance. and this racing stripe here i feel is pretty sharp.
35219,Homer,"don't worry, cheech. i know all the classic bits of you and chong."
25098,Homer,yahoo!
37279,Homer,"how much plutonium do you want? gotta warn you, it might take me twenty minutes to get it."
40687,Homer,damn those novelty telephone answering machine tapes!
36983,Homer,"hollywood has taught you well, my son. now let's push ""play."""
24700,Homer,stupid lisa.
36833,Homer,our houses are the cheapest! the one next to me's been on sale forever! i see them lowering the price every morning when i go out to pee.
39893,Homer,"see these? american donuts. glazed, powdered, and raspberry filled. now how's that for freedom of choice?"
36641,Homer,i don't recall that.
22830,Homer,you mean this hunka junk? this isn't art. just a barbecue that pushed me over the edge. didn't you? didn't you?! you stupid so...
30716,Homer,teach me that the stove is hot.
41467,Homer,"it was love at first sight, and you ruined it!"
40821,Homer,marge?
25230,Homer,"sorry, son."
36822,Homer,"no, no, nothing, nope."
28049,Homer,i rarely feel the need to utter d'oh!
20148,Homer,"we're getting outta here, now! jump in, marge! trust me! throw the kids! no time for the baby!"
24276,Homer,"oh boy, oh boy, oh boy..."
29290,Homer,"every simpson starts with a circle. daddy has one big circle here... then a smaller one up here... two big, sexy circles for eyes... one macho muzzle... and a snappy new outfit. hm, i'm lookin' good... ooh, cuffs... yeah... and for some reason, my hair and ear form an ""m"" and a ""g."""
40516,Homer,"yeah, but what are ya gonna do?"
30455,Homer,a strongman? are you for sale? 'cause i need someone to throw a birdbath at my neighbor.
38692,Homer,poking through.
16907,Homer,"i only have two questions. how much, and give it to me."
38606,Homer,"thanks, charlie. maybe fracking isn't so bad."
24827,Homer,but santa can't be evil...
33261,Homer,hm. usually that ends the dream.
26831,Homer,"fine, i won't kill it."
33039,Homer,this counts as a parent-teacher conference!
17028,Homer,"you think i don't want to? it's those tv networks, marge. they won't let me. one quality show after another. each one fresher and more brilliant than the last. if they only stumbled once -- just gave us thirty minutes to ourselves. but they won't, they won't let me live!"
31812,Homer,clot-clot-clot-clot-clot!
31560,Homer,dammit!
28180,Homer,"okay god, i bumped off the love of my life, according to your divine whim. now release me from this ghastly vocation."
26425,Homer,"eh, i'm sick of this tarzan movie."
25275,Homer,i've got it! it's in the bag!
29466,Homer,"marge, you can't go with me to moe's. i mean, how would you like it if i came with you to your mother's?"
27250,Homer,"i would never sign that! unless there was a red sticker that said ""sign here."""
26725,Homer,i'm just passionate -- like all us greeks.
36020,Homer,"almost there, boy. almost there. almost there."
34611,Homer,"well, if you ask me, you were trying to play god."
15300,Homer,"not as low as my low, low prices."
19967,Homer,it's your life.
38127,Homer,guinea pig?
14799,Homer,chocolate...
38754,Homer,yep. it's all about the music... and it would take a pretty unforeseen development to change that. pretty unforeseen...
23355,Homer,"when i think about ned, i can't help but remember the look on his face when marge drove over..."
22617,Homer,so we're even then?
19504,Homer,we sure did... soul mate.
25544,Homer,yoink.
25657,Homer,"linguo, dead!"
38221,Homer,"what do you think, sweetie?"
21283,Homer,"yeah, it's somethin', all right."
24599,Homer,"oh, if only it were that easy, marge."
31458,Homer,"that's okay, i can get it from the bank, honey. i just need to know your birthday."
34655,Homer,"moe, i don't know whether to punch you or kiss you... so i'm gonna do both."
39397,Homer,wow. they listened to me.
32202,Homer,mimi!
22932,Homer,and i do! woo!
38149,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa..."
34407,Homer,whuh?
29927,Homer,not real.
15564,Homer,"legend of the dog-faced woman! oh, that's good."
27641,Homer,now wait just a minute -- i used to worry marge was too good for me. she was always thinking of ways to improve me. but then part of her died and she doesn't try any more. so we're all where we want to be.
31806,Homer,can't i even have privacy here?!
28672,Homer,no problem.
29895,Homer,"my new best friend. we think alike, we act alike, we finish each other's sandwiches..."
18015,Homer,oh my god! he's got the precious cable tv cable!
39245,Homer,"oh, i certainly do."
25410,Homer,"nice place you got here. ooh look, a hair net. be a shame if it was hurled to the ground!"
18578,Homer,"uh... excuse me, mr. burns?"
27826,Homer,moe's tavern grand opening... that was back when his floors were sticky with promise.
39485,Homer,that's it? that's the college fund we've been saving for all these years?
20863,Homer,"hey, what the hell's going on?!"
21715,Homer,the kid's gotta die.
31024,Homer,screw you! i'm never gonna pay!
23899,Homer,"please, bart. you've gotta use your powers! i'm beggin' ya!"
32995,Homer,something for the sweetest little scientist in the world. a new chemistry set.
37081,Homer,"wow. i assumed the jackson five were the only perfect family, but now i see there's another."
20743,Homer,it's a ring toss game.
17712,Homer,man. it's windy as hell out there.
19580,Homer,"aw, looks like mr. pretzel man is doing pretty well for himself."
39977,Homer,"i think you're right, dumplin'."
36877,Homer,it's a hellhole!
40410,Homer,oh my god! he's enjoying it!
20050,Homer,over there.
40205,Homer,"you know, i was just telling the wife that if i was governor, i'd do things a lot differently."
34572,Homer,bad dog! stop!
35414,Homer,another hairdresser?
21374,Homer,who is this?
37400,Homer,i took a class where you do chest compressions to a bee gees song.
19113,Homer,um... someday i'd like to own the dallas cowboys.
31093,Homer,what about him?
22766,Homer,branch monster.
24602,Homer,i hate this new area code. like i don't have enough to remember already.
24458,Homer,you're daddy's precious dancing queen!
21087,Homer,no.
40117,Homer,"uh, why?"
31655,Homer,what's your hurry?
19956,Homer,two in a row!
20019,Homer,do you think it might work without the fork in the eye?
31530,Homer,a heart-shaped box of chocolates.
16648,Homer,how do you figure boy?
37514,Homer,"you have a great day, ma'am."
29067,Homer,"oh come on, she's a little girl."
35476,Homer,"oh ned, i never dreamed that beneath those iddilies and diddilies there was a dude."
41150,Homer,get away from that thing and help me find my athletic equipment.
21101,Homer,woo hoo!
41290,Homer,what the hell are you doing?!
40370,Homer,"now, this is a picture of your enemy, todd flanders. every day i want you to spend fifteen minutes staring at it and concentrating on how much you hate him and how glorious it will be when you and charlene annihilate him."
27287,Homer,"uh, if you two country hens are finished clucking, i'd like to buy a copy of jugs and ammo."
22109,Homer,"so, how'd you get the nickname ""legs""?"
21814,Homer,kent brockman. please.
19931,Homer,he better know how to keep his mouth shut.
17747,Homer,"oh, there are pictures. i keep them where i need the most cheering up."
31919,Homer,how is that possible?
29661,Homer,"i've never worked all night, never! and i worked at an all-night diner for three years! i slept on the grill."
36325,Homer,stranded? what's that?
21837,Homer,"come on, ron, we're not wanted here."
20432,Homer,"good practice, team. okay, it's time for the easiest part of any coach's job, the cuts."
25079,Homer,"oh, baby!"
40314,Homer,what a family.
19822,Homer,the important thing is i didn't imagine it.
38883,Homer,"that kid's got talent, but c'mon!"
24630,Homer,oh yeah? what is it?
16231,Homer,what the hell's so funny?
24274,Homer,"marge, i did it! i found lincoln's gold!"

36243,Homer,"nice parking, idiot."
35058,Homer,life was so much easier when a machine told you when to laugh.
18986,Homer,"hey, i've been safari-in' since before you were born."
35917,Homer,this is going so great. i'm already a halloween mask.
30635,Homer,prego?
37630,Homer,"hey boy, since you don't need a bedroom any more, i finally get my man cave."
18369,Homer,"i was going to surprise you, but what the heck -- honey, i'm purposely gaining sixty-one pounds to get on disability."
40479,Homer,"he's got us, marge. there's nothing we can do. he's as good as dead."
38880,Homer,"well, we haven't heard from maggie yet."
14265,Homer,"marge, for you."
34979,Homer,well... back in my keister you go.
13227,Homer,"uh-oh, spaghetti-o's!"
14599,Homer,whoo-hoo!
31546,Homer,you could caramel my arm...
37029,Homer,"this is the easiest money i've ever made, lugging around a ninety pound parking meter!"
13162,Homer,absolutely. or my name isn't... whatever i told you it was.
14784,Homer,all right. he can stay. but i get to treat him like garbage.
13734,Homer,"yeah, right. son... i'm gonna teach you a lesson. i'm going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. then maybe you'll learn..."
38774,Homer,"oh, you mean he generously invited us to come watch him be a rock star?"
25890,Homer,really. you like skateboards? we're sure learning a lot about each other.
39065,Homer,stop fearing me!
37993,Homer,about the glasses...
21665,Homer,"look at me, bart! i'm driving!"
24077,Homer,then we star-wipe to flanders brushing his...
34269,Homer,curling is real.
36871,Homer,"even flanders agrees! this is our neighborhood. we were here first, so you should leave."
26628,Homer,"marge, it's making my eyes better, and it's legal."
32463,Homer,"all for you, baby."

36152,Homer,woo hoo!
16008,Homer,it's probably the person you least suspect!
21299,Homer,"oh, marge. how could you let me let myself go like this?"
27070,Homer,damn straight.
20245,Homer,"fine, then don't use it."
22036,Homer,"you're right, marge. i'll do it. but if i die during the operation, will you do one thing for me?"
37005,Homer,"marge, when i started prepping for the end of the world, everyone laughed at me."
20392,Homer,"oh, honey, please come home. i need you. it's dark in the house and i'm hungry and lonesome. and there's no one there to hear my various witty remarks."
16592,Homer,literacy programs... preserving our beloved covered bridges... world domination...
27223,Homer,so how do you afford such a sweet pad?
16898,Homer,your kid flew five feet. that counts as a ride. two bucks.
17745,Homer,"come on marge, show a little enthusiasm."
32399,Homer,"marge, give me a break! i don't notice the color of people's eyes! i just judge them on the color of their skin."
36273,Homer,that could've been my motherboard lying in the street!
22394,Homer,"mmm, who knows? maybe i'll have to foil an assassination, or stop a peace conference."
25620,Homer,"okay boy, drop the thumb..."
35106,Homer,stupid double snuggler's hitch! only hope is to chew off my leg.
24063,Homer,"it's natural to feel that way, but the sprinkler is gone. it's time to let go."
27231,Homer,"oh-ho-ho, you look adorable, lisa."
41079,Homer,we never had a problem with a family member we can give away before.
41035,Homer,"all my life, i have searched for a car that feels a certain way."

38297,Homer,"yes, well it's a special evening. and i thought it best not to look like a monkey."
27233,Homer,"befoul an army helmet? you'd like that, wouldn't ya, hippie?"
31550,Homer,slick willie wiggles out of another one.
25663,Homer,he can't admit he likes her till he's sure she likes him back. and there's only one way to find out.
37196,Homer,"high-five me, marge!"
34621,Homer,"into the playpen, sweetie. and if you get hungry, there's lobster!"
14663,Homer,"who's that guy?... what did that guy say when i said, ""who's that guy?"""
22955,Homer,"gee, i feel bad. if people knew the real monty burns, and not the silver-dollar-throwing morphine addict you've become, they might like you."
39679,Homer,praise the grizzles son.
36138,Homer,"here car. here, boy."

26197,Homer,what?
27946,Homer,who is he?!
25763,Homer,"'cause the thing is, there are no bad kids..."
14583,Homer,"no, the army said i was too heavy. the police said i was too dumb."
14313,Homer,wait a minute. does this mean you like my present?
32505,Homer,"finally, the ribs."
23094,Homer,"hmmm, i see... i sure hope they don't have an ice cream round."
39686,Homer,"you know, bart, when i was your age, i pulled a few boners, but i think you'll find that people are pretty decent if you give them half... oh, oh."
23283,Homer,"aw, they're both good."
31141,Homer,buck mitchell!
41175,Homer,"if you need me, i'll be in the refrigerator."

23905,Homer,everyone gets an award but me.
37252,Homer,"i hate unions. there's this guy at my plant, caused three meltdowns and he still keeps his job."
36600,Homer,"what about... you know... ""stinky""?"
31516,Homer,really? who's gonna make him?
30443,Homer,they look a little green.
31533,Homer,scottsdale? will we stay at a tripletree resort?
19127,Homer,"hey, if tom landry's hat doesn't motivate you, then i should just quit right now."
41311,Homer,"ooh, these cotton-poly blends are sooo comfortable!"
17789,Homer,"steady, steady..."

22798,Homer,"'scuse me, i have a few questions for pop."
33536,Homer,"good, but not great. i'll go get some rat poison."
41114,Homer,dad!
22184,Homer,"eh, the missus will clean that up."
20675,Homer,maybe so. but there's one thing they forgot to take away from us. this washcloth.
15891,Homer,that's my boy.
15301,Homer,"uh, huh, that's mr. plow."
40843,Homer,hear me roar -- the network for women.

22620,Homer,"hey, this is pretty comfortable. that andy capp was onto something."
22443,Homer,he's max power's oldest and dearest friend.
36041,Homer,"oh honey, why must you always assume that a huge picture of us, at a secret meeting we weren't told about, is a bad thing?"
21430,Homer,gotcha!
30302,Homer,you're needed at home!
15815,Homer,"okay, okay. this time i'll just go into the bushes over there, make a lot of noise and flush out a rabbit. when he comes out, you step on him."
39332,Homer,"how 'bout a tie, son? everybody knows boy geniuses wear ties."
22600,Homer,they know i'm kidding.
13535,Homer,"all right, all right. i'll get lisa to do it."

26669,Homer,"it's been three days. and my mind is clearer, my sperm count is up, and i'm able to recognize simple shapes and patterns."

18875,Homer,"uh, you don't have to tell me, but i thought we trusted each other with our secrets now. i mean, i haven't told a soul about your new boyfriend."
38790,Homer,"hey, um, you gonna be okay?"
32245,Homer,a little bit louder now!
16634,Homer,that's not a job. it's a waste of time. what can poor people pay ya? nothin'! what satisfaction do you get from helping 'em? none! who wants to help poor people anyway? nobody!
25649,Homer,"here, little fella."
26401,Homer,"don't worry, honey. we can't afford this now, but when it's time for college, i promise my darling daughter can go to the finest school there is."
20497,Homer,"oh, crap, i forgot!"
37174,Homer,...the smallest nesting doll!
36215,Homer,so what do i do again?
23947,Homer,there are no laws. we can do anything we want! anything!
38965,Homer,i'm beat.
35551,Homer,fine. i am being held somewhere in the springfield area. turn the card.
35606,Homer,but i guess i should find out a little bit about you.
38065,Homer,what's he doing?
20546,Homer,fossils shmossils. you can't stop progress 'cause of some moldy old bones. bones shmones.
28789,Homer,"okay kids, forget the movie. we'll just go to the furniture store and sit down."
18733,Homer,"you su-diddily-uck, flanders! gimme that!"
40904,Homer,"yeah, at the worst possible time."
22043,Homer,i'm not worthy to live among civilized people.
32708,Homer,"oh boy, dinner time! the perfect break between work and drunk."
34298,Homer,"me neither. for once, the simpsons were in management!"
37003,Homer,here's something to pass the endless time. write down which celebrities were rumored to be gay for future generations.
23837,Homer,howdy. and thanks for not recoiling in horror.
39913,Homer,gee whiz. adil would get a kick out of seeing this.
21161,Homer,do they do any other tricks?
18665,Homer,he's not lost.
33620,Homer,"sweetie, any place i'm marrying you is the most romantic place in the world."
25724,Homer,everyone's having fun but me.
35639,Homer,"i'm having problems with my new boss roz. she's the most evil person to come out of ohio since lebron, but at least he thought long and hard before screwing everybody over, in public for no reason."
18841,Homer,"troy, buddy, i gotta know. what's a great guy like you wanna marry a guy like selma?"
20504,Homer,"hey, dad. i've come to spend some time with my favorite father."
23427,Homer,duelling at dawn? how did it ever come to this?
32920,Homer,"marge, your back is so sweaty. i'm starting to slip off."
39407,Homer,privately?
36431,Homer,"when i was in special ops, they held me in an afghan prison where all i could see was a patch of blue sky. but that blue was nothing compared with the blue of your eyes."
23625,Homer,"c'mon, maggie. you can trust me."
34484,Homer,that's some big underwear.
27714,Homer,god yes!
28498,Homer,that's the birthday i'm always forgetting. i must have it!
29459,Homer,... marge?
18375,Homer,"well, that's a plus."
18344,Homer,"hey, where's charlie? how'd he get out of this?"
36253,Homer,"ah, here it is: hydraulic systems flush... eeprom bios autoboot... conversation mode? they can talk?!"
26820,Homer,"i was trying to throw bart over the roof, and he got stuck in this tree."
29055,Homer,i've run out of pie-related puns!
39935,Homer,four.
40315,Homer,my wife and kids stood by me. on the way home i realized how little that helped.
28248,Homer,candlepin bowling? that's a great idea. we'll play right after i break your grandmother out of prison.
28745,Homer,ee-yow!
26630,Homer,"marge, i just realized: i am the ""ow"" in the word ""now"". and if you tell anyone..."
39022,Homer,what about the chocolate?
24740,Homer,"sheesh, look at these refugees. how 'bout a smile?"
27110,Homer,for serious?
15912,Homer,"gotta get a juicer. gonna drink juice, lose weight. won't get chest pain from answering the phone anymore."
36036,Homer,two can play at that game.
14267,Homer,because i knocked you up?
29289,Homer,"that's ridiculous, honey. you're the cutest little girl i know. you just have what is known as the simpson butt. permit me to elaborate."
23226,Homer,"well, if you want one, they sell 'em at..."
29822,Homer,the guards are sadistic and cruel!
38831,Homer,what are you doing here?
15284,Homer,do you come with the car?
23859,Homer,"so when dean peterson opens his door, this bucket of super glue is gonna drop right on his head..."
32462,Homer,do you like guys who are... attractive?
29249,Homer,fine.
37786,Homer,and now to sing you a lullaby my father sung to me:
31088,Homer,i'm so happy we're together again. wanna get a drink?
24642,Homer,"thank you, marge. now, let's see how olde snobfield does without electricity."
20128,Homer,flushing meadows...
37643,Homer,"i'm an idiot! of course! i get marge to marry moe, then i kill moe, then she gets the ring, then i marry her, and the ring is mine. and the brilliance of my plan is its simplicity!"
22672,Homer,like what?
27848,Homer,"it is to me! marge, i can't live like this! i'm tired of walking around on eggshells."
22588,Homer,"19-- 1939?! oh my god, i've gone back in time!"
21633,Homer,"all week, my life long dream was to be the next thomas edison, but now it's over. i guess i'll just give up my hopes and dreams and settle for being a decent husband and father."
25716,Homer,"hey man, you're harshin' my buzz. anyway it all started when..."
32626,Homer,i can't stand to see a grown burger cry. we must rebuild fast food boulevard!
30872,Homer,there's a chance we won't win?
18628,Homer,"so, anyone here from... evergreen terrace?"
30665,Homer,"oh my god, i forgot to get marge a present!"
37466,Homer,i just need to get closer.
36688,Homer,my dad had furniture?! i don't know him at all!
37485,Homer,"sorry, carl. it's world war ii all over again -- america kicks iceland's ass."
24789,Homer,"uh, no thanks. i'll just eat it here."
30089,Homer,"c'mon, lisa. no one in this family is being left below."
22981,Homer,i'm hot... so very hot...
33454,Homer,"baby, i hope you've got snuggle insurance, 'cause i'm about to file a claim."
39960,Homer,uh... i'd like some flowers.
25666,Homer,"hey, she's coming this way!"
25075,Homer,"school, please."
35622,Homer,i thought of it first.
21497,Homer,thank you...
15864,Homer,i'll bet you'd trade it all for one night with my wife.
37483,Homer,"sorry, lenny."
13622,Homer,"look, marge, that guy has the same last name we do... taxi!"
31258,Homer,"look, i understand that you're mad. which makes now the perfect time to tell you the mayor's hired us to fix the old springfield roller coaster."
24444,Homer,sorry.
25110,Homer,"c'mon, marge. we're a team! it's uter-us, not uter-you."
18677,Homer,"jerry, i think you and i are gonna get along just fi--"
38267,Homer,best recess ever!
36835,Homer,"in my house, we found human bones."
27051,Homer,"what? wait a... that can't be right! wait, was last night the night we set the clocks ahead eight hours?"
31122,Homer,now you can only see butts on cable.
32394,Homer,the cornerstones of the brewish faith.
24801,Homer,am i glad to see you guys. you gotta call...
36499,Homer,"sweetie, i've been thinking. now, this all started because you used a fake name to defend yourself. the problem's not that you were cheating...it's that you got caught."
40042,Homer,i was right.
38759,Homer,"i think i can answer for apu. he's flattered, but the small-time success of covercraft is all that any of us have ever wanted."
24581,Homer,anything to get out of work.
26719,Homer,"stupid ""bart-toon""! bart-toon, that's clever. i'm gonna kill him!"
33533,Homer,"aw, rats in the kitchen. just like that delightful movie i taped in the theater."
30387,Homer,i don't know. i kept away from maggie all day.
16655,Homer,your old meat made me sick!
19798,Homer,"attaway, son! you made your old man proud!"
32420,Homer,snow white teeth and lips so red / she's the wilma to my fred
22276,Homer,wooooo! 'topes ruuuule!
22960,Homer,"oh, yeah! and i'm not easily impressed. wow! a blue car!"
33939,Homer,"nag, nag, nag."
13831,Homer,"it's good that you made that awful thing, bart. it's real good."
16020,Homer,"ooh, ice creamville."
33880,Homer,"well, if you see him in heaven, tell him he sucks."
31041,Homer,jogging?!
36919,Homer,"okay, okay. i'll be nicer to the dude. i've just never really been a dog person."
17016,Homer,what?!
30806,Homer,"hey moe! thanks to you, i've been sober a week!"
21889,Homer,"get off, you stupid dog!"
36309,Homer,lovin' it!
37650,Homer,"dear, i am not the jealous type. and from you, i have learned to feel compassion for these disgustos."
32442,Homer,"um, so... tell me about your day."
25630,Homer,"symmetry, eh?"
22625,Homer,hm. that thought never occurred to me. funny how your mind works in a crisis.
19486,Homer,"here i come, buddy! no more loneliness for homer and earl...."
34082,Homer,"oh sweetie, i found you! now, who's gonna find us? help!"
14306,Homer,we got a great big con-voy / rockin' through the night / we got a great big con-voy / ain't she a beautiful sight / con-voy
18421,Homer,i could sit in the aisle.
27967,Homer,i always thought cats were just for losers who live in apartments until my life was saved by this sweet little kitty.
28765,Homer,"if you can read this you're almost as smart as my baby. i'm slappin' this sucker right over ""support our troops."""
32495,Homer,sold!
32267,Homer,i think it goes here.
19484,Homer,the loneliest man in the world! he'll understand me!
29796,Homer,"oh my god! that man might be hurt! guards, there's a prisoner in there!"
36352,Homer,"okay, but if this house starts a-rockin', don't come a-knockin'."
14418,Homer,not duff dry... dallas.
15414,Homer,u.s.a.! u.s.a.! u.s.a.!...
20693,Homer,and their damp-trousered pa.
15908,Homer,should i whack slow or fast?
16570,Homer,... and if a group of responsible adults can't handle firearms in a responsible way...
13463,Homer,now let's get the show on the road.
30343,Homer,lisa!
18962,Homer,"and when i listen to a really good song, i start nodding my head, like i'm saying ""yes!"" to every beat. ""yes, yes, yes this rocks!"" and then sometimes i switch it up like ""no, no, no, don't stop a-rockin'..."""
39951,Homer,don't be ridiculous. my wife worships the ground i walk on.
32163,Homer,"oh yes, of course."
28946,Homer,shut up! i didn't tell you to say that!
19745,Homer,"ohmygod! ohmygod! ohmygod! ohmygod! i danced with a gay! marge, lisa, promise me you won't tell anyone. promise me!"
17731,Homer,"don't worry, joey. we'll make it to california some day."
40232,Homer,i was only reading what the card...
19186,Homer,no problemo.
40637,Homer,nothing. it'll just upset them. i want my last hours of family life to be happy ones.
30832,Homer,old man flanders!
17047,Homer,"ew. okay, let's get started."
25788,Homer,"hey, wait a minute. ""airport tax, five dollars?"""
39880,Homer,give me the old stars and stripes.
27948,Homer,"don't worry, son. i'll build you a new treehouse. one so grand it'll be an affront to god himself."
19049,Homer,all right.
24518,Homer,"helloooo, iowa! does anyone have a donut?"
21809,Homer,alec baldwin and kim basinger?!
41231,Homer,swish!
32057,Homer,okay.
14291,Homer,"aw, ain't that cute... hey!"
41113,Homer,huh?
18745,Homer,"well, nice talking to you."
38533,Homer,lucky.
37653,Homer,"to you, marge. now you are one of us."
33645,Homer,malge! ahmiss oo. ahmiss oo so mug...
31511,Homer,your present is leaving.
23669,Homer,mine tasted like strawberry.
24119,Homer,"okay homer, don't panic. let me do the talking."
36278,Homer,"axels to axels, rust to rust, amen."
31996,Homer,don't... give snake... attention... it's what... he really... wants.
36385,Homer,"swiss cheese. marge, how come you're not saying anything?"
27823,Homer,"hey, what's this? ""marge's memory chest."""
18025,Homer,now it's two sets of twins.
31322,Homer,"lisa, that was just a radio show."
41076,Homer,"no, my cookie!"
40719,Homer,i love watching the bald guy argue with the fat tub of lard.
41166,Homer,"marge, marge. look at me! my clothes are just hanging off me!"
21204,Homer,sorry ned. i didn't see you down there. got him.
34116,Homer,"yeah. it sounded like naked bacon to me. i don't know why they say you're the dumb guy, tom."
20226,Homer,oooh.
21249,Homer,"well, ray patterson thinks you should do it! animals are crapping in our houses, and we're picking it up. did we lose a war? that's not america. that's not even mexico."
33935,Homer,you. you watch.
40976,Homer,"because... ... i'm your baby brother, homer!"
34120,Homer,now to seal you in for safety.
31679,Homer,i will! i will be rich! i'll own a football team and a basketball team and i'll make them play baseball!
31475,Homer,"and i hate the cutesy way you make jack-o-lanterns! i like scary halloween, not funny halloween!"
35234,Homer,"yes, sir."
22021,Homer,"pork chops, sloppy joes, hot dogs, and pork chops?"
40740,Homer,maybe we should get together some time.
24009,Homer,"cheer up, son. i thought you looked damn good out there. oh, wait. you were number ""5""? eew! you stin... damn good."
37253,Homer,"oh yeah. i say ""union"" you say ""power""! union..."
20572,Homer,"oh angel, listen not to this child of satan."
37544,Homer,it's in drugtown. not the nice part.
30995,Homer,i've got an idea: climb into my mouth.
28211,Homer,oh my god!
15265,Homer,uhh... can't you see i'm reading the uh...
16675,Homer,outrageous.
22815,Homer,"yeah, that's one fine-looking barbecue pit... why doesn't mine look like that?!"
33915,Homer,"yeah, well you don't always have time to masturbate ."
31133,Homer,"what a game! i got on the kiss-cam, i participated in ""the wave,"" and i got to pee in a trough! marge, can we get a trough?"
31696,Homer,i just thought for once i could be the cool guy in your movie. but all i am is the guy who makes everyone else look good.
15681,Homer,"and if that doesn't work, six simple words: ""i'm not gay, but i'll learn."""
21113,Homer,"so if my cover gets blown and i need help, what's the signal?"
31257,Homer,"...i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry, infinity. i never expected them to climb on the cabinet and ride it down the biggest hill in town."
38490,Homer,jebus loves tebow.
18220,Homer,i got it! madman moe's pressure cooker!
20378,Homer,"ooo, the gun club's gonna be here any minute!"
19452,Homer,hiya.
30376,Homer,why would you do that? are you a bad parent?
29236,Homer,"you know, black dracula is now a congressman from virginia."
32231,Homer,"that's it! let me make something very clear: my heart belongs to marge and you can never, ever have it. this opera's over when the fat man sings."
30910,Homer,"i've had enough of your stinkin' thinkin'. i, homer simpson, will personally bring the new pro football franchise to springfield."
27234,Homer,"finally, i'm no longer a slave to the gillette corporation."
14488,Homer,can you believe it? pretty soon i'll be able to quit my job and live off the boy.
31042,Homer,sweet!
16794,Homer,heh heh. ow.
23623,Homer,"you're a tough cookie, maggie, but i'm gonna win you over. just like i did with lisa."
31640,Homer,"parents who are still alive, i might add."
28424,Homer,"wrong again, liberal media."
32759,Homer,when you cut 'em they multiply -- i can't fight that! now let's take care of those raccoons.
15184,Homer,itchy's a jerk.
31771,Homer,"here i am on the space shuttle, orbiting earth."
23576,Homer,"hey, this was supposed to be about me. now, any other questions? pumpkin face? headgear? chicken pox? smelly? lazy eye? spikey head? okay, class dismissed. rock on!"
25135,Homer,"ladies and gentlemen, i give you your moron!"
23537,Homer,"oh, i'm twenty-six hours late for work. no time for maggie."
27405,Homer,"oh, marge. you're not gettin' it, it's me. homer. simpson."
16083,Homer,"uh, excuse me ""professor brainiac,"" but i worked in a nuclear power plant for ten years and uh, i think i know how a proton accelerator works."
29578,Homer,bart's gone! i checked everywhere!
16894,Homer,"then that's what i'll do, smart guy."
15479,Homer,"well, you kids are old enough to know the truth and i'm not gonna sugarcoat it."
35741,Homer,the troll twins of underbridge academy.
22846,Homer,is it about pies?
31272,Homer,"sure, i'll tell them the truth..."
38958,Homer,"um, mrs. simpson?"
31893,Homer,i'll write you a check.
27914,Homer,"he's your perky, peppy nightmare neighborino!"
25737,Homer,"yeah, well. how was the concert?"
38924,Homer,"okay, marge. we can go to the circus. maybe i can finally find out why a man would think a stool is a proper defense against a lion."
33254,Homer,dynamite?! they are terrorists! must leave quietly.
27988,Homer,"a plan, eh? okay, we'll use a plan."
37250,Homer,your famous murmur. you know .
16672,Homer,what? that's your job. if he starts doing lisa's wood chopping...
39894,Homer,uh... maybe. hold on a second.
34490,Homer,wow. so this is what it feels like to be a pregnant lady.
23969,Homer,"they're the greatest heroes of all. hey, something's clawing at my leg. okay, it stopped."
31203,Homer,"thank you, doctor. marge?"
16120,Homer,"actually, i've been working on a plan. during the exam, i'll hide under some coats and hope that somehow everything will work out."
25883,Homer,"c'mon, hug me..."
33094,Homer,"marge bouvier, will you not marry me?"
17428,Homer,"oh, gotta go. innocent!"
38791,Homer,okay! okay! i'll stay for one beer.
32103,Homer,please tell me you're joking -- it's the difference between champagne and carbonated pee.
16884,Homer,"now i've had my head in an elephant, a hippo and a giant sloth."
39136,Homer,"marge, which can makes me look cooler? the drizzler or mr. drip?"
37729,Homer,can you give me the morphine forever?
34392,Homer,he's going for the record! he's going for the record!
21841,Homer,"oh, it was so great. i didn't have to fake it with them. i was actually excited to hear about their day."
39598,Homer,what?
25190,Homer,what are you looking at?
15056,Homer,but i think she'll win.
18760,Homer,what a jip.
21214,Homer,"this is a very, very proud day for us, especially me. your father, me, beat city hall. it's just like david and goliath, only this time david won."
34809,Homer,hyah! hyah!
15521,Homer,maybe.

21662,Homer,i needed my power fix.
37399,Homer,i know c.p.r.
37998,Homer,"hey, everybody!"
14906,Homer,"excuse me, marge. i think that if you told me i would remember! i mean i'm not an idiot!"
30469,Homer,"wha? hey, you..."
30363,Homer,"although if we were evil spirits, we'd probably assume the shape of your parents."
40847,Homer,oooh. pizza.
21831,Homer,unbelievable?
15834,Homer,"oh. well, thanks for your time."
34045,Homer,"""lick... eyes."" um, i'll try again. ""spank... hair."" what the? ""whisper into... ass."" this game sucks!"
37937,Homer,the hell you are! piracy is stealing! you're taking money out of my family's mouths.
32663,Homer,"with the nineties drawing to a close, and the sydney olympics to look forward to, our love rekindled..."
16582,Homer,return to your homes and places of businesses!
21239,Homer,can't someone else do it?
37327,Homer,"oh. well, you know how in the special olympics they give medals just for showing up?"
18574,Homer,"five hundred dollars?! no problem. would you take an out-of-state, two-party bad check?"
15093,Homer,and that is that.
32208,Homer,"wow, praise from placido domingo."
18541,Homer,"or what? you'll release the dogs? or the bees? or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? well go ahead, do your worst."
16767,Homer,"oh, those golden grahams/ oh, those golden grahams/ crispy crunchy graham cereal brand new breakfast treat."
13741,Homer,"marge, the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding."
20189,Homer,no problem. i'll just give her a sip of beer. come on maggie -- it's miller time! yes-it's-mil-ler-time!
22834,Homer,so you'd better catch the fever. catch it...
17581,Homer,next.
36735,Homer,you really should tweet less.
25985,Homer,i don't get it.
15852,Homer,"marge, i never graduated from high school."
28225,Homer,"give me a hug, you."
36743,Homer,"you're making me mad and i want, i want to shoot you now! / i don't have to see it."
26323,Homer,"well, i don't know. the demolition derby is next month..."
36763,Homer,oh yeah!

18417,Homer,nuts to that. i'm going to the movies.
18402,Homer,"""decalcify calcium ducts?"" well, gimme a y. gimme a--"
29501,Homer,"marge, i just wanna say: if you ever feel like cheating on moe, here's my card."
30196,Homer,"how can we afford any of these private schools? they're all so expensive. if we want to throw good money after bad, why don't we just get grampa that new pacemaker?"
17511,Homer,"the last bar in springfield. if they don't let me in here, i'm gonna have to quit drinking."
27869,Homer,why you little...!
25989,Homer,teenage vandals smashing the bar! moe's gonna kill me.
36412,Homer,"yeah, dr. cain, the thing about that is... there aren't any weapons."
24693,Homer,there.
19385,Homer,"eh, one out of twenty-five ain't bad."
31284,Homer,"if he's so smart, how come he can't stay outta my mouth?"

39726,Homer,just a statue? is the statue of liberty just a statue? is the leaning tower of piza just a statue?
36245,Homer,"so, workin' hard or hardly workin'?"
19290,Homer,"let me finish. we could tear it down, but we'd be tearing down a part of ourselves..."
37310,Homer,i like that picture of the sneaker with wings. i'm gonna flee!
19007,Homer,"but the main thing is, i've finally tapped into that spirit of self-destruction that makes rock 'n' roll the king of musics."

15796,Homer,god bless those pagans.
36470,Homer,"you really put on a great reception, marge. it's like the happy flashback in a gritty cop thriller."
23347,Homer,hey maude! look who's helping me clean the chimney.

17855,Homer,"when will you australians learn? in america, we've stopped using corporal punishment, and things have never been better. the streets are safe. old people strut confidently through the darkest alleys. and the weak and nerdy are admired for their computer programming abilities. so, like us, let your children run wild and free. because, as the old saying goes, let your children run wild and free. now boy, run back to the embassy! back to american soil!"
31862,Homer,"sweetie, are you here to forgive me?"
35293,Homer,go ahead -- just try to provoke me.
18415,Homer,"hey, what are you kids looking at?"
35366,Homer,"aw, can't we stay one more day? the occurrence and i are going to the tanning salon and get oiled and broiled."
21411,Homer,"closed, eh? so getting in would be a pretty big risk. what do you say, honey? feeling stupid? i know i am."
15057,Homer,"hey, nobody's prettier than my little girl."
36665,Homer,we're here to see abe simpson.
40657,Homer,no. let me hear you play.
26432,Homer,"look bart, sometimes dogs, or people, hate you for no reason."
23890,Homer,wait! hang on!
39115,Homer,marge! stop that crazy thing!
16684,Homer,and we've all found happiness... every one of us.
37423,Homer,sausage fingers!
28611,Homer,"not so rough, bart. daddy can't handle so much love right now."
19301,Homer,"oh, we can't afford that. who do you think i am, liz taylor?"
19010,Homer,"thank you! and remember: don't trust anyone over thirty. and now, peter frampton!"
19564,Homer,marge! how could you?
34610,Homer,"god created the devil? finally, he did something cool."
28046,Homer,"no, wait. it's still my ass. but your point is well taken. you see..."
36178,Homer,now that's what i call looking out for number one.
24688,Homer,"i said, it's... ohhh..."
20110,Homer,ooohh...
18518,Homer,"eighteen seconds, hmph. if this were really a nuclear war, we'd all be dead meat by now. say, you're all shivering. are you cold or what?"
23832,Homer,bart! leave some for rod and todd!
15741,Homer,the other day i was so desperate for a beer i snuck into the football stadium and ate the dirt under the bleachers.
37345,Homer,anger's a mood!
19655,Homer,"good for you, son. giving up smoking is one of the hardest things you'll ever have to do. have a dollar."
16785,Homer,i know i shouldn't eat thee but... mmmm... sacri-licious.
14647,Homer,and i'll be right here watching tv.
21813,Homer,i'll do that! you go upstairs and have a beer.
30170,Homer,last-diddily-ast? he's gone! and it's all someone's fault!
25007,Homer,i guess we'll just have to haul the check back to headquarters. too bad we couldn't just give it to these nice folks.
13247,Homer,i tried the broccoli again.
22139,Homer,"all right, fat tony. if it's trouble with quimby you're after--"
21660,Homer,"all right. one for ""resident""..."
38740,Homer,i almost forgot the most important thing.
29433,Homer,"all right, i'm comin' back there."
21941,Homer,that's no fun.
38844,Homer,okay! we're there! finally!
38995,Homer,"marge, an eagle is our country's mascot. fighting him is like kicking george washington in his wooden nuts!"
17348,Homer,"ah, sorry bart, lisa and i are going out for gelato. we'd ask you to come but, you know..."
25446,Homer,"man, he really hates wayne rogers."

32799,Homer,"how could a man just abandon his family? by which i mean, what is the method he would use and could anyone do it?"
29604,Homer,now begins the long and spiritual journey to becoming an ordained minister.
31920,Homer,mood swings?! mood swings. mood swings!
21991,Homer,"hey, i'm trying to drive here!"
24516,Homer,"ohhhh, mister. porky."
19741,Homer,"oh, a swinging bachelor, eh? well, there's lots of foxy ladies out there..."
36297,Homer,"oh, this is the life."
41394,Homer,goodbye!
19521,Homer,so?
31055,Homer,"yes, now you do."
13370,Homer,"no, you don't!"
13499,Homer,"now bart, you keep an eye out for the mailman. just give me some kind of signal."
21945,Homer,"he zinged you, marge."
36615,Homer,"i'll take it from here, wing-man."
34320,Homer,oh my! a child who doesn't enjoy school? hello? hollywood?! you want to buy the movie rights to this incredible story? a million dollars? deal! now i have to write it.

39298,Homer,i don't want to leave till our dog finishes.
35365,Homer,"y'know selma, from what i've seen here, fat tony has a lot of bad influences on him. i walked though a door last night and they were playing cards for real money."
31491,Homer,"lady, you're nice, but i'm married."
34584,Homer,"hey, i'd do anything for a sweet intelligent mammal, by which i mean you."
24965,Homer,what the?!
39010,Homer,die!
29974,Homer,youth? i hate them. secondly...
28844,Homer,"ahh, summer in tuscany."
34735,Homer,i wish. what the hell are you doing?!
17973,Homer,wow. i'll never drink another beer.
18763,Homer,"oh, it's not your fault, honey. i'm supposed to be the responsible one. i shouldn't have let you let me get carried away."
29191,Homer,"marge, i'm pullin' an all-nighter for my little girl. put on a pot of coffee, drink it and start makin' burgers."
17697,Homer,the next few weeks at my dream job were like a wonderful waking coma.
37647,Homer,"let me worry about how. but you know, you could make his last day a happy one. and the ring is just the icing on the cake."
35692,Homer,fun me... fun me... fun me...
16922,Homer,forget it. that elephant cost me thousands of dollars.
25727,Homer,"this place is so boring. i've gotta do something to keep from going crazy. i know, i'll breed the pets. to each other."
37680,Homer,i think i just might have what you're looking for.
30510,Homer,"oh yeah, oh sure, it's easy to point out my faults. it's a little harder to shut up."
34573,Homer,why couldn't i be eaten by a giraffe? that would be fun!
13689,Homer,"homer simpson, sir."
33285,Homer,what about the bridge?
35652,Homer,little help?
24305,Homer,"well, forget it, guys. i am not barney!"

16799,Homer,"we won! we won! flanders, we won!"
24146,Homer,done.
40056,Homer,"uh, i'd like to charge that dimoxinil stuff to my health insurance?"
33534,Homer,"ooh, he's controlling me with my hair, using me to cook a delicious sole meuniere with a celery root puree and carrots vichy."
23297,Homer,whew.
18918,Homer,hey... how come my pay is so low?
38357,Homer,"have a good day, you two! don't be me!"
37297,Homer,beats drowning.
29332,Homer,"oh honey, her life can't compare to yours. you've got three kids, a tv tray from expo sixty-seven, and you're married to king stink!"
20629,Homer,"oh, you will, honey. you will."
20657,Homer,"outta my way, snow-poke!"
21544,Homer,bringin' up the rear.
38500,Homer,relation ship. it works two ways. pretty good. pret-ty good.
34852,Homer,look what maggie got!
35921,Homer,"oh marge, don't worry. people know i'm doing a character, like stephen colbert, or newt gingrich."
13687,Homer,"uh, well actually, moe..."
18767,Homer,i think smithers picked me because of my motivational skills. everyone always says they have to work a lot harder when i'm around.
22032,Homer,"well, actually i-- hey! quit harvesting me with your eyes!"
34436,Homer,"because when you get down to it, aren't all religions the same? they tell you what to eat, when to pray... how this imperfect clay that we call man can mold itself to resemble the divine. but we can never attain that ultimate grace while there is hatred in our hearts for each other."
25479,Homer,you read my mind. sooo...
22234,Homer,we are so dead.
39248,Homer,prancer...
34917,Homer,"kids, remember when i promised to feed us from that victory garden? well, instead i grew this tree!"
37501,Homer,is this everyone?
16129,Homer,"oh, marge. you're worse than that crusty old dean."
37606,Homer,how'd you get in here?
25276,Homer,"do-i-have-cooties? no. oh, this home testing kit saved me a fortune."
16834,Homer,they're fine.
17283,Homer,urge to kill rising.
29050,Homer,"no, i shouldn't."
38116,Homer,"young lady, in my day..."
24216,Homer,that one.
39850,Homer,ahhhhhh!
16851,Homer,"stop it! stop it! stop it! how dare you talk about ned flanders like that! he's a wonderful, kind, caring man. maybe even more so than me. there have been times when i've lost patience with him, even lashed out at him. but this man has turned every cheek on his body. if everyone here were like ned flanders, there'd be no need for heaven. we'd already be there."
24328,Homer,okay.
29409,Homer,that's him to a t!
37977,Homer,"i'll let you try them on, right after i decide if these videos are ""funny or die"". funny, funny, die, die, funny, funny but the guy died..."
23140,Homer,"she's always doing that, mel."
18697,Homer,"marge, did you know that kennedy and lincoln had the same handicap?"
35887,Homer,"you can check my carry-on, but you can't check my spirit! and why is there moisture between the windows?! and don't wake me up to land! just land!"
32568,Homer,who was it with?
21699,Homer,"woo hoo! marge, they found a donor! i'm saved!"
32612,Homer,oh right. just leave! but kick like a rockette!
17896,Homer,request permission to slink by.
23629,Homer,that's a great idea. we'll swim in the ocean.
22116,Homer,"oh, get that away from me!"
13941,Homer,woo-hoo!
18926,Homer,"you know what, apu... i am really, really gonna miss you."

18751,Homer,"oh yeah? well, put this in your fife and smoke it!"
40005,Homer,sure.
37743,Homer,everyone has a cellphone. mine's at home.
37020,Homer,"you got to watch a vhs copy of ""red dawn"" thirteen times. stop complaining."
40497,Homer,"ohhh, thank god. thank god. thank god."
27596,Homer,"finally, someone explains it to me in words i can understand. look, boy. i know i did wrong and i am truly sorry."
30352,Homer,you know that racecar bed i made him?
13371,Homer,"marge, just puttin' a few last things in the trunk."
40539,Homer,they're forcing 'em.
28212,Homer,"marge, wake up! the newspaper is talking to me!"
36135,Homer,what? no! it can't be!
34520,Homer,flanders! wake up! take off your clothes and prepare to be raptured.
33554,Homer,catholics!
36435,Homer,i already have my part: man who buys ticket but doesn't show up.
26764,Homer,what's a eunuch?
28198,Homer,"bart, you're not at school. don't swear!"
13696,Homer,"oh, i get it. it's not good enough for you, but it's good enough for me! well, i wouldn't be caught dead buying this... hello!"
22299,Homer,i have a problem.
36403,Homer,"my feet hurt, and my neck is cold."
32891,Homer,"oh, i don't even care."
30527,Homer,every man for himself! trample if you must!
34446,Homer,woo hoo! i'm drinking my salary!
35406,Homer,right.
21324,Homer,"look at you people. bart's a tub, lisa's weak as a little girl, and maggie doesn't seem to be growing at all."
33424,Homer,"ooh, that sounds like fun!"
14976,Homer,"like fun i don't. marge, i'm never going to church again."
37459,Homer,our money's gone.
32810,Homer,"oh, i see. it's reverse psychology. well in that case i'm not going and i'm not staying. and i'll cut my steak with a spoon, then take a walk on the ceiling."
14497,Homer,the hell with this!
35586,Homer,ow!
22166,Homer,"well, we'll see about that."
16151,Homer,"blah, bla..."

27016,Homer,gotta find a way to change marge back. and replace the m&ms i took from the mini bar.
26008,Homer,that's it!
39496,Homer,wait a minute. these mallet things are padded with foam rubber. what's the point?
36879,Homer,"okay, you win. we don't have to be friends, but can we live on the fringes of your world? like those eels that eat whale poop?"
39331,Homer,"doc, this is all too much. i mean, my son a genius -- how does it happen?"
19928,Homer,can do.
35772,Homer,"so long, sector 7-g...hello, sector 22-f!"

17933,Homer,call off the debt?
15193,Homer,"hand me my patching trowel, boy."
23881,Homer,yeah.
41583,Homer,where's bongo? is he still at the crazy lady's...

33081,Homer,occupied!
23375,Homer,"geez, marge, tell the neighborhood."
17882,Homer,that was in the third grade.
28411,Homer,"no way. if something happens to me, you have to carry on the simpson name."
35238,Homer,let's just leave the crazy woman alone in our house. we've got something more important to attend to.
22180,Homer,"well, well, well. so flawless flanders needs help from stinky-pants simpson."
26784,Homer,you might hear from your friends or co-workers that apu isn't living at home anymore.
41328,Homer,woo hoo!
35715,Homer,"all right, you can each have one toy."
39049,Homer,on a miami dolphins helmet the little dolphin is also wearing a helmet.
25399,Homer,"so, how's that new block i got you?"
35575,Homer,you guys need to get a woman.
27811,Homer,"oh, that takes me back."

21312,Homer,"ow! ow! ow! boy, am i feeling this. ow! oh, my head's gonna be sore in the morning. ow!"
31459,Homer,"marge? i have an apology that i hope is better than all the other ones. so please listen carefully. the thing i liked best about being an ice cream man wasn't the free ice cream, or the colorful toppings, or the love i received from obese children. it was giving you those sticks, and watching you smile as you turned them into art."
24330,Homer,"oh, no! that's bart and lisa!"
37365,Homer,touché.
39926,Homer,"the reason i look unhappy is that tonight i have to see a slide show starring my wife's sisters -- or as i call them, ""the gruesome twosome."""
17517,Homer,but i -
30523,Homer,"look, lisa. i made safety happen!"
24348,Homer,yeah. so what do you call this stuff?
26675,Homer,"start inhalin', waylon."
19062,Homer,"oh my god, marge, it's escaped!"
22257,Homer,"you're right, you're right. fifty spaceships, beamed us aboard. they gang-probed you, while i discovered an invention that blew their heads up and saved america."
39502,Homer,arrrgh!
35309,Homer,what?!
28400,Homer,but how will i find out what you had for lunch in nineteen twenty-eight?
24280,Homer,see? a new pacifier for maggie.
30462,Homer,"three hundred and six, three hundred and seven..."
14572,Homer,"no, no, no! i don't want you to see me sitting on my butt."
24209,Homer,i know. i'm a character. now a little beer music to get in the mood.
41534,Homer,this book sucks so much.
41469,Homer,you're lookin' at him.
24942,Homer,"oh, it's wonderful."
31887,Homer,"sex problem, eh?"
18836,Homer,troy mcclure? he's a washed-up movie star. he could be dating washed-up supermodels.
40546,Homer,uh-oh...
39618,Homer,on my honor.
19471,Homer,uh-oh. i guess you're cranky because i didn't come home last night...
15327,Homer,"flanders, i thought i was your plow man."
28690,Homer,how can you write such horrible things about me?
34222,Homer,hm. not as much money as there used to be.
36680,Homer,thank you mr. papadapaconstanti-kasgianopolopodopotopolis.
20467,Homer,"aww... you know, tomorrow's the championship game and i could sure use a good offensive tackle."
26295,Homer,rainbows... tank tops... empowerment... this is the gay pride parade! woo hoo!

27042,Homer,"oh, you'd like that wouldn't you, ya..."
41086,Homer,type! type!
27620,Homer,you monster! why did you expel boogerman?
35198,Homer,i've failed as a parent. i swore the day my son was born he would appreciate stoner comedy. to the media room!
18444,Homer,hey everybody! up here!
21004,Homer,fired. i can't believe it.
22763,Homer,"no problem, lord. and it would be even easier to avoid that temptation if i had a few extra wives."
32939,Homer,god bless america!
24451,Homer,would it get me out of having to choose glasses?
40814,Homer,i gotta get outta here.
14337,Homer,"lousy, stupid denver."
27602,Homer,it's nice to see a realistic single woman on tv.
27795,Homer,duh-uh.
33483,Homer,it's so beautiful. no two are exactly alike. though many of them are very similar.
22615,Homer,wha?!
38739,Homer,i don't know guys. i'm not sure i'm feeling this. the bass is kind of known for being a solo instrument.
38060,Homer,"oh, i know what that means. there comes a time when a boy sneaks his first beer. finally! i was beginning to think that kid was a teetotaler."
20619,Homer,that old flanders place gives me the creeps.
19634,Homer,we could build snowmen.
34302,Homer,"time for bed, sweetie."
25714,Homer,"i don't know, i'm still a little hazy."
19833,Homer,"nah, i'm really more of a slacker."
20820,Homer,"yes, it would be nice if he'd buy american, but what are ya gonna do?"
29218,Homer,"hold on, maggie! daddy's coming!"
39722,Homer,are you?
14236,Homer,"hey, why don't i apply at the nuclear power plant? i hear they pay pretty well."
29980,Homer,"did you hear that foxy, the fox network fox?"
38370,Homer,hey!
20991,Homer,"woo hoo! beer, beer, beer!"
34254,Homer,and you like potato...
38483,Homer,we're not similar. i love being told what to do by someone who's wise in the ways of the world! love it!
39812,Homer,why you little --
39390,Homer,"hey, you idiot! watch where you're going!"
22787,Homer,i never used those pizza coupons.

19695,Homer,"hey, this is homer simpson sayin' ""howdy"" to all the girls out there in radioland."
24326,Homer,ta-ta.
25227,Homer,you're right. gimme a minute. hmmm.
18404,Homer,"hey, miss doesn't-find-me-attractive sexually-anymore. i just tripled my productivity."
33496,Homer,i'm the victim here!
35437,Homer,"oh, what the hell? life is made to be lived. i've been buttoned down too long!"
31131,Homer,look at that ugly old man.
40542,Homer,"ooo, classy."
29575,Homer,"boy, let me explain the situation in terms you'll understand."
17481,Homer,dad!
28362,Homer,"kids, we're going mother's day shopping! i'm glad this holiday only comes every four years."
16146,Homer,"you know, mr. burns is so cheap..."
17579,Homer,i saw weird stuff in that place last night. weird strange sick twisted eerie godless evil stuff. and i want in.
39226,Homer,"oh, thank god for the big jar."
17873,Homer,"but uh, could i just..."

36932,Homer,bongo was happy. without me. he had become her dog.
22729,Homer,"hey, bart, watch me run down this old lady."
21139,Homer,is that the trillion-dollar bill in his hand?
30582,Homer,"marge, i did it! i found a woman to be your new friend! she's waiting in the living room!"
27140,Homer,"i've grown, you haven't."
28395,Homer,are you a care bear?
22062,Homer,even the sea won't forgive me.
20487,Homer,i have this much.
18270,Homer,"marge, since i'm not talking to lisa, would you please ask her to pass me the syrup?"
23678,Homer,"apu? manjula? marge, i've got a bad feeling about this."
41141,Homer,"all right family, i want the truth. don't pull any punches. am i just a little bit overweight?"
16891,Homer,"hey, what's with them?"
34663,Homer,"stupid kid, fooled by a silhouette."
32304,Homer,all is well. goodbye forever.
16144,Homer,are you ready to laugh?
36758,Homer,"i just want to say, i was having the worst day of my life."
25091,Homer,kids.
30879,Homer,"so, what's the prize on this wife swap show?"
37359,Homer,they charged a deposit!
30769,Homer,"uh, normal wear and tear."
34666,Homer,"marge, the bathroom scale is lying again."
18102,Homer,"what're you gonna do about it? what're you gonna do? ooh, i'm officer marge, i'm gonna arrest you! whoa! etc."

18209,Homer,the springfield river!
34702,Homer,marge! you ruined my shot!
23771,Homer,get her! she's doing something!
31777,Homer,"how 'bout you, gabbo?"
17776,Homer,it must be the first of the month! new billboard day!
30324,Homer,"i think they killed each other. you know, one of those murder-suicide deals."
23934,Homer,"huh? if you can't sell beer, what are lenny and carl doing here?"
33195,Homer,"marge, i'm getting' out of the break-up business and i don't know if i'll ever sleep soundly again."
20921,Homer,no. i'm just going out to commit certain deeds.
13285,Homer,beer... for me?
38910,Homer,"but, wait a minute! that's my job!"
26615,Homer,"all right, that's it. shoo, you stupid crows! shoo! shoo! shoo!"
22853,Homer,"marge, i've screwed up everything i've ever done. i mean, look at bart. but i finally found something where people worship me for screwing up. and that feels pretty good."
30013,Homer,"good job, sweetie. every time you hit that note, i'll shoot a glass with my bb gun."
13862,Homer,"hey, do i tell you how to do your job?"
32344,Homer,why does he always bring up my weight?
36754,Homer,dogs can't get mumps.
36935,Homer,"oh my god, dad... i owe you an apology. you saved bongo. i never understood that till now."
30439,Homer,this stinks! i've got stubby little robot legs and an ass that's not equipped for an adult diet.
27006,Homer,"hey, what could be more fun than an island shaped like a big smiley face?"
32512,Homer,but i'm getting a home perm!
28503,Homer,"oh, it just needs a little love."
16509,Homer,and then i said to the president... get this marge? marge?

31030,Homer,"on second thought, i am brenda wine cooler."
16707,Homer,"look, maggie! it's sgt. thug's mountaintop command post, complete with death-bringer missiles that really launch!"
18633,Homer,"hey, big spender! / dig this blender! / rainbow suspenders!..."
37906,Homer,why should a regular guy like me have to spend fifteen bucks a ticket so studios can pay huge salaries to the air buds and ray liottas of the world?
22112,Homer,milking room? i hope you cows are decent.
34483,Homer,oh yeah. all the time. they say it's 'cause i'm overweight.
33432,Homer,great jokes make me hungry. i wonder what's in the pantry...
37509,Homer,"okay everyone, get ready to see your brand new..."
23752,Homer,"hey, why is this door locked?"
36719,Homer,my dad used to tie me up when the ice cream truck went by. and now there's no amount of ice cream that'll make me feel full. so this should work!
13778,Homer,what? what is it? what are you doing?
24570,Homer,"boy, dumping your kids in the forest sure gets your hands dusty."
23650,Homer,"kids are the best, apu. you can teach them to hate the things you hate. and they practically raise themselves, what with the internet and all."
34330,Homer,what the?! then i wanna eat at moe's express!
22155,Homer,get out of the way you--
33456,Homer,"boy, where are my zydeco records?"
28603,Homer,"oh, the beer's gone. i'll have to suck it out of the shag."
27985,Homer,my wads! i never even broke the wrapper.
18386,Homer,"i see essc, ctarl, and pig-up. there doesn't seem to be any ""any"" key. all this computer hacking is making me thirsty. i think i'll order a tab."
20442,Homer,"it's okay, son. you'll do better next time."
33532,Homer,is there any other way to enter a kitchen?
35816,Homer,"so, everybody good?"
23512,Homer,"did you see the way emile's lookin' at mindy? hoo-hoo, i think something's going on there."
33925,Homer,your other hand.
26258,Homer,woo-hoo! in your face milwaukee!
21506,Homer,"uh, yeah, but without the grease all you can taste is the hog anus."
27475,Homer,and i miss being your knight in flabby armor.
13170,Homer,"i've gotta go, i've got a date!"
13258,Homer,"bart, help! sonnn!"
33072,Homer,"that's it, boy! you're going to bed without supper!"
29676,Homer,i just felt a chill go through my very soul.
32137,Homer,stop peppering me with questions!
34203,Homer,i'm gonna make it! i'm gonna make it!
34260,Homer,"hey, we came here to enjoy the movie and we're going to enjoy the movie."
14529,Homer,"""dear baby, welcome to dumpville. population: you."""
23025,Homer,"""gigabytes!"" they've done it again. gigabytes. wait, this isn't ""weird."" why, there's no magazine called ""weird,"" is there?"
19926,Homer,"you want some puppies, eh, mr. brockman?"
37056,Homer,fine. but i swear: i will win you back from lenny.
35175,Homer,"uh, you look tense. let's discuss this over a cup of grampa's coffee."
23820,Homer,jesus?
14789,Homer,open up! open up! i gotta go and no fooling.
39652,Homer,"when you're an experienced woodsman like me, you get a feel for these things. it becomes natural. like a third sense."
17473,Homer,you're the screw-up!
17963,Homer,pull my finger.
15911,Homer,you mean there's a better way?
37475,Homer,how do you know about carl's family?
17971,Homer,"marge, i've got some serious thinking to do."
13458,Homer,"yeah, you have the right to remain silent."
30735,Homer,"i bet they're from massachusetts. you know, it's legal there for a guy to marry his son."
29849,Homer,"marge, i thought you'd never take me back after what i did to krusty."
39030,Homer,"wow. elon, you're like willie wonka without the underpaid munchkins."
37346,Homer,i don't know. it's just that you always say we should try new things. but i thought snuggle clamps just might rekindle...
33864,Homer,"thank you, friendo."
41047,Homer,y'ello.
26478,Homer,"wow, a booth. if i'm tired, i can just lie down!"
29999,Homer,interesting. it's like a corndog without the dog.
33723,Homer,"it is? 'ey every-ody, 'eck out i 'ompliment!"
25987,Homer,"i'm a walkin' down the street, gonna open moe's bar / i'm a singin' what i'm thinkin' / hey, look at that dog."
33903,Homer,"let's go around the table, and everybody say one amazing thing that happened to them today. lisa?"
37261,Homer,"c'mon, man. what's the catch?"
20535,Homer,"come on, elephant. put me down! hey, everyone seems upside down."
39015,Homer,"great. and if anyone asks where i am, just cover for me."
15721,Homer,does the lord count as a person?
14797,Homer,this sucks. where is that channel changer?
37580,Homer,can i just get a glass of water?
34231,Homer,"i said someone like me, i didn't say me."
15840,Homer,what the...
26465,Homer,"oh, my dad never even knew how i felt about him."
34139,Homer,stupid grampa. i try to end the cycle of neglect and he hits me with some super neglect!
22725,Homer,the what now?
28015,Homer,"chaka khan, let me rock you / let me rock you, chaka khan / chaka khan chaka khan..."
34470,Homer,"burns, you're coming with us."
13863,Homer,"you know, if you tip the glass, there won't be so much foam on top."
21185,Homer,kiss it.

32026,Homer,i wanna get us all in the picture this time. closer.
35421,Homer,time for a shortcut.
19769,Homer,... as a father! a father!! a regular father!! whooh!
25483,Homer,"no, i do!"
20352,Homer,"a gun is not a weapon, marge. it's a tool. like a butcher knife or a harpoon or... a... a... an alligator. you just need more education on the subject. tell you what: you come with me to an nra meeting, and if you still don't think guns are great, we'll argue some more."
24670,Homer,"c'mon, what happened to the angry, defiant who of ""my generation,"" ""won't get fooled again,"" and ""mama's got a squeeze box""?"
25886,Homer,i thought i would hate working nights. but it's so peaceful. and there's no one here to squeal on me for shootin' mice.
13161,Homer,uhhhh... ummmm...
22666,Homer,"okay, i'm ready to get out now... yoo hoo! hippie lady! hippie lady?! hey! hippie lady!"
14668,Homer,"hey, it's pretty obvious if you think about it."
29609,Homer,"okay, what's next? adam and steve or madam and eve?"
24417,Homer,"okay, now am i the only one on fire? good."

35443,Homer,"hey, kids!"
28489,Homer,i need money for christmas... can i get anything for this joe dimaggio baseball card? it's kinda old.
19748,Homer,"you know me, marge: i like my beer cold, my tv loud, and my homosexuals fla-ming."
37128,Homer,you told me it was up to me if i wanted to go!
22782,Homer,"ohhh, my back. so this must be that pain thing."
18645,Homer,i guess you might say he's barking up the wrong bush. heh heh heh.
25187,Homer,there's an air in space museum.

30586,Homer,"wait a minute... if she's going bird watching why did she leave our ""peterson's field guide to birds"" on the kitchen counter?"
37570,Homer,to texting!
37248,Homer,"here, i'll get you started. hail superman, wearing tights, clark kent be thy name... one nation, under zod..."
25947,Homer,that was close.
28694,Homer,"well, i'll make sure you never imagine anything again."
17929,Homer,yes. i am in flavor country.
14158,Homer,uh... all of them?
13729,Homer,how much does it pay?
18935,Homer,and i'm not registered!
26788,Homer,yeah! 'cause if they don't...
40355,Homer,that shot is impossible! jack nicholson himself couldn't make it.
38182,Homer,i guess i can't help but feel fully responsible.
17614,Homer,everything lasts forever.
15077,Homer,"i mean don't worry, son. i forgot to get you a present. but i swear on my father's grave..."
22690,Homer,so much steak... lungs filling... sinuses packed with meat...
31813,Homer,listen to 'em. they're on top of the world while i'm sittin' here pretending i have a stool.
17349,Homer,"wow, eye of the tiger, mouth of a teamster. to think of all the time i wasted on you... uh, well, not wasted... i love you."
14956,Homer,"let's see here... caramels, waffle batter...liquid smoke..."
19968,Homer,"c'mon, christmas tree."
33188,Homer,anyone else want me to get rid of that special someone?

15403,Homer,"patience, my pet."
26527,Homer,"this one takes place in a make-believe kingdom called ""france..."""
28872,Homer,"but you do believe it, right?"
14857,Homer,this is the greatest invention in the world! you'll make a million dollars!
26680,Homer,and now a man you will see is definitely not dead... mr. montgomery burns!
16207,Homer,more. mmmm.
36651,Homer,"a poker site is now safer than an american bank. has our nation, built on people suing because their onion rings were too hot, come to this?"
26343,Homer,unguarded breakfasts -- the sweetest taboo.
38260,Homer,i've never seen anything so beautiful.
35823,Homer,"thanks. now if you'll excuse me, i don't really like bourbon or business talk, just good old simpson family fun."
14935,Homer,shut up boy.
38058,Homer,sit. sit. sit! sit! sit!!!
38242,Homer,"oh my god. that's, that's shattering. and now, i'm a man in pain in the naughtiest city since san francisco turned all nerdy."
32692,Homer,that's my boy! now let's watch the air conditioner fight the heater!
14908,Homer,"match point, homer."
34323,Homer,"too late, marge. i already used a ""prayer block"" on your prayer."
20692,Homer,i wouldn't / i couldn't / i hate that stuff!
19546,Homer,"that's my boy. well, if you believe in me, then i'm not going to give up. i'll prove i'm right. this friday we're going back to the woods, and we're going to find that alien!"
39655,Homer,"bart! oh bart! bart, bart! oh, bart, my beautiful son. why couldn't you have taken me? of all the fates of heaven and earth, why did this one befall me?"
35518,Homer,"charlie, wanna grab a beer?"
19726,Homer,that is so true.
36578,Homer,is there any other deal that you can accept?
16265,Homer,where you going?
23201,Homer,"hi, marge. it's me, homer."
38834,Homer,woo hoo!
24543,Homer,missed me! stupid horoscope!
40419,Homer,"hi, patty. hi, selma."
32726,Homer,"c'mon, pick up, pick up! i know you're there."
15763,Homer,and make life-long connections to the world of organized crime. hmmm... organized crime.
13270,Homer,then why were you moaning last time?
15024,Homer,"you know, i have a feeling there's a lesson here."
26853,Homer,and i can ride my bike real fast.
19784,Homer,"stand aside, marge. i'm taking the boy deer hunting. he's going to grow up straight for once."
29808,Homer,i'm a prison snitch.
37757,Homer,mothers are so awesome.
30297,Homer,these are for you.
27204,Homer,let's go get fried chicken!
38141,Homer,you know it's rockin' 'cause music notes are coming out of it.
37978,Homer,"now, a simple sunday drive will reveal the hidden wonders of our hometown!"
24342,Homer,stay away from my wife!
36883,Homer,i did it! i did it! i man-hugged!
27397,Homer,of course i do. it's all my fault for refusing to pay...
16045,Homer,the bee bit my bottom. now my bottom's big! oh!
40133,Homer,so we got a good deal for once. quit fighting it.
13166,Homer,"...ooh, what a view..."

40327,Homer,holy moly! it's... it's... beautiful!
18957,Homer,"i see these kids now with ""jive"" printed on their shirts. now, i can teach you how you're supposed to say ""jive""..."
22542,Homer,you drive. i eat.
35387,Homer,"just call me ""homer fingerhands."""
23160,Homer,i second that motion...
39443,Homer,gotcha!
17105,Homer,"marge, look at me! we've been separated for a day, and i'm as dirty as a frenchman. in another few hours, i'll be dead. i can't afford to lose your trust again."
31289,Homer,still hungry.

32933,Homer,the rainforest?! that's that thing lisa likes!
39236,Homer,"hello, flanders."
34978,Homer,please! let me have it! come on! give it to me right in the mouth!
30960,Homer,i'm not a god. god has a white beard and invented the da vinci code.
13649,Homer,"don't get me wrong, it's worth feeling three inches tall to find out what kind of a person you really are. marge simpson... president of the international we love flanders fan club..."
28469,Homer,why should america consume ninety percent of the world's resources? argentina must devalue her currency to pay her debts!
13966,Homer,"yeah, give us a break, doctor."
34264,Homer,this bromance just got interesting.
36289,Homer,robots... trying to kill me... and now they'll kill you... 'cause i led them here...
34582,Homer,"ooh, maybe the blood will scare the sharks off!"
25522,Homer,so all her bullying was just to get some attention.
25223,Homer,"i can still see your movies, right?"
16314,Homer,"marge, it's the perfect exercise. it'll double the value of our house. and it was free. freeee!!"
31163,Homer,i used to be so embarrassed buying these.
18476,Homer,i thought i dreamed that kiss.
40161,Homer,"what are you lookin' at, buddy?"
35831,Homer,fatso flanagan!
30539,Homer,are you sure there wasn't a midget in his hat? i read an email that said there was.
28256,Homer,"mom, i love you! i can't let you go to prison!"
25266,Homer,"sorry, i grunted way too early."
19646,Homer,your mother seems really upset about something. i better go have a talk with her... during the commercial.
34901,Homer,"i'm sure you will, because you take such good care of your ostriches."
28908,Homer,put that sissy down!
26919,Homer,did you steal dolls from my daughter?
24840,Homer,"heavens, no!"
23327,Homer,"so what are you up to, young lady?"
31465,Homer,"marge, where are you? did you change your name? is it kelly? kelly!!!"
29834,Homer,"son, sometimes people just grow apart, like me and your mom."
27172,Homer,"oh, thanks..."
33659,Homer,"stop him, babando!"
31316,Homer,"so, it's a war of the worlds. good thing we've got the sun on our side."
40831,Homer,"hey, stop, cable man! stop!"
31267,Homer,"sweetie, you don't understand. if i can do this myself, then all those lies i told will be true. don't you want daddy's lies to be true?"
35045,Homer,i don't like those guys.
30966,Homer,it's... um... jannnn... febbbb... marrr...
26393,Homer,i'm bored. heyyy... a fair!
38344,Homer,sure.
28032,Homer,"you see? before, i probably would have driven to the syrup."
16054,Homer,"c'mon! gimme the hand, you stupid dog! c'mon! gimme' that!"
38363,Homer,and you never bought a replacement?
37745,Homer,the scene where she escapes with the cat at the end.
38650,Homer,"okay, so what are you?"
19117,Homer,all right.
38002,Homer,wait!
28945,Homer,which are you saying is dead? our marriage or our batteries?
33166,Homer,she blew it again! woo-hoo!
14114,Homer,homer simpson here.
24724,Homer,i said i was sorry.
35931,Homer,"marge, i'm going to meet with the republican establishment and pick their nominee! if there's sandwiches there, you want me to bring some back?"
39309,Homer,i'm warning you two!
41572,Homer,of course. the thing that stood between us -- the nineties -- is almost over.
40700,Homer,"oh, i can't wait any longer. hold on, marge. i'm comin' home, baby."
39203,Homer,"oh, it's lisa. that's ours."
41323,Homer,"greetings, friend. do you wish to look as..."
29385,Homer,i juiced it up a little.
18311,Homer,that's weird. it's like something out of that twilighty show about that zone.
14945,Homer,don' wanna go.
35725,Homer,a million bucks has changed stupider minds than yours.
37424,Homer,"okay guys, here's the deal -- i've gone bald."
29320,Homer,i sawed you on the television.
40208,Homer,"where are we going, sir?"
31678,Homer,"thanks, boy. hey, for old time's sake, you wanna drive me around while i sing public domain songs out the window?"
39709,Homer,what? oh yeah. you were great.
17217,Homer,no.
38783,Homer,"i'll be right home, honey. i've just got to lock down the reactor for the evening."
13175,Homer,you're superior to me in every way!
25388,Homer,what are you gonna do about it?
39992,Homer,"sheesh, eleven years ago, and you've never forgotten it."
23448,Homer,race ya to the swimmin' hole!
33130,Homer,do you have a pineapple pizza?!
41211,Homer,oh my god! a naked celebrity. be cool. don't stare at his famous wang.
15702,Homer,"to overcome the spider's curse, simply quote a bible verse. uh, thou shall not..."
32266,Homer,street cattle?
22397,Homer,"no, no, he can't be. i know, maybe he's just acting stupid to infiltrate a gang of international idiots. yeah, that's gotta be it."

31072,Homer,"no, it was the happiest night of my life! the warm spring air, the swings i took in the batting cage afterwards... don't you remember, darling?"
24568,Homer,don't worry. no child will ever starve in my home.

18026,Homer,"yes, we've waited many years, but the good lord has finally blessed us with a real family."
19226,Homer,why? it's not like anything interesting happened to anyone else today.
38442,Homer,i've had my problems with sparklers.
19842,Homer,"it's been st. patrick's day for hours and i'm still not drunk yet. oh, it's never gonna be nine o'clock."

40774,Homer,"well, a... you see the problem is, you don't know me. i have references. just ask coach flanagan, and ask mr. seckofsky and barney gumbel."
40085,Homer,"well, sir, for one thing we had a problem every tuesday, when the cafeteria would serve fish sticks."

23102,Homer,my children deserve to see me get a free gift.
28295,Homer,are you crazy? i'm not getting up at six-thirty every morning so you can prance around a frozen pond and think you're better than me!
21546,Homer,"well, here goes..."
14436,Homer,"and uh... later tonight i think you and i should uh, snuggle."
25643,Homer,it's too late.
14699,Homer,i guess so.

19459,Homer,soul mate?
35003,Homer,"oh. well, uh... you wouldn't like it. it's not very good."

38046,Homer,do you have my money?
39490,Homer,"hey, no pain, no gain."
28386,Homer,smooth.
33738,Homer,"oh, come on, relax, i won't embarrass you."
32570,Homer,"kids, your mom is with another man, and i need you to help me find out who he is. hm... is this really something i should show you kids?"
32001,Homer,"hey milhouse, who're you spying on? those bullies?"
21642,Homer,that chair might be the only one he made.
32656,Homer,but marge's education was worth all the pistol whipping in the world.
14653,Homer,"marge, that's just a suggested car size."
15140,Homer,"but marge, look at that hangdog expression. he's learned his lesson. let's get him a present."
22517,Homer,i'unno. gasoline? axes? i got some stuff in the trunk.
34774,Homer,fine. i'm going for a walk.
37167,Homer,"marge, can i get a subscription to highlights magazine?"
19614,Homer,"wow. you sure know how to cheat, mr. burns."
28744,Homer,it doesn't matter!
20162,Homer,and why is grampa here?
33054,Homer,...and beat you with one of those big thick women's magazines with all the ads in it!
35431,Homer,"well, it might have been the time when..."
28622,Homer,"you think you've got problems, look what i just pulled out of my arm!"

24085,Homer,what would you say about a man who owns his own house...
37842,Homer,the deed is done.
23895,Homer,"no, wait! i got a kid who's a miracle worker! he'll heal him up real good."
15317,Homer,"the waiting game sucks. let's play ""hungry, hungry hippos."""
24873,Homer,what a bombshell!

26342,Homer,"here's to a happy, well-rested marge!"
18023,Homer,"yes! come on, you little horse!"
14617,Homer,yeah. and one of the lassies is in there too. the mean one. the one that mauled timmy.
29498,Homer,uh... ice?
32374,Homer,"oh marge, your tentacles feel so good. wait a minute... why am i getting words in edgewise?"
29438,Homer,sure it will. all we need is a pilot!
40993,Homer,i feel the same about you.
14011,Homer,oh this isn't working at all. it's hopeless... wait a second.
13431,Homer,are you?
18191,Homer,"now wait a minute! okay, i'm not gonna win father of the year. in fact, i'm probably the last guy in the world who should have kids. wait, can i start again? fathering children is the best part of my day... i'd do anything for bart and lisa!"
20726,Homer,fry up some cheese?
22935,Homer,"could we, marge? could we get a horse?"
24776,Homer,that's the sneeze guard. you have to lean under it to get salad or sneeze on stuff.
22205,Homer,"ooh, ooh, ooh, pick him! pick him!"
23260,Homer,ooo... pointless nostalgia.
35763,Homer,"good one... uh... mr. burns, everyone is dying to hear you sing karaoke."
18252,Homer,ham?
23450,Homer,just think of 'em as cats with rabies.
29134,Homer,"no, no, no, let her finish."
29949,Homer,turn the television to what channel?
29122,Homer,"bart, pass the ketchup. bart, pass the ketchup!"
19399,Homer,because humans are obnoxious sometimes. humans hate things.
13948,Homer,no sir.
33505,Homer,"ew, that's gross."
21671,Homer,"you're going down, you--"
23151,Homer,they will if you set up that the dog is evil. all you have to do is show him doing this and people will suspect the dog.
41266,Homer,now she'll really be surprised when she opens that ironing board cover!
27989,Homer,help! help! i'm drowning!
32435,Homer,"yeah, i haven't decided what kind of new car to get."
18562,Homer,"ooo! ""snappy answers to stupid questions""! i'm great at these. ask me if something smells funny in here, boy."

31647,Homer,i don't know. let's just lay here till we figure it out.
28060,Homer,"hot! hot! hot! warm, tepid, cool, cold... so cold!"
24717,Homer,"oh, right. why don't we just break into fat tony's compound and get it back?"
25723,Homer,no they don't.
19918,Homer,"oh, yeah, a dog like this you have to feed every day."
33739,Homer,"uh... can i work it off? don't worry, i won't embarrass you."
35733,Homer,do you have a computer?
14589,Homer,maaarge... the dog doesn't count as a kid.
27828,Homer,"hey, there's writing on the back of this."
16781,Homer,why am i such a loser? why?
29287,Homer,"and marge, you'll always be the best chef in our house."
34198,Homer,"tickets, please. hey, where's your ticket? leave me alone! why you little..."
21582,Homer,not the way i quit. ooh-who.
21983,Homer,here's a little playmate for you.
21105,Homer,"no sir, please. i can't go to prison. they pee in a cup and throw it on ya. i saw it in a movie!"
13887,Homer,"marge, if i spend any more time doing these girl things, i'm gonna -- you know -- go fruity. no, you were right the first time with that quick fix idea. let's see, quick fix, quick fix. ah, i'll buy her that pony she's always bugging me for."
19722,Homer,"hey, that wasn't supposed to happen! those finks double-crossed me!"
22055,Homer,"say, who are you guys?"
28691,Homer,i didn't lie. i was writing fiction with my mouth.
38192,Homer,and that man sold it to me!
36511,Homer,"aw boy, i feel for ya. nobody likes to be rejected, and it never gets easier, until you can drink. because then you can express your unfiltered feelings by drunk dialing."
26949,Homer,"you all know me. i've kept the streets safe for you and your children. i've tricked or treated at many of your houses. last year i was jar jar binks. now, who will stand and fight with me?"
23600,Homer,"save your tears, moe. save 'em in a shot glass for someone who still has a shred of hope."
37445,Homer,"you like this now? what about ""planet jackson and the earth brigade?"""
15747,Homer,yoink.
14075,Homer,i need to talk to moe.
40795,Homer,"i can't believe it, it's sticking. you're telling me new stuff, and minutes later it's still there! and it's all thanks to you. marge, when i see you forming the vowels and continents --"
34441,Homer,how 'bout a greg norman executive putter from the sky mall?
35207,Homer,i can't do reefer comedy -- i'm drunk. two different animals.
33092,Homer,"he rhymes! oh, happy day!"
22767,Homer,why won't you be art?!
39210,Homer,"marge, where's the extension cord?"
38618,Homer,"because i've never gotten a promotion before. once i thought i had, but it turned out to be a beautifully-worded firing. so judge me all you want."
40509,Homer,"keep her away from me, marge! she's got that crazy look in her eyes again."
38776,Homer,apu wouldn't be able to sing a note if i didn't help him get over his stage fright with his kwik-e-mart shirt...
32962,Homer,"mr. burns, my son and i have been collecting coins. it's really brought us closer together. that penny you bought tonight would mean the world to him."
13253,Homer,"no, she's mine!"
20322,Homer,"i don't have to be careful, i got a gun."
16065,Homer,woo hoo! a flyer for a hardware store!
14338,Homer,why did you do that?
25825,Homer,let's make sure he's a leprechaun. sing us a song of the emerald isle.
39614,Homer,"don't you have something that isn't out of my price range? i don't want to go away empty-handed, bob."
38904,Homer,don't you people realize your queen is dying?
35097,Homer,um... i'll see myself out.
17377,Homer,oooh -- gummy bears. gummy calves heads. gummy jaw breakers.
36702,Homer,the day my frisbee landed in your yard was the luckiest day of my life...
17318,Homer,"yeah, and then we'd get the chair."
21551,Homer,ow! stop pummeling me! it's really painful!
24237,Homer,the one with the amulet?
13223,Homer,"coming, chief."
14705,Homer,"don't thank me, lurleen, you should be thanking your brain."
36211,Homer,i'm cured. i'll never wet the bed again.
25542,Homer,where? over there?
23079,Homer,all hail emperor clobbersaurus!
17460,Homer,you want me to spend more time with dad? what about my new year's resolution?
26929,Homer,how 'bout lenny?
30554,Homer,"no, but i swam in it."
21276,Homer,"look at that beautiful garbage! other cities don't want it, so they pay me to dump it in this old abandoned mine."
14199,Homer,"marge, you're as pretty as princess leia and as smart as yoda."
36039,Homer,and i can drive drunk while i'm actually sober!
27782,Homer,there you go.
18861,Homer,they all have hilarious names and are delicious.

20051,Homer,"barney, where's my car?!!"

18937,Homer,"oh. it can't be that many. c'mon, apu. i'll be your tutor."
27114,Homer,good thing it's laminated.
15039,Homer,hey there blimpy boy /flying through the sky so fancy free.
36683,Homer,i can't believe my dad never told me he had another wife. the man i looked up to my whole life.
25409,Homer,"they wouldn't? well i'll go to bat for you, honey."
22863,Homer,"hey, ray j. johnson never changed his act and he's more popular now than he's ever been."
16489,Homer,oh yeah. like you don't know. we're gonna have sex.
30156,Homer,"sensual, isn't it? and the best part is stupid flanders doesn't even know it's happening in his stupid house. hence my nickname, stupid flanders."
41286,Homer,"you have to think, it's your job."
30928,Homer,"hey, marge it's what i've gotta do to keep this family living in luxury."
39556,Homer,"""lisa refuses to play dodge ball because she is sad."" well, she doesn't look sad. i don't see any tears in her eyes."
27922,Homer,this dude ranch is gonna be great -- a whole week without hearing that stupid song.
23764,Homer,hah! if i had a nickel for every time i've heard that...
28874,Homer,she's not coming anymore.
39158,Homer,"chief! thank god! i was drinking at moe's, and i lost an african princess!"
15980,Homer,now all we needed was the approval of record company low-lifes.
29208,Homer,never!
16983,Homer,"uh-huh. and ""if""?"
19843,Homer,"oh, moe, thank god you're here! we'd like to come in and drink, please!"
18169,Homer,were you the ugly one?
36539,Homer,"heh, no kidding, i saw your reviews."
36529,Homer,"all right, i'll spring for a cab."
36357,Homer,"nice doin' business with you, boy."
25847,Homer,"yep. man one, machine zero. how do you like that score?"
36298,Homer,hey!

14377,Homer,"moe, twenty-three dollars on new york."
40562,Homer,"oh, what? what is it?"
32657,Homer,marge! marge! where are you?!
13871,Homer,number four and a half -- stupid gum!
14449,Homer,how often should i change maggie?
28260,Homer,"no, you're my mother and i won't leave you!"
17032,Homer,and how.
25366,Homer,how many lives must you ruin?
24031,Homer,i can't stress enough how easy it was to win this prestigious race. and furthermore...
33304,Homer,"really? i thought it was lisa with a beard of bees. well whatever, brace yourself."
39272,Homer,"come on, son. let's go cash this baby and get presents for -- thirteen bucks? hey, wait a minute!"
21384,Homer,lisa?! lisa?! li-sa?!
24920,Homer,sorry.
21999,Homer,do we have to listen to you?
33854,Homer,"how 'bout you, me and my wife have a two-way?"
25578,Homer,don't worry. being eaten by a crocodile is just like going to sleep... in a giant blender.
30479,Homer,i can relate. i've fought that foe and lost many times.
39028,Homer,"careful, elon. he's not as kindly as he appears."
16679,Homer,well you deserve it. all these vegetables are really clearing the cholesterol out of the old heart.
32486,Homer,bingo!
25652,Homer,"quick, moe! marge cut off my thumb."
15672,Homer,what? that's highway robbery! i won't pay it!
36921,Homer,ever!
33960,Homer,"the one we just had about you doing bad things, you stupid kid! ohhh."
20234,Homer,"yeah. ""to lisa. never forget your daddy loves ."""
34565,Homer,"oh lisa, i'm sorry. i tried my best. i know it's really hard when you discover your dad isn't perfect."
32712,Homer,"it's tangy like a pepper, but crunchy like a bell!"
40963,Homer,"oh please, please, this is my life we're talking about here. please..."
36552,Homer,why you little...
39959,Homer,i read you loud and clear.
33772,Homer,"sweetie, our country was founded by a clique: the continental congress. dolphins swim in cliques. those are my two examples."
39742,Homer,"ummm, nah..."
24723,Homer,i think we're in the clear.
30141,Homer,"shut up, flanders, i need a favor. would you mind watching maggie for a while? it would only be until later."
29120,Homer,doctor! perform a diagnosis!
36231,Homer,"oh man, i'd better have some coffee and iced tea."
26349,Homer,"hey marge, i just thought of something."
15335,Homer,all right.
22943,Homer,i do!
33594,Homer,"who are you, stuttering fonzie? what about you, bicycle pants?"
29948,Homer,on the radio?
17452,Homer,"no, honey, it's a romantic fantasy. i imagine i'm the janitor, and you're... the janitor's wife, who has to live with me in the utility room."
17839,Homer,"that's tough but fair. boy, go with the man."
19092,Homer,of course not. i wouldn't do that. why not?
36168,Homer,but isn't karma just an expression of the dharma?
30249,Homer,"thanks, moe!"
32881,Homer,"you're right, boy!"
31408,Homer,you're not ice cream... faker!
21690,Homer,"really? well, the time just flew by, didn't it?"
36279,Homer,no! i'm already using it to put my keys in!
32622,Homer,this must be how the rich toss out their gold. and as long as i'm cleaning out the family chariot...
24905,Homer,what the hell?
28528,Homer,you're welcome!
15273,Homer,hey!
17818,Homer,what keeps doin' that?
14318,Homer,"well, he fell down a well... and can't get out..."
16930,Homer,"on the other hand, who's to say what's right these days... what with all our modern ideas... and products."
25290,Homer,"hey, bart. yeah, you got your daddy's hustle."
29383,Homer,"up-bup-bup-bup-bup, don't look!"
34595,Homer,golf ball-sized hail!
26449,Homer,stop saying that.
14035,Homer,"name your son's hobbies. building a soapbox racer... ""name your child's friends."" martin... martin! i'll curse that name 'til the day i die... huh? ""who is your son's heroe?""..."
18056,Homer,"oh i'm sure he knew. and i'm sure that wherever he is now, he's happy."
40754,Homer,oh.
15758,Homer,"people stop! we can't give up our dental plan! lenny, without the dental plan, you wouldn't have that diamond in your tooth."
23112,Homer,ohhh.
16234,Homer,"marge, it's public tv! they never have anything good. where are the geraldos? where are the eubankses-es?"
26744,Homer,"you're trying to get me angry, thank you."
37170,Homer,leave it to me...
20412,Homer,flaaaan-ders... flaaaan-ders...
15562,Homer,patty. selma. i'm sorry.
33138,Homer,"oh, oh, oh, i have a better idea -- let's spend the night together, right here."
39111,Homer,"it will never happen again. now come on, let's walk home."
16482,Homer,"heh, you know, i was a little worried about coming to this convention with you, but i think as long as we're not alone together..."
31983,Homer,dammit!
30038,Homer,"all right, i wanna teach you a little something about jazz hands."
27350,Homer,more free samples.
16589,Homer,"so i said to him, ""look buddy, your car was upside down when we got here. and as for your grandma, she shouldn't have mouthed off like that."""
21748,Homer,"one-eyed, two-timing ! i'm gonna !"
17531,Homer,permit me to solve the mystery. your mother has a fear of flying.
29455,Homer,"why did i ever have kids? i could have written symphonies, or been shakespeare."
19519,Homer,"i'm telling you, i saw a creature from another planet."
40320,Homer,"h'lo, flanders."
38290,Homer,"oh, it's ringing!"
35877,Homer,woo hoo! can you focus on my shoulders -- that's where i carry my stress.
21540,Homer,"this better work, boy. i don't wanna wind up workin' on your mother's emu farm."
28313,Homer,"we're bigshot tourists from everyone's favorite country: the usa. we saved your ass in vietnam and shared our prostitutes with hugh grant. so give me some free maps, and none of that dry british wit."
31639,Homer,"no, seriously, you're great -- let's hear it."
18342,Homer,two!
35737,Homer,"okay, our book will be about... an orphan who goes to a magical school... where he discovers he's... a vampire!"
23860,Homer,he-- what the?!
30742,Homer,"bart, where are you?!"
27833,Homer,"why did she stay with me if she hated me so much? hey, two days later she had a doctor's appointment."
34406,Homer,give my dad another heart attack?!
24820,Homer,it's okay.
34281,Homer,uh-oh.
38521,Homer,hey! i was listenin' to that!
29154,Homer,"great, dive in."
27046,Homer,"get 'em now, jerks."
18847,Homer,'cause they won't hire an assistant.
36058,Homer,springfield talk!
38248,Homer,wave a brazilian flag so you'll stand out in the crowd.
28794,Homer,"relax, stupid. everything you see is make believe. although it is based on a true story. some of which happened in this very theater."
32333,Homer,"""make way for superman,"" said superman as he punched everyone at the coffee bean. chapter two..."""
26640,Homer,wow. wow. god does so much for me. and he doesn't ask anything in return.
27421,Homer,"oh, lisa has excellent hearing. once when she was three, i was quietly sobbing in the closet and she found me!"
26106,Homer,zing! what's a skeletor?
21367,Homer,"thanks, bart. that makes it all worthwhile."
28580,Homer,"bart, that creepy kid's here!"
17277,Homer,"television! teacher, mother, secret lover."
16232,Homer,stupid tv. be more funny.
38892,Homer,"...but perhaps earth's greatest achievement is moon rocks. oh, and the golden age of radio."
23989,Homer,"see, marge? i told you they could deep-fry my shirt."
30296,Homer,marge?
29522,Homer,woo-hoo!
40686,Homer,wait! i can't call marge. it's our last day on earth together. i can't drag her into this mess. i know! i'll call barney.
18229,Homer,run for your life!... ... boy!
28449,Homer,"but from now on, you better save your lovin' for the couch cushions!"
41046,Homer,"yes, master."
27149,Homer,damn your sparkling wordplay!
22752,Homer,thank you.
39572,Homer,"no, bart, no."
23665,Homer,i just wanted to invite you to the wrap party. and that's my cue to exit.
32339,Homer,"sweetheart, what's wrong?"
36889,Homer,and ca-lick!
33289,Homer,"oh no, no bees? oooh, now who will sting me and walk all over my sandwiches?"
23861,Homer,"oh, real original. who did this?"
21942,Homer,don't make me come up there!
40458,Homer,"oh, good, unfinished. this shouldn't take long."
15593,Homer,woo hoo!
28961,Homer,"and now, padre, if you would do the honors."
22269,Homer,now it doesn't work.
38821,Homer,"say flanders, with all the hard luck you've had, how do you stay so happy? and don't say ""jesus."""
33819,Homer,"oh, elementary school friends -- those are forever! you're always gonna be friends with milhouse. stand by me / oh, stand by me..."
39885,Homer,"oh, she's just jealous. she'll get over it, and if she doesn't, we can always exchange her."
32846,Homer,"why, 'cause i'm fat?"
22512,Homer,this valentine's crap has gone too far.
28755,Homer,are you saying my daughter can't cut it? just because i owe you fourteen thousand dollars? i'll show you!
28654,Homer,maybe on planet zoozoo.
37043,Homer,"way to get us back on topic, marge."
16192,Homer,"but mr. burns, it's not my bear. it's maggie's."
19206,Homer,"okay, homer, nothing to be worried about... just--"
41184,Homer,wow! you made the front page.
33994,Homer,i can't make sense of that muncher talk!
19265,Homer,hello.
31960,Homer,"hey guys, check out the radical-free air generated by my stolen ionic breeze."
27710,Homer,"uh, well, i drew it on... see..."
20107,Homer,"oh, all right, but not a minute later -- 'cause once the sun goes down, all the weirdos turn crazy."
33494,Homer,poltergeist in the closet...
32771,Homer,fatherhood hurts my brain.
22920,Homer,"boy, moe, you sure look angry. here, have some nuts."
37104,Homer,"oh yeah, man."
36689,Homer,"hey, i'm startin' to remember why i don't remember so much."
24117,Homer,"uh-oh. you've gotta help me, bart."
36475,Homer,because his avatar is darth maul! the second-coolest darth!
23839,Homer,electric needle room?!
38104,Homer,have you seen how he treats my grampa? never visits him. never even acknowledges his existence.
30690,Homer,i'm sorry... i got a little carried away there.
24286,Homer,mama mia. look what the hawaiian restaurant threw out!
38137,Homer,kettle corn... the heroin of the farmer's market.
41001,Homer,"oh, okay. i'd like a big one, then."
35684,Homer,really? you'd let me in on your thing? even though i think it's stupid?
38282,Homer,wait. let me get this straight. sit and eat? that's my punishment?
26424,Homer,"oh, i quit. there's no convincing you. i'm gonna take a nap."
38553,Homer,whew!
30590,Homer,i gotta stop marge from doing something reckless and irresponsible.
37448,Homer,are you nuts? you can't win if you don't play.
38620,Homer,everyone who signs over their mineral rights to mr. burns gets five thousand dollars!
24817,Homer,"excuse me, sir."
34349,Homer,yeah.
23099,Homer,"before i go, i want to say something. game shows aren't about cruelty, they're about greed and wonderful prizes like poorly-built catamarans. but somewhere along the line, you lost your way. for shame."
37339,Homer,hello dere!
33472,Homer,that poor man. is he okay?
28439,Homer,now calm down. i'll just unlock it with this coat hanger.
14433,Homer,what should i say?
29825,Homer,i won't tell if you don't tell.
39307,Homer,bart!
23722,Homer,all right.
23529,Homer,mindy?
34727,Homer,let me just grab one more shrimp.
32931,Homer,"you can have her. to me, she's been nothing but trouble."
36924,Homer,it doesn't make sense to me!
13516,Homer,"oh, woe is me."
32418,Homer,"a song? wait, it's coming back to me."
18789,Homer,"yes! yes, sir!"
21396,Homer,i hope this works...
41352,Homer,you moron! just kill her!
17722,Homer,we're doomed!
35616,Homer,life imitates flart.
40112,Homer,how do you know?
30903,Homer,"so it would appear. however, cousin it, there, was born a woman."
24101,Homer,"so how'd you do tonight, romeo?"
32479,Homer,aw...
17167,Homer,"marge, i want you to stop seeing this jacque. you can let him down gently. but over the next couple of months, i want you to break it off."
23307,Homer,the other critics told me to be mean. and you should always give in to peer pressure.
19196,Homer,you... didn't?
40069,Homer,he thinks he's so big.
27661,Homer,never!
32879,Homer,"wait a minute, i smell apples... cinnamon... crust... it's a pie!"
31002,Homer,my keys!
23547,Homer,this is the worst day ever.
25014,Homer,you'd do that for us?
29293,Homer,"oh, homer, you're wasting away to nothing. you simply must eat something. well, you're the boss!"
19324,Homer,"oh, and for yourself."
14372,Homer,sure! you'll find it gets rid of the unpleasant after-taste of church.
39578,Homer,"oh. me, too."
27123,Homer,my official tour jacket!
22057,Homer,whew.
21328,Homer,"hospital, please."
25323,Homer,"oh, come on. you've been gunning for queen bee ever since you buzzed into this hive. now serve!"
31938,Homer,"oh, i can't wait for my first fire. is that one?"
37336,Homer,"well, at least you don't have to suffer, boy."
38582,Homer,"there's no reason to be jealous, it's just younger you."
40705,Homer,"oh, gimme a break, marge."
36764,Homer,"you can look at it this way...or this way...whether you want to or not... and it's got awesome games like ""tapped out."""
14280,Homer,"and tomorrow morning, i'm gonna buy your ring back! then i'm going house-hunting!"
34948,Homer,"oh, i get it. the government runs out of money, so they pass a bunch of lame-o laws to sock it to the little guy."
23003,Homer,please be kind.

31457,Homer,"oh, i see. you'd prefer a wire transfer. what's your routing number?"
33785,Homer,"hey, how hard can it be? all we have to do is follow the directions."
38732,Homer,"this is embarrassing to admit, stig, but i hadn't even thought about gels."
29700,Homer,u.s.a.! u.s.a.! u.s.--
24836,Homer,that does it. i'm getting a computer! as soon as somebody lets me outta here!
36834,Homer,please. please rush into this! please rush into this!
33930,Homer,he's gone.
21992,Homer,uh-oh. tape must have fallen off.
14869,Homer,that's it?
25376,Homer,'bout time.
21815,Homer,"well, you know me. i love animals. beef, chicken, veal... if you're not part of the solution, marge, you're part of the problem."
28935,Homer,"okay, fat load here."
34629,Homer,"marge, have u left me 4..."
22076,Homer,i don't need two kidneys. i have everything i need right here...
41407,Homer,another me? you can watch the kids.
17674,Homer,"did you hear me? i said, i quit, monty. and since i quit, i can do anything i want."
26981,Homer,"man, are we evenly matched."
27487,Homer,it's not fair. i always wanted to drive a food-shaped car.
40239,Homer,"you know, boy, some of the players you see tonight may make it to the big leagues, one day."
20409,Homer,"yes, roy."
30887,Homer,i'll bet the twist is he's gay.
28311,Homer,wow. i can't believe we met mr. bean.
29281,Homer,"uh-um... what do you think ""some"" is?"
20814,Homer,of course not! except that we're all moving to the movementarian agricultural compound to be near the leader and serve him.
38981,Homer,what do we do next? what do we do next?
36094,Homer,by the box lady herself!
31388,Homer,fine. i'll drive between sips.
30633,Homer,"all right, bob. we won't tell your beautiful new family that you're a homicidal psychopath -- if you fix up our car."
27858,Homer,"what's the deal with this place? it's so manly, yet scented."
23153,Homer,"and it was fine for the 1930's. the country was doing great back then. everyone was into talking. but now, in whatever year this is, the audience wants action! and seats with beverage holders, but mainly action."
19633,Homer,it could be days before they find us.
20544,Homer,i didn't like it. the mast had termites.
31535,Homer,gunderson!
13281,Homer,you like back rub?
38144,Homer,"now, ere's what makes art valuable: 1. nudity. 2. holograms. 3. something terrible happening to jesus."
24361,Homer,"okay. ""last question: who is your favorite backstreet boy?"""
38700,Homer,what about mosquito cove?
24716,Homer,"stupid game! now, what were we talking about?"
21260,Homer,"hey, ray. cleanin' out the old office, eh?"
29801,Homer,well... i don't know.
16773,Homer,"i love you, homey. heh, heh, heh. i don't need her at all anymore."
24215,Homer,"moo?! lenny, you were supposed to be ""e""."
26939,Homer,"you know, the old lady's apartment was actually lenny's. we just used a different duvet cover."
36564,Homer,i turned it off.
23028,Homer,"oh yeah. i'm betting on jai-alai in the cayman islands, i invested in something called news corp..."
19911,Homer,when? when? ich bin hungrig!
32414,Homer,"boy, stop talking to yourself!"
35386,Homer,"well, i open a lot of crazy things when i'm drunk, but i don't think so."
21638,Homer,"see? it's just a regular chair, but i attached a couple of extra legs to the back... kinda like the ones on the back of your..."
38539,Homer,none.
28661,Homer,"where to, mack?"
22502,Homer,"oh, sorry, marge, that's in my stockpile. you can have this."
34249,Homer,"marge, soaring above the forgiving beauty of nature, i have something to confess. um... i wasn't there for that wedding toast because... i was buying a lottery ticket."
25103,Homer,"oh, i hope ""plunging"" means ""up,"" and ""seventy-five"" means ""two hundred."""
33126,Homer,what?! but i have urges!
31522,Homer,"oh, that's it -- we're changing doctors."
28423,Homer,he must be following this thing. well i'm gonna make sure it never harms another living creature.
20833,Homer,to think i turned to a cult for mindless happiness when i had beer all along.
27935,Homer,this map is useless! useless!
17480,Homer,"kids, your daddy and his daddy are involved in a very sticky... nutty... chewy... chocolatey... put it away, boy... situation. and your daddy has realized something very important: a father should always make his kids feel wanted. starting right now, i promise to spend a lot more time with you and give you the attention you deserve."
13631,Homer,"ah! what does the ""i"" stand for again?"
29052,Homer,"i'll keep my promise, honey."
18332,Homer,i'm gonna be sucked into the black hole!... i'm gonna be sucked into oblivion!... i'm gonna be nothing and what's gonna become of me on the other side?! i don't know...
32510,Homer,i don't care about these church jerks... church jerks... church jerks...
19008,Homer,woo hoo!
40053,Homer,but it's a thousand bucks... burns would can my butt in no time flat.
13699,Homer,sorry! no cash for neddie! homer keep all money! bye bye neddie! bye bye!
22072,Homer,what? what? hey!
33447,Homer,"i mean, nooo!"
17097,Homer,"moe, what are you doing here?"
37398,Homer,nothin's gonna delete these!
25976,Homer,"oh, i don't know. what would moe say about that?"
31859,Homer,yeah. what have you done with the real moe?
31155,Homer,"hey tabitha, great show. i like that part where you mentioned springfield. did you know that's where you are?"
39787,Homer,"pffft. i have to warn you, marge -- i think the poor young thing has the hots for yours truly."
27165,Homer,dew-ey! dew-ey! dew-ey!
40744,Homer,it was worth it.
30562,Homer,"aw, thanks. now how 'bout a dance with your daddy?"
34741,Homer,"it's not what you think... i came here to warn them... yes, to warn them about, um..."
30231,Homer,why does that woman thwart my sporadic interest in my children? shouldn't bart and i be able to choose our own religion if we want to?
31967,Homer,"moe, i think we may have perverted..."
36886,Homer,hold down the fort?! with my bad back?!
31764,Homer,aw. our kids used to be so cute!
17295,Homer,"oh, my loving family. nothing's changed."
35903,Homer,"but i do speak for the common man who does his lousy job, goes to church twice a year and watches women's tennis 'cause he likes to hear 'em grunt. i bet chuck the cameraman and steve the sound guy know where i'm coming from."
16114,Homer,perfect.
18851,Homer,i'm sorry. i guess watching me isn't any more exciting than being me.
21081,Homer,"you can't spell ""dishonorable"" without ""honorable."""
33442,Homer,"marge, i won't bore you with the truth. all i can say is that until three p.m., we must avoid all accidents and injuries or we're all going to the poor house."
17930,Homer,it's a big country.
17572,Homer,i saved your life. that egg sandwich could have killed you by cholesterol.
31626,Homer,oui oui! and i have spent the last five years plotting the most exquisite revenge!
14366,Homer,"that's right. my god, it's like there's some kind of bond between us."
30179,Homer,"hey, you knocked out my power. how am i supposed to eat without watching tv?"
32618,Homer,"well, if i'm gonna start a diet, this is my last chance to eat all the crap i love."
38837,Homer,"oh marge, you found me! you always find me. now we just have to find your car in the mall parking lot."
30402,Homer,i repeat: did you sleep with kirk?
26276,Homer,"oh, you mean tennessee?"
26192,Homer,cooperate?! this is one family that doesn't swing that way.
25403,Homer,"well, you're welcome, honey. now, i'm gonna spend the whole day helping shmoes with their problems. got a problem, bart?"
15084,Homer,that's good.
35163,Homer,"i was born a rollin' eighty, and i'll die a rollin' eighty."
13491,Homer,yeah...
33109,Homer,"no, get two of your own."
29647,Homer,that coot happens to be my father. please continue.
16733,Homer,"hello, is this nasa?"
32535,Homer,fine. google maps.
19766,Homer,"don't worry, boy. we're gonna set you straight. by tomorrow morning, you'll be a regular burt reynolds."
35872,Homer,high school yearbooks...

37287,Homer,"son, if there's one thing i've learned as a defendant, and a juror, it's... stay out of the courtroom! it's so frickin' boring! run, boy! i'll create a distraction!"
39915,Homer,"ouch! watch it! hey. ow, ouch!"

16445,Homer,"hi, son. howya... ewww."
38449,Homer,oh thank god. a rickety bridge.
38641,Homer,"relax, marge. it's probably just homer comin' home late from moe's."
28612,Homer,"well, i've been busy, son. they really need me over at the nuclear plank."
18853,Homer,"boy, this is a lot more fun with a second person!"
30641,Homer,uh-oh.
20085,Homer,"'evening, moe."
25662,Homer,leave ned alone.
13768,Homer,"hey, you know boys, a nuclear reactor's a lot like a woman. you just have to read the manual and press the right button."
28366,Homer,"i could get marge a new window, just like this one."
25090,Homer,"hello, marge. hi, homie. sign this, please? you're the boss! daddy, ask the man for some candy! no, no, no candy for you. then at least get some candy for yourself."
31709,Homer,look at those dumb hillbillies! i bet they don't even know what... something is.
21294,Homer,"hmm... all right, but don't lose them. they're my only pair."
40178,Homer,"-- surely that is something at my window lattice; let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore --"
15740,Homer,i would kill everyone in this room for a drop of sweet beer.
36021,Homer,i'm getting' closer. it's just within reach.
15163,Homer,"sorry, but the punishment stands."
36456,Homer,"daughters of jerusalem, weep not for me but weep for yourselves."
18429,Homer,"wait, i know! ""vent gas."""
33469,Homer,"marge, don't worry. it's like when we stopped paying the phone bill. they stopped calling us. in fact, everyone did!"
22370,Homer,"hey, howyadoin'?"

20485,Homer,then get married. what the hell do you want from me?!
33349,Homer,"sunday's the lord's day, boy. not god's. completely different guy."
30456,Homer,hmmm. i suppose i could use a little toning.
26377,Homer,"oh, it's no good. everything reminds me of marge."
35489,Homer,"ned, i've learned that the only way a relationship survives is by forgiving! endless, endless forgiving!"
37119,Homer,what the?
22849,Homer,good night.
19774,Homer,"bart, i want you to shake hands with -- what's your name, fella?"

25279,Homer,"okay, honey. i can see this means a lot to you. i'll practice till my elbow is swollen and discolored."
13197,Homer,"oh yeah? check with me in eight years, dr. who. i'll be kickin' your ass with a solid gold boot!"
27954,Homer,"look, i have no idea who frank lloyd wright is."

29902,Homer,i don't have to -- ray's gonna be here any minute.
24460,Homer,oh! what's that awful sound?
22092,Homer,"well, it's all-- hey, i thought you twisted your ankle."
26067,Homer,"oh, sorry."
32867,Homer,i never wanted to be famous for being mean. i wanted to be famous for catching santa claus.
30028,Homer,"everything i did, i did for you."
27883,Homer,wait a minute... marge likes a little bit of stubble.
24421,Homer,"more hashbrowns, sugar?"
16760,Homer,"hey guys, look what i smuggled aboard."

28146,Homer,"yeah. you know, looking at this sweet precious child makes me want to have one of our own."
32872,Homer,it's a medical condition!
38867,Homer,wow. this place is completely alien but everything's in english. just like canada.
23356,Homer,"oh, wait... what i'd like to say is, we're still looking for the real killers. anyway, in conclusion, a man cannot be forced to testify against his wife."
34694,Homer,and i also mixed all the spices together into one super spice!
32886,Homer,no thanks.
29776,Homer,i'm not a machine -- i can't just turn it on!
17887,Homer,what a wonderful dinner. what a beautiful family. someone get a picture of me with my arm around this steak.

20216,Homer,"oh, marge, but we've needed a new air conditioner for years! and our stopgap solution is getting cranky."
20702,Homer,ice-cream-man-ice cream-man!
25743,Homer,"it's just a legal thing, to protect me."
35231,Homer,can we at least get some french fries?
34672,Homer,"help us! help us, for the love of god! won't somebody help us?!"
40655,Homer,"oh, that's my boy."
21648,Homer,now let's take care of business.

16945,Homer,"huh? oh, right. so i guess you're in okay shape, huh? no heart problems or anything..."
27445,Homer,"it's not just a bug, it's the queen of something!"
13821,Homer,now you're talkin'!
29559,Homer,"after forty days and forty nights, the rains stopped, and noah sent forth a single dove..."
26414,Homer,ouch! i sat on something sharp!
36930,Homer,"wait. wait. there's one part of the story even grampa didn't know about: a few months later, i went to rescue bongo..."
26443,Homer,i've seen drunker.
39511,Homer,"bart, you're saying butt kisser like it's a bad thing."
37678,Homer,and you sat on the gas pedal when my foot fell asleep. so i'm gettin' you shined up nice.
40766,Homer,ignoramus. it means i'm stupid! doesn't it?
31761,Homer,i'll just focus on one area... how many did i get? none? that's cool.
14229,Homer,"marge, i'm sorry. i wish i could afford a better place."
16483,Homer,huh?
14339,Homer,"okay, just don't say anything and sit down over there."

32686,Homer,"hey boy, check out my new car!"
21800,Homer,"apu, i'm about to purchase some weird and fruity items, and i don't want any guff. first of all, i'll need the following mushrooms: portobello --"
15148,Homer,"run along, ya little scamp."
18237,Homer,that's the plan.
31207,Homer,"so it's a noise war he wants, huh? then i'll throw in some rush-hour traffic!"
20518,Homer,yeah!
21877,Homer,"yeah, but they were all part of a single ball of lies. the point is, i'm a grown man, and i deserve a middle name."
28572,Homer,"""families come first"" is supported by lifelong springfieldians you know and trust like me, milhouse's dad, bumblebee man, surly duff, and that jerk that goes ""yeees!"""
40323,Homer,"there's nothing wrong with crabgrass! it just has a bad name, that's all. everyone would love it if it had a cute name like... uh... elfgrass."
39379,Homer,oh.
29644,Homer,"dad, where's your base?!"

17311,Homer,nothing. nothing at all. let's just eat.
21063,Homer,mr. moe -- steady as she goes!
31342,Homer,that's an odd way to start handing out medals.
38644,Homer,"we'd better send the dog down. come on. here's your chance to protect us, boy. come on."
23908,Homer,"what's that, sonny?"
15945,Homer,"ooh, delicious."
37295,Homer,"marge, this is amazing. i never realized some restaurants are better than others."
34052,Homer,i will! edamame?
28922,Homer,she sure loves that couch.
40652,Homer,"...and, finally, the little spot under your nose. next, we take some toilet paper, tear off some teensy little squares, and stick one there, and there, and any place you're bleeding. there and there. don't worry, the blood will hold it right on your face. now, some aftershave."
30637,Homer,sideshow bob!
17180,Homer,"stop that. i love my wife and family. all i'm gonna use this bed for is sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort. that's it."
18243,Homer,hey flanders!

30386,Homer,"marge, what's happening to me?"
23557,Homer,really?
28579,Homer,what do i care?
29106,Homer,"earth to special girl? you forgive me, right?"
27356,Homer,"hey, your kid is in the movie -- and the movie knows his name. maybe lisa will like this better than the diary. stupid flanders, you're a genius!"
15918,Homer,i'll miss sheriff lobo...
18321,Homer,"hey, shut up!"
31202,Homer,spare us your medical mumbo-jumbo! just give us the pills. clear-cut his brain down to the nub!
39777,Homer,i gave you advice? get outta here.
41480,Homer,"i've gotta ask, what happened? was i in a forest fire or something?"
36478,Homer,don't tell me what our thing is.

27391,Homer,"you did it! lisa thinks i'm the greatest. i might even put you to work on bart and maggie, go superdad on all their asses."

26321,Homer,"dude, i thought we were friends."
28953,Homer,give her back to skinner! a fat bald guy like you... you could have anyone!
15624,Homer,"how would you like me to take it? ""go ahead, bart, have your fun, i'll be waiting for you?"" i'm sorry, i can't do it."
18057,Homer,"well, it's like the time that your cat, snowball, got run over."
32434,Homer,i pay ten dollars a tube for those!
38684,Homer,i won't laugh at you. let's see--
21891,Homer,bummer... love-in... dean rusk... by george i've got it!
33776,Homer,"ooo, i'm sorry, moe. i didn't mean everyone everyone. hope you don't mind."
37948,Homer,"man, carrying these kids is hard on my back."
16854,Homer,"guess what, everyone?! my great uncle boris died and left us his old country house. there's only one catch they say - it's haunted. but i'm sure we can prove him wrong by spending the weekend there."
39644,Homer,"well, it's a quick job, but it's shelter."
29861,Homer,so why didn't you invite me?
23681,Homer,"she's no liza, but it works."
13353,Homer,the way i acted?
19879,Homer,i said forty-two!
16852,Homer,"right back atcha, buddy."
29978,Homer,neunundneunzig luftballons / auf ihrem weg zum horizont / hielt man fuer ufos aus dem all / darum schickte ein general /
26562,Homer,"oh, that poor little boy. we've got to find him."
41174,Homer,marge! i'm two-thirty-nine and i'm feeling fine! look! i'm using the original notches that came with my belt.
34461,Homer,use that image any way you want.
22565,Homer,at least i've got a license.
39296,Homer,go! go!
20120,Homer,"aw, shoot. all right, all right. give me one bowl."
26946,Homer,"all right, fat tony. your little game is over."
18819,Homer,"bye, kids. on your way back, pick up a six pack of beer."
19418,Homer,fine. i'll come find you when i'm ready to stop having fun.
37264,Homer,"because if i hit you back, we'll be even. but if i don't hit you, that makes me the better man. and i'm liking the way that feels."
25253,Homer,i'll bet you didn't see that comin'.
26632,Homer,i didn't. but now daddy's special medicine...
24047,Homer,"be patient, son. a rushed car never crashes."
25562,Homer,wowww... it just rolled over to ten thousand.
35352,Homer,maybe we've found all the truffles. the only thing i've dug up was these weird-looking mushrooms.
29581,Homer,follow instructions? he's doomed!
27088,Homer,i came up with a stage move i feel is very cool.
21026,Homer,what the--?
28378,Homer,that's my old lady.
34519,Homer,i know just the guy.
17954,Homer,okay! wait a minute. why did it take you so long to say yes?
14314,Homer,aww...
27729,Homer,"mr. burns, i've made a list of recommendations to improve plant efficiency."
17316,Homer,new glasses?
37602,Homer,what everything's been building toooo /
17358,Homer,"now that we're all alone, marge, admit it. you like lisa best."
33062,Homer,"oh, you look great."
39710,Homer,what was it about?
27402,Homer,let me just put on my glasses.
24708,Homer,"yeah, i'm watching, honey. nice cannonball. anyhoo, the key to fathering is don't over-think. 'cause over-thinking is... what were we talking about? ooh, a clown."
37234,Homer,"he's taking on mean man monty! go get him, honest abe!"
39883,Homer,"please, please kids. stop fighting. maybe lisa's right about america being a land of opportunity, and maybe adil has a point about the machinery of capitalism being oiled with the blood of the workers."
40337,Homer,well... he...
17819,Homer,but wait. you can't kill me for being krusty. i'm not him. i'm homer simpson.
18849,Homer,this has purple stuff inside. purple is a fruit.
36229,Homer,a surprisingly not-horrible fruit drink called a mimosa.
37736,Homer,it grows on threes!
32742,Homer,have you ever wondered what i do in that locked room?
36417,Homer,my dear... did you just fall from heaven? 'cause your hair looks really messed up.
19736,Homer,do i know you?
14008,Homer,"okay. no, i'm gonna do it."
38530,Homer,"aw, somebody wants more crusts. here you go, boy!"
17292,Homer,stupid bug. you go squish now.
18358,Homer,"oh yeah? well, we'll just see about that, little miss smart guy."
29777,Homer,why you little...!
24945,Homer,"okay, you can park my car, but no joyriding."
36379,Homer,"yeah stupid, stop thinking about fun and have it!"
15302,Homer,i'm gonna lose my plow.
20353,Homer,pull!
24239,Homer,ding-dong!
16155,Homer,"maggie, i'm trying to watch tv. put that moldy old bear down."
16580,Homer,never mind the commercials. just give it to me. i've got to whip this neighborhood into shape.
31736,Homer,how could my dad go out with selma? don't those two gargoyles know that love is for good-looking young people?
24323,Homer,you keep thinkin' that.
35195,Homer,"their ""can-do"" will bail out our ""won't-try"" every time!"
35375,Homer,i'll just keep cutting till i hit something solid.
34084,Homer,"marge, please. you're embarrassing me in front of the mob."
18064,Homer,and i won't rest until i've gotten a hot dog.
13872,Homer,number four and a half reed! whoo hoo!
15971,Homer,wait'll i tell marge!
23760,Homer,"so, who am i beating up?"
14117,Homer,yeah...
28429,Homer,"all right, all right i'm still thinking!"
16119,Homer,"exam?!? oh, this is just like one of those bad dreams."
32219,Homer,no problem.
33513,Homer,"so, after i paid for the ice cream cones, i said ""thank you"" and was on my way."
18650,Homer,"well, you can always depend on that."
23399,Homer,"ooh, there's ross perot, dr. laura, spike lee..."
18236,Homer,no.
13757,Homer,who'd have thought a nuclear reactor would be so complicated!
16167,Homer,"a million dollars and three hawaiian islands. good ones, not the leper ones."
36861,Homer,"o-o-o-ooooh booooyyyyy... we had the family version of a bromance going with our awesome neighbors, and you had to screw it up."
25402,Homer,"my heart was in the right place, jerk!"
34772,Homer,"you're safe now, my friend."
27592,Homer,now to win back my son in comfort and style.
40683,Homer,"get moving, you hunk of junk. i gotta make up for lost time."
17735,Homer,thanks for giving me my old job back.
40221,Homer,"marge! don't worry. my daughter's very bright, i'm sure she'll be able to memorize your question by dinner time tomorrow."
13754,Homer,huh? ahhh!! it's my problem! we're doomed!!!
20096,Homer,it's time i told you about a chapter of my life i hoped would be closed forever. i was on my way to the harrisburg coat outlet to buy an irregular coat. but it required a stopover in new york city.
20472,Homer,"are you sure, son?"
39943,Homer,"yes, sir."
39475,Homer,"you can't talk that way about my kids. or, at least two of them."
13430,Homer,are you?
33710,Homer,"son, girls come and go. but you'll always have your family."
26380,Homer,"this job'll be perfect. i'm gonna leave this world the way i entered it -- dirty, screaming and torn away from the woman i love."
36487,Homer,i appreciate that.
22631,Homer,"bart, stop squeaking your chair!"
28518,Homer,"c'mon, death. leave mcgrew alone. take tiny tim."
38860,Homer,that's good.
23718,Homer,carl looks great. can't take a bad picture of that guy.
39842,Homer,marge. marge. we're gonna try one more place. the sapphire lounge. bart! i said look at the floor!
34569,Homer,"now, lisa, i know you miss your whale. so i got you a pet that will never die. an invisible dog."
21523,Homer,"li-sa, i can't imagine anyone being more likable than you. but apparently this new girl is. so my advice would be to start copying her in every way."
19328,Homer,"marge, i'm home! where are you? are you okay? i don't smell dinner!"
30495,Homer,"fear not, m'lady! captain dash superstud is here with his small tool!"
24442,Homer,"whee! touch the sky, maggie! whee! touch the sky!"
40075,Homer,i deserve this!
19491,Homer,"well, i won't be lonely for long...."
22654,Homer,"other cultures are fine. i'm just saying i can get along in life without a ""tooth brush."""
13308,Homer,"no, no, no. i just wish i knew what to say."
21366,Homer,"aw, dammit!"
25774,Homer,"well, i'd rather reserve judgement until i... oh my god!"
39836,Homer,yes i do. because i'm hungry... my clothes are smelly... and i'm tired.
20095,Homer,"new york is a hellhole, and you know how i feel about hellholes."
22636,Homer,"hey, you're mad at me. that wasn't your mayonnaise, was it?"
21735,Homer,"wait, mine came back."
41543,Homer,"apparently if all the kids fire at your stomach at once, it adds up."
18471,Homer,woo hoo! i'm so glad to have my mom back! i never realized how much i missed her.
26038,Homer,"a cougar! die, cougar!"
33586,Homer,this place is in ireland?!
23707,Homer,"hey, don't make me hassle you, lisa."
29481,Homer,you do?
26279,Homer,kinda.
31025,Homer,"fine! i'll finish it myself. and don't think i'm gonna screw it up, because i won't!"
40605,Homer,no!
13758,Homer,"i don't understand anything! when they look up stupid in the dictionary, there'll be a picture of me!"
15080,Homer,"well, i need something for my son's birthday."
13318,Homer,would you have to do extra work?
16656,Homer,this shrimp isn't frozen and it smells funny.
27663,Homer,"now cookie, do you think you can sell this house?"
39369,Homer,comin' through.
20715,Homer,"sorry, son. daddy failed."
37711,Homer,"mmm, melon collie."

23269,Homer,"thanks for the chance. you won't never regret this, mr. editing guy!"
32282,Homer,"i've got tow dough i'm lookin' to blow, moe!"
28263,Homer,brambles! briars!
30892,Homer,"ya know, you don't seem like the money-hungry semi-stripper who's usually on fox. why'd you do it?"
26274,Homer,cool.
38989,Homer,"you know, boy, i'm not sure i can strangle you anymore. i'm gonna try something new."
30076,Homer,a week? that's...seven days from now!
21751,Homer,i promise you kids lots of things. that's what makes me such a good father.
19146,Homer,eh... i... no.

38393,Homer,"ah, young love."
25071,Homer,we're free! and we've got something to eat.
34765,Homer,"yeah, charts are for squares, baby."
39168,Homer,see what i mean? always an argument.
40159,Homer,smothered pork chops.
30739,Homer,fine. but the bacon man lives in a bacon house!
18706,Homer,how - can - that - old - man - hit - so - far?!!
31797,Homer,if you don't mind!
14742,Homer,is there anything you need?
30329,Homer,"okay, just let me clear some space."
39159,Homer,yes! the prayer i forgot to say has been answered.
37402,Homer,too on the nose. i really need to learn / 'cause we're living in a world of fools...
14971,Homer,i... found... a penny!
18456,Homer,"damn you, walt whitman! i... hate... you... walt... freakin'... whitman! ""leaves of grass"" my ass! wait a minute. maybe it's that other grave. the one that says ""simpson."""
36277,Homer,"aw, jeez."
40417,Homer,"i know, i will."
28787,Homer,"ooh, well, i am curious to see if those teens lose their virginity. and the wager only sweetens the deal."
38839,Homer,thank you magical creatures of the mall.
26266,Homer,get in the car.
23598,Homer,you're right!
17803,Homer,"look, you're gonna be having dinner with groucho tonight if you don't beat it."
25062,Homer,call mr. plow / that's my name / that name again is / mr. plow.
17843,Homer,"oh, yeah, this is the life. boy, next summer, can you commit some fraud in orlando, florida?"
35454,Homer,"that doesn't mean you're any better than him, young lady. he could be a war hero."
22824,Homer,uh-oh.
14275,Homer,"thanks, mom."
28317,Homer,"fish? i don't know, i'm not really a vegetarian..."
17431,Homer,thank you!
33610,Homer,it was apt.
14215,Homer,what's it say?
19017,Homer,"die? well, you don't scare me, doc. 'cause dying would be a stone groove. got any messages for jimi hendrix?"
39711,Homer,"oh! he didn't by any chance say that under certain circumstances it was all right, did he?"
28559,Homer,you can't change the rules in the middle of the game! we never would have had these kids if we'd thought we had to pay for 'em. promises were made!
15996,Homer,i pity the fool who doesn't like... he. and wher's barney?
17530,Homer,i'm sure it's nothing.
39476,Homer,"why, you... here's five you haven't met."
24764,Homer,i think it was when that cold snap killed off all the hoboes.
33686,Homer,"in a nuclear power plant, just how is nuclear energy turned into electricity?"
34820,Homer,"no child of mine will go without anything, ever! except quality healthcare!"
19800,Homer,"son, there comes a time in every father's life when he must -- gaahhh!!"
38194,Homer,i love art!
33961,Homer,woo hoo! there's no better violence than self-inflicted violence!
34833,Homer,"tell her ""no deal""."
19856,Homer,"right. now remember, don't mention this to anyone. not your mother, not rex banner, not anyone."
19060,Homer,"yeah, three nosy kids. and you know what happens to nosy kids who ask too many questions?"
33168,Homer,how about r?
14021,Homer,"okay bart, we've got a lot of work to do on that car. so, i'm gonna pull you out of school for the next couple of weeks..."
30148,Homer,i've had enough -- i'm leaving!
16256,Homer,your point being?
25944,Homer,uh-oh.
23540,Homer,"waldo, where are you?!"
22034,Homer,"but i don't want them cutting up my soft, supple body. why didn't somebody tell me what i was volunteering for? this is everybody's fault but mine."
20646,Homer,"you take that back, barney!"
35361,Homer,he's cheating on selma? that's crazy! why go out for a hamburger when you've got rancid steak at home?
36408,Homer,stradivarius cain!

23317,Homer,people will think what i tell them to think when you tell me what to tell them to think!
13481,Homer,"oh, all right. you always do that hand thing! and it usually works."
17387,Homer,"nobody's blaming you. hey, could you take the wheel for a second? i have to scratch myself in two places at once."
22191,Homer,that's your problem. you're living up here.
20915,Homer,mmmm... me.
29640,Homer,"people please, can we wrap this up? it's gonna rain and i've gotta get the bikes in here."
18433,Homer,shut up!
34226,Homer,you're right. i have been acting like telethon jerry lewis when i should've been acting like rest-of-the-year jerry lewis. will you teach me how to put myself first?
23392,Homer,"certainly. i am... the, ah, piano genius from the movie ""shine."""
37780,Homer,"oh, it's cool. we did it in an elevator."
25953,Homer,"oh hello, young man. beautiful day for digging, isn't it?"
21389,Homer,i am at work. this is what i do.
36899,Homer,i don't know -- the back yard?
24714,Homer,"marge, may i play devil's advocate for a moment?"
16779,Homer,i've got two tickets to paradise / i've got two tickets to paradise...
24769,Homer,i'm on board.
27164,Homer,"and maggie, you no longer have to live with the burden of replacing bart and lisa."
28925,Homer,"what are you trying to tell me, skinner?"
39507,Homer,do i smell cupcakes?
26894,Homer,"lisa, if we start conserving, the environmentalists win!"
13180,Homer,"hey, the manure dealership is just one of the things i got goin'."
23668,Homer,yeah. it looked just like that.
14651,Homer,the cat? what's the point?
19500,Homer,"we're number one! we're number one! in your face, space coyote!"
23224,Homer,"oh, this thing'll do anything. watch, i'll ask it how many leagues in a furlong. no, wait... i'll make it say ""whatsa matta you?"" in turkish."
36336,Homer,and where...

27897,Homer,that is the best kiss i've had tonight.
19797,Homer,"bart, i'm gonna turn my back -- and when i turn around, i wanna see a whole pile of dead reindeer."
16668,Homer,oh.
38358,Homer,"do you know how embarrassed i was to get a call, at my arraignment, for my behavior during the pub crawl, because of a voodoo curse my son placed on his art teacher?"
39626,Homer,bart!
29282,Homer,"i thought i'd never have to do this, but it's time to tell you the facts of life."
27640,Homer,"flanders, i mix twinkies and ding dongs all the time. in europe they call it a dinkie."
40477,Homer,springfield gorge? i thought we settled this daredevil junk.
31048,Homer,"great news, marge -- we're goin' home."
41246,Homer,"this is it, homer. it's time to tell her the terrible secret from your past."
36114,Homer,"why you little... i'm gonna get... no, homer. you can't strangle a boy on his mother's birthday. juries hate that. so instead, boy, i want you to... get in that rabbit cage!"
21578,Homer,"and these hardy boys books are great, too. this one is about smugglers."
38785,Homer,mr. scrooge!
17796,Homer,"and - then - take - that, and - put - that - in - there - and ah. here's your giraffe, little girl."
26843,Homer,now let's not get into who smells like what.
27707,Homer,you know everything about me!
39091,Homer,"i'm so sorry i threw you across the room and called you a liar. when you told me i was two hundred and sixty pounds, you were just encouraging me. it was a poem you were writing about my potential. i'm gonna start celebrating my size and i need you with me as a partner. now if you'll excuse me, i need to talk to the broken porch swing."
20142,Homer,"so long, mr. boot."
24465,Homer,"what are you talking about, professor frink? they're clearly in the ""on"" position. see? ""on."""
38587,Homer,ow! ooh! what the? mmm! i smell toast!
33669,Homer,"marge, you're not naggy. you just set the bar impossibly high."
34270,Homer,great curling reference.
37953,Homer,aka ni taishte burei da! yogore o yaburu!
36239,Homer,a must!
27027,Homer,what game?
24363,Homer,"okay. ""there's a black widow at your door, a rattlesnake at the window, and a scorpion on the phone. do you a) none of the below, b)..."""
19742,Homer,couldn't agree more. happy as a clam.
32269,Homer,"wow, you make people miserable and there's nothing they can do about it. just like god."
16028,Homer,"hey, kids! wanna drive through that cactus patch?"
31814,Homer,all because of a bunch of stuff that happened.
25484,Homer,"okay, now. put..."
18468,Homer,"oh, i've missed moments like this... mom."
25332,Homer,"comin' through... hey, hi otto... sorry..."
33131,Homer,this is all going so fast.
39750,Homer,bart!
34754,Homer,"boys don't have feelings, they have muscles."
16382,Homer,"i don't want to go, so if he asks me to go, i'll just say yes."
33833,Homer,"goodnight, marge."
16646,Homer,what the hell are you readin' books for?
28073,Homer,here's a dollar.
34615,Homer,cleaning the gutters?
17423,Homer,are you hugging the tv?
17361,Homer,hi kids!
19672,Homer,come on -- isn't he the guy i bowl with? the black guy?
25615,Homer,look out for the reach-around!
24930,Homer,"huh, that was easy."
21559,Homer,"okay, send the truck."
21219,Homer,"don't come off all high and mighty with me, patterson. you can't scare me, with your office and your desk and your lamp."
35708,Homer,sorry!
19453,Homer,"if it's about laying off the insanity peppers, i'm way ahead of you."
17726,Homer,how about if i triple the business? then could i get a raise?
16909,Homer,thank you.
27075,Homer,what was that?
26354,Homer,"oh, i'm so sorry."
26841,Homer,lousy community service. meals on wheels! eat it up or i go to jail!
28704,Homer,"that's right. i love you marge, and i realize now i should show you more often. the end of your book was the wakeup call i needed after falling asleep at the beginning of your book."
16872,Homer,y'ello.
23765,Homer,"please, mr. coleman. we can explain."
21424,Homer,"oh, happy anniversary, marge."
23468,Homer,"something will thrive in this harsh, merciless soil."
40860,Homer,"oh, boy!"
26598,Homer,"fine. take me, but let the boy go."
28242,Homer,"hey guys, i brought my mom."
21150,Homer,i call president!
33591,Homer,"oh, i miss her."
22843,Homer,"moe, this is astrid, my ""dealer."" and these are my fans, gunter, kyoto, and cecil hampstead-on-cecil-cecil."
40452,Homer,"i have an announcement to make. as a family growth thing, bart and i think we should all go to the monster truck rally this saturday."
15394,Homer,i could use a tv tray.
27626,Homer,the pig?
39137,Homer,"aw, your leaves are drooping. here, let me turn that gloom into bloom."
37292,Homer,give up? it's marge -- i'm having a lunch date with my wife.
22508,Homer,"don't worry, honey. i got something really special planned for valentine's day."
37052,Homer,"maybe! look, you guys obviously know about weather, but i understand something much more predictable: women."
20184,Homer,"now, son, on your first day of school, i'd like to pass along the words of advice my father gave me..."
15104,Homer,ooo.
34848,Homer,what time monday?
17894,Homer,no! i'm giving them a foot massage. at least let me have that.
26464,Homer,and he never even lived to be a vegetable.
26931,Homer,"flanders, i was able to find your missing leaf blower, belt sander and morning newspapers."
39538,Homer,cupcakes.
20708,Homer,heart condition? get outta here.
26622,Homer,i had a bad experience with drugs...

40623,Homer,poison! what should i do? what should i do? tell me quick!
24889,Homer,finally.
35114,Homer,"so basically, my job is to make you look good by comparison. like west virginia does for virginia."
38929,Homer,oh my god. what if all those clowns are parked in the same lot as us? maybe there's better wi-fi in the freak tent.
21542,Homer,it's not working.
27681,Homer,how 'bout before?
19304,Homer,i just gotta put my shoes on.
38003,Homer,what! no one can live in a non-augmented reality! i need another pair of glasses!
13827,Homer,"hey... hmm. not bad. nice hot mustard... good bread... turkey's a little dry. the turkey's a little dry?! oh foul, accursed thing! what demon from the depths of hell created thee?!"
23748,Homer,"whaddaya say, honey?"
16267,Homer,"how can you do this, marge? how can you desert your children?"
20998,Homer,"yep, i earned it."
39523,Homer,what? and violate the code of the school yard? i'd rather bart died.
35980,Homer,"you try it, maggie!"
31571,Homer,bart!? what the hell are you doing in there?!
19625,Homer,"um, i don't see one. unless..."
15270,Homer,"so i says, ""yeah, if you want that money, come and find it 'cause i don't know where it is you baloney..."" you make me wanna retch..."
28795,Homer,"oh honey, don't be scared. look, they killed the evil doll."
24680,Homer,magic bus!
21031,Homer,there! the perfect sheepshank.
36189,Homer,what do i do?

37969,Homer,glowing rods / glowing rods / it's making me / weak and dizzy...
31564,Homer,"finally. something even i wouldn't eat. well, maybe a little more."
24068,Homer,"okay, be right down."
39865,Homer,"and maybe some of those little wieners that come in a can. oh, and some fruit cocktail... in heavy syrup."
23325,Homer,"oh, marge, something bad usually happens to me when i go in anywhere."
33592,Homer,"well, dad, was there anything on your list about being cheated by an irishman?"
19059,Homer,no more questions. i work my butt off to feed you four kids and all you do i -- what?

24650,Homer,"loyal citizens of new springfield. you stayed on my side of town despite a total lack of hospitals and schools, and a sewage nightmare that threatens to consume us all."
19358,Homer,let me show you how it works. this baby has every phone number in town programmed into it. it automatically calls them one by one and plays my message. listen.
30549,Homer,why should we let this election be influenced by a photo taken hours ago?
37189,Homer,"son, promise you will never look like me."
31451,Homer,"i made it back for your show, honey..."

33218,Homer,"mr. teddy, can you ask lisa if she's mad? what's that, mr. teddy? you're saying that you know women? and that when women say they're not mad, they're madder than ever?"
23351,Homer,"aww, she missed it."

18478,Homer,"oh, come on, mom. we use that same line on the kids when they're at camp."
15599,Homer,"what'd ya say, marge?"

32132,Homer,"uh, yeah -- i have no job and nowhere to go. what do i have to buy so i can sit here all day?"
17487,Homer,"some day you'll thank me for all this scary love! but now, i've gotta go somewhere and do some serious thinking."
30335,Homer,i can't believe it took us forty minutes to get here. why can't they build a stamp museum closer to our house?
26932,Homer,who said it was a he?
13723,Homer,"hello, jerry? homer simpson. remember last month, when i paid back that loan? well, now i need you to do a favor for me."

41298,Homer,"okay, homer. this is the moment of truth. you've gotta tell marge you really don't want another kid."
24613,Homer,how the hell did they find that out?
39171,Homer,...and because you can't strangle a girl.

27506,Homer,"oh heavenly god, my son is plagued with homework. with your vast knowledge of the shore birds of maryland, i know you can help him."

26428,Homer,"oh, he just wants to make friends."
34040,Homer,"leave me alone, you two!"
25214,Homer,"hey, where're you going with that?"
39271,Homer,"ah, son. one day you're gonna know the satisfaction of payday. receiving a big fat check for a job well done."

23142,Homer,"you had me at ""hello."""

14461,Homer,"heh, heh, heh."
36928,Homer,grampa always hated bongo and loved money so he sold bongo to a wicked farm witch just so he could hang out with a bunch of rich dogs and kidnapped santa so i'd never get the toy i actually wanted--
25016,Homer,"don't worry, son. i have an idea."
24041,Homer,"okay, nobody panic. there's plenty of spray for me."
28298,Homer,one thousand dollars. do you know how much furniture we could rent with this?
23927,Homer,"geez, way to burst my bubble, marge."
36329,Homer,what a great opening episode. and i'm sure everything they said will pay off handsomely!
39436,Homer,"why you, listen to me you..."
38760,Homer,"apu has a rich life here in springfield: a store full of great products, a lovely him-type wife, and eight super kids: anoop, sandeep, nabendu, gheet, pria, uma, poonam, sashi--"

32740,Homer,"son, while your mother and little mother are out, i'm gonna let you in on a deep dark family secret."
41171,Homer,"all right, all right, who took the funny pages?"
30286,Homer,"okay, kids, we'll stop for the day. i have cousins near here. we'll stay with them."
40913,Homer,i'll take that bet.

33464,Homer,"hey, flanders. listen, uh... we're having a party..."
13988,Homer,steve mcqueen.
24175,Homer,"like this, from the book of p-salms: ""god will shatter the heads of his enemies, the hairy crown of those who walk in their guilty ways. that you may bathe your feet in blood."" as true today as it was when it was written."
40909,Homer,ooh! barbecue!
35075,Homer,"hmm, if this were a tv show that would be a helluva act break."
18884,Homer,helms calls for donut tax?!
15103,Homer,don't you remember? he went golfing all the time and it really bugged her.
14686,Homer,maybe. i'm not sure. i forgot it.
19865,Homer,"you see, boy, the real money's in bootlegging, not in your childish vandalism."
39929,Homer,"no, bigger. and big red hair that came out to... yeah, yeah like that."
34766,Homer,that's my cell phone.
16012,Homer,"is that so? oh, flan-ders! won't you join me in my kitchen?"
29217,Homer,"shrink ray? oh, there's always something else to buy."
31432,Homer,"marge, i... folk art!? that's my favorite kind of folk medium!"
33421,Homer,"hey, was there another plaque here before?"
20561,Homer,"no one's calling it an angel, lisa. if you'll look carefully, you'll notice i never once used the word ""angel""."
23871,Homer,yeah. and i got a bucket on my head!
22134,Homer,"you've gotta snap out of this funk, mayor. i'm gonna take you someplace where you can relax and forget all about gangsters."
31831,Homer,"did someone say ""snack""?"
20765,Homer,"one game of ring toss. if i can throw this hula hoop onto the chimney, you'll give us our house back. if i miss, i'll sign the deed over to you."
33902,Homer,great! do you want to see me naked?

28535,Homer,just like the pope!
39090,Homer,"marge, you're my wife of ten years and i love you. but i must observe the teachings of this man i just met tonight. now, the first thing i have to do is make amends... with the bathroom scale."
41140,Homer,i... can't... breathe! too... many... children...!
14875,Homer,"now listen, boy. we have an understanding and you'd better keep your end of it. i don't think i'd be any kind of a father if you got d's and i let you go to kamp krusty."
39738,Homer,"huh... a very thoughtful gift. but it's a surprise. you know, it's such a beautiful morning, i think i'll take a little stroll around the block."
26849,Homer,"eh, you're the shut-in."
41335,Homer,what train?
19878,Homer,"forty-two bathtubs, please."
40251,Homer,"thanks, everybody."

39432,Homer,"okay, now look. my boss is gonna be at this picnic, so i want you to show your father some love and/or respect."
36506,Homer,what's goin' on?
14816,Homer,"forgot there was a physical today, huh?"
31027,Homer,my work here is done.
35985,Homer,"sir, as a complexion scientist, i must advise you against using any more. this is the most powerful hydrator we sell."
16418,Homer,i mean... you know if we wanted to... not that i... ever did.
35099,Homer,my feet hurt.
31223,Homer,i guess.
13377,Homer,oh yeah.
41426,Homer,"well, if we put our heads together, we can think of a plan."
38445,Homer,"giuseppe, i want you to come out of retirement for the greatest fireworks show of your career."
13581,Homer,you are? why?
29761,Homer,these are my new friends. they like me for me... and my plumbing and gas hookups.
29674,Homer,my thingies!
36353,Homer,"again with ""mr. steak!"" do you know why i go to mr. steak? because at mr. steak they don't get mad at me for spending a lot of money at mr. steak!"
29126,Homer,to date!
31688,Homer,i got the idea from the regular pen.
30553,Homer,a little.

18146,Homer,"kids, would you step outside for a second?"
26056,Homer,"yes, mr. burns."
15076,Homer,oh yeah? with what?
37609,Homer,"i missed my flight so i got in a van...with some eco-friendly activists. they wanted gas, grass or ass and brother, i had the ass."
25864,Homer,"your honor, if i may sing a little bit of ""don't fear the reaper"", i think you'll agree that..."
17029,Homer,"oh, who am i kidding? i am slow..."
33437,Homer,uninsured! uninsured!
17952,Homer,"whatcha doing, marge?"
41203,Homer,uh-oh.
25980,Homer,ayyy!
22735,Homer,"oh, i shoulda known. they're hazing us, to initiate us into the truckers' fraternity."
20371,Homer,"all right, marge. i'll do it. for you."
14391,Homer,you promised you wouldn't get mad!
26560,Homer,no way. i still haven't lost the weight i put on from the last one.
36068,Homer,do you ever wonder if there are donut shops on other planets?
22799,Homer,"look pop, i'm planning some expert home repairs, and i need a pair of bolt cutters, or wire cutters, or something to get the lock off my toolbox."
32320,Homer,why you little...
29618,Homer,"please, kent. call me your holiness."
13587,Homer,huh? huh?

40009,Homer,"uh... uh... no. are you sure this microphone works? uh, well, i wouldn't say i aided her. this is on, right? because, actually, it was quite a struggle."
21386,Homer,has anyone seen my little girl?
20018,Homer,"oh, what'll i do, moe?"
27915,Homer,if you despise polite left-handers...
19704,Homer,"hey, it really is you! how'd you get to be so good?"
21205,Homer,then you might wanna close your windows before the sun hits diaper hill.
15901,Homer,"yes, honey."
16929,Homer,"oh, i guess it wouldn't be right to sell stampy after he saved my life. and, the boy seems to have some sort of relationship with him."
21668,Homer,ooh. ball one.
25899,Homer,it's about time. oh.
38933,Homer,"eh, they'll grow back."

25347,Homer,courtesy of pete sampras.
31338,Homer,"can you say ""side effects may include drowsiness and loss of appetite?"""
28832,Homer,"oh, i'm so bored! maybe i'll clean out my wallet."
23766,Homer,"perhaps, but let's not get bogged down in semantics."
40953,Homer,"i'm going to find my brother. i don't care what it takes. if i have to move heaven and earth, i'm going to find him!"
22906,Homer,god bless america!
31402,Homer,"rich maple color, good swirl..."

33608,Homer,i can't tell if those are questions or statements.
39431,Homer,"there it is, kids... stately burns manor. heaven on earth."
18164,Homer,i've got no time for your demented parlor games! you won't be telling anyone else that homer simpson shot you.
39753,Homer,"well, if you don't want it, i know someone who does."
29089,Homer,why? because i only kissed one girl in my whole life? that's still one more than you.
39280,Homer,"bart, did you hear that? what a name -- ""santa's little helper"". it's a sign! it's an omen!"
25818,Homer,are you coming on to me?

23313,Homer,"marge, i'm sorry, but your cooking's only got two moves: ""shake"" and ""bake."""
15390,Homer,"wait a minute. that was a ""lucy"" show... okay, where were we?"
34603,Homer,"well, uh... the one place the cameras can't see is right here in our backyard so i'm charging people to do whatever they want -- isn't that wonderful?"
23953,Homer,what have you done with my party guests?
39932,Homer,"yes, sir."
18770,Homer,mr. burns has a mother!? she must be a hundred million years old!
23814,Homer,"hello, lollipop island? there's a little girl here who had too many sourballs."

28277,Homer,"this is it, baby. first thing tomorrow, we're getting a playstation one!"
39740,Homer,ah... no.
40020,Homer,"oooh, ""gorilla, the conqueror."" the granddaddy of them all."

31391,Homer,it's gonna be awesome!
19065,Homer,"we'll search out every place a sick, twisted, solitary misfit might run to."
39288,Homer,"yeah, you're right. i guess whirlwind is our only hope for a merry christmas."
18356,Homer,"no. it would only worry her. if you want to add to her worries, go ahead. i guess i'm just a little more grateful for all she's done for us."
30010,Homer,"you did it, sweetie!"
27254,Homer,"oh, yes! the tag chafed my throat! let's go eat some bugs."
36093,Homer,"love?! your mom's gonna feel so good it'll make mere ""love"" seem like chewing tinfoil. because today i'm getting it autographed."
14483,Homer,"you found my baby. oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
22104,Homer,"hmm, still half an hour till dinner. oh, well..."

16628,Homer,"just a minute! don't hang up! y'ello... you'll have to speak up, i'm wearing a towel."
16370,Homer,"marge, don't discourage the boy. weaseling out of things is important to learn. it's what separates us from the animals. except the weasel."
39215,Homer,y'ello.
22411,Homer,and that big yellow flower.
19325,Homer,it can't just be sex. it can't.
36244,Homer,"so, uh, you guys are my new coworkers."
38487,Homer,eat your broccoli.
31001,Homer,what? i have great ass suction. now how 'bout a little privacy?
39045,Homer,i don't want to be with you anymore.
30311,Homer,"look, if it were up to me, i'd be harassing them with you. if anything, i'd be the guy who took it too far. but i love my wife and i want to win her back!"
21247,Homer,"well then, can't someone else do it?"
29038,Homer,"not so fast, old-time liberal."
22837,Homer,"i'm gonna be an outsider artist! that way, i can turn all these old baseball cards, disney memorabilia, and antiques into something valuable."
31740,Homer,"okay, but i'm not good at details. or the big picture. i also show up late, and drunk."
37872,Homer,"shut up, flanders!"
36914,Homer,gonna drink ammonia / 'cause it tastes like cheese / wonder what will happen...
37816,Homer,"ooh, spaghetti."

32355,Homer,"great, great -- i turned over so many wheelbarrows... wait, that was your thing."

18968,Homer,"but you've got all the top bands in here. styx? i just heard them on ""the king biscuit flour hour."" now here are some of your no-name bands: sonic youth, nine inch nails, hullabalooza..."
33090,Homer,"c'mon, all the teens on bikes are doin' it."
35947,Homer,but gravy is the freedom where--
25684,Homer,she's still bossing you around from beyond the grave? can they do that?
24898,Homer,"real news is great, son. but i'm gettin' a thousand hits an hour with grade-a bull plop."
35724,Homer,"the perfect crime, eh?"
40716,Homer,"do you two have to sit so close to the tv? back up, or it'll hurt your eyes."
15484,Homer,"hey, i'm just trying to make it easier on 'em."
23987,Homer,i stand by my disappointed groan.
27600,Homer,"well, kathy, i'll tell you. it's viagrogaine. it gives you lots of hair and what you need down there. what are you waiting for, loser?"

13889,Homer,"marge, i've got to get her a pony. when i look in lisa's eyes, i don't see love anymore."
21588,Homer,"ohh, that's where you're wrong, marge. he was a shameless self-promoter."
26157,Homer,i don't know how to feel.
14389,Homer,play on.

29451,Homer,screw you.

27884,Homer,uh-oh. gotta even it out.

16537,Homer,can't talk now.
38579,Homer,"so... yeah. things aren't perfect with the missus and me. and by the way, nice melons."
19227,Homer,"yes, sir. i do."

22586,Homer,"oh, i'm sure of it!"
37818,Homer,"may i ask what this is regarding? oooh, a budding new friendship? oooh! boy, how come you can't get a new friend?"
24279,Homer,"quit gabbin' and start grabbin'. and remember, the best stuff is usually deep in the garbage juice."
21598,Homer,my files!
24124,Homer,"yeah, it's a real ghost town in there."
22296,Homer,"okay, whatever takes my mind off my life."

26608,Homer,"it's a murder, honey. a group of crows is called a murder."
25502,Homer,"okay maggie, put it down."
17253,Homer,"hmm. i don't agree with his bart-killing policy, but i do approve of his selma-killing policy."
19636,Homer,"stay back! i have powers! uh, political powers!"
26920,Homer,"well think again. son, you're going to juvie."
35146,Homer,soda?
40243,Homer,"marge, this ticket doesn't just give me a seat, it also gives me the right - no, the duty, to make a complete ass of myself."
37752,Homer,"oh! oh wait, there's more!"
35932,Homer,then what percent above one hundred are you behind me?
31707,Homer,"look boy, nobody knows better than me that you're a lost cause. but the school's paying for five sessions and there's a chinese restaurant next door where i can get drunk."
21381,Homer,"mmmaybe... but you don't know lisa. i mean she's so smart, they hooked her up to a big computer to try to teach it some things, but she had so much knowledge it overloaded and then it got really hot and caught on fire."
26362,Homer,"wait, you really think marge is gonna fall for this guy? even after i bought her that hockey-fight tape?"
25009,Homer,"thank you... no shoving... that's right, put your money in here... all of it... is that everyone?"
39503,Homer,arrrgh!
34297,Homer,"i warn you: i don't know what's in there but if it's about a simpson, you ain't gonna be proud."
39820,Homer,"look, barney. see the row of tiny lights up there? the middle one is my house. someone must have left the porch light on."
37625,Homer,a beer from the sky! it's a sign!
26360,Homer,i didn't sell her. i just rented her to an old boyfriend.
26868,Homer,"book 'im, lou."
21501,Homer,scary ways. but we never intended it to end like that. with thousands of people staring at our naked bodies.
29543,Homer,dammit! will you take a check?
33836,Homer,that's another twenty or thirty years.
24147,Homer,me homer. me hiding from pbs.
40938,Homer,"hey, selma's no prize pig herself you know."
34060,Homer,you wouldn't dare!
31414,Homer,max told you about me?
21829,Homer,who the hell are you?
20893,Homer,hmmm.
29223,Homer,"bah! has science ever kissed a woman, or won the super bowl, or put a man on the moon? this is what i think of your precious science."
14725,Homer,"i don't have time to answer all these questions. uh, time is money. come on, people!"
13953,Homer,thanks. when is she gonna stop loving me?
33315,Homer,"sweetie, i have a very special surprise for you."
30045,Homer,"okay morty, gimme a rose-colored spot, tight to the mid-chest and an aqua background with an astronaut on a surfboard."
21244,Homer,"uh, okay, it's excellent. but aren't you tired of waking up early and dragging the garbage to the curb?"
39406,Homer,"our lives are in the hands of men no smarter than you or i. many of them, incompetent boobs. i know this because i have worked along side them, gone bowling with them, watched them pass me over for promotions time and again. and i say, this stinks!"
16257,Homer,"marge, i know you didn't believe me about the vending machines. that's why i had the fireman write me a note."
41446,Homer,"oh, i don't feel so good."
37846,Homer,"sorry, but dick fiddler is allergic to potatoes."
31684,Homer,why do you sound so shocked? this is our fifth take.
40668,Homer,hello? yeah he's here who is this? bart's friend milhouse. bart! get your butt down here!
16279,Homer,done.
37382,Homer,"now, for the record, i hated the building, the people in it and the spirit it represented. i never hated the church itself. and now, finally, i believe in something bigger than myself."
36618,Homer,"uh, well, looking back, i guess it started sometime before bart was born."
23098,Homer,it burns! it burns!
38578,Homer,"why is it always me? i work twelve hours a week, you know!"
31392,Homer,"man, couples in this state sure like to clink glasses."
23087,Homer,"well, i haven't talked it over with the family, but i think we'd all like a free dinner at americatown."
24498,Homer,not now. i'm busy turning on this washing machine.
22558,Homer,fine.
15653,Homer,"for your information, i'm his father!"
23835,Homer,"oh, thank you good sir."
15906,Homer,woo hoo!
27738,Homer,"no, i think this calls for something a little more cerebral."
18640,Homer,why did he have to move in on my territory? look at him. thinks just because he led the free world he can act like a big shot.
27909,Homer,his name is ned!
28189,Homer,i can't go on...
36729,Homer,i never thought homer simpson would be a part of the day of the locust.
32406,Homer,and we'll move your bedtime to an hour later so you'll have more time to be alone with your thoughts.
15453,Homer,"okay, okay. we need forty-thousand dollars. now, how much do we have in the checkbook?"
27482,Homer,yes...
29929,Homer,real.
19260,Homer,"no, but at least rinse your mouth out with soda."
22904,Homer,"knowing you always hate my first idea, i prepared a backup. how about a big olympic hello for springy, the springfield spring!"
13678,Homer,"no, i do not know what schadenfreude is. please tell me, because i'm dying to know."
13803,Homer,gladly.
26645,Homer,you're covered with a very fine fuzz.
41039,Homer,"get in, dad. i'll explain on the way home."
38171,Homer,"oh, that was cold, luann. so cold! brrrrr! sarcastic brrrrrr!"
22728,Homer,"wow! you guys are even lazier than me! well, don't worry. i'll keep your secret."
20874,Homer,"yes! yes! oh, god yes!"
17524,Homer,"but marge, you deserve a vacation. it's a chance for you to clean up after us in a whole other state."
39768,Homer,"sport, dear, it's a sport, you silly thing."
21149,Homer,yes!
39116,Homer,i'm not spending my precious saturday chauffeuring those over-privileged kids to a better life than i ever had.
13509,Homer,homer simpson.
28340,Homer,"her luggage is inscribed ""h.r.h."" -- which means her real name must be... henrietta r. hippo."
27276,Homer,"triple, no. definitely no."
20925,Homer,"""stealing, stealing / stealing a car for moe / dada dada dada dada / insurance fraud today..."""
35790,Homer,can you be my dad?
23676,Homer,"eight kids. hm, i'm sterile, right baby doll?"
35658,Homer,i won't shed a tear when the oceans rise and wash this world away.
18993,Homer,"oh, it makes no sense. i haven't changed since high school and suddenly i'm uncool. i've been kicked out of paradise."
33172,Homer,"keep moving, deadbeat -- cash only."
34739,Homer,yes... uh... maybe i'll just come back during someone else's shift... is claire working today? she's a real sucker.
18520,Homer,"bart! where are ya, boy."
17169,Homer,"okay, marge. as long as we're traumatizing the kids, i have a scandalous story of my own."
36601,Homer,"whatever you want, sweetie."
33026,Homer,forgot my keys.
23284,Homer,woo hoo! stop the presses!
32508,Homer,"yeah, well, between you and me, i still can't stand him."
21746,Homer,"well, we can't compete with that, but--"
14244,Homer,"i swear to you, when you come out of there, the first thing you're gonna see is a man with a good job."
29176,Homer,stupid women drivers.
22165,Homer,senior citizen? flanders?
33212,Homer,"you know, for a bartender-bookie you're awfully judgmental."
23828,Homer,mops? the cure sounds worse than the disease.
26474,Homer,"well, you brought me into this world, so no."
28826,Homer,can i apply my time toward a future crime?
17417,Homer,"ooh, ""portrait!"" sounds classy... doesn't it?"
29503,Homer,"listen, i gotta tell ya, i chew in my sleep."
14601,Homer,"correction. three hundred and eighty million to fifty. so what are you gonna do with your share of the money, kids?"
39554,Homer,"what did you do this time, you little hoodlum? oop. get out of the way."
37129,Homer,i am sick and tired of trying to decode you like you're some kind of human being separate from myself!!!
25454,Homer,but homer simpson doesn't give in to temptation that easily... hey!
23251,Homer,the frame store! you monster!
26731,Homer,"i gave up anger forever. from now on, i'm into candles, soft music and horse tranquilizers."
38202,Homer,while you're at it... could you make me a couple more?
14755,Homer,lousy snitch.
40849,Homer,the lad has a point.
14353,Homer,"c'mon, c'mon! don't you realize this is costing me money?"
37534,Homer,"don't worry, moe. when marge is asleep, i'll sneak back."
34252,Homer,"yes, but i have one more thing to show you."
25001,Homer,"so what's the pitch, old man?"
13745,Homer,i thought he was dead.
27566,Homer,what the--? half goes to bart. half goes to my vegas wife. what's left for moe?
23210,Homer,"yeah, and i'm a size four."
32527,Homer,six a.m. -- still early enough to sneak into bed and pretend i actually got home at three a.m.
35217,Homer,i can't believe i'm riding around in cheech's van! the van made of weed!
27096,Homer,i'm entitled to a private life! i'm not a role model! and so forth.
38992,Homer,it's good to be back.
28160,Homer,death? we don't want any.
39744,Homer,too exciting.
31371,Homer,"ohhh, don't forget. don't forget what?!"
17488,Homer,here's where it all started to go wrong. how'm i supposed to be a good dad when i never had one myself?
39827,Homer,"uh... mr. burns, in spite of what everybody thinks, i'm no lover-boy."
16070,Homer,my first day of college. i wish my father was alive to see this.
27908,Homer,fine.
40434,Homer,"yes, dad."
33125,Homer,"all marge and i need are a queen-sized bed and a king-sized ""do not disturb"" sign."
33683,Homer,how would i know?
27292,Homer,"ooh, someone's coming!"
13950,Homer,i don't know. how long do horses live?
33922,Homer,but how will i keep from overeating?
15950,Homer,hello...
16711,Homer,"we're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock to-nighhhttt!"
18602,Homer,"aw, marge, we were so close to winning the championship. now thanks to burns it's never gonna happen. and i spent so much time building that trophy case."
29513,Homer,"i'm number one! i beat my son! victory is mine, so kiss my behind!"
38605,Homer,"woo-hoo? i don't know... ""fracking"" is one of those scary lisa words."
38486,Homer,you are not leaving this table until you eat that broccoli. and i'm going to sit right here until you do.
22218,Homer,"oh, never mind. just pay attention."
28835,Homer,that was you!?
40630,Homer,why you little --
40018,Homer,"i'm just gonna take this over to the refrigerator and, hmmm. well as long as i'm here, i might as well kill two birds with one stone."
26537,Homer,now that's what i call a moon shot.
22822,Homer,all right! my bumper fell off!
41318,Homer,"kiss her already. what, are you chicken? bok-bok-bok-bok-bok-bok-bok-bok!"
40169,Homer,"yeah, thanks lisa."
15393,Homer,"hi, flanders."
32010,Homer,"hello, officer!"
39601,Homer,a satellite dish!
23479,Homer,easy... careful... steady...
30212,Homer,bingo!
26686,Homer,and you wanted to take him to the hospital.
32700,Homer,my old car!
28349,Homer,"okay, what do i do?"
21492,Homer,"grab onto the handles, marge."
19866,Homer,"wait a minute. i forgot to make sure the coast was clear. aw, it's probably clear. let's go."
36772,Homer,i'm standing by that.
24624,Homer,now who's stupid?
16809,Homer,"marge, quit livin' in the past."
27629,Homer,"daddy made it for your dance recital, honey!"
23413,Homer,why that little... he insulted your honor!
19503,Homer,they see us! they're starting to turn!
15904,Homer,yeah.
41223,Homer,okay. don't use reverse psychology.
25278,Homer,"okay, now some of that is me."
35617,Homer,hm.
29830,Homer,why? is it messing you up?
13147,Homer,"you know, doing dishes has been the best part of camp."
20865,Homer,"well, well, well... if it isn't professor know-it-all. 'scuse me, marge."
14444,Homer,all right then.
33277,Homer,ow! my finger!
27799,Homer,"you may be a smart kid, lisa, but you don't know much about not hurting people's feelings."
21989,Homer,"uh-huh. pinchy would have wanted it this way. my dear, sweet pinchy. no more pain where you are now, boy."
13994,Homer,"well, that's what i... wait a minute. what are you doing?"
16782,Homer,"heh, heh, heh. yeah they swore they'd get us back by spiking our water supply. but they didn't have the guts."
36424,Homer,the three of us are going to the most romantic restaurant in town.
22297,Homer,"well, turn something on. i'm starting to think."
37383,Homer,why you little...! lamb... mustn't... kill own son... only god can do that...
14989,Homer,no. they moved to phoenix.
31917,Homer,"what a wonderful night's sleep. thank you methasorbizone tartrate, also known as nappien."
14763,Homer,"hey, and after we watch this, we can tape over it."
26709,Homer,"this'll teach that stupid chair. i'm on fire! oh, i hope no one's drawing this. ow!"
19322,Homer,i already did.
28042,Homer,"honey, you seem frazzled. why don't you come with us?"
36246,Homer,"i said, workin' hard or hardly working? working hard or hardly working?! working hard or hardly working?!"
33842,Homer,s'open!
38091,Homer,i call all music mozart!
22108,Homer,"oh, honey, don't be so naive. that's how the world works. sure, the mayor takes a few bribes, but he also makes the trains run on time."
34085,Homer,moonshine in the water? i'll be the judge of that.
26703,Homer,i'm sick of your lies. secrets and lies. it's always secrets and lies.
29341,Homer,"marge, that's crazy talk. now look, i'll save lisa. your place is here with the women."
16624,Homer,we'll dig our way out!
23898,Homer,"bart, i need a miracle!"
30225,Homer,"wow! up here, that feels good!"
14752,Homer,pfft.
23733,Homer,really? read it.
38648,Homer,don't drink my loved ones!
16025,Homer,everything is a source of fun...
29735,Homer,huh?
24634,Homer,stop right there.
13357,Homer,"i'm sorry, honey. can't we just forget it and go to church."
26405,Homer,"look, boy. here's my advice on women: don't give them nicknames like ""jumbo"" or ""boxcar"" and always get receipts -- it makes you look like a business guy..."
30345,Homer,"oh, and i spy with my little eye something with four legs that can't run."
23732,Homer,"yeah, someone really dropped the ball here. marge? marge?!"
38068,Homer,fine! but the game is much more enjoyable if you understand it.
19207,Homer,are you an angel?
15473,Homer,"son, they call it a ""droodle"". whoo hoo! look at him go!"
36342,Homer,she walked away and slammed the door. what does it mean? what does it mean?
32171,Homer,those are words.
31725,Homer,"sure, but i think you're exaggerating the problem."
41474,Homer,"stupid kid. steals my future. well i'm going to...ice cream, with cookie dough?!"
19355,Homer,"hey, what's this thing?"
22049,Homer,"oh, i like taffy, but i don't deserve taffy."
41428,Homer,i'm here to take my life back!
33860,Homer,what movie?
38014,Homer,what else is marge hiding from me?
38258,Homer,"well, at least i'll die the american way. in a foreign country wearing short pants."
37426,Homer,"the way you put it, it sounds so perfect, but it's not."
41116,Homer,"pass the bug juice, dad."
40885,Homer,"bart, you promised me you wouldn't watch that trash! now go to your room."
32415,Homer,"your thoughts should stay in your head! heh, heh, i sure told him. now, what am i gonna do about marge?"
26441,Homer,i've seen fancier.
13219,Homer,"that's right. and if anyone asked who swindled you, it was christians. remember that name: christians."
37073,Homer,goodbye forever!
28910,Homer,that's right. i got a job here so i can watch over you like a mother hen.
25673,Homer,"say bye, mr. flanders."
18318,Homer,but i seem to be trapped in here.
32549,Homer,i'm afraid i did something to make marge and the kids leave me.
19147,Homer,aargh!
23594,Homer,sweet bowling alley balloon. you're my only friend.
25418,Homer,the satisfaction of helping another human being is all the thanks i et cetera.
34806,Homer,excuse me?
30167,Homer,you're right. but you know who the real victim is here? ned.
31588,Homer,i can't go back to living on the surface world! i can't!
21707,Homer,"shut your squeal hole, booze jockey. i'm gonna, like, totally waste you."
16503,Homer,we got more gongs than the break-dancing robot that caught on fire.
15496,Homer,you seem okay.
23159,Homer,here comes two!
24048,Homer,"oh, i missed one!"
17652,Homer,"go knightboat, go!"
29780,Homer,will you raise them christian?
33970,Homer,it wasn't just a piece -- it was the whole cake! frosting... like snow... on the eaves of a bavarian castle!
35444,Homer,if i tossed you guys a bucket full of something could you pour it out and toss the bucket back up? don't drink it!
20054,Homer,call me when you get a karaoke machine.
34131,Homer,"hmm, while i'm up there..."
26216,Homer,use both hands...
19596,Homer,look at him. he's gonna do something. and you know it's gonna be good!
40625,Homer,"no need, doc. i can read marge like a book."
30626,Homer,i honor you and your country.
21900,Homer,"that was cool. think i'll stick around. we've got everything we need right here. good times, sunshine, free love..."
17639,Homer,"from now on, i want you to be honest with me. i mean, i'm not perfect, right?"
18420,Homer,what are you talking about?
34701,Homer,"don't worry, i got it!"
38765,Homer,i'm not jealous. i'm envious. jealousy is when you worry someone will take what you have. envy is wanting what someone else has. what i feel is envy.
38629,Homer,"oh yeah, great. great, marge. great work. thanks to you, springfield will never be a natural gas boom town. and like all boom towns it would have lasted forever."
29175,Homer,"boy, i can't wait to dance on his grave."
36695,Homer,dad!
16980,Homer,"okay, fine."
37012,Homer,white rice or brown?
31328,Homer,now where's my parade? where's my parade?
26872,Homer,gimme some peanuts.
35301,Homer,all right.
18922,Homer,"open your eyes, lisa. our schools are so jam-packed with immigrants, kids like bart have lost the will to learn."
38444,Homer,kaboom.
30075,Homer,"three fifteen p.m., may 18th! that's when the rapture will be!"
29043,Homer,we shall continue this conversation in the pie cave.
36771,Homer,i'm really stupid.
26758,Homer,don't worry. i'm just gonna drain the area around your wound. so cold... so cold...
26913,Homer,you're right. what's this?
37329,Homer,you're all i have left. i trust you completely.
27837,Homer,whatever.
33283,Homer,"boy, don't blow up this mall! it has the cookie store that gives free samples!"
29667,Homer,i'll be back for tall kitchen bags!
15018,Homer,"flanders, you saved me. why?"
22653,Homer,"oh good, i've been meaning to buy a ""dream catcher?"" gimme a break."
34903,Homer,"marge, i'm watching a rerun of an important bowl game."
17567,Homer,"hey, will you guys help me fix my..."
23219,Homer,hmm. my career has kinda lost momentum...
23886,Homer,"well, i think the veal might have died of loneliness..."
25085,Homer,that motion-capture suit is just what this country needs. just think of all the hilarious motions that are going uncaptured. like this...
19882,Homer,"uh... nothing, marge. i think it must have been that bean i had for dinner."
38294,Homer,"yeah, i knew you'd think it's dumb--"
41506,Homer,"sing me my bedtime song, mom."
18014,Homer,"my ""best of ray stevens featuring the streak"" album! so it was the dog that buried all our stuff!"
39587,Homer,"that's okay. with the tips you've given me, i'm going to pound the tar out of a certain little smarty pants tonight."
24260,Homer,"right, right, present. anyway, can i get you some soylent green?"
36198,Homer,whee! i'm in me! / oh! / i love the down parts! here comes!
29996,Homer,i need change for a dollar.
34318,Homer,"hm. clean dishes. i either have to unload them, or, uh..."
41562,Homer,leave the humidor.
31830,Homer,do i have to?
28297,Homer,over my dead body!
21887,Homer,"my head full of long, luxurious, hippie hair. i'll do it!"
32459,Homer,all food tastes like barf now.
37233,Homer,why does everything i forbid always happen?
29160,Homer,simpson.
29784,Homer,"marge, you're taking this pretty well."
18458,Homer,"i hate to rain on your parade, lady, but this is my grave. hey, wait a minute... mom?"
29307,Homer,"but talking about the problem is the first step towards the solution, right?"
29617,Homer,wait a minute! are you two brother and sister?
37566,Homer,"more free stuff, more free stuff, more free stuff, more free stuff..."
27962,Homer,"oh thank god, the dog's here! pull me free, boy."
32066,Homer,apu sang a song. what are you gonna do?
15667,Homer,"uh, kind of. nobody makes a big deal out of valentine's day."
19846,Homer,"oh, honey, you're not the world's worst mother. what about that freezer lady in georgia?"
34354,Homer,fine. i'll do both at once. we should both take a role in vacation planning!
40769,Homer,"no, you..."
28550,Homer,"wait a minute, everyone! there's your christmas up there!"
27002,Homer,gimme!
24675,Homer,"oh, c'mon, it plays itself. ""pacman fever / a do do do do / it's driving me crazy."" look lisa, daddy's in the who!"
15769,Homer,"done and done! heh, heh, heh."
14147,Homer,"oh, woa is me."
37582,Homer,you're so beautiful when i cut you off in the middle of a question.
19991,Homer,konichi-wa.
16696,Homer,really?
30110,Homer,"oh, i'm wrong again. i'm nothing but a big, fat... oh!"
25710,Homer,i'm okay.
14352,Homer,cincinnati.
20723,Homer,"thanks for the food, mister..."
27466,Homer,'mornin' kids! i made your lunches. they're on the table.
26606,Homer,"i'm sure he'll turn up. look, here's one of his buttons."
29258,Homer,"oh, now you tell me."
31891,Homer,what's wrong with it?
28413,Homer,i never realized how hot this suit is. i'm sweating out all my blood-lust!
19145,Homer,"eh, you have any sugar around here?"
25931,Homer,woo hoo!
26142,Homer,"the word ""unblowupable"" is thrown around a lot these days, but i think i can say with confidence..."
23374,Homer,"eyes bigger than your stomach, eh, wolfie?"
23075,Homer,"spare some salt, tubby?"
26350,Homer,"if we had artie's money, i could get that snoring surgery. plus at least two of those other surgeries i desperately need."
18641,Homer,stupid president. why couldn't he just stay in his own state?
13521,Homer,"save a guy's life, and whattaya get? nothin'! worse than nothin'! just a big, scary rock."
37435,Homer,"no, it's something else."
16208,Homer,no.
38540,Homer,"careful, marge, that's how i bankrupted a pizza hut."
31506,Homer,no man should outlive his fictional wizard! no man!
29391,Homer,stay out of my boxes!
24735,Homer,"ah, the luftwaffe. the washington generals of the history channel."
40799,Homer,"wait, wait, wait, marge. if honest and open is what you like, get a load of this. i'm not really in any french class. this was just a brilliant scheme to get to know you better."
18532,Homer,"...""no tv and no beer make homer..."" something, something."
15670,Homer,perhaps this might be appropriate.
21447,Homer,g'night.
25374,Homer,"yeah, that's the look."
13461,Homer,it was the olden days!
33893,Homer,drinking makes me slee-py
15957,Homer,just leave it to me.
36065,Homer,"pish tosh, smithers, and fiddle-dee-dee! nailed it!"
33306,Homer,"they're just drones, lisa. they only live for like five minutes anyway. and they only have haploid cells, not diploid like me and bart."
28371,Homer,"well, well, if it isn't fatty and smell-ma."
36302,Homer,watch whatever you want -- i got you here alive. now i'm gonna visit the only court i could never be in contempt of: food court.
35841,Homer,everything's perfect about the past except how it led to the present!
35149,Homer,"there's something going on at the nuclear plant that's a little more important that your ""table read."""
18714,Homer,"i'm gonna regale everyone with my anecdote. you know, the one i tried to say on the radio? heh, heh, who's gonna bleep me this time?"
23929,Homer,what about partays?
40460,Homer,how much longer was sherbert planning on making this piece of junk?
17999,Homer,"you know what's great about you english? ""octopussy."" man, i must have seen that movie... twice."
40768,Homer,you ignoramus.
13341,Homer,"bart, do that thing you do that's so cute."
33510,Homer,"hey, flanders. you can't evict us because a senior's living here now."
25488,Homer,this is such an eye-opener. i always pictured the kids dying in the living room.
23029,Homer,ahh! undo! undo! uhh.
13776,Homer,"what's your problem, boy?"
20479,Homer,"oh, you hate lotus flowers, too? oh, don't get me started on lotus flowers."
19171,Homer,the thing is -- oof! -- bart really loves that belt and -- ugh!
34089,Homer,oooh.
24297,Homer,"ah, man that's sweet. okay, let's go."
39297,Homer,"come on, boy."
41082,Homer,"you do? ha ha, ha ha ha!"
23709,Homer,"this gang's for rebels, flanders, not conformos."
15791,Homer,haw haw. april fool's.
30178,Homer,go! go! go!
26885,Homer,"goodbye, marge."
32725,Homer,"mmm, lamb."
37022,Homer,"good riddance. when i found out shrimp cocktails had no alcohol, i really lost interest."
36885,Homer,oh no! i won't be able to help you pack up grampa!
39391,Homer,"well, live and learn."
35288,Homer,"um, i uh, lied about having health insurance."
23026,Homer,the internet? is that thing still around?
31549,Homer,i bet it was bill clinton's fault.
20274,Homer,"so, who wants to steal some ferraris?"
32804,Homer,just sit still in my lap!
21637,Homer,"look, mr. edison, i did it. i'm an inventor! and i owe it all to you."
36311,Homer,it's programmed to my specifications!
23813,Homer,oh yeah. you were way off.
30870,Homer,stupid non-plasma tv. picture so blurry. might as well rub dirt in my eyes.
19205,Homer,gotcha.
23876,Homer,look at moe dance! aloha moe...
19836,Homer,"you know, honey, when i think of all the good times we've had together-- aaagh!"
16702,Homer,"apu, if it'll make you feel any better, i've learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish flanders was dead."
16106,Homer,"of course he does. he's a cute little piggy. curly, straight, curly, straight, curly..."
16572,Homer,"no, we're forming a vigilante group."
28597,Homer,"there's nothing worse than the look on a boy's face when he says ""dad i don't think you can build a fully-functional robot."""
15897,Homer,"maybe so, lisa, but it's part of our oh-so-human nature. inside every man is a struggle between good and evil that cannot be resolved."
27265,Homer,"hm, the water's off. i'll use my eye to see what the trouble is."
25972,Homer,can do. now don't you worry about a thing.
23543,Homer,"heh, heh. i'd hate to see the look on ol' burnsie's face if he knew i was just gettin' in. hee hee."
35960,Homer,"now to baptize his candidacy with my tears. the words ""strutting stadium rocker"" are overused these days, but when i first met ted nugent..."
16345,Homer,it sure does!
22850,Homer,you're upset about something. is this about that trip barney and i took to machu picchu?
37420,Homer,my wife has never seen my head naked. maybe i should wear a cowboy hat.
23825,Homer,yes! yesssss!
26787,Homer,and krusty. we gotta invite krusty.
24195,Homer,"oh, you should've seen their faces, honey. now i know how bob stupak feels."
19976,Homer,"but marge, i'm obsessed with it! where did it come from? what is it a box of? how'd my face get on it?!"
23786,Homer,quit it! must wash eyes! j--
21329,Homer,"yeah, he helped me blast through the burn and ride the zone."
19595,Homer,"but marge, that little guy hasn't done anything yet."
26952,Homer,"what, and let them come after you and the kids?"
35448,Homer,xbox.
16673,Homer,"okay, okay i'll let him. but then i get a chipwich, okay?"
34567,Homer,of course.
37288,Homer,you gotta be kiddin'.
38343,Homer,whew!
22472,Homer,i'm free! woo hoo!
16216,Homer,it sure was nice of mr. burns to invite us for a midnight dinner at his country house in... pennsylvania.
26691,Homer,don't you have criminals to catch?
23246,Homer,"but how do we know, marge? how do we know?"
13932,Homer,there it is.
24429,Homer,you'd better.
38361,Homer,yeah... well just talk about sports!
18324,Homer,"ow! watch it, coney."
36837,Homer,i don't know how.
36485,Homer,where are they going with this?
39202,Homer,pardon my galoshes.
30702,Homer,what do i do? what do i do?
23137,Homer,huh?
30597,Homer,"bomp, bomp, bomp, bomp..."
13906,Homer,"mr. burns, you do this personally?"
33210,Homer,fine. i won't look you in the eye.
36604,Homer,x's for eyes...
34271,Homer,there's a winter olympics?
16612,Homer,i didn't say stop.
39175,Homer,oh boy oh boy.
39879,Homer,you gotta be kiddin'. the lek?
13721,Homer,"flanders, you open that store tomorrow!"
19002,Homer,"""stay in school. your hero, homer."""
33588,Homer,"sir, i brought my father thousands of miles just to drink at your bar."
18894,Homer,"oh, don't worry, maggie! i'll think of something!"
18963,Homer,"no, i'm not. i'm teaching you about rock music."
22536,Homer,correction. kill us both.
23555,Homer,"hey, guys. is it normal to see burns' face on a bowling ball?"
27944,Homer,i still hate them. go back to pittsburgh!
20023,Homer,it's him! it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him it's him!...
29694,Homer,i finally get this play!
28834,Homer,"that's it. from now on i'm not looking forward to anything. oh my god, tomorrow there's a two-for-one sale on piano benches! i can't wait!"
28620,Homer,"and if anything happens to me, i want you bullies to take care of my boy."
16908,Homer,"so, your bid is zero."
18654,Homer,i'm going to punch george bush in the face!
14142,Homer,lucky drunks.
31278,Homer,avenge me!
27788,Homer,"no, because they pass the savings onto me, the consumer."
40617,Homer,there's gotta be something i haven't tried. huh? hey! what's this? fugu!
13685,Homer,"hey flanders, when are your busy hours?"
27558,Homer,emancipated? don't you like being a dude?
20727,Homer,"please, folks. hold your fire. the water level is dangerously low. oh!"
41132,Homer,"if i take you, will you two shut up and quit bugging me?"
30202,Homer,"i didn't need that new fact! now i forgot who won bud bowl eight. boy, i'm pulling you outta that crazy school!"
25193,Homer,so? just gimme some drugs and surgery.
33117,Homer,sushi fight!!
19706,Homer,"uh, i guess. is this episode going on the air live?"
32862,Homer,you stupid kid! what if i walked in here barefoot?
22151,Homer,"oh, fat tony."
25780,Homer,i'll tell you where we're not going: jail.
17679,Homer,"and that is that. goodbye mind-numbing, back-breaking labor forever. hello dream job in paradise."
25372,Homer,i wanna go home now.
32401,Homer,spaz.
21576,Homer,"ooh, look at all the inventions edison came up with. the stock ticker, the storage battery, even wax paper. and look at him dance."
18608,Homer,thanks.
18845,Homer,"that reminds me -- troy said something interesting last night at the bar. apparently he doesn't really love selma and the marriage is just a sham to help his career. well, enough talk. let's snuggle."
34278,Homer,"oh, a pork bao, a shrimp bao, everywhere a bao bao / homer simpson wins a gold / sliding rocks on ice... bao bao!"
40921,Homer,all right.
27474,Homer,"somewhere in that sea of bull hormones is the sweet, wonderful girl i married. the woman who instead of swatting a fly, will give it a bath and send it on its way. i'd sure like to go home and have jiffy pop with her."
32673,Homer,what if i told you some of the greatest love stories of all time?
27947,Homer,"woo hoo! in your face, imaginary guy!"
14025,Homer,"i'll just sit here in ""li'l lightnin'"" -- which the simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, i had a son."
39434,Homer,"simpson, homer."
32436,Homer,are you sure they're not talking about cars? because those are car words.
23381,Homer,"hey, this milk's broken."
20835,Homer,yeah. he's my favorite fictional character.
24773,Homer,"yes, go on..."
25882,Homer,that's my boy...
37016,Homer,how can that be? i took every last can of gas!
37173,Homer,...twenty-five dollar casino chip...
26835,Homer,once upon a time there were three bears. the end.
34556,Homer,"ooh, it's dinner time!"
30831,Homer,don't pressure me. i get enough of that from my dad.
33797,Homer,"that's not henry the seventh, it's henry the sixth! stupid, stupid, stupid!"
31259,Homer,"by the way, nice job installing this wall-chart bracket. if the kids ask, i did it."
23730,Homer,"okay, bikers, that's it. benjamin franklin once said that house guests are like fish at... huh? they're gone! woo hoo!"
16166,Homer,i knew you'd come crawling back.
33599,Homer,"yeah, look at 'em crowding the bar! there's sully, and mack, jimmy d. and jimmy b.! what can i get ya, boys -- the usual?"
32176,Homer,"lisa's right, son. your mom is way too classy a lady to crash a private--"
28809,Homer,"okay kids, you can keep him."
36359,Homer,i never even got to realize this jacket was too small.
28985,Homer,"boy, it's great being here without those children of yours."
28415,Homer,oh my god! lenny! carl! bart?
24162,Homer,nothin'.
33604,Homer,"so, what can't people do in modern ireland?"
14664,Homer,"oh, that submarine's so fake... look, you can see the strings... ooh! an octopus!"
31687,Homer,"just click the buttons at the top and you can choose from ketchup, mustard, mayo, and relish."
18534,Homer,"ooh, sorry. here's another one."
18806,Homer,"you can't let yourself end up in a place like this. you've got two choices: you can give up on yourself and take the barney-guarding job, like so many of us have contemplated in our darkest moments. or you can admit to yourself there's only one person that can make you happy and do whatever it takes to get them back."
18370,Homer,"so that's it, isn't it, marge? looks. i didn't know you were so shallow."
13662,Homer,hmmm.
15548,Homer,"are we gonna die, son?"
14521,Homer,"fiddle dee dee. that will require a tetanus shot. i'm not going to swear, but i am going to kick this doghouse down."
19411,Homer,you're nuts. i gotta get some fresh air.
28259,Homer,"mom, i'm gonna hide you where there's no one around for miles... disney's california adventure."
18048,Homer,really? wow.
13744,Homer,"well, not the leader... i mean... oh, it's true, it's true! all the pieces fit."
16409,Homer,i stole it from that borgnine guy.
23129,Homer,got a pencil?
39140,Homer,'cause boys are already on track to get all the good jobs. the dirty dozen? all guys. twelve angry men? men! the x-men? mostly men.
37429,Homer,"are you my guardian angel? if so, can you turn a pumpkin into a chariot? even a used camry would be okay."
39965,Homer,...and i've made reservations at the chez paree.
36145,Homer,"really, anyone? what about the hulk riding a rhinoceros? would you stop him from laughing?"
17874,Homer,let me see! let me see! out of the way!
14678,Homer,... that's true.
40598,Homer,fine. we'll go to mars.
38527,Homer,it's all gonna thaw!
31031,Homer,"son, all our mail has ever brought me is bad things: bills, jury duty, entertainment weekly. now, for once, i'm getting' rich-person mail. you wouldn't take that away from me, would you, son?"
33225,Homer,wow... nobody gives better parenting advice than childless drunks.
20451,Homer,"good, take this note over to the referee."
34700,Homer,"ah, those guys are all crooks. they charge you for parts and labor? pick one, buddy! i can do this just fine by myself."
36856,Homer,"homemade presents are how cool families demonstrate how awesome they are. if i show up with a ""toy"" from the ""store,"" like we would give ""our kids,"" then i've failed! and these skinny jeans will have flattened my junk for nothing!"
21177,Homer,"oh, i don't need your pity."
24986,Homer,suckers.
30165,Homer,mmm... soggy br--
13628,Homer,free food?!
28729,Homer,nope.
37019,Homer,"now to save these sorry souls from a life of anarchy, starvation, and having sex for procreation."
20719,Homer,"sure, anything you want."
32146,Homer,"honey, there's something i have to tell you..."
26619,Homer,"hm, fascinating. say doctor, can you do something about my searing pain?"
29183,Homer,wait a minute. are you trying to get dirt on lisa?
40955,Homer,i guess he's got us there.
31447,Homer,must jettison excess weight!
39809,Homer,hmmm... still got it!
19896,Homer,"hey, how would you like to show him up by beating him at his own game?"
17980,Homer,"woo hoo! oh, marge, that's great news!"

27731,Homer,"yes, sir."
31524,Homer,yes we are.

21848,Homer,"only 5, no wait 10 dollars. you heard right, 20 dollars."
18646,Homer,"oh, man, i've only got one minute 'til they stop serving those breakfast balls..."
15538,Homer,"and this is the snack holder where i can put my beverage -- or, if you will -- cupcake."
36085,Homer,that's not a choice you get to make.
33508,Homer,i'm using you!
39791,Homer,"good idea, marge. by the way, this friday night i'm gonna be attending a little get-together with the boys at work. eugene fisk is marrying some girl in valve maintenance."
22648,Homer,i sure settled his hash. imagine that quack thinking you'd try one of those crazy new-age cures.
28560,Homer,then why did you appear in it?
19181,Homer,you used to be a boxer just like me?
41564,Homer,"razorblade of apathy / shave me with your irony / shave me, shave me..."
19026,Homer,"oh, marge. i thought i had an appetite for destruction, but all i wanted was a club sandwich."
31078,Homer,that might be marge!
19496,Homer,"right, and we don't like the same things. it's like you're from venus..."
17034,Homer,"that's it! if he can teach a class, he can teach a class. i mean, i can teach a class."
14640,Homer,"oh, you mean tonight."
14559,Homer,"well, are you better than me?"
19371,Homer,"oh, i'm sure i'd be a third wheel."
21893,Homer,"no way, narc. bodily functions are a natural thing."
23608,Homer,that's great. even big stars take their kids to the zoo.
36598,Homer,"no, no, marge. i want you to explore your feelings."
33314,Homer,and she's ready for a night of anonymous sex with multiple partners.
15227,Homer,he left his briefcase. hey! it's full of shredded newspapers.
37540,Homer,"oh, uh, i'd better take this. y'see, moe's been depressed and needs to hear a friendly voice. why the hell are you calling me at home, you moron?!"
18738,Homer,"hear ye, hear ye! what's for breakfast?"
17080,Homer,"but, i learned my lesson. it'll never happen again."
35367,Homer,"i don't wanna be ""that guy,"" but marge is making me be ""that guy."""
17446,Homer,yes. and i am pursuing my interest in...
30615,Homer,"eh, there's a picture of it on my cup."
36809,Homer,"bart, stop it! you might fall!"
29620,Homer,"if you love the bible so much, why don't you marry it? in fact, i now pronounce you and the bible man and wife. and you're the wife. you owe me two hundred bucks."
35172,Homer,it does!
31478,Homer,too late.
25054,Homer,oh no you don't! i paid full price for this freak show. now nourish the child within me! nourish...
29462,Homer,that was me.
29921,Homer,"well, that's a world of difference. light me up, doc!"
32662,Homer,i had become diabetic from drinking too many frappuccinos.
34884,Homer,ended that a little too soon.
14902,Homer,marge keep it down in there.
37845,Homer,"now, i'm afraid it's time to start your new life. you'll be hunted... on the run... searching for the man who killed your mother, which is you. so avoid mirrors."
30876,Homer,all expenses paid?
24668,Homer,that's right.
34426,Homer,"pickle, carrot, tomato. pickle, carrot, tomato. pickle, carrot, tomato."
25807,Homer,ew!
36195,Homer,"uh, marge, this is my friend keggy..."
21405,Homer,"nah, i'll just walk it off."
39971,Homer,"ba, ba / ba, ba, ba, ba ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba / ba, ba ba!"
20786,Homer,"so, i beat the system."
31974,Homer,betcha can't solve our maze? i didn't come here to be insulted. we're leaving!
34034,Homer,"oh fine, i guess i'm at your beck."
30120,Homer,i've gotta save them.
25224,Homer,...and i never saw gallagher again.
19563,Homer,"take a look at this, lisa. you don't see any ""homer is a dope"" t-shirts, do you?"
34279,Homer,"oh my god, i'm holding back the team. but our marriage is based on curling. what am i gonna do?"
33869,Homer,"c'mon, boy! be cool!"
22279,Homer,woo! not over! wooooo!
13794,Homer,we could have seen a monkey.
21521,Homer,"wow, look at that load of grease. boy, if we're ever gonna earn paper money, we have to expand our operation."
32253,Homer,"hey moe, got any milk?"
21938,Homer,love...
41466,Homer,why you little...
38852,Homer,"well, that's it. we've visited every section including churro county, toonton abbey...but you know what we haven't had here? i'll tell you: fun. the kind of fun attractive families have in commercials."
19904,Homer,"wooo, we're in orbit now! what's that? a call from the president? hello?... uh, yes. ""let me just say this about that."" okay, mr. president..."
30629,Homer,holy moley!
40553,Homer,fifty percent?
33706,Homer,"oh, it's even worse when you know it has a name."
30215,Homer,"celibacy?! i was talking about the meat on friday thing. man, you guys got more crazy rules than blockbuster video."
29646,Homer,"welcome to sprawl*mart... pimple cream in aisle five! buenos nachos -- ask about our señor discount. hey, rabbi, jesus loves ya. just kidding."

28113,Homer,people will do anything a sign tells them.
17768,Homer,i can't get the... i can't get the door closed. somebody's going to have to get out.
25416,Homer,wait a minute. four hundred a month for loafer lightener?
37473,Homer,"this is funny, it says here iceland is green, and greenland is icy. the vikings switched the names to trick everybody."
27460,Homer,ow-wooh-wooh-wooh! i'm married to joey heatherton.
15592,Homer,the erotic adventures of hercules.
26763,Homer,that giggle is none of my business. or is it?
19716,Homer,"put a sock in it, roy."
23179,Homer,"well, i think we lost 'em."
17507,Homer,"hmmm. this looks like a nice, friendly place."
32650,Homer,things happened between your mother and me that we're not proud of. it was the middle of a wild decade known as the nineteen nineties.
15920,Homer,lobooo...
35890,Homer,you can't check my spirit!
13480,Homer,"forget it, marge!"
41153,Homer,"your mother must have painted this. i guess she thought he was cute... hey, what the..."
14115,Homer,i own stock?
14537,Homer,softball?
14082,Homer,get away from me.
19104,Homer,i'm gonna miss springfield. this town's been awfully good to us.
23874,Homer,"i believe i had hair. oh, here they are."
20810,Homer,"all i had to give them was our life savings, the deed to the house, and a commitment of ten trillion years of labor."
23728,Homer,but you have so much inner beauty.
20569,Homer,"okay, okay, don't panic. marge, stop panicking. we need a replacement skeleton, and we need it now. bart! strip down to your skeleton!"
18644,Homer,"oh, look at those phonies, sucking up to bush."
14535,Homer,"mmm, do - nuts."
36121,Homer,i'll poke a broom in there! you know i'm capable of it!
26074,Homer,let go of her or i'll scream!
38478,Homer,i thought we installed parental blocking software on all our computers.
39474,Homer,"you know, moe, my mom once said something that really stuck with me. she said, ""homer, you're a big disappointment,"" and, god bless her soul, she was really onto something."
19659,Homer,you're phony! fakey phony broad!
16533,Homer,"oh yeah, the costume."
39643,Homer,there! finished.
35537,Homer,he said it.
30406,Homer,gladly.
23549,Homer,okay.

39170,Homer,"...uh, because you want them to grow..."
39144,Homer,"babysitting, eh? what do i know about kids?"
31572,Homer,"aw, son."
36568,Homer,"i'm right behind you, honey! we have stairs?!"
19440,Homer,"huh? sunrise, sunset... sunrise, sunset... sunrise, sunset / sunrise, sunset..."
22146,Homer,"i think i saw him in ""rent,"" or ""stomp,"" or ""clomp,"" or some piece of crap."
40919,Homer,"oh yeah, yeah, yeah. but i thought she didn't like to be... you know, touched."
35276,Homer,"please, marge, no! the other negligent dads'll make fun of me! they're so cliquey!"
39624,Homer,jealous. everybody ready?
18255,Homer,"look, kids! i just got my party invitations back from the printer's."
17353,Homer,hey! apu just called. this friday lisa's team is playing bart's team. you're in direct competition. and don't go easy on each other just because you're brother and sister. i want to see you both fighting for your parents' love.
29763,Homer,"sorry, marge. we've got the power now. and you can't turn us off!"
29882,Homer,"you're right, marge -- i guess i should look for roofers at poetry slams and yoga retreats."
31932,Homer,mm-hm.
26633,Homer,"which you must never use because it will ruin your life, lets daddy see and hear magical things you will never experience. ever."
20674,Homer,what the hell's goin' on?
22111,Homer,hey! i called that! i saw it first! come back here!
33580,Homer,hmm. probably a reminder to relax more.
31957,Homer,just what are you getting at?
39845,Homer,"look, i'm here because i want to apologize for treating you like an object."
39680,Homer,maggie! oh my little girl!

13256,Homer,nellllsonnnn...
31434,Homer,"honey, i brought you more sticks."
18581,Homer,"oh, c'mon, if we quit now we'll never know how badly they're gonna beat us."
14740,Homer,"forget it, pal. they don't call me colonel homer because i'm some dumb-ass army guy."
13771,Homer,"well, thank you."
33416,Homer,my own plaque! and one for vice president butthead! cool.
27270,Homer,"the ""george foreman mail sorter"" will let us know."
25117,Homer,there's a crayon in my brain?!
36938,Homer,what flavor?
15590,Homer,"that yentl puts the ""she"" in yeshiva."
13861,Homer,"hurry, moe, hurry! i've only got five minutes till the music store closes."
26570,Homer,woo hoo!
21747,Homer,"it made me angry, jerry. angry and tired."
37573,Homer,all the payphones at the airport were replaced by self-serve yogurt. i had all the cookie dough toppings a man could want.
30557,Homer,"that's an excellent question, kent. first of all..."
22202,Homer,i think you'll find escape is quite impossible.
40675,Homer,papa!
26303,Homer,start the movie!
18267,Homer,i know.
35600,Homer,"yeah, and what are you gonna do about it?"
39278,Homer,thirteen bucks. we can't get anything for thirteen bucks.
37263,Homer,"i'm not punching you, flanders."
31026,Homer,"but sweetie, i just wanted to tell the '74 oakland a's how i felt about them."
29179,Homer,these batteries have to power everything in our house!
31863,Homer,but to get that dvd i had to become a pbs subscriber! now i'm paying for crap like american masters!
16871,Homer,okay.
27220,Homer,stupid bran producer's convention.
37179,Homer,we'll get those kids back.
23849,Homer,so much.
31924,Homer,yoko?
30964,Homer,"silence! now for my amusement, let the monkey fight the elephant."
39374,Homer,"you're right! i'm young, i'm able-bodied, and i'll take anything. watch out, springfield, here i come."
26748,Homer,thanks. are you sure you don't want to come? in a civil war reenactment we need lots of indians to shoot.
23127,Homer,"oh, you're just saying that because your ""boyfriend"" was in it. i'll bet you would've hated it if me and lenny were mr. smith."
21334,Homer,you? did?
25596,Homer,somebody light this monkey.
33333,Homer,"hey, could you take a look at a lump on my back?"
18378,Homer,"oops, no time for that now -- the computer's starting."
34178,Homer,and you like tomato...
23105,Homer,what kind a mint?
35786,Homer,i can't believe that was work!
28655,Homer,"kids, kids. those aren't your toys. they're to keep daddy asleep and awake."
21043,Homer,"oh, lisa, it's just war games. it's not like a game could hurt me."
35879,Homer,yes there is! woo hoo.
22747,Homer,"ten-four, dead buddy."
29402,Homer,par-ty! par-ty! par-ty!
34675,Homer,"oh, yeah, yeah, right. uh, just give me one of those crispy shells with meat in it."
28549,Homer,"um, shouldn't you all be singing carols or something?"
27964,Homer,hey! where are you goin'? i'm your pal! i took you for a walk once!
24770,Homer,"just give the word, and i'll cut him off."
16665,Homer,one hot dog please.
41357,Homer,got to stay mad. the next morning is where the fight is won or lost.
16837,Homer,food fight!
39064,Homer,stop laughing at me!
38198,Homer,then why did the auction house say it was real?
35851,Homer,too late!
15471,Homer,"now, i know i haven't been the best... aw, forget it."
22418,Homer,"yeah, but why does the homer simpson character have to be so stupid?"
30847,Homer,"when the monkey falls asleep, i'll sneak you out in this trash bag. then i'll come back and feed the monkey a peach full of antifreeze."
34066,Homer,"now, it's my turn to roll the dice! wanna kiss them for me?"
18293,Homer,"well... i acquired it legally, you can be sure of that."
32571,Homer,"it's okay -- we're not really your kids. we're just representations of them, that you created in your mind."
15019,Homer,"that's right, old friend."
26166,Homer,bag's in the kitchen.
29449,Homer,"see you in hell, document!"
41055,Homer,"y'ello, hi, lisa, what's wrong? the mumps? oooh, the kissing disease! my little girl is growing up."
30820,Homer,"he's headed for the old mill. no, cheatie, no!"
32629,Homer,"think tank, eh?"
38703,Homer,"hello? hello? this is homer simpson! 742 evergreen terrace, looking for a place for my kids and me! and my pretty, pretty wife!"
23046,Homer,but it's so cheap.
25686,Homer,no problem. i'll need a sack and something sharp.
32228,Homer,marge!
38597,Homer,"bad news, bears. forecast calls for nothing but rain."
31612,Homer,"oooh, the the! but why are you helping me?"
14287,Homer,"y'know, son, the day you were born i received the greatest gift a man could have."
39249,Homer,"nixon, comet, cupid... donna dixon."
17270,Homer,heh-heh. scaredy-cat...
35998,Homer,are you just saying that 'cause you don't want me to see the hippo?
13169,Homer,i don't belong here!
22033,Homer,"marge, i've been thinking. what if, instead of donating one of my old, worn-out kidneys, i gave grampa that artificial kidney i invented?"
29818,Homer,"marge, c'mon!"
16967,Homer,"well, i'm off to work."
40589,Homer,is it done yet? is it done yet?
27674,Homer,let him speak!
27926,Homer,"you people are guests in our country, and the beaver have no right to treat you that way. if i get back your land, will you promise to build a casino on it?"
25580,Homer,"monkey. now, according to animal crackers, there's no river here."
36017,Homer,which one do you want?
31765,Homer,used to?!
14723,Homer,"calm down, marge, it's just our life savings. i'm not going to go into hock for this."
30157,Homer,"hey moses, are you a loser?"
18610,Homer,"i guess some people never change. or they quickly change, and then quickly change back."
35037,Homer,"it's kind of weird, us all being naked in here."
31559,Homer,i think the hook is touching my brain. .
26503,Homer,"that mini-van had the biggest cup holders. and change slots for every coin, from penny to quarter!"
13681,Homer,"yeah, come on boy, this better be worth my ten bucks."
19198,Homer,"ooh, ""general!"" who's drederick tatum, anyway? is he another hobo?"
36027,Homer,"don't worry, ladies! i'm-a comin'!"
21118,Homer,barney? that was me! and i'd do it again.
21801,Homer,porcini --
29083,Homer,"it was years ago, when i was ten. back in the '60s, or '50s, or maybe it was the early '70s..."
29885,Homer,oh ray! you came at the agreed-upon time.
34609,Homer,"you see, ned... your city-wide nagging compressed all of our town's misbehavior into one small place...creating a glittering diamond of super evil."
36339,Homer,homie!
31695,Homer,"it's been another eight years, and what do i have? same job, same house, same dirty joke book..."
22628,Homer,"ooh, anything spicy?"
21445,Homer,"hey, marge, wasn't that great when the dog came in here?"
23552,Homer,"yeah, so i'm going to have to work late, instead of seeing you and the kids, which is what i really want."
17185,Homer,"but at dinner, the fortune cookie predicted doom."
29351,Homer,"bart's shirt is a classic, marge. just like ""keep on truckin'"". as if i would ever want to stop truckin'."
23632,Homer,"and this riptide is certainly nothing daddy can't struggle against. help! help! somebody, help!"
22440,Homer,tie good. you like shirt?
34462,Homer,uh listen... can i leave a little early tomorrow? my kid has a thing.
20795,Homer,really? i'm surprised about maggie.
23116,Homer,"well, here it is, so we can open it and find out now."
33203,Homer,what is it?
26988,Homer,"now before i abandon you in this cornfield, does anyone remember the way home?"
13286,Homer,chores? me need clone.
40609,Homer,"it's so hard to choose. it all looks so terrible. just bring me one of these, and one of these, and one of those."
15285,Homer,bart! that car belonged to bonnie and clyde! show a little respect.
33250,Homer,i'm sorry -- it's just so fun and easy to judge people based on religion.
14156,Homer,no!
39276,Homer,wait a minute...
29628,Homer,"son, that's the stupidest idea i ever heard. and i know exactly who would pay top dollar for it."
41416,Homer,"what are you, cavemen? turn on the lights!"
34365,Homer,stupid kid. thinks he's smarter than a computer.
20837,Homer,quiet. god looks like he has something important to say.
40717,Homer,oh yes it will.
31792,Homer,"well, then you could come over here and help daddy pour chemicals."
32860,Homer,"one, two, three... another chute?!"
19746,Homer,"am i, marge? am i? think of the property values! now we can never say only straight people have been in this house!"
39778,Homer,hmm. good advice.
18288,Homer,that's false advertising! lard lad lied!
41374,Homer,especially this time...
23167,Homer,i'm on it.
13930,Homer,"liberty bell... two liberty bells... come on, come on, come on... oh. yes! whoo-hoo! three liberty bells! that'll be ten thousand dollars, apu."
15771,Homer,"sorry, mr. burns, but i don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans. sure, i'm flattered... maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no."
38261,Homer,"hey-hey, what--"
37897,Homer,"guys, guys, i saw the radioactive man movie! here's my ten favorite scenes from worst to best -- number ten: when what's his name did that stuff with those dudes. number nine--"
26361,Homer,"gee, a million bucks, that's gonna buy him a lot of, uh... swings in the old battin' cage."
31172,Homer,it's working! buck's buying my fake message! and you said it would never work.
39416,Homer,"ladies and gentlemen, this plant is --"
18802,Homer,"mr. burns, is there anything at all i can do for you?"
35424,Homer,"uh-oh, they've got the right-of-way."
34711,Homer,they fight and bite? i never go to europe without learning something.
16578,Homer,"you know, push people around, make ourselves feel big."
34624,Homer,i got marge!
14872,Homer,"wake up, boy."
17345,Homer,"okay, little buddy, hop in!"
32697,Homer,"hello, you've reached the snug bug. what do you mean my car's ready?! well you can keep it, 'cause i'm never giving up this one. now why don't you enjoy the sounds of my wife and me making sweet, sweet love."
37355,Homer,holy moly!
15229,Homer,damn right!
25974,Homer,i thought you said you had to go.
34863,Homer,amen.
29392,Homer,"you give my son what he deserves, or i'll knock you on your delightfully offbeat ass!"
30449,Homer,"aw, i can't stay mad at you when that pan smells like sausage and onions."
27971,Homer,"all my life, kent. i prefer ""catsup"" to ""ketchup."" and to me, ""yusuf islam"" will always be ""cat stevens."""
33896,Homer,it's my moment.
17594,Homer,this is it. my ticket in. they have to let me join if i'm the son of a member.
14509,Homer,"look, we're past that. marge, maybe i do curse a little, but that's the way god made me. and i'm too old to stop now."
13764,Homer,what?
32494,Homer,"good luck, with my finicky appetite."
23256,Homer,"hey, you , you cut me off! ah, yeah, you!"
33615,Homer,suckers!
30460,Homer,you want me to ride a whatsickle built for who?
22410,Homer,"the whole town's laughin' at me. even that cat out there. bart, kill that cat!"
20531,Homer,"don't worry, apu. some day you'll meet someone you really love."
39728,Homer,yeah? why you little...
20907,Homer,maa-rrge...
31487,Homer,"lisa, wake up! they're taking angelica to mount purgatorium."
36987,Homer,"aw. uh, listen, i've gotta know. you're not just being nice to me because in a pinch you could make candles from my fat?"
32342,Homer,"hey marge, look at us -- the four amigos! they're gonna let me do some odd jobs for them on the outside."
40090,Homer,"sure thing, mr. burns."
16419,Homer,hi.
40569,Homer,five hundred thousand dollars. i spit on his five hundred thousand dollars.
16038,Homer,nope.
13864,Homer,ah. finished with fifteen seconds to spare.

33735,Homer,"man, who comes up with this stuff?"
13829,Homer,i wish i had a monkey's paw.
18445,Homer,"right away, mr. smithers! i'll just walk across these slippery rooooock --"

35630,Homer,"can't, marge. i'm fighting for my professional life here."
34014,Homer,while turning gay the other day / a thought occurred to me...
21402,Homer,"i'm not normally a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, superman."
22340,Homer,"hey, troy aikman!"
19692,Homer,"yeah, hi, roy. hey, they're having open casting for the voice of poochie."
31218,Homer,and what about my new job as a mexican wrestler?
38736,Homer,"i feel a powerful connection to the history of famous bass players. like what's his name from the who. or that guy from led zeppelin who wasn't page, plant or bonham. those are the only two i know for sure."
30130,Homer,"yeah, i'll definitely read those later."
24528,Homer,what?
26682,Homer,"mr. burns, may i field that one?"
28127,Homer,noooooooooo!

17054,Homer,i told marge this wouldn't work the other night in bed.
22449,Homer,nah. just park it.

33357,Homer,"great, thanks. listen, settle a bet: behind that smile you're dying, right?"
20731,Homer,i guess not.
18470,Homer,mo-om! you're not looking!

13720,Homer,"listen, flanders, do you still have that store?"
25496,Homer,good times.
33180,Homer,"look at it this way: you're a free man... unlike me. you have all your hair... unlike me. no kids tying you down, or a crippling mortgage that you refinanced at twenty-six percent because a dancing internet cowboy told you to... oh, god, i hate my life!"
39641,Homer,what am i going to do? i've murdered us all.
37245,Homer,i didn't know you were left-handed.

29082,Homer,"actually, marge... uh... there uh, was someone before you."
24807,Homer,"you see, that's what i'm saying."
16506,Homer,"hey, marge, after your big tantrum against legalized gambling, i bet it feels pretty weird to be in a casino."

24290,Homer,i threw you a party at my house.
33927,Homer,a lot of things come and go in life. but not fame and fitness.
36250,Homer,"hey, i've gotta tell ya, i'm miserable there. i'm all alone; and when there's some problem due to human error, guess who gets blamed?"
18835,Homer,"you know, his bizarre ""personal"" life? those weird things they say he does down at the aquarium? why i heard..."
22540,Homer,"well, i think i have a collapsed lung, but okay!"

38947,Homer,"i know you are but what am i, infinity plus one! jinx!"
23221,Homer,"i tell ya, the kid's a wonder. he organized all the lawsuits against me into one class action."
35988,Homer,i'll take it! provided you charge me for services that google offers for free.
19953,Homer,it's all right. i understand. but we really could have used that twelve thousand dollars.

14731,Homer,"oh, that's hot. there isn't a man alive who wouldn't get turned on by that. well, g'bye."
20356,Homer,"hi. it seems to me if a gun can protect something as important as a bar, it's good enough to protect my family. so if you'll have me, i would like to become a lifetime member of your wonderful organization!"
32533,Homer,daddy...
15354,Homer,"mr. plow, that's my name. that name again is mr. plow. our forecast calls for flurries of passion followed by extended periods of gettin' it on."

20180,Homer,"lisa, honey, if it'll make you feel better i'll destroy something bart loves."
34560,Homer,"okay, we'll need the town's strongest men to roll the whale back in the water."
19718,Homer,never!
26957,Homer,"yeah, but this town doesn't deserve me. i'm giving this badge to the next guy i see."

27360,Homer,but it's a personalized video about my favorite little star -- lisa simpson.
41476,Homer,"...""thursday night football?!"" and the globe feels so warm -- i am in awe of the future!"
27107,Homer,"my dream has been shattered into shards of a broken dream. i was so close to being a rock star, but now there's a chance it might not happen. i'll just have to settle for being a fat, bald, fat nothing."
32969,Homer,and if i don't show up?

38915,Homer,"and marge, i've got this weird new feeling in my stomach. a little sour and a little sick."
35073,Homer,"son, you already have your reward... the feeling of accomplishment you can only get from hard work."
26131,Homer,"now the movie's turned into a play! still good, though."
30765,Homer,stupid horse! it's a deer crossing!
25861,Homer,"uh, your honor, i was chasing the kbbl party penguin prize patrol."

22421,Homer,then i'd like to legally change my name.
13756,Homer,"uh-huh. it's as fat as a phone book! ""congratulations on your purchase of a fissionator 1952 slow fission reactor. get to the point, man! ooh, what's this?"

14018,Homer,this is my son and if he doesn't want to wear one you can't make him!
29395,Homer,damn him to hell.
17352,Homer,"and if you get eaten, it's your own fault."
29479,Homer,hey moe... haven't seen you in a while.
20410,Homer,"yes. mr. koufax, don't you think flanders is a big jerk? y'ello? y'ello?"
22267,Homer,and it sucked!

14486,Homer,"you got it, sweetheart. you have enough blanket there?"

30272,Homer,moe! what are you calling me for?
13731,Homer,... bart! have you started smoking?
18485,Homer,"mom, there's nothing to be alarmed about, but could you take one last look at the family and join me in the kitchen?"
17926,Homer,"being a jerk, minus a million points."
40215,Homer,"not yet, son. not yet."
35468,Homer,"yeah, language."

16213,Homer,they're dogs! and they're playing poker!
18182,Homer,i got my dad to look after her.
14111,Homer,uh-huh.

34018,Homer,so find yourself a man who'll want you in the sack
19849,Homer,"at first i thought prohibition was a good thing. people were drinking more and having a lot more fun. but without beer, prohibition doesn't work."

22221,Homer,"oh, yeah. two more of these, please."
23724,Homer,done.
31157,Homer,if only i'd seen you before i met my wife.
14170,Homer,that's right. i lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars.

32002,Homer,"hey, lay off -- you're the fat one of you guys!"

29356,Homer,"you know what, mr. burns? i'm never comin' back. my son's making so much cash in the t-shirt game, that i don't have to work another day in my life -- assuming my health does not deteriorate as i age."
31247,Homer,"uh... like all manly men, i have a vivid imagination."

37875,Homer,"where are my keys? oh, right here."
21453,Homer,"it was just the shock of seeing all that food on the floor. plus i'd just fallen on my back, which hurt more than i let on."
16312,Homer,and i can just haul it away? free?
39251,Homer,why you little eggheaded...!

36033,Homer,so do your farting now.
36741,Homer,"no, i don't want to."
37086,Homer,maybe this'll help you make up your mind.
33354,Homer,"exception that proves the rule. if losers like me know one thing, it's that deep down, winners like him are miserable. watch, i'll prove it."
27001,Homer,"hey, so are the grammy judges. --"
26822,Homer,right.
40572,Homer,"oh, marge."

15944,Homer,"oh, wait. that was the old sofa."
25274,Homer,"come on, marge -- all sports have their lovable clowns: john rocker, o.j. simpson, dorf..."
18716,Homer,"you kids should thank your mother. now that she's a better person, we can see how awful we really are."
32729,Homer,"sweetheart, i didn't want to deceive you. i just couldn't stand to see the disappointment in your beautiful eyes."
26148,Homer,"super. now if you'll gather around, i'd like to say a few words. all nerds clear the launch area."
13810,Homer,what a dump. why would princess grace live in a place like this?
24595,Homer,great idea. then we should call the doctor about this.

29169,Homer,"bart, you're grounded for a year."
36165,Homer,"i like to watch lamar odom play x-box while his giant wife yells at him. is that so nuts? huh? yeah, shut you up."
17055,Homer,"no, that's not what i meant. marge and i always talk things over in bed. like the other night we were fighting about money."
37870,Homer,what? i'm saving them from the struggle of life.
30019,Homer,"don't worry honey, the song i wrote you is so schmaltzy, it'll make ""moon river"" sound like a farting orangutan."
38522,Homer,absolutely not.
40535,Homer,really? great!
18079,Homer,nothing. i'm just a little edgy since your mother told me she wants to be a cop.
33600,Homer,we are so screwed!
24360,Homer,"oh, yeah. i saw a gopher. what a day!"

26296,Homer,look at those abs.
34919,Homer,"sweetie, if your mother was in trouble, they'd tell us as soon as they could."

33847,Homer,foam wasn't spilt in a day.
20408,Homer,"well, i'm tellin' ya, flanders can't coach at all! now i'm not the type to have a grudge for no reason..."
15109,Homer,"why? oh, the zombies. no."

19084,Homer,hold on guys. i'll help ya!
25836,Homer,trusting every aspect of our lives to a giant computer was the smartest thing we ever did!
13849,Homer,"ooo, what job is that?"
29107,Homer,what about now?
41217,Homer,mmm... bacon.
35429,Homer,"well, if you live long enough you start to accumulate things. this is from a gas station men's room. they put the block of wood on it so you don't walk away with it. these are from a key party we went to before we realized what a key party was--"
18911,Homer,"ahh, not a bear in sight. the bear patrol must be working like a charm."
23797,Homer,"we'll be fine, honey. the main thing is for you to get better."

39869,Homer,"hear him out, marge."
35064,Homer,hm. i never thought of fatherhood as something that could affect a kid.
36936,Homer,"why would you think that, just because i put you in a home where they feed you dog food?"
40903,Homer,"excuse me. i hate to interrupt your judging me, but i wanted you to know i've made a couple of really important decisions. number one: i'm cutting the cable as soon as the fight's over. and number two: i'm not very fond of any of you."
16369,Homer,mmmmm... free goo.
15884,Homer,false.
27156,Homer,they're gonna be in the same class as each other?
31517,Homer,he sure has a lot of markers that don't work.
30565,Homer,i still feel it. it's so itchy. itchy...
20520,Homer,"ohhh, right, right. the fake marriage thing. how's that goin'?"
26559,Homer,don't you know the boys from brazil are little hitlers? i saw it in a movie. whose name i can't remember.
38066,Homer,"okay. in your terms, points are like mice."
16493,Homer,"oh, baby."
23081,Homer,"oh, i'm sick of doing japanese stuff. in jail we had to be in this dumb kabuki play about the forty-seven ronin and i wanted to be oshi, but they made me ori."
17822,Homer,benedict arnold!
25789,Homer,"well, we are not boarding that plane unless you waive that tax. waive it..."
24304,Homer,but that's barney's seat. are you tryin' to make me the new barney?
39534,Homer,"and if you get the chance, get 'em right in the family jewels. that little doozy's been a simpson trademark for generations."
18304,Homer,do not touch willie. good advice.
14517,Homer,you dirty bas...
16030,Homer,"i tied him up, out back."
35699,Homer,the experience begins!
22028,Homer,procedure. deadly procedure.
38524,Homer,turn right here. i keep this frozen meat in case society collapses but we still have power.
13150,Homer,"to me they were the rubbery gates of heaven, because behind them was the girl of my dreams."
30488,Homer,"kids, this is the holiest night of the year. tomorrow is father's day, and that makes tonight father's day eve."
31484,Homer,"oh yeah, this is that fantasy book that even grownups like. broken, lonely grownups."
29585,Homer,oh yeah? send a finger wrapped in today's paper to prove you have him.
32283,Homer,i'm buying a round of the fanciest drink you got.
19241,Homer,still?
16048,Homer,just poke blindly at the controls until they let you go.
25178,Homer,"hey, toro! here's something to gore!"
37024,Homer,parking meter?!
15788,Homer,woo hoo!
13619,Homer,woo hoo! who would've guessed reading and writing would pay off?
21720,Homer,"i love you, son."
28760,Homer,"...who steals from the till, would ya let me finish? geez."
20845,Homer,"no time to answer that, marge. i'm setting up a home office for my new business enterprise."
22847,Homer,"wow. it's like marge's dream come true... for me! isn't that great, marge?! for me!"
14669,Homer,"marge, i have always carried myself with a certain quiet dignity. tonight you robbed me of it. i'm going now and i don't know when you'll see me again."
22851,Homer,"aw, honey, i've always liked your art. your paintings look like the things they look like."
33301,Homer,"hold still, sweetie. daddy will kill it. and this time no screw-ups."
26689,Homer,"did you say ""life story""?"
16553,Homer,"shhh, quiet lisa."
23415,Homer,i challenge you to a duel.
33280,Homer,run for your--
40172,Homer,"oh, lenore."
36163,Homer,"not just the laundry... that would be weird, and you might ask questions. i wanna do all the chores!"
37176,Homer,wanna split it while we snuggle?
33904,Homer,"great. okay. marge, go."
40136,Homer,"ooh, a vortex."
20623,Homer,you're...
14175,Homer,nobody loves you...
40046,Homer,great! great! great! how much? how much? how much?
31861,Homer,it's a documentary... by the b.b.c... in cooperation with canal plus...
30961,Homer,"hmmm, let's see. you got the elephant man, johnny six-arms, papa smurf... these guys are pretty cool. maybe i am one of them. if only i had some kind of proof."
35229,Homer,why aren't you exactly like your stage persona?
31312,Homer,this hurts so much.
22265,Homer,especially me.
22998,Homer,"uh, you're not gonna ask me to pose nude, are ya?"
21493,Homer,"okay, i think i've figured this thing out. it can go up and down, but not side to side, or back in time."
34359,Homer,why you little...
35803,Homer,"tell her i'm at a meeting, not drinking..."
20127,Homer,"come on, boot guy!"
36576,Homer,i like it when you don't say words.
20878,Homer,booo!
27733,Homer,"well, he does. all my life i've had one dream: to achieve my many goals. mr. burns has never given me a thumbs up or a ""way to be"" or a ""you go, girl."" no, he just steps all over everyone who works for him, taking pleasure in making us feel small."
26512,Homer,"gentlemen, i must be wasted, 'cause it looks like that cloud is mad at me."
29932,Homer,"man, i'm glad to be off that electro-shock table. although to be honest, i did enjoy lying down."
15664,Homer,"step on his neck, and run like hell."
23497,Homer,and there's some more!
39775,Homer,"son, i don't know if i can lift my head, let alone a ball."
32167,Homer,move it! move it! move it! do you want to be second out of the parking lot? do you?
21766,Homer,"ohhh, that sounds like a wager to me."
34303,Homer,"you still reading that thing? i'm warning you: when something goes into that vent, it shouldn't come out. ever!"
15937,Homer,i'll figure it out. i'm gonna use all the power of my brain.
29382,Homer,all i need is some plutonium and i know just the place to get it.
31384,Homer,do not mention that publication in this house! they never published my poem!
37000,Homer,"boy, get in the car. and say goodbye to your best friend forever."
33352,Homer,guys that popular and confident are never truly happy.
33497,Homer,kadiddlehopper.
31782,Homer,"look at those celebrities: i've met them all, and yet they don't even acknowledge my existence."
23759,Homer,"uhh. is this gonna be like one of those horror movies where we open the door and everything's normal, and we think you're crazy, but then there really is a killer robot and the next morning you find me impaled on a weather vane? is that what this is, lisa?"
20141,Homer,the boss says you're fired.
17555,Homer,"oh, being stuck on this god forsaken planet has vanquished what little appetite i have."
23642,Homer,"looks like daddy won, but two ninety-five is awfully good for a baby."
22587,Homer,"i'd like to read the following statement, but i do so under my own free will. it has come to my attention that nbc sucks. i apologize for misleading you and urge you to watch as many fox shows as possible. so in summary, nbc bad, fox good. cbs great."
16802,Homer,ow!
37808,Homer,"i guess this is it, little guy."
30270,Homer,let it ring. play hard to get. that's hard enough!
31656,Homer,"aw, my little girl's just like cbs news."
29367,Homer,i don't have an inside voice!
36636,Homer,but i was really looking forward to...
28656,Homer,i'm gonna need them on my first shift tonight.
25698,Homer,bullies breaking bread with nerds...
39351,Homer,let's go get a burger.
18201,Homer,that's it.
40980,Homer,just a little further. just a little further. just a little further. just a little further.
41050,Homer,"hey lenny, i need to leave early. cover for me, will ya?"
20852,Homer,"fine. it's not important. what really matters is my title. i think i'll make myself vice president. no, wait... junior vice president."
30197,Homer,get 'em from the smoke detector.
31118,Homer,c'mon...
37814,Homer,that's the sweetest thing any baby has ever done for me.
37622,Homer,"hey, hey, it's not what you think, lou. lou! lou! lou! lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu-lu!"
15123,Homer,"i mean, no."
28080,Homer,that i fixed with new words!
31943,Homer,did i say any moment?
15580,Homer,"marge, i'd like to be alone with the sandwich for a moment."
24935,Homer,"not a chance. no one can silence me, but me!"
28077,Homer,pick one.
32588,Homer,a surprise party?
37640,Homer,taste the strength of your fiancé!
21954,Homer,unless...
20969,Homer,"if i were her, i'd be buying me a great big chocolate apology cake."
35986,Homer,"less blathering, more slathering."
30940,Homer,oh no! i took a job on the other side of the world!
36728,Homer,dinner time! i know you're hungry! i can hear you rubbing your legs together! oh my god!
13713,Homer,you're gonna live in your car?
18035,Homer,"uh, i'm sorry, mr. burns, but you can't have these dogs. am i fired?"
41519,Homer,"marge, come here."
27845,Homer,"oh, i get it. your stupid husband is too ""drunk"" to do it right."
26607,Homer,"there's russell crow, cameron crow, crow diddly, hume crow-nyn, gregory peck..."
15341,Homer,"there's a $10,000 bill in it for you."
27022,Homer,what's that?
23782,Homer,"hmmm... ""the widowmaker,"" oh, that one's for the ladies. ""spinebuster,"" boring. ooh, ""colostomizer."""
18133,Homer,"this is the darkest day in the history of springfield. if anybody wants me, i'll be in the shower."
22691,Homer,lousy drunks. i'll show them.
40213,Homer,"i hope burns and i can count on your support, honey."
16218,Homer,"yeah, his hairdo looks so queer."
16293,Homer,"it's marge! she's become a crazed criminal, just because i didn't take her to the ballet."
23595,Homer,what was that about?
36534,Homer,damn you and your fluted neck!
29527,Homer,"after you prance across the goal line, you hurl the other team's mascot to the ground, and drive your cleats into his neck!"
13194,Homer,is he the same as jack be nimble? and jack frost? and little jack horner?
38863,Homer,stupid kid! you ruin every trip!
27100,Homer,what the hell are you doing here?
24936,Homer,whuh?
15144,Homer,thataboy.
22867,Homer,he must be a hundred feet tall.
17086,Homer,"good night, marge."
32139,Homer,"so she said that's not my ""in box"" and he said that's not the johnson report!"
19540,Homer,"no, i can't. this is my cause. i'm like the man who single-handedly built the rocket and went to the moon. what was his name? apollo creed?"
33921,Homer,was that tobey maguire?
17516,Homer,i stowed it safely in the overhead compartment.
13460,Homer,"yeah, probably. anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. and all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. so they got hercules, and hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave hercules this big thing of riches."
38982,Homer,"bye, bart. stay ten forever."
32621,Homer,a drive-up trashcan!
32243,Homer,kick my heels up and
37809,Homer,the most beautiful words a father can hear.
30883,Homer,i'm signing us up for a reality show where we trade you to another family.
26394,Homer,but knowing about it would make you want to go here.
28458,Homer,"please welcome my newest panelist, disco stu."
17669,Homer,okay.
33385,Homer,"now, dondelinger, i want some answers."
18036,Homer,"a little too well, if you ask me. i'm sure he's plotting some brilliant scheme to get those puppies."
32083,Homer,he is not my boyfriend!
17459,Homer,"marge, i'll explain to you afterwards."
28636,Homer,"let's see... i'll have sixteen gravy scrape 'ems, a bucket of twisty lard, and two super-choker breakfast burritos with macho sauce. and mega-size it, please."
28369,Homer,how dare you challenge my perceptions of what old people can do?
38281,Homer,"marge, if you want me to do something, just tell me. don't hide behind a magazine."
21936,Homer,"hatred is a cage that keeps us from soaring free. yes, the sixties may be dead and gone, and its spirit long since extinguished, but its ideals live on."
18682,Homer,"i know a genuine panaphonics when i see it. and look, there's magnetbox and sorny."
34980,Homer,how're you gonna do that?
17341,Homer,"i don't want anyone to give her a hard time just because she's different. no jokes, no taunting... look! that kid's got bosoms! who's got a wet towel?"
19702,Homer,"she smells sheet smells by the sheet store. wait, wait. lemme try it again."
17748,Homer,...and then i sped away without anyone seeing my license plate.
20049,Homer,"change the channel, marge."
35139,Homer,"so, what brings you here, mr. chair?"
40110,Homer,what do you mean?
16069,Homer,i am so smart/ i am so smart/ i am so smart/ i am so smart. s-m-r-t...i mean s-m-a-r-t.
30332,Homer,there's a little plastic man in your hair and i'm trying to rescue him.
33457,Homer,"i know they do, but the simpson mardi gras party has been a tradition since two days before you were born. and we spare no expense."
20374,Homer,"i put it in a safe place, marge. i mean, what are the odds the boy would look in the vegetable crisper?"
19562,Homer,this interview is over!
17667,Homer,oh no you don't!
38477,Homer,brief nudityyy!
31769,Homer,"i don't know. maybe the krusty doll accidentally turned on the car's headlights, which focused on the cologne bottle, causing it to boil, and soon explode."
29976,Homer,fifty dollars? what about all the water you guys will waste with your bathing and showering and washing your clothes?
35007,Homer,"wow, i've never seen a mobster use a tracksuit for exercising."
29951,Homer,"now if i wanted to see it on a certain day, what would be the best day to see it?"
39438,Homer,"now, remember, as far as anyone knows, we're a nice, normal family."
13832,Homer,"he gets it from your side of the family, you know. no monsters on my side."
27927,Homer,how many decks will your blackjack dealers use?
40036,Homer,"got ya, burnsie."
21209,Homer,"yeah, but i'm always secretly disappointed when you do. anyway, i think those garbage men are starting to crack."
36369,Homer,"ocean sex rules! go to hell, land sex!"
15026,Homer,"i was rude to every one of you... and you saved my life, when you could have just left me to fry, like the proverbial pancake that i am."
34843,Homer,ta-da!
35911,Homer,let's go to the map.
24123,Homer,"maybe your movie star banks are open crazy hours, but we in springfield are simple folk. we like our cars fast, and our banks closed. okay, fine, we'll go down there. but they're not going to be open."
38411,Homer,why you--
31527,Homer,"well, i guess i'll have to wait for marge to show some backbone and-- you again?!"
15729,Homer,"all right. starting tomorrow, no beer for a month."
20917,Homer,"so, as soon as you get back, we steal the car, right?"
39008,Homer,bye!
36358,Homer,what happened to my mini-pool table? i was training to be a mini-pool hustler.
23011,Homer,i've got something for you.
38453,Homer,"hey, super mario. don't you tell me about america!"
31728,Homer,"well, here we are, home early."
37136,Homer,"oh, it'll happen again, son."
40931,Homer,"oh, no reason, really. i was just wondering if you know, you'd like to come over to my house for dinner. a payback for all the crummy things bart has done to your school."
27621,Homer,that was awesome!
35201,Homer,hide the dope!
40964,Homer,"i know, he could be anywhere! that's why i want you to narrow it down! please..."
37930,Homer,"you know what, judge apatow... i do have something to say. these movie people may say i'm a pirate. but i'm just a man. a man who loved hollywood too much. so i made my own rules, and fought the big guys who tried to destroy my way of life."
15508,Homer,you're adopted and i don't like you.
28228,Homer,"you sure know me, mom."
29800,Homer,"well, i am a sucker for a little hat."
28687,Homer,that one i got.
41015,Homer,huh?
28743,Homer,"butt on bowl, little man!"
40333,Homer,i wouldn't stay on a bet!
26947,Homer,"if that thug thinks he can run me out of town... oh man, i love this song."
13775,Homer,it tastes so bitter. it's like ashes in my mouth!
18672,Homer,"oh, brought some of your commie friends to help you fight dirty, eh?"
20456,Homer,"i didn't raise him to be a quitter, marge. it must have been you. you've quit every job you've ever had: cop, pretzel vendor, church counselor, professional gambler..."
14590,Homer,oh yeah.
18965,Homer,i'm just trying to party with you guys.
32201,Homer,mimi!
15402,Homer,"i know you like clowns, so i made you this bed. now you can laugh yourself to sleep."
16720,Homer,"marge, lisa, lady -- if you'll excuse me, i've got something very important to attend to."
29428,Homer,"why the sweet talk, apu? are you after some cheap drugs?"
38798,Homer,the ghost of marge future!
29964,Homer,"doctor, little kids aren't supposed to have heart attacks. they're supposed to skin their knees, and poke their eyes out, and be smothered by cats."
37225,Homer,fine.
40057,Homer,"good morning, springfield! good morning, mr. and mrs. winfield!"
27020,Homer,"you know, you're not helping."
38977,Homer,"d-doo doo doo doo doo! y'know, you're the closest thing i've ever had to a brother."
39729,Homer,"lay off the boy, marge. he's a good kid. quit givin' him the third degree."
25119,Homer,"well, i'm not sure, but it mighta happened when i was six."
21854,Homer,"oh, i'll never outrun them in a museum!"
28604,Homer,like a dog. or a snowman!
15048,Homer,i need help.
21477,Homer,awww... eskimo kiss!
38634,Homer,killdozers.
37954,Homer,honki da yo?!
34911,Homer,"hey, show some respect. three gingerbread workmen died making that."
15379,Homer,are you done?
20732,Homer,"buddy, you're the luckiest chicken in the world."
35642,Homer,"are you aware that ""stones"" means ""man junk?"""
31600,Homer,"i didn't write that! even if i did love england, i'd play it cool. wait for it to come to me."
17613,Homer,what's this?
14278,Homer,"no, you listen! this is my wife and this is my kid, and i'm paying for this delivery, so if you want to stay, you better give me some respect!"
37358,Homer,"and you know, marge, those salespeople weren't really our friends."
24300,Homer,not a chance. i can sink way lower. i just came to help my friend barney.
35956,Homer,that's what a play within a play is for!
14299,Homer,do you have any of those microphones left?
14873,Homer,well it is.
16754,Homer,oh.
17059,Homer,"come on, marge. let me in! there's crickets out here."
38359,Homer,"oh, everyone does, son. that's why they lock it up in museums where no one will ever visit."
31614,Homer,i wonder how long this tunnel...
20000,Homer,"hey, you seem like a great guy, so i'll give you a little tip. if you turn that security camera around, you can sleep and no one will ever know."
25965,Homer,woo hoo!
15461,Homer,oh. i...
15426,Homer,it could only be one thing.
25382,Homer,we're here.
32923,Homer,"mom, we didn't know each other very well. if we did, you never would have asked me to climb anything. but even when you weren't around, i always felt good, knowing you were out there somewhere."
39375,Homer,i'm just a technical supervisor who cared too much.
31374,Homer,this guy sucks. he can barely make it to the top.
13589,Homer,not me. i got this.
15028,Homer,"god, i gotta ask you somethin'. what's the meaning of life?"
34942,Homer,huh? what'd i do?
30023,Homer,"hey, these are red vines. here you go, sweetie. daddy got you your candy."
24929,Homer,"oh, no! an anti-escape orb!"
36241,Homer,does the chair go back like this?
21243,Homer,fellow citizens! how would you rate the trash service in this town?
24844,Homer,"this is the best computer in the world and always will be, right?"
33098,Homer,how dare you expose my children to your tender feelings! bart! don't you dare take your eyes off that gameboy!
26530,Homer,victory? we're french! we don't even have a word for it.
21850,Homer,"oh, yeah? what have they ever done for you? when was the last time barbra streisand cleaned out your garage? and when it's time to do the dishes, where's ray bolger? i'll tell ya. ray bolger is lookin' out for ray bolger!"
27802,Homer,it's this new anti-crime dealie. the mayor turned the streetlights way up. my daughter lisa feels really strongly about it.
35915,Homer,"are you ready for irish announcers with lyrical accents, ""oh, that's a lovely touch! oh, such beautiful form!"" if we lose football, we lose the blitz, cheerleaders, rudys, ochocincos... something for fat kids to play! ochocincos..."
26111,Homer,i'm twelve years old... i'm with my friends. it's a beautiful summer day at the old swimming hole... oh my god!
15848,Homer,me lose brain? uh-oh.
33079,Homer,"this looks like a job for captain crazy! up, up and away!"
32206,Homer,"sorry, lisa. can't change the future."
22381,Homer,"there's ""the laughter family."" that's animated. networks like animation 'cause they don't have to pay the actors squat."
33260,Homer,nooooooo!
31798,Homer,thank you!
39660,Homer,"ah food. good thinking, son."
24028,Homer,"well, it is a good life, believe me... all right, we'll give it a shot. i'll deal with those murderous trolls."
39113,Homer,"and because you love me, i will not stop yo-yo dieting till i get it right."
36884,Homer,"well, i can't pick up something this heavy without my lifting belt."
34291,Homer,oops.
14154,Homer,"oh, what am i gonna... hey, you! top being so unsafe! smitty -- safen-up!"
23067,Homer,let's just say the stories about him are greatly exaggerated.
35413,Homer,i'm afraid it's all too true. my wife has betrayed me... with another hairdresser!
28069,Homer,"there's homer... homer j. simpson... and commander cool, a/k/a me."
13748,Homer,you know who the real crooks are? those sleazy hollywood producers.
40883,Homer,"marge, we can't be too careful. there are thieves everywhere, and i'm not talking about the small, forgivable stuff."
40987,Homer,herb?
26881,Homer,"y'know, this is our last night... and our cells are side-by-side..."
19345,Homer,"marge, will you marry me?"
34506,Homer,"clancy, i haven't seen my family in days. would you mind if i went home now?"
14821,Homer,"oh, my couch! the arms, the seat... the dream is over. all right, who did this?"
19246,Homer,"heh-heh, they'll never look for us here."
25464,Homer,"oh, i'm so hungry. oh, why keep starving myself? no one cares."
28616,Homer,"there are many people i'd like to thank for this award. my wife, anjelica huston -- this is for you, angie! we did it!"
35023,Homer,"okay let's see, number of dependents: three. um, add to line thirteen..."
25722,Homer,"two weeks?! well, what am i supposed to do? just sit on my ass and watch tv? that ain't my style, man!"

31415,Homer,this is the most fun i've ever had giving you wood.
37692,Homer,"marge, if you don't mind, i'm gonna quit complaining about my life and start wallowing in the past."

39320,Homer,"what have you done this time, boy?"
41014,Homer,oh fine. we're putting in an on-board something-or-other and rack-and-peanut steering...

32064,Homer,"oh sure, put down a simple guy like me, who works hard and plays by the rules!"
14368,Homer,"you'd think that wouldn't you. but you see lisa, your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong. even though they say it's okay in the bible."
23584,Homer,did somebody say a perfect game?
31969,Homer,"so daddy saved apu and moe, and believe me, we learned our lesson."

35215,Homer,it is so cool for you to let me go on tour with cheech.
30691,Homer,"marge, i found my real father! his name is mason fairbanks, he has a knife just for cheese, and he talks like this ""homer, please do that in the loo."""

41527,Homer,i understand. we should follow the lead of today's celebrity role models.
19240,Homer,"marge, it's not a real kidnapping. it's a simple hoax to win a father's love."
34411,Homer,chickpea fizz.
31449,Homer,i'll never make it! unless...
34892,Homer,a shrink who takes kids and pets?
30404,Homer,i'm still not hearing no.
19231,Homer,"larry, there's only one sure way to make him realize how much he loves you. and that... is a phony kidnapping."
34796,Homer,i repeat: no one will ever know.
18010,Homer,i rode the teacups! then i got a little sick and i had to sit down. but then i rode 'em again!
13894,Homer,buh.

20503,Homer,"oh, right. with the giant heads."
26458,Homer,whoa. there's nothing wrong with a little hey-hey!
31890,Homer,"the lovejoys?! if this is about me drinking that holy water, let me tell you i had had like a million doritos -- you know, the ones with the flame on the bag? oh-ho, that bag ain't lyin'!"
36718,Homer,"okay, i don't, i don't know why i said it... i was scared... i needed a response... it was a perfect storm!"
18353,Homer,yes i can.
27791,Homer,it's a concern. a serious concern.
41559,Homer,i just want a tentacle.

16774,Homer,"heh-heh-heh, i did it. second in line and all i had to do was miss eight days of work."
17556,Homer,"why, you clattering clank of.... my dear lady, as you well know my back is a disaster area. d'oh the pain! d'oh the pain of it all!"
33325,Homer,"friendship is like marriage -- the key is listening. also, if her dog bites you, don't make a big deal out of it."
33343,Homer,what about a jacket and jeans with a nice tee shirt?
18618,Homer,"uh, spray the boy."
36345,Homer,"spoiler alert! i've only seen up to season three, episode seventeen: ""coconut cream die."""

13407,Homer,"uh, oh."
16753,Homer,"marge, i don't really want to go through with this... but being an astronaut is how i got you to respect me."
27956,Homer,"well, two can play at that game."
17075,Homer,"well, now that the little ones have toddled off to bed..."
16073,Homer,"marge, try to understand. there are two kinds of college students: jocks and nerds. as a jock, it is my duty to give nerds a hard time."
22786,Homer,"eh, it's not the end of the world."
35363,Homer,sorry.
17129,Homer,"oh, i see. then everything is wrapped up in a neat little package. really, i mean that. sorry if it sounded sarcastic."

39550,Homer,"oh, no! i'm not down, i'm -- get up, you! get up! come on!"

22550,Homer,"and that's it, right?"
34329,Homer,no line... near the men's room... i see no reason to question your choice.
25709,Homer,"eat my dust, mortals!"
17913,Homer,"oh, no wonder i didn't hear about bart being elected world's greatest sex machine."
28996,Homer,"and now, my darling, it's finally time for romance. but before the intercourse, the dinner course."
40436,Homer,what show is this?
18103,Homer,"whuh! marge, not here. hey, you're not really arresting me...?"

14311,Homer,mmmmm. chocolate.
31336,Homer,i don't understand. how does punishing them teach me a lesson?
30467,Homer,forty-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine... fifty thousand!
33021,Homer,"first, why don't you and i and the cake take a shower?"
32156,Homer,i drove a car over a cliff once. how different could it be?
17108,Homer,"hey, this is dated two weeks ago."

33247,Homer,what's the matter? don't like the taste of freedom?
13604,Homer,"it's not just one magazine, marge. they take hundreds of magazines, filter out the crap, and leave you with something that fits right in your front pocket."
40328,Homer,"well, we've only been neighbors, what? uh, one, two, three, four... eight years."
20108,Homer,i'm on to you!

24359,Homer,no way. when?
37584,Homer,how y'all doin'?
39230,Homer,"oh. i love you, marge."
25506,Homer,now do you realize how unsafe the american home is? baby accidents occur every three minutes.
34721,Homer,"well, it's a cat -- i'm not sure it's the cat."
33691,Homer,"i'll save you, maggie!"
23229,Homer,"ooh, let's go to the waterpark. my ten-year ban ended yesterday."
19432,Homer,"heh, heh! my finest hour! and marge wasn't even here to see it."

26241,Homer,i'm here to break a world record. what's the longest anyone's ever done this?
13711,Homer,"knock 'em dead, boy! kid's gonna be a black belt in no time."
27301,Homer,"marge, you're embarrassing me in front of the drag queen."
19028,Homer,"i'll miss you pumpkins, but i just can't share your bleak world view. i've got too much to live for."
34486,Homer,oh yeah -- sorry i was such a jerk about it.
22992,Homer,"yes, there's a real think piece here about a bra sale."
21250,Homer,don't you deserve better than the best?
33577,Homer,go back to your day spas!
36908,Homer,i believe the word is idiote.
13145,Homer,"ooo la la, a girl with teeth. me like!"
17863,Homer,"all right, let's not panic. i'll make the money back by selling one of my livers. i can get by with one."
22637,Homer,maybe you'd feel better if we watched some tv together.
34899,Homer,enough chitchat. time for operation dog dump.
22903,Homer,"just for the prototype, honey."
40854,Homer,"well, duh."
39089,Homer,"it's not what you think. his name is albert and he taught me not to buy into the lies taught by ""big nutrition."""
34893,Homer,even my tramp stamp?
18228,Homer,"run, boy! run!"
19133,Homer,umm-hmmm...

15276,Homer,how someone someone abuse their body that way?
20891,Homer,"aw, i understand, kids. i'm not a bath man myself -- more of a cologne man."
39993,Homer,"ooh, your blue thing with the things?"
30257,Homer,"honey, please, just listen to what i have to say."
26002,Homer,don't you know who i am?
16874,Homer,he's taking the elephant instead of the money.
38734,Homer,"beautiful music, baby."
33929,Homer,but you taught me the only people who can stay thin are those who can afford five thousand dollar a week nutritional consultants.
41545,Homer,"hey, it's townies like me that cook your food and clean your bathrooms!"
18457,Homer,why does my death keep comin' back to haunt me?!
19605,Homer,"well, here we are."
26483,Homer,"give me those keys. do you have any idea what you put us through? i called the police, the hospital, my bookie, the kennel... okay, this isn't about who i called."

29831,Homer,"stupid wildlife, serves 'em right."
31021,Homer,"well, i won't be lonely. i can always cuddle with the dog."
30205,Homer,mickey mouse's dog?
36920,Homer,bongo?! i told you never to ever talk about bongo!
22689,Homer,"huh? oh, right. the steak."
30797,Homer,now you're telling me burns's story?
22289,Homer,"oh, my god! look what those rotten kids did to my car!"

21832,Homer,"nothing, nothing. good hustle."
20336,Homer,how am i supposed to last five days without shooting something?
39588,Homer,excuse me. i think i hear my wife calling.
16421,Homer,what the hell was that? i probably shouldn't have eaten that packet of powdered gravy i found in the parking lot.
15898,Homer,"look what i got, marge. a new whacking stick."
27655,Homer,marge germs!
14192,Homer,"don't you ever, ever talk that way about television. lousy, ungrateful... can't keep their, whaddyacallit... minds... on any uh..."

33353,Homer,tears of a clown.
37127,Homer,why you little... i'll teach you to say something that sounds similar!
13196,Homer,you'd better not put this shot after the one where i said i won't have kids. that would be a devastating edit!
38520,Homer,way heal away! / we'll heal away joe!
36098,Homer,apu! what are you doing out of your natural habitat?
27200,Homer,"i came out the elephant's mouth, right? 'cause i already showered once today."
40641,Homer,"ah, watch the sunrise."
38770,Homer,yoko! yoko! yoko! yoko! yoko! all you yokos are out of the band!
13386,Homer,"ohhh, because i got drunk and looked down her dress."
22457,Homer,"hey, no problem."
35624,Homer,someone snitched? wha-wha-wha-wha-what are you gonna do to me?
31906,Homer,or a chicken club... or a reuben... or a monte cristo... or a... pull over behind that billboard!
25115,Homer,food? i'm blind!
17081,Homer,"aw, marge is throwing me out for blabbing about her elbow thing."
13375,Homer,catfish lake.
21982,Homer,"relax, boy, we're not gonna cook you. enjoy your day at the beach! ooh, look."
28224,Homer,"mom? you're back. just like you were back before, then you left me again. i love you so much, but it's so hard for me to trust you. oh, what the heck."
22809,Homer,"okay, no big deal..."
34858,Homer,hell yeah!
28016,Homer,oh my god! i've got to do something.
32893,Homer,no! i can't forgive you -- and i don't accept your tuck-in!
18800,Homer,"well, can i at least drive you home, mr. burns? it's five o'clock."
41071,Homer,the price is right.
14228,Homer,hey! this marriage is gonna last forever.
38853,Homer,"i just wanna sit down, but the line for the bench is too long."
31186,Homer,ow! i hurt my fist and my palm. i thought you guys were lookin' out for me.
31907,Homer,"it's like our honeymoon all over again. aw, we even have the same bum looking at us."
33185,Homer,the gay guy?
18096,Homer,"hey, marge. how's my little piglet?"
15391,Homer,ah yes. i remember the day we moved in...
16998,Homer,"maggie, can you point to the monkey?"
17588,Homer,i'd give anything to get into the stonecutters.
39330,Homer,"come on, bart, your mother's only trying to help. so go ahead and enjoy the show."
27054,Homer,"of course. it was, uh... some kind of a... light rail."
26838,Homer,"uh, he's sleeping."
26203,Homer,i knew it!
17500,Homer,jokes on them. i'm still alive.
16233,Homer,"heh, heh, some idiot actually called in!"
21969,Homer,"take that, pinchy."
27931,Homer,no! i wanted to die choking on food!
17025,Homer,how dare you call me that?!
18886,Homer,"oh, why did i have to stop at the railroad tracks? better get some change."
33084,Homer,"y'know, i feel sorry for you, kid. going back to that cold, loveless family."
31593,Homer,you're all idiots. i'm putting it on chill thunder lite.
38568,Homer,"bart, you went to hell and came back a winner, like jesus. now come on, boy! pull me apart like string cheese."
36368,Homer,and the ocean'll do all of the work!
16958,Homer,"can i keep him anyway? huh, huh?"
14574,Homer,i am? whoo-hoo!
21834,Homer,"i'm looking at you, horshak."
15254,Homer,"hey, hey, hey!"
27519,Homer,"woo-hoo! can i get that in lottery tickets, please?"
28812,Homer,i'll see your fifty cents and raise you one dollar.
39269,Homer,"hey, little ones, santa's back. ho! ho!"
26663,Homer,eyes? what the hell are you talkin' about?
23613,Homer,i can see i'm not needed here.
26878,Homer,"don't worry, marge. i'll cut us a deal by becoming a jailhouse snitch. i know who stopped up the toilet!"
30503,Homer,i still don't understand how her feelings can be hurt. it's my day.
36488,Homer,"hey, why don't we go see lady gaga? that'll turn your frown upside down."
14845,Homer,they're singing again. lousy neighbors. wish i was deaf.
21946,Homer,brunch is served!
16681,Homer,that's okay.
17628,Homer,wow. mental note. don't overdo this.
36907,Homer,"prep, prep, prep..."
37159,Homer,"if they're not a trumpet or a rolling pin, then ""no."""
35002,Homer,"it's not over, marge. it'll never be over. when i shut my eyes, all i see is fat tony and me having drinks at that bar on the beach."
19434,Homer,flanders! you gotta help me!
28894,Homer,"hey, i only drink that when i'm already drunk."
30568,Homer,silly rabbit... kicks are for ribs!
35660,Homer,"and we're in hall d. three halls, three minutes..."
41061,Homer,"okay, flanders, you're the boss. heh, heh, heh."
37907,Homer,"i now present, direct from the computer of an angry editor at a special effects house, ""cosmic wars episode seven""."
26511,Homer,forget it. sacrificing animals is barbaric. now have the slaves kill the wounded.
38814,Homer,... ooh!... ...
23932,Homer,"havin' a party, moe. i'll need four kegs of your finest imported-sounding beer."
36788,Homer,flushy! go get help!
22117,Homer,"kids, i don't want you drinking any more milk. ever."
24718,Homer,for a casual acquaintance like you? absolutely.
24582,Homer,intelligent italians? something's wrong.
14524,Homer,beer! how did you know?
31405,Homer,i thought we were playing cincinnati time-waste.
14712,Homer,"marge, look at me."
18611,Homer,saturday afternoon tv is so boring.
17737,Homer,"hi honey, how are you?"
29557,Homer,but there was one righteous man: noah!
35781,Homer,i've outgrown you!
14949,Homer,forget it. i'm not going.
30409,Homer,i'd do anything to get your mother and that donut back.
29424,Homer,marge? bart? lisa?
29312,Homer,"what's happened to us, marge? we used to feed each other cheese and laugh all night. then came the heart attacks."
40218,Homer,"come on, marge."
15997,Homer,then came the day we knew we were finished.
28243,Homer,"welcome to your room, mom. i want you to stay here forever."
22362,Homer,football!
14062,Homer,i decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle.
24913,Homer,"i am not a number, i am a man. and don't you ever... oh, wait, i'm number 5. ha ha! in your face, number 6!"
18203,Homer,why you cotton pickin' --
15963,Homer,the be sharps.
19006,Homer,...and i like to think sometimes we get a message across as well.
36663,Homer,"marge, you take that back!"
34492,Homer,impressive.
34098,Homer,and it's not over yet.
22554,Homer,"aw, crap! it's a girl's car. i can't drive this."
19339,Homer,"oh, of course, my sweet. i'll just make some soothing ocean sounds for you."
21027,Homer,"uh, a seagull took my sailor hat."
17738,Homer,i can't go on with this charade any longer. i hate my job. i hate my life. and ever since i found out about this baby there's been nothing but bad luck.
25415,Homer,"boy, you weren't kidding. your profit margins are razor-thin."
38409,Homer,question. it says here the murderer is admiral wainsworth. who's that?
26010,Homer,"moe, we want our bar back."
25111,Homer,"you mean, like, medical testing?"
30761,Homer,i miss bart! i can't leave him in that awful camp!
36958,Homer,what cool kid thing's in here?
38763,Homer,sammy hagar? you're not dead.
20236,Homer,"next, i'll tell you the origin of maggie's pacifier."
38398,Homer,"ooh, doubles!"
24811,Homer,"i mean, screw you!"
39004,Homer,seems almost a shame i'm gonna have to bang you against a wall till you die.
32106,Homer,a fresh face!
20670,Homer,"run for your lives, everyone! this is not a drill!"
20680,Homer,"oh, i got it! oh, it's just a thread! it was... she's got... she's got the washcloth!"
37852,Homer,"global warming, huh? by pure coincidence, every scientist was right!"
13160,Homer,"elvis? what the hell kind of name is... oh yeah, right."
22740,Homer,"well, well, well. looks like we've got ourselves a showdown, boy."
16915,Homer,i'll just keep these then.
17381,Homer,"run, marge! save the booty!"
27171,Homer,"well, if bart can be ""el barto""..."
37923,Homer,"consulates are regional offices, which serve the embassy in the capital."
15676,Homer,i'd sell my first-born son.
25911,Homer,ow!
30533,Homer,this looks like a job for a dad trying to win back his daughter's love!
16955,Homer,"or what? you'll release the dogs? or the bees? or the dogs with bees in their mouths, and when they bark, they shoot bees at you? well go ahead, do your worst."
27559,Homer,"hey, my dad was lousy and i didn't sue him. i just dumped him in the cheapest home i could find."
37278,Homer,"to elaborate, i want your wife, the teacher, to help get rid of lisa's substitute..."
24231,Homer,whatever.
41539,Homer,hm... i wonder what's on your mind...
20904,Homer,"hey, don't give up, moe. the girl of your dreams has gotta be in some bar."
28332,Homer,"okay, i'm gonna go over there and see if they're cool."
13782,Homer,their eanae-eharatou-nah-dule-what?
33602,Homer,"well, we need help. someone who can make money with a bar that has no customers and zero charm."
26571,Homer,"forget every word, boy. it's useless."
32949,Homer,"son... all hobbies suck. but if you keep at it, you might find at the end that you've managed to kill some precious time."
40256,Homer,"delicious frosty beer. fat lot of good that does me, sitting next to old man burns."
30624,Homer,it's a lamborgotti fasterosa xt 550 with abs sport tech package.
29209,Homer,"fine, i'll never go back. starting tomorrow. today is lenny's birthday and they're having ice cream cake."
30500,Homer,"aw, isn't that cute?"
26227,Homer,to amber... who proves there are seconds in the buffet of life.
19830,Homer,"aw, i love this pedestrian mall! there's practically no traffic!"
16554,Homer,"curse you, magic beans."
28900,Homer,dressing room? uh oh.
17953,Homer,"marge, do you respect my intelligence?"
15607,Homer,"shut up, flanders."
24796,Homer,i've been doing some outside projects for mr. burns.
39794,Homer,"hey, what is this? the spanish exposition?"
13360,Homer,i admit it. i didn't know when to say when. i'm sorry it happened and i just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect for me.
27018,Homer,"uh, i really don't wanna do that, ned."
33465,Homer,"so, anyway, if you're not doing anything, and it looks like you are, you're welcome to stop by, or not."
32164,Homer,"marge, flying in private jets is great and all, but it's just too dangerous. that's why i've decided to go to the plant and beg mr. burns for my old job back."
34062,Homer,"allo, you are getting cozy with sarkozy."
37218,Homer,look at all this wrestling stuff.
34854,Homer,"hurry up, boy. we have to burn everything the cat touched before the virus makes us paranoid."
15323,Homer,"ah, white gold."
17729,Homer,"my marketing plan attracted a record number of police and fire officials, but few stayed to bowl. i failed. quitting my dream job was the hardest thing i've ever done."
30936,Homer,a book?
33630,Homer,what if we...
39508,Homer,"oooo, do i ever!"
38817,Homer,i guess i'll take the concentration camp one.
22133,Homer,"oh, i get it. you're worried about those mobsters, aren't ya?"
41391,Homer,more sugar! more sugar!
27896,Homer,"marge, i never want to be apart from you again."
17715,Homer,oh just that one time.
40786,Homer,the perfect crime.
22886,Homer,"so long, the simpsons!"
16348,Homer,"hey, i hear ya, buddy."
28805,Homer,i thought we killed him!
28696,Homer,open this door right now!
17004,Homer,"marge, please. old people don't need companionship. they need to be isolated and studied, so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use."
23521,Homer,"i know, honey. but what can i do, as an individual? i wouldn't know where to begin."
17974,Homer,i'll take ten.
40549,Homer,"w-well... it's a v-very generous offer, sir. but... his medical bills alone..."
20059,Homer,"honey, i'm home!"
37931,Homer,at first my wife didn't believe in me. maybe we forgot why we fell in love in the first place.
26452,Homer,i'm still not givin' up on buck. there must be some hare-brained half-assed way...
26610,Homer,"awww, look, maggie wants to fly too."
21175,Homer,"good boy, mojo. now, bring 'em down and i'll give you one."
15105,Homer,did you wreck the car?
33827,Homer,i'll take it!
27297,Homer,very well. i am gone!
37433,Homer,"yeah, your generation won't have any dreams come true."
23985,Homer,"play ""ain't seen nothing yet!"""
40360,Homer,"come on, boy."
16277,Homer,we pay eight dollars for the night and you can take two popsicles out of the freezer.
36420,Homer,what do i do? what do i do?
19381,Homer,talk to me!!
15618,Homer,hit me.
39808,Homer,"i hear ya, buddy! whew! full moon!"
29791,Homer,there must have been a mistake. my body is a temple.
25863,Homer,coooool.
28238,Homer,a boy who gets some on the side.
24978,Homer,"ten-four, kemosabe."
20711,Homer,"yes, sir!"
19920,Homer,"oh, i don't know about this dog. he's kinda... snooty."
19763,Homer,"no i'm not, marge! they're embarrassing me! they're embarrassing america! they turned the navy into a floating joke! they ruined all our best names, like bruce and lance and julian! those were the toughest names we had, now they're just..."
17246,Homer,"when i'm driving the car, i get to choose the radio station. when you're driving, we'll listen to your radio station."
18582,Homer,"c'mon, guys. let's be the team that supports each other. you can do it otto / you can do it otto / help each other out, that'll be our motto..."
25799,Homer,what have i done? what have i done?!
15177,Homer,don't you think i know that?
28815,Homer,four jacks.
22498,Homer,"c'mon, boy. c'mon!"
39703,Homer,"oh no, no. we stink, we stink!"
15617,Homer,hit me.
31902,Homer,"look, we're just gonna take our mattress, do a quick sweep of the medicine chest, then we're outta here."
39405,Homer,"unlike most of you, i am not a nut. just a good, honest american who opposes wrongdoing and especially carelessness wherever they occur."
26716,Homer,that guy's hilarious. i especially like his white shirt and blue pants. wait a second... angry dad is me!
34306,Homer,leave me alone! i have shares to crop!
25476,Homer,what can you do? sex sells.
16783,Homer,"god, if you really are god, you'll get me tickets to that game."
14943,Homer,leggo! leggo!
22228,Homer,"okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay... okay. okay, you're saying that ned and me married you two?"
16586,Homer,too late.
30030,Homer,it's called smoozing!
39954,Homer,you might say that. my wife's gonna leave me 'cause she thinks i'm a pig.
37597,Homer,"hey, i'm the one in bed with two beautiful women."
17178,Homer,see you tomorrow....
39455,Homer,"boy, i'm glad that's over. now we can go home and act normal again."
37876,Homer,"oh, boy. monday morning chit chat at the water cooler. the only reason to have done stuff over the weekend."
41091,Homer,"my god, you're right, marge. you kids wouldn't put me in a home like i did to my dad, would you?"
40872,Homer,"there is something wrong with that kid. she's so moral. why can't she be more like... well, not like bart, but there's gotta be a happy medium."
29413,Homer,"spill it, super-boss!"
15716,Homer,i guess it's not all bad.
22785,Homer,the pie shall be cut in two. then each man shall receive... death. i'll eat the pie.
19412,Homer,"what's wrong with you? what are you trying to hide from m-- what's that smell? onions... chili powder... cumin... juicy ground chuck... it's chili! oh my god, i'm missing the chili cook-off!"
25664,Homer,does -- rachel -- like -- ned?
30853,Homer,mr. teeny?!
34075,Homer,"now, kids, we're about to get really cold, then really warm."
22010,Homer,"whoever keeps saying ""please stop"" back there, better quit it."
28982,Homer,there's a first class?
24308,Homer,"can i, marge? can i?"
36043,Homer,we won! woo hoo!
37422,Homer,"those royal elephants have trainers to keep 'em in shape. average schmoe like me, forget it."

25437,Homer,members of the media...
34712,Homer,another good one...
13882,Homer,"look, i let you down and i apologize. i know that doesn't make it right, but i hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me."
36124,Homer,dri-ving-to-work!
13242,Homer,what's she doing here?
32525,Homer,"wow, i must have really tied one on last night."
36486,Homer,you wanna honk your jazz tube?
24140,Homer,wha -- wait! i'm no missionary! i don't even believe in jebus! let me out!

16876,Homer,"we'll call you back! bart! with ten thousand dollars we'd be millionaires. we could buy all kinds of useful things, like... ... love."
34171,Homer,"watch your language! now, why the hell not?"
38864,Homer,let me just... there you are... like new... not a freak of nature...
15095,Homer,the doll's trying to kill me and the toaster's been laughing at me!
15094,Homer,"marge, marge, look!"

20848,Homer,"can't discuss that now, marge. i have to write another delicious memo."
26221,Homer,"not a sports fan, huh?"
35486,Homer,"wha? my doctor said ""don't walk."""
32783,Homer,"hee-hee. okay, now we get rid of the cigarettes..."

34378,Homer,look at that.
17800,Homer,"and now the winner for the most promising new series on cable: old ""starsky and hutches."""

17369,Homer,"sorry kids, but this is one event i want my darling wife by my side."
36051,Homer,"oh, let's face it. i'm the one that's brought this fate upon us. and there's only one way out: i've gotta man up. okay, manning up... manning up. mannning-- girling down! girling down!"
36029,Homer,"sorry, dad. i was afraid the dragon wouldn't cough the moon back up."

29922,Homer,"aw, what did he die of?"
40684,Homer,"i pay my taxes and they pay your salary, so when i say ""give me a ticket"", just give me a ticket."
38080,Homer,fine. i'll take you. they have this cool psych class at the campus i sat in on.
23609,Homer,that's it! kids are the answer! i'll dedicate my life to my children.

27631,Homer,"yeah, you're the number one speller in this car or in that car or in that car or, don't look at that car."
31490,Homer,"lisa, i'm home! time for me to read to you!"

33400,Homer,"sorry, debbie. i hope you can find happiness without me."
31441,Homer,"i would never let you down. our marriage is like soft-serve ice cream. and trust is the hard chocolate shell that keeps it from melting onto our carpet. in cone-clusion, here's the scoop: i love you."
26285,Homer,remember what i told you about running away from your troubles?
17606,Homer,really?
32468,Homer,"doctor, i'm embarrassed to show my body to my wife. and it's all because of your surgery!"
25304,Homer,uh-oh.
18589,Homer,"marge, you're missing the point. the individual doesn't matter. it was a team effort and i was the one who came up with the whole team idea. me."

25309,Homer,my manhood? i never thought of that!
17079,Homer,"okay, marge, things were said, mistakes were made. let's end this madness and get on with our lives."
35566,Homer,paddles down! it's the only way to change the system!
32274,Homer,"man, you work as a silhouette model for one day and it haunts you for the rest of your life."
37994,Homer,"i'm really sorry, and..."

36455,Homer,what the?
21701,Homer,who wants to see their sexy new daddy?
15220,Homer,"marge, get my gun."
24618,Homer,"now, i'm not one to make trouble... but it seems to me that everyone who got to keep the old, or ""classic"" 636 area code, lives on... the rich side of town!"
16545,Homer,"well, that's nothing, because you have a gambling problem! and remember when i let that escaped lunatic in the house 'cause he was dressed like santa claus?"
32141,Homer,say it!
26400,Homer,"hey marge, watch me burn flanders. ned flanders bids fifty dollars."
16024,Homer,i think he's talking to you.

36799,Homer,"moe, i could believe this was a random occurrence, or i could believe some higher power reached down and squeezed the sap outta that tree. i'm choosin' hope! moe, a bottle of your finest beer!"
31337,Homer,"man, you've got an awesome voice."
15049,Homer,lisa's age seven to nine!
18932,Homer,i never should have bought this button. can i have my three dollars back?
21821,Homer,"the important thing is, it's got the perfect part for you. either one of you. it's about a killer robot driving instructor who travels back in time for some reason. ron howard's attached to direct."
21569,Homer,hike.
26900,Homer,no! i've caused enough trouble already by plugging in that santa claus. no more irresponsible behavior.
35268,Homer,no one else is doing it. i'm trying to start it. whoo!

24619,Homer,"and as usual, we joe twelve-packs get the royal screw job."
23601,Homer,"this is the end / my only friend, the end / weird scenes inside the gold mine..."
31407,Homer,"hey marge, want a thousand dollars?"
36617,Homer,"marge, i was just being a good husband by pretending to agree with you while secretly undermining your agenda."
26674,Homer,this stuff can make anything funny... even the show that follows friends. but i promised my family i wouldn't smoke it anymore.
25957,Homer,very little.
14007,Homer,bart!... i'm gonna help you build that racer.
20691,Homer,"no i don't, i think they're bad / they're fake and phoney and totally wrong."
17591,Homer,"do i ever! it's five years later and i still think i'm a chicken. i'm a chicken, marge."
39187,Homer,have you seen this woman? have you? have you seen my wife?

22003,Homer,duh.
16052,Homer,"maybe you're right. i did always want to go to college, but fate stood in the way."
17140,Homer,"those are prizes. ooo, a blasting cap!"
23164,Homer,"do the words ""executive producer"" mean anything to you?"
13316,Homer,"hey, what's the matter, son?"
33883,Homer,"""dammit, morpheus. not everyone believes what you believe."""
32578,Homer,the mother of my children with the reason for my children!
20427,Homer,my father never believed in me.
37275,Homer,"flanders, i've come to forgive you."
31821,Homer,"ooh, papa john's."
33224,Homer,"lisa's mad at me, and now she's using marge's maiden name instead of mine."
27242,Homer,"all right, let's see what we've got here."
14937,Homer,i wasn't bored. i was sad. it really got to me how that lady -- uh... uh... you know which one i mean. you played her.
13141,Homer,"wow, a negro!"
16332,Homer,that's not fun!
22721,Homer,okay-we're-all-set-let's-put-the-pedal-to-the-metal!
37286,Homer,all too well.
22447,Homer,"this is our chance to rub elbows with springfield's young, hip power couples... like me and debbie pinson."
18368,Homer,"hello, honey."
21457,Homer,"when you think about it, mud is nothing but wet dirt."
39302,Homer,but he's a loser. he's pathetic. he's...
27306,Homer,"america loves its kings, from george the third to larry."
36405,Homer,"...and now because it's afternoon, i can go to moe's without having a ""drinking problem."""
31379,Homer,this vibrating massage chair feels great!
20296,Homer,i'll teach you to mess with my machine!
22581,Homer,nice rhino.
26387,Homer,"artie, thanks for saving my life. now, i believe there's a little matter of the million dollars..."
25955,Homer,"so, i guess you wouldn't mind if i was to dig a hole of my own."
41324,Homer,"greetings, friend..."
32252,Homer,does it work?
40582,Homer,"oh, marge..."
23125,Homer,at least the jimmy stewart version had that giant rabbit who ran the savings and loan.
25024,Homer,"well, hmm, let's see, he was foreign and he had some..."
14558,Homer,i play right field too.
14282,Homer,"oh, college boy, eh?"
29310,Homer,prove it.
37836,Homer,yes. what's skinner's weakness?
22754,Homer,"relax, i found it in the dumpster."
37328,Homer,"i'd like a lot of food, and for this to be the last decision i have to make."
34344,Homer,"awesome breakfast, marge! breakfast in bed is so much better than breakfast in a chair."
31561,Homer,queer strange or queer gay?
33726,Homer,"mmm, cherry."
18477,Homer,"wait a minute. there's one thing i don't understand. in all those years, why didn't you ever try to contact me?"
23273,Homer,it was so hard to get to 500 words...
29048,Homer,"i was in so deep, i forgot pies were food."
15346,Homer,this is all my fault. i've gotta save him.
28442,Homer,the door? now i'll never get to pee.
17865,Homer,my house is on fire! woo hoo! insurance to the rescue.
38835,Homer,this party's great. but all i wish is that i was drinking a beer with my kids right now.
23954,Homer,third best for me.
26936,Homer,"is this you? if it is, don't dial nine one one. simply dial six three six five five five three four seven two."
25685,Homer,i am. i'd be glad to spearhead the entire begging initiative.
23822,Homer,what's wrong with us?!
24916,Homer,"so, who brought us here?"
13148,Homer,because i talked to you.
26836,Homer,"oh fine, i'll go back to the beginning."
24561,Homer,"hello, wife! hello, children!"
30367,Homer,i forgot to floss this morning!
37737,Homer,"nice sunglasses, lenny."
36692,Homer,that's dad's cologne? i always thought it was his old-man stink.
38628,Homer,marge simpson... i'm as mad at you as you usually are at me.
29874,Homer,"ray, you know me better than anyone. how can i get my wife to love me again?"
28459,Homer,my pleasure.
22889,Homer,make sure you strap 'em on real tight.
37025,Homer,and it still works!
14354,Homer,"doh, not the wind."
35085,Homer,"and i love having you here, son. 'cause you can wake me up if somebody comes."
25777,Homer,no! no! no one is taking my kids from me!
16434,Homer,me too.
35561,Homer,cold. so cold.
15706,Homer,no.
27501,Homer,yes!
20291,Homer,"get 'im, boy! smash that fly! mush him up good!"
14726,Homer,stop it.
34093,Homer,"son, i love you kids. but i'm only going to the hospital one more time in my life and i ain't comin' out."
27216,Homer,"hey, get out, i'm in here! oh."
20398,Homer,"i'm sorry i lied to you, marge. but this gun had a hold on me. i felt this incredible surge of power, like god must feel when he's holding a gun. so please, get rid of it, because i know i'll just lie to you again and again!"
30884,Homer,"oh marge, you're the greatest mom ever. i want the whole world to see that."
26204,Homer,yep. our family is as functional as all get out.
26991,Homer,"okay, everyone out!"
21860,Homer,"in closing, you people must realize that the public owns you for life. and when you're dead, you'll all be in commercials, dancing with vacuum cleaners. thank you, your honor."
21046,Homer,"well, i guess that's everyone. except earring-boy."
21494,Homer,these have pleats...
36556,Homer,"okay, it's possible that someone may have started a business called ""magic craphole waste removal,"" but it wasn't me."
21248,Homer,and can't someone else scoop out that nasty kitty litter?
23878,Homer,it's not to scale.
33874,Homer,"hey, there's no way i could ever be as good as that guy."
28348,Homer,a secret tunnel? i don't know. won't that get me in more trouble?
30218,Homer,"...i coveted the wife in ""jaws 2,"" i lied to a waiter, i masturbated eight million times and i have no plans to stop masturbating in the future."
35582,Homer,"ah, halloween. the one time of year when the squalor of our home works to our advantage."
31538,Homer,there's water under the seat!
27271,Homer,your family is invited to a free weekend at stagnant springs spa.
30804,Homer,moe has a cappuccino machine??!!
38493,Homer,"uh, works for me."
33972,Homer,"five, six / who's got tix?"
15640,Homer,"""learned,"" son, it's pronounced ""learned."""
24739,Homer,mmm... donuts.
24866,Homer,"hmm, that's the kind of dirt that belongs on my web page."
35565,Homer,don't buy it! i bought one last year and it was crap construction!
41206,Homer,"heh, heh, heh, heh."
36716,Homer,please stop. i just wanted my frisbee back from your yard.
29060,Homer,nooo! not community service -- i can't stand helping others! i just can't!
24757,Homer,"no, really."
27094,Homer,precisely.
20132,Homer,"what? ""failure to wait by vehicle: $250."""
28773,Homer,"oh no, the giant is waking up!"
38891,Homer,why are they dancing? shouldn't they be making weapons?
37671,Homer,i'll bet a rich man like you has no regrets at all.
34466,Homer,ooh! we mock your very decency.
24871,Homer,darn tootin'.
14667,Homer,"oh wait, i heard how this ends. it turns out the secret code was the same nursery rhyme he told his daughter."
30289,Homer,"i warned you he was an idiot. well, all i need is some moonshine and someone playin' the har-mon-a-key, and i'm as happy as a pig in plop!"
20541,Homer,"howdy, gents! i'm here to collect my free--"
36982,Homer,"so, what have you learned so far from our post-apocalyptic movie marathon?"
19927,Homer,"i'd take him, but those cards are non-transferable."
21733,Homer,ohh... ahh...
26069,Homer,"but mr. burns, you're exhausted."
19048,Homer,"um... let me have one of those porno magazines... a large box of condoms... a bottle of old harper... a couple of those panty shields... and some illegal fireworks... and one of those disposable enemas. no, make it two."
24212,Homer,go moe! boo everyone else!
20199,Homer,wait a minute... she's right!
32942,Homer,"well then, mom, this was for you."
17000,Homer,what? it's not magaggie's birthday? oh.
15940,Homer,"two wrongs make a right, lisa. ah, rex morgan m.d., you have the prescription for the daily blues."
19913,Homer,"marge, mail's here."
33093,Homer,i wish -- we were bicycling to a lake.
23687,Homer,"okay, okay... don't panic. release the mongoose!"
38887,Homer,yes! this mysterious tube can only lead somewhere good. so long you stupid slobbering... what the?
26005,Homer,"ah, whatever. just give me a duff."
25081,Homer,animation is so great. it's way better than... whatever the alternative is.
36355,Homer,bart! there's a really mean squirrel in the back yard. i need you to dare me to fight him!
30975,Homer,"please, you've gotta help me! if they find me they'll kill me."
28906,Homer,i believe that children are the future -- unless we stop them now.
36505,Homer,gap's too small!
30182,Homer,like a woman who's made the biggest mistake of her life.
20647,Homer,"stay out of this, old man."
17659,Homer,moom.
18158,Homer,homer simpson! homer simpson!
31433,Homer,"marge, you're a genius. you should make sculptures of other people! like lenny, or carl, or the new james bond. will america accept a british james bond? i can't wait to find out!"
33032,Homer,"well, i'm--"
35107,Homer,"ow! ow! huh, mmm, not bad. just a hundred and twenty-seven more hours."
41109,Homer,yell-o.
35691,Homer,this is my thing and always will be!
15334,Homer,i know! i'll do a rap. i'm mr. plow and i'm here to say: i'm the plowingest guy in the usa / i got a big plow and i move a lot of things / like your cow it you have one.
38926,Homer,how can anyone relax when they made us park in stack parking?
23967,Homer,ahhhh!
22027,Homer,really? you think it's dangerous?
31566,Homer,here you go -- beer-battered shrimp.
24078,Homer,why eat hamburger when you can have steak?
31175,Homer,"now, m'lady, your carriage awaits."
20919,Homer,why all the pearls? why all the hair? why anything?
36622,Homer,"okay, good, we're talking..."
19792,Homer,"oh, she'd never go. she's a vegetarian."
40544,Homer,wow...
31181,Homer,"dirt nap, eh? hm..."
30032,Homer,"hey, everybody...i brought a guest."
36774,Homer,woo hoo!
17504,Homer,thank you!
19200,Homer,"uh, well... i was gonna surprise you, but, um... happy anniversary, baby!"
40015,Homer,"mmmm. marge, could you get me another beer, please?"
20886,Homer,"you too, bart."
30865,Homer,"later, if i have enough energy, we can walk up to the tv and i'll show you how thin it is."
27269,Homer,mail call!
15092,Homer,"goodbye, dolly."
29991,Homer,i don't wanna.
37183,Homer,no. i'm sorry. it's... wait a minute.
32716,Homer,what?! i'm not even gonna dignify that with eye contact.
14420,Homer,"all right, we're back in business."
40388,Homer,"look, son, all i'm asking is that you try."
19729,Homer,"okay, so maybe that thing's a hunk of junk, but look at what you're selling!"
34418,Homer,ah-ha -- a sand horse! car of the desert!
29641,Homer,"patty, i admire your decision. it takes courage to follow your heart and walk out on a non-refundable wedding ceremony. so i'm gonna waive the rose petal removal fee and prorate the cake-handling surcharge."
26757,Homer,this was supposed to be a mock battle! mock!
38576,Homer,"hey... if you're homer simpson, show me your driver's license."
14322,Homer,"hey, don't make me come down there!"
30524,Homer,safety tip ninety-nine: always double-bolt your easel.
27910,Homer,ned's a stupid name! he's worse than frankenstein or dr. no.
13244,Homer,"aw c'mon, serious homer, let me out! we'll get a monkey drunk and push him down the stairs."
40076,Homer,i am nature's greatest miracle!
40811,Homer,"one of each, please."
36681,Homer,that's where we live!
35381,Homer,you did this?! with your fat fingers and your brain the size of a super ball?!
33122,Homer,i'll put a hundred bucks in your col-lege fund.
25790,Homer,stupid anti-fist-shaking laws.
34333,Homer,"fine. i was gonna apologize, but now i'm not going to!"
19361,Homer,woo hoo! two dollars! it's working!
34170,Homer,do you want to come in and get your sister with me?
36513,Homer,"hey, it's me."
15102,Homer,"well, she was. and she hit him in the head with a golf club!"
13359,Homer,about last night... you might have noticed daddy acting a little strange and you probably don't understand why.
28542,Homer,i'll show flanders. i'm gonna get everyone a car. what's that one good american car?
26373,Homer,"i'm leaving you, marge. the next time you see my name will be in the hobo obituaries. don't worry about the kids -- i'll drop 'em off with patty and selma."
21169,Homer,"this ""filthy monkey"" made the orange juice you're drinking."
24497,Homer,mamma mia! now i'll have to do it.
20044,Homer,"marge, do we have any elbow macaroni and glue-on sparkles?"
17965,Homer,but ... the ball... his groin!... it works on so many levels! roll it again.
40486,Homer,"'cause if you don't, i'll never believe anything you say, ever again."
23187,Homer,"i don't get it, mel. how can you be so calm and cool? my stomach's full of vomiting butterflies."
34535,Homer,"yup, i al-gored it pretty good. where's my grammy for audio book narration?"
27158,Homer,the status quo.
31105,Homer,"hey, flanders! thanks for saving our place."
39228,Homer,"it's true. the jar's empty. oh, my god, we're ruined. christmas is cancelled. no presents for anyone."
33747,Homer,"hi, homer simpson. mind if i sit near your son? mine sucks."
30696,Homer,who's mason fairbanks?
18981,Homer,well... what have we here? looks like your un-cool dad scored tickets to hullabalooza.
38349,Homer,kids are so afraid of being terminated.
22101,Homer,hold it! what's your clearance?
14005,Homer,what boy?
17469,Homer,wow. let's go find that hot dog tree i planted.
28750,Homer,...i'm taking you all out for pancakes!
39425,Homer,"you were? aw, well go ahead."
25235,Homer,"aw, now, be nice, moe. this guy just got out of the hospital."
30736,Homer,"don't forget to wash your hands, shakespeare."
13981,Homer,"oooh, ""death by knockout,"" ""blood on the ice"" oh, oh... ""football's greatest injuries"". lisa, we're going."
37770,Homer,"oh, yes, i am shopping for maggie, our baby together, so this looks perfectly innocent."
17811,Homer,look at it.
32660,Homer,...hating being famous.
37238,Homer,"now if you could make with some bacon and eggs, i'll be on my way."
27087,Homer,"no, i think it's seltzer."
25829,Homer,yah!
35726,Homer,we're taking down kids who read.
41341,Homer,now for that happy period between the lie and the time it's found out.
40616,Homer,you're the doctor!
39668,Homer,no.
37832,Homer,come on.
17394,Homer,"c'mon, i'm a decent guy..."
27498,Homer,"die, monster!"
16944,Homer,"woo hoo! we're rich! bart, get over to the mansion and open up all the windows. we want to get the old people smell out before we move in."
38474,Homer,bubble wrap!
15279,Homer,ohh.
29019,Homer,judge a pig competition?... but i'm no super-genius! or are i?
30606,Homer,what's in you?
16440,Homer,ew.
36733,Homer,stop!
35445,Homer,but there's so many buttons!
19618,Homer,"you know, mr. burns, you're the richest guy i know. way richer than lenny."
19787,Homer,"butt out, butt-insky! what would you know about hunting?"
39964,Homer,"i love you, marjorie."
39285,Homer,i can't believe i'm doing this.
28698,Homer,"flanders, pull over! i'm an ambulance!"
31185,Homer,leave him to me.
22549,Homer,will do!
22393,Homer,take it or leave it... carl.
14124,Homer,sell! sell! sell! woo hoo! twenty-five dollars!
40927,Homer,sorry.
41186,Homer,"woo woo! all right! i always knew you had personality. the doctors said it was hyperactivity, but i knew better. president simpson. has a nice ring to it, doesn't it, boy?"
19999,Homer,i didn't even know what a nuclear panner plant was.
30649,Homer,"i know, and he's magic!"
23254,Homer,"don't worry, sweetie. daddy's got it covered."
22048,Homer,"um, can i be a mate on your ship? preferably first mate."
27441,Homer,"emergency whistle, pepper spray and this map of the most vulnerable parts of a man's body."
35385,Homer,woo hoo!
15527,Homer,"hmmm, false... no, wait. maybe it's true."
40555,Homer,whoo ooo! i stand corrected. a million bucks is a-okay!
27711,Homer,"oooh, published by kinko's!"
37169,Homer,"highlights... ""for..."""
32037,Homer,why the cemetery? i wondered. but my dreams were too strong.
24273,Homer,shut up.
28408,Homer,fine. but do you know how ridiculous you look right now?
26884,Homer,now you do it for me.
30752,Homer,"kidding! i'm kidding! we can do that, we have a special friendship."
14385,Homer,tut-tut. only the best for my family.
20253,Homer,"geez, what's with all the death?"
31749,Homer,"oh lisa, that's one of those rumors you get off the internet."
34731,Homer,"you got to enjoy that bag for nothing! we can buy stuff we can't afford, temporarily own the hell out of it, and then indignantly bring it back for a full refund."
14774,Homer,there was a little spanish flea... a record star he thought he'd be... he heard of singers like beatles... the chipmunks he'd seen on tv... why not a little spanish flea? and so he hid... inside a dog...
20975,Homer,"lisa, it's me, daddy, your father. i rounded up every simpson in the tri-city area, so i can prove to you there's nothing wrong with the simpson genes. this is your great-uncle chet. go ahead, chet, tell her what you do."
27324,Homer,bart! turn down that original cast recording and go to sleep!
39201,Homer,"hey, norman. how's it going? so you got dragged down here, too... heh, heh. how ya doing, fred? excuse me, fred."
13182,Homer,"um, i know super clean cleans, but does it scrub?"
30983,Homer,may i escort you to the railing?
35088,Homer,"damn, that hurt!"
35065,Homer,"son, i won't strangle you anymore, but i also won't get you that mini-bike."
36931,Homer,"but, there was one thing i wasn't prepared for..."
21845,Homer,"hmmm... she may not be famous, but she's right. those big shot stars used me up and spit me out. i did their laundry, got their pictures developed, took their garbage to the dump... and i've still got a car full of their crap. crap, eh...?"
13595,Homer,i had a feeling it was too good to be true. every time you get a million dollars something queers the deal.
14526,Homer,"boy, you've got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth."
35634,Homer,you're mean!
26704,Homer,secrets and lies...
36287,Homer,i'm doomed! can they climb stairs?
23897,Homer,"oh, right. the ice pick."
36577,Homer,"listen, pal, you seem like an honest guy."
13867,Homer,"hmm. ""lisa stop playing that stupid... saxophone!"" yes! that's it!"
28971,Homer,"yeah, we're tryin' to create a mood here, so shut the hell up!"
13226,Homer,yes indeedy.
36157,Homer,"hey, it's called ""karma."""
41351,Homer,"okay, you're already eating it, but don't finish it. okay, you finished it, but don't ask for--"
17313,Homer,"uh oh, it's seeping in! stupid cheap weather stripping."
14052,Homer,"you spoke while you were jinxed so i get to punch you in the arm. sorry, it's the law. heh, heh."
18529,Homer,"hey guys, look what i smuggled aboard."
15819,Homer,no! no! beer bring pain!
23553,Homer,are poo and ass taken?
21355,Homer,"it just keeps going! i give up. you beat me, mountain!"
26644,Homer,you just said it!
19064,Homer,we chained hugo up in the attic like an animal and fed him a bucket of fish heads once a week.
29427,Homer,oh wait. i was supposed to take these with food.
36295,Homer,then take us out to sea.
35681,Homer,of how much fun i am to be around! it's always a party with fun dad!
40540,Homer,he's awake!
21491,Homer,"yeah, the british tabloids will have a field day. there's only one thing left to do."
21685,Homer,"or reading comic books. what am i, kreskin? you tell me what he's doing."
16971,Homer,"yes, deeply concerned."
17782,Homer,marge.
21978,Homer,"pinchy, i made you some risotto."
41099,Homer,dad! it's the third sunday of the month. you know what that means.
19256,Homer,right... uh huh... gotcha... cat in the furnace.
14405,Homer,huh?
37009,Homer,no! i want to help the people who didn't prepare!
14183,Homer,maybe.
19880,Homer,"remember, honey, we're disobeying an unjust law here. we're patriots. like... all those people in jail."
31436,Homer,let me just put on some romantic music.
35166,Homer,"oh, hi! ricky gervais, umm such an honor to meet you, sir ridley. i love your movies. or as i call them, ""films."" umm, glad i bumped into you, actually. because, uh, i'm looking to expand beyond comedy. i know what you're thinking, sir ridley. you're thinking ""oh my word, he's been making me laugh all these years, but now he's moving me as well. i'm gonna have to put him in my new film. what do you think?"
21859,Homer,"i believe that famous people have a debt to everyone. if celebrities didn't want people pawing through their garbage and saying they're gay, they shouldn't have tried to express themselves creatively."
21311,Homer,ohhh... a gym.
27644,Homer,"hey, don't blame me, i voted for the green m&m."
28130,Homer,look at those pants. they're standing up with no one in them.
25806,Homer,it--
36362,Homer,why does every sand castle require my participation?
35855,Homer,who wants to go to the park and ride the merry-go-nowhere?
15600,Homer,"hmm, i keep thinking i'm forgetting something."
40340,Homer,"oh, he's perfect now, is he?"
24134,Homer,sanctuary!
20701,Homer,"sor-reee, your majesty."
27308,Homer,oh my god! attention drunken idiots: this is your king! sacrifice yourselves to slow me down!
38133,Homer,"you don't have children, do you?"

36667,Homer,"oh, it's hopeless! this room is like a museum of meaningless old crap. by which i mean every museum."
30278,Homer,"no, no. it's not gonna be like that, i swear."
25732,Homer,"well, marge isn't here. she had to identify a body at the morgue."
27645,Homer,"moe, what are you doing here?"
28061,Homer,"yeah, the doctor says that soon my pelvis will actually be stronger and more beautiful than ever."
15225,Homer,"well, i won't sleep in the same bed with a woman who thinks i'm lazy. i'm gonna go right down stairs, unfold the couch, unroll a sleeping bag... eh, goodnight."
34904,Homer,i mailed them the answer but they never printed it.
29869,Homer,i'd like a beer and a sympathetic ear.
26243,Homer,"wait, wait, wait..."
31324,Homer,"sorry, guys. you know, his mother's the one who made me come down here."
21062,Homer,very well then. i'm a captain.
22489,Homer,"uh-uh, no way. i don't want to miss a word."
18190,Homer,i can see lisa... but it might be a starfish. i've gotta call 'em!
21573,Homer,"really? a restaurant? well, now i don't know what to think."

26751,Homer,grape.
18913,Homer,"oh, how does it work?"

27236,Homer,"okay, more coal, less coal, less, less, more, less-less-less! annnd... none."
19642,Homer,"oh lord, protect this rocket house and all who dwell within the rocket house."
30158,Homer,"yes i am, homer."
40502,Homer,"marge, i'm gonna build you a spice rack!"
28876,Homer,"well, what i did was..."
14822,Homer,"well, why did this have to happen now, during primetime, when tv's brightest stars come out to shine!?"
20309,Homer,"oh, i'll kill myself if portugal doesn't win."
33755,Homer,no time. i'll just deduce where you were from a list of possibilities in my head.
24812,Homer,"huh? oh, why did he have to say that extra thing?"
37718,Homer,the editor put in like six pictures of this girl 'cause she was his girlfriend.
18871,Homer,"moe thinks he knows a lot more than moe knows! well, just give me another chance, and i'll prove i can keep your secrets."
38126,Homer,"lisa ""wants"" ""a"" ""dot dot dot""..."
23882,Homer,woo hoo! go s.u.!
40671,Homer,"never went fishing, or played catch, or even hugged each other."
20653,Homer,"thanks, ted."
15984,Homer,"lisa, did you see the grammys?"
26582,Homer,"oh, too much junk in the trunk, eh?"
35641,Homer,c'mon. the apple must be wreaking havoc with the twinkie!
15501,Homer,"now, marge, if the unthinkable should happen, you're gonna be lonely..."
33905,Homer,you? awesome. next.
14150,Homer,"ooh, battlestar galactica."

33439,Homer,dear. stupid. insurance. company. i. meant. to. mail this. on time. what. do you. mean. too bad? screw. you! heh. heh.
35281,Homer,"so... are those butter cookies for everybody, or..."
27278,Homer,"well then, you might as well stay with us. we serve the same meat the prisons do!"
15753,Homer,don't worry. we won a dental plan in the strike of eighty-eight. that's where i got this scar.
21558,Homer,"what are you talking about, marge? i don't need a..."
25191,Homer,"first i'd feel like having a blt, then proud of you."
21842,Homer,was it the dog from the beethoven movies?
37826,Homer,what your mother is trying to say is we don't think you can be good that long.
13698,Homer,"you were swindled, my friend. twenty bucks. take it or leave it."
18104,Homer,i choose to waive that right.
26348,Homer,"hm, a million dollars? wait a minute. how much sex would be involved? 'cause if it's ""some""..."
32473,Homer,"i don't want to live without you, marge."
29239,Homer,"oh c'mon, marge. it's not fair to compare us to an american household."
30747,Homer,"so lenny, how's it goin' in vegas? pretty boring, i'll bet."
19995,Homer,chair goes round... chair goes round.
16473,Homer,free mouthwash! free shampoo! free shower curtain!

31729,Homer,a bear is eating my father!
31020,Homer,"well, uh... uh... honey, you're just as smart as a man. sometimes when i'm with you, i feel like i'm doing it with a dude."
40672,Homer,"i just want you to know that i love you, dad."
37378,Homer,since when?
35342,Homer,you are cruel but fair.
16607,Homer,"well, mr. cat burglar, you'd like to get in here, wouldn't you? there's just one little problem. thirty-six years ago some lady gave birth to a man named homer j. sim -- oh my god! underage kids drinking beer without a permit!"
33956,Homer,no... but the layers of bad on your surface go almost all the way to the center.
36525,Homer,"yes, and now look at us. only in america."
21777,Homer,"higher, i say! i want to soar higher than any man has ever soared! i want to look down on the clouds with contempt! i want to sneer at god's creation and spit on his -- uh-oh."
27318,Homer,frank grimes...
25992,Homer,"wow, well i i almost fainted, but then i didn't. what are you doing?"
15828,Homer,"can't breathe... sweet chocolate... cutting off air... ...mmm, nuts."
31908,Homer,woo hoo!

36998,Homer,"marge, this is it! teotwawki!"
15589,Homer,sounds great!
28402,Homer,lookin' good. and i did it all without wasting money on one of those stupid welder's masks.
37100,Homer,"marge, this has been great couples time. the one thing people with kids desperately need is no kids!"
35346,Homer,i decorated her car for nothing.
15236,Homer,"wha... hey, moose! shoo! go! talkin' to you! get off my lawn! now!"
32755,Homer,"enjoy your jerky laced with sleeping pills... nobody outwits homer simpson... hey, they're not sleepy. they're just turning fuzzy..."
21849,Homer,"that's right, mister tough guy can't handle a little penicillin. oh, and look at this. we can't even pay our bills and they're drinking royal crown cola."
20073,Homer,"if, uh, that happens, are we still charged for the entire semester?"
33459,Homer,"ladies, how're you doing with the float?"
28613,Homer,"i don't think so, son. but on the other hand, i may be closer than you think."
33800,Homer,oscar wilde?
20190,Homer,"oh, my father gave me beer as a child. till i wrapped my little red wagon around a tree."
31946,Homer,woo hoo!
41142,Homer,"well, am i?"
35031,Homer,"sure, i'll stay home and skype with the guys at moe's."
26720,Homer,"stop it! the more you rock, the angrier i get!"
32403,Homer,"because if i do it enough, maybe they'll start to pay me."
33563,Homer,"um... no problem, sweetie."
22400,Homer,who-o-oa! who-o-oa! who-o-oa!
24257,Homer,"hi-how-are-ya, hi-how-are-ya, hi-how-are-ya, hi-how-are-ya."
13454,Homer,"aw, nuts! extremely rare blood and i don't have it."
32162,Homer,"and now, to taxi to the terminal."
31693,Homer,"please, mr. burns, pretend you work for me. you can have the boy, just don't beat him. you can beat him, just don't leave marks."
34457,Homer,patty and selma are dead? woo hoo! a double funeral!
34035,Homer,nooooooo!
13936,Homer,no!
21395,Homer,give me all your balloons.
30576,Homer,"son, i need to find a new friend for your mother. so you're gonna have to finish the shopping yourself."
38139,Homer,"yeah, these seem great. oh, too bad someone used cello rosin."
29652,Homer,"this twenty-foot pole will make bart's restraining order oh-so-easy to enforce. and i used my sprawl*mart employee discount to buy this fancy pole cover. it'll keep your pole looking great, poke after poke after poke!"
21972,Homer,okay...
13442,Homer,"hey, what's all the --"
40345,Homer,you are my brother. i love you and yet i feel a great sadness in my bosom.
19862,Homer,going bowling. not back - avenge deaths.

19461,Homer,"hey, wait! come back!..."
17987,Homer,"whew! uh, enjoy."
24023,Homer,and what if i refuse to lose?
14409,Homer,okay.
33116,Homer,she's not strange! she's fun! and she doesn't get jealous when i talk to other women!
29697,Homer,you guys are commies? then why am i seeing rudimentary free markets?
17350,Homer,"quiet down, bart!"
21352,Homer,la la la la la la la la la...
30007,Homer,"don't lose hope, sweetie. i'm gonna write you a song so great, you can't lose. and that's not just the beer talking. your father's in here too."
38085,Homer,"no. i'm saying you're wasting everyone's time. but it's a church thing, so that's a given."
28799,Homer,but scaring kids is good for them. it hardens them against future terrors -- like roofing and driveway scams.
35451,Homer,boy! stomp on my head!
40922,Homer,okay.
29762,Homer,that's a lot of places.
24971,Homer,there ya go! we'd be stealing from people we know. it's just like the seasons.
31734,Homer,it's not right. it's like an old sea turtle dating a suitcase that fell out of a plane.
33541,Homer,how am i gonna get us all across this river?
25118,Homer,but i've had thousands of head x-rays. how come no one ever noticed it before?
26327,Homer,yep. nothin' to get excited about.
29190,Homer,i can still hear her. i'd better do something.
14416,Homer,buffalo's gonna win. lisa hates me!
38173,Homer,"i don't know whose this is. i found it next to the cash machine, and i've always kept it. look at the balance."
23395,Homer,"well, son. i guess this is the end. but we've both had long, full lives. oh, right."
26442,Homer,"oh, listen to you. ""ooh, ooh, i'm too old to change. "" how old are you?"
18596,Homer,"""they made us!"" that's loser talk! you gotta start acting more like me and my team, the future league champions of the world! nothing's gonna stop us now!"
29859,Homer,"aw, guys. this is just what i needed."
34553,Homer,"sure. lisa, bring the car around."
27745,Homer,hello!
19682,Homer,you little...

20973,Homer,"pff... ""simpson gene!"" somebody's got to set that girl straight. and i know how to do it."

14510,Homer,"well marge, self-improvement has always been a passion of mine. bring on the swear jar."
20415,Homer,"i know, sweetie, and i got him right in the... uh-oh."

33749,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa -- you come to school to help him get good grades? isn't that why we pay public school teachers those enormous salaries?"
19015,Homer,no biggie. i'm cool.
29165,Homer,"if that tree gets too big, it'll ruin the beauty of that rock. we'll lose tourists! and then who will buy my roadside corn?"
37935,Homer,what the hell is all this?!
28176,Homer,i'unno.
35490,Homer,"and didn't the easter bunny himself say ""forgive them, father, for finding all my eggs?"" and if a giant rabbit can lay chocolate eggs, maybe you and edna can find a way to make it work."
20573,Homer,"oh, marge, don't let go, no matter what. if they want you in heaven, they gotta take me, too."
21590,Homer,and i'm starting right now. no more lousy pajamas!
37437,Homer,"hair, no hair, i don't really think about it."
18465,Homer,i'll kwaanza you!
15789,Homer,"woop, woop, woop! woop, woop, woop!"
13633,Homer,mmmmmm... money.
20182,Homer,you don't remember how you got it?
21391,Homer,"uh, yes sir, mr. burns, sir."
41325,Homer,friend...
20709,Homer,"obviously, i don't. now if you'll get out of my way..."
40631,Homer,what's after fear? what's after fear?
25451,Homer,why you little...

29103,Homer,no.
15717,Homer,"it's funny `cause i don't know him. heh, heh, heh."
27842,Homer,so you mean our whole marriage you've just been resenting me behind my back?
13977,Homer,anything for my little girl.
23463,Homer,"aw, what do you know?"
33145,Homer,that takes care of those three -- want to go for a lakeside snuggle?
41552,Homer,kingdom of numb / closet of hurt / feelings are dumb / kisses are dirt...
17923,Homer,"look, all i ask is that you be fair."
25065,Homer,"yeah, as a tribute to princess di. and dodi. because these days, princesses..."
38498,Homer,i don't know. eat your broccoli.
16023,Homer,no problem.
25311,Homer,"it's obvious what's happening. i'm being replaced by a younger, more in-your-face version of me."
17145,Homer,"in america, first you get the sugar, then you get the power, then you get the women."
20114,Homer,"they expect me to sit here from nine to five?! that's how many hours? ten, eleven, denominator... oh, where's lisa when you need her?"
19005,Homer,our first job is to entertain...
30987,Homer,"people, this is madness! we can burn the witch later! right now, i've got to save this ship!"

39521,Homer,"so, what's the problem, son?"
34830,Homer,the march of progress.
14568,Homer,one thing i'm good at and i can't do it anymore.
35973,Homer,i make my own turnoffs.
13656,Homer,uh... sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me.
29716,Homer,something's wrong with bart. he's acting weird.
36642,Homer,"one onion rings, please."
37810,Homer,oh.
35235,Homer,tour bus parked. gotta save marge!
33020,Homer,"marge, i can see you withholding sex or withholding cake. but withholding sexy cake? i know we have to move past this, but i don't see how."
17412,Homer,under the sea / under the sea / there'll be no accusations / just friendly crustaceans / under the sea.
25618,Homer,"sorry doesn't put thumbs on the hand, marge!"
32765,Homer,i can't believe you were smoking. do you know the sturgeon general said you're not supposed to?
19295,Homer,easy...
40193,Homer,so... someone will punch in for me.
25869,Homer,it's a little tight.
39371,Homer,"but, sir, i --"
22961,Homer,a sober irishman?
32431,Homer,i hear that.
33053,Homer,"you better settle down, boy, or i'll drag you into the blind spot of that security camera..."
37154,Homer,i'm on it.
33572,Homer,"guys, what's it like?"
33411,Homer,"oh, i get it. you're all gonna try to convince me that my life is great just like it is, right?"

36844,Homer,"no, i'm young person ""cool"" bald, not old person ""sad"" bald. i never want to see these again."
19366,Homer,"hey, who shot the auto-dialer? marge's auto-dialer?"
41139,Homer,oh noooooo!!!!
17886,Homer,"you're my last-last chance, bottom of the barrel, hail mary, long shot, wish you would do it but probably won't, final resort, to lend me money."
23831,Homer,"oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! you wonderful man!"
24572,Homer,son? daughter? i'm ever so sorry.
37486,Homer,"guys, do you think carl was right? what if we're not real friends? maybe we are just lonely guys who do... guy stuff..."
30017,Homer,may i have a word with you?
25553,Homer,your box made promises of a vacational nature. and i expect you to live up to them.
24784,Homer,i liked when i threw the pudding.
35533,Homer,why don't you come stay with us till you can get back on your feet?
34256,Homer,"carl, you're a liar, but i love it."
37709,Homer,"i don't know what it is about having all my dreams fulfilled, but i feel great."
17300,Homer,these wieners will give me the quick energy i need to escape.
29469,Homer,"boy, i can't wait to get my lips around an ice cold..."
15616,Homer,hit me.
22887,Homer,step two: snorkel the animals.
16228,Homer,"take that, vile fiend!"
40846,Homer,"huh, wha'? oh, okay."
17259,Homer,"well, it's been two long trips, but we're finally almost there, again."
29720,Homer,stupid spider... afraid of dying.
34622,Homer,it's from moe!
23183,Homer,"it's your plan, from ""braveheart."" your army mooned the enemy until they could take no more and surrendered."
20822,Homer,"but marge, we're not mass married."
41336,Homer,marge thinks flanders is annoying. this marriage just got interesting.
28091,Homer,it's not all his fault. i blame this latchkey kid.
36596,Homer,"marge... do you think maybe there's another reason you don't like this car? um... um... a ""feelings"" reason?"
14116,Homer,"so uh, how much did it go up?"
21997,Homer,"it's because they're stupid, that's why. that's why everybody does everything."
23237,Homer,"hey, i had lenny's name on that!"
26941,Homer,even dessert?

23156,Homer,piece o' cake. now where's that kid with my latte?
28813,Homer,and the peanuts in your mouth.

32319,Homer,"you have to think, it's your job!"
19195,Homer,"gee, thanks, moe... what's this?"
19616,Homer,that worked sooo well.
14734,Homer,uh... i gotta think about this.
21890,Homer,"okay, if i'm gonna be a real hippie, i have to learn from the master, mr. bob ""flower child"" hope."
23403,Homer,the sun? that's the hottest place on earth!
14316,Homer,"hey, what's up?"

21232,Homer,"take a hike, kojak."
23805,Homer,"oh, it's a great hat. no one's questioning the hat."
36469,Homer,"great, we'll take care of everything. we'll just need to borrow your punch bowl, seventeen chairs, your portable dance floor, your banner printer, banner ink, and a ream of blank banners."
14060,Homer,"as i stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, i knew i needed a drink."
20255,Homer,little lisa-a-a...
20232,Homer,two hundred dollars!
19220,Homer,"and i think it's the best idea i've ever had! we're picking up the weirdo, and that's final."
32674,Homer,even better -- a tale of ... one moment.
31116,Homer,"i love it when you're not into it. oh yeah, baby. oh yeah that's it ignore me. i'm not even here."
33486,Homer,"some friend you are. the minute you become our landlord, you expect us to pay rent. you'd better just pray i don't find out where you live!"
26479,Homer,no you can't.
34087,Homer,start the ride!
41568,Homer,i paid for her dreams / she taught me to cry / like watery knives / like rain from my eyes / i can't believe you're not mine / i can't believe you're not mine...
36591,Homer,well...
41345,Homer,"uh-oh! i'm gonna have to work on my marriage. or, alternatively..."
40505,Homer,"i knew all this stuff would come in handy some day. let's see now... ah, here it is. the complete handyman's bookshelf. volume one. spice rack."
35313,Homer,i don't know...
13818,Homer,"forget it, you two. as the pants- wearer of this house, i get the first wish."
31127,Homer,"tickets, thirty dollars! big game, everyone wants to see the game..."
37498,Homer,carl's family was even worse than people thought.
39012,Homer,"and now he's landed in our yard, on my son's bike and on our mailman's leg."
24925,Homer,"look, you can drug me all you want, but my family won't rest till they find my drug-bloated corpse."
23530,Homer,mindy and i are just hammering out a payment plan. we'll talk monday!
24734,Homer,bor-ing!
28388,Homer,"i did a lot of stuff today. i went to starbucks, but you didn't see that on tape."
37716,Homer,"so that's it? all my dreams, lived?"
30766,Homer,"wipe the blood off the windshield and get in the car, boy!"
27853,Homer,do i dare to go up? or is the love that waits behind that window just a lie?
35942,Homer,they sell some at the gas station.
33728,Homer,"ooh, lemon. that'll stop the cherry."
27081,Homer,"uh-huh. now i'm afraid that if i stop talking, i'll die. isn't mick cool? i thought he'd be all like, ""i'm a rock star. aren't i great?"" but he's just like you or me or jesus over there."
40816,Homer,"because i'm sure we were meant to be together. usually when i have a thought there's a lot of other thoughts in there. something says yes, something says no. but this time there's only yes. how could the only thing i've ever been sure about in my life be wrong?"
16135,Homer,ow. ow. ow. missed me. ow!

31883,Homer,"marge, we were just talking about it a few seconds ago."
34986,Homer,what are we doing here?
21212,Homer,"good morning, trash pile. how's about..."
37389,Homer,"calm yourselves! in times like this, there's one almighty being we can put our faith in... reverend hooper."
24535,Homer,why you little...!
16886,Homer,"plants, eh?"
30116,Homer,thanks. listen... could you do me one more favor?
28346,Homer,"well marge, if i die here, there's one thing i want you to remember: don't buy any videotapes in england. they won't work in our vcr!"
40879,Homer,seen it. seen it. seen it. seen it. ugh! soccer. seen it.
41049,Homer,"are you losing your hearing, or are you just stupid? i am going to explain this to you one more time, and then i am going to hang up on you. it is not my dog. i tied my dog outside myself. i am looking at him right --"
32118,Homer,will you shut up? i can't hear the song in my head!
15783,Homer,"ya know, i think you're right. first thing tomorrow morning, i'm gonna punch lenny in the back of the head."
20633,Homer,"attention, shoppers. register 9 is now open for your shopping convenience."
17891,Homer,it means these two fabulous babes are staying for dinner.
38042,Homer,"okay, hibbert's in surgery, but they're having him paged."
27514,Homer,so that's your answer! i'll sue the church!
17291,Homer,"fine. as long as i stand perfectly still and don't touch anything, i won't destroy the future."
26656,Homer,"whether you suffer from glaucoma, or you just rented ""the matrix,"" medical marijuana can make things fabulous. medically."
16251,Homer,"marge, this may be hard to believe, but i'm trapped inside two vending machines."
30396,Homer,okey-doke. and you are...
38040,Homer,who bought it?
39205,Homer,who shall i say is calling?
25981,Homer,oh! whoa! hemorrhage-amundo!
18739,Homer,"i don't understand thee, marge."
15200,Homer,did you see the bubble?
17637,Homer,"oh i win again, don't i? woo hoo."
33976,Homer,"watch your language, moron."
13472,Homer,"this is some way to show your gratitude. no gold. no diamonds. no rubies. not even a lousy card. wait a minute, there was a card. that's what got me so mad in the first place."
33699,Homer,"moe, this was a great thing for you. you went from sitting on the sidelines to getting in the game. and sometime when you least expect it, you'll realize that someone loved you. and that means someone can love you again. and that'll make you smile."
39870,Homer,"sounds great, although a kid can't learn much in just three months."
24591,Homer,"badger, my ass. it's probably milhouse."
28836,Homer,"marge, you destroyed my interest in weather!"
16525,Homer,boogeyman?! you nail the windows shut! i'll get the gun!
15506,Homer,and lisa...

35237,Homer,"don't look back, marge. don't look back."
32987,Homer,"this taser is awesome. finally, a practical use for electricity."
13282,Homer,i dunno.
29905,Homer,did you make enough for ray?
24852,Homer,you're it!
41036,Homer,"powerful, like a gorilla, yet soft and yielding, like a nerf ball. now, at last, i have found it."
28338,Homer,back cuts?
39983,Homer,"oh, okay. then i'll take that one there with the beady eyes."
20895,Homer,hi sweetie. i'm off to moe's. love ya.
35151,Homer,pained noises.
28707,Homer,"all right, we're back to square one. put on some coffee."
18558,Homer,"i've figured out the boy's punishment. first: he's grounded. no leaving the house, not even for school. second: no eggnog. in fact, no nog period. and third, absolutely no stealing for three months."
26013,Homer,i believe i had a hat.
32203,Homer,woo-hoo!
15583,Homer,s-s-o cold.
23505,Homer,don't push. there's plenty of tomacco for everyone.
34003,Homer,another politician who can't keep his promises.
19251,Homer,-- but they can always count on one thing: their father's unconditional love.
24380,Homer,par-ty!
24356,Homer,my way is easier.
38184,Homer,"so, why does that chick think she owns the painting?"
17219,Homer,"we don't need to do that, marge. i'm not tired. i'm not tired at all."
33270,Homer,"homer, why are you really here?"
26693,Homer,i never found true happiness until i met marge.
20165,Homer,"all right, all right. so, he's a fraud. i don't care! his mom doesn't care! do any of you care?"
23060,Homer,i don't have time for that.
29611,Homer,hm... where's lenny and carl?
28323,Homer,what? what play?
30370,Homer,"i know, and you did, and you're great."
26344,Homer,what's goin' on?

38119,Homer,oh my god! i know that kid! we've gotta help him!
37887,Homer,"more snip, less lip."
24210,Homer,looking for these? dee-dee-dee.
23616,Homer,"mag-gie. it's me, dad-dy!"
13505,Homer,"great plan, bart."
31162,Homer,thank god i brought protection.
39061,Homer,"well, not maggie."
26333,Homer,listen to all that revving!
30630,Homer,"i always thought you were, you know, ""out loud and proud."""
24492,Homer,"our favorite show was ""hollywood hogwash."" but we also loved ""the dreck squad""..."
28152,Homer,"oh my god, i've gotta save her!"
28218,Homer,that's why i don't listen to my brain. and away we go!
37628,Homer,oops.
40789,Homer,cray-on.
20965,Homer,"boy, seeing that stomach surgery made me hungry! marge, we need five thousand cc's of snacks, stat!"
22773,Homer,"yeah, just like yesterday."
23614,Homer,"lisa, honey, do you need any help with your homework?"
22031,Homer,"yeah, i guess."
26076,Homer,"ohh... geez, i just wanted to escape."
20022,Homer,"no, no. he doesn't know he's coming to dinner. i didn't think he'd come, so i called and said i had something really important to tell him and that i could only tell him about it here."
16081,Homer,then kiss my curvy butt goodbye!
18631,Homer,"well, for only five dollars you can sock it to him in style!"
32856,Homer,"hey, you're crying!"
33721,Homer,"burn, barty, burn!"

21071,Homer,oh my god! we're all gonna die!
18312,Homer,i'll take my chances in the mystery wall.
19844,Homer,look at me! i'm the prime minister of ireland!
38913,Homer,stressful. do you see how loose my tie is?
24402,Homer,look out for what?
20524,Homer,all you need is a car bomb and...
28095,Homer,"hey, these freaks do a lot of cool stuff. ""cookouts, hayrides, bowling..."""
15128,Homer,"eight o'clock... happy days. the fonz, henry winkler, is worried he's losing his cool."
24067,Homer,"what the... oh, you want a rock fight, eh?"
23014,Homer,"no, no. it's just our basement."
28845,Homer,"pleasant aroma, rich full body, well-aged... and the wine's not bad either."
29158,Homer,"no, marge, there's one group that's always welcome in america: immigrants without i.d."
31653,Homer,floor it!
15113,Homer,i'm a-comin' boy!
26504,Homer,fine.
14384,Homer,i used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. now it's the smell of victory.
29809,Homer,"sure, they're on top of the world. then there's a big riot scene. then i don't know, i usually doze off."
14135,Homer,fifty-two hundred dollars? what are you talking about?
40918,Homer,find a husband? which one's selma again?
31793,Homer,kids. they always say they're not tired when they're the most tired of all.
35048,Homer,a dinosaur!
37703,Homer,do you have a disrespectful son who calls you by your first name?
32321,Homer,what?! name twelve.
22136,Homer,do you have a table for the mayor?
26860,Homer,the missus prefers you call me simpson.
14398,Homer,"but marge, she never loses. she's got a gift. aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent?"
28380,Homer,birds!
31840,Homer,hilarious joke?
40494,Homer,because that way you'll see what it's like to witness a family member stupidly risking his life for no good reason.
17136,Homer,"don't worry, buddy. here's a quarter. call for help at the nearest phone... i'll keep an eye on things here."
14197,Homer,"well, girls i mean i mean boys. i, i mean you!"
13704,Homer,daddly-doodly.
25369,Homer,"ah, it doesn't mean anything. it's like ""rama-lama ding dong"" or ""give peace a chance""."
37075,Homer,"kids, there's nothing to worry about...but we're looking at replacements for your mom and me if we should fail to die together as a family."
32235,Homer,"who could it be? a disgruntled former employee? whoever it is, the cobra is their symbol."
39110,Homer,"marge, i'm sorry i was proud of myself."
22919,Homer,"now if you want to be the life of the party like lenny here, just place your order for this hilarious novelty item."
25318,Homer,"no. no. stay away from my wife, bart."
38632,Homer,"marge likes sushi, i like gum that squirts in your mouth. she's into romantic comedies, i like movies where there's only one day a year when murder is legal. yep, marge and i see the world in totally different ways."
36421,Homer,"you're right, marge. i lied."
25267,Homer,"hey, this was a lot of fun, guys."
35079,Homer,can't lose that. it's the best picture of me i have.
15371,Homer,"no, we won't. i've got it all figured out. the baby can have bart's crib and bart can sleep with us until he's 21!"
25378,Homer,am i ever!
31291,Homer,"nag, nag, nag."
39843,Homer,"there she is! hey, princess! it's me, the guy from the snap shot!"
24550,Homer,"well, the thing about that is..."
30684,Homer,"uh... you know it's a boat, right?"
22772,Homer,i didn't say stop.
38609,Homer,and all those new workers are gonna want to spend their earnings buying what you're selling: beer.
24235,Homer,"that was amazing, moe. i'm actually a little turned on."
33768,Homer,i did it! i helped my son! helicopter homer away!

36669,Homer,"look at that, a man's whole life being kicked around on the floor."
20435,Homer,"except you, you and you."
39441,Homer,bart! lisa! maggie!
32764,Homer,i can't believe how easy it is in this country to get cigarettes.
33950,Homer,"okay, now i'll be the dog and you be the daddy."
29908,Homer,oh thank god. where is he? tell me!
19170,Homer,"yesss, they are a clever bunch. i know, i'll squeal for you. to their parents."
38963,Homer,"...did i say graham crackers?... chocolate, marshmallows, sticks, fire..."
24638,Homer,"oh, that was fifty already?"
39377,Homer,"moe, i think i'll have another -- -- whoops. moe, i'm a little low on funds. you think could cover me just this once?"
25779,Homer,uh... for frosty chocolate milkshakes. frosty chocolate milkshakes!
24985,Homer,"oh, right, the magic. the magic was great. it's really... the way to go."
35418,Homer,awww...
40286,Homer,phfft. you'll make new and better friends.
16154,Homer,"don't worry, boy. he'll be ready for your aunt selma's birthday."
16302,Homer,woo hoo!

36042,Homer,"yeah. we're like family to you. i'm talking to you, headphone-bus driver guy."
32913,Homer,no...
33984,Homer,"uh, moe, i have a confession to make: i'm just homer dressed as marge."
35784,Homer,bo-ring.
28151,Homer,i'll get our little passports.
22424,Homer,"that's the way max power is, marge. decisive, uncompromising, and rude."
35774,Homer,i thought you were retiring. why are you still here?
40951,Homer,a half-brother?
17653,Homer,quiet. i will not hear another word against the boat.
35453,Homer,why you undead little...!
35806,Homer,you're not a client. you're the client.
19661,Homer,sorry.
27890,Homer,"but it was marge. my first and only love. i'm like david spade without chris farley, alone and useless!"
32574,Homer,see? that's where my memory stops. who the heck is that guy?
18777,Homer,"uh-huh, uh-huh, okay. um, can you repeat the part of the stuff where you said all about the things? the things?"
26386,Homer,woo hoo!
13875,Homer,no.
29669,Homer,i just don't understand what the problem is.
32366,Homer,at your funeral.
30319,Homer,"hey, since we've got the kids with us, why don't we all take a few days of much-needed r and r?"
19665,Homer,might i add -- no fat chicks.
35417,Homer,"i love your low prices, but why did these weddings get cancelled?"
33155,Homer,"i know we'll get married someday, and to prove it, i'll carve our names on this tree so all who are hopelessly lost in the woods can see it."
39621,Homer,no.
19109,Homer,wowww.
29476,Homer,"thanks, honey. my mind is completely at ease."
13379,Homer,oh.
28599,Homer,i could quit now... but then my son will never look up to me. why was i born a dad?
38418,Homer,mmmm--
21869,Homer,"pretty good, huh?"
35714,Homer,"yeah, why should the asteroid have all the fun?"

30227,Homer,"welcome to the jungle, kevin!"
24150,Homer,"oh, yes. very much so."
18276,Homer,that's it. go to your room.
13599,Homer,"oh, marge. cartoons don't have any deep meaning. they're just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh."
38251,Homer,it was pity-fridged!
25356,Homer,"oh, yeah, uh, i was at the flower shop today, too. yup, gettin' drunk at the ol' flower shop."
38999,Homer,"ha-ha! stupid eagle! it wasn't the mouse we were after, it was you! marge! preheat the oven!"
41115,Homer,"well... sure. we'll have to move a chair in from the den, but it's no problem. bart!"
30927,Homer,"woo hoo! i win! in your face, best friends!"
38556,Homer,why do these things happen to innocent victims? i was just about to become a million dollar crotch model!

38812,Homer,next year... this is... your job.
22330,Homer,"yeah, they're good. but i wouldn't count out the... denver broncos ."
21357,Homer,"""last entry. i have mountaineered to the utmost, but the peak is unclimbable. worse still, that treacherous skunk abe simpson stole my oxygen, and tried to eat my left arm."""
18622,Homer,the guy who doesn't live there.
32165,Homer,"you'd think so, but no."
17646,Homer,"you were right, lisa. i've never felt so spiritually fulfilled. and with my brothers, the stonecutters, behind me, this is the beginning of a better world for all of us."
23452,Homer,you little scamp.
39423,Homer,"but, don't worry. i've just been appointed the new safety inspector at this very plant...with a big fat raise!"
36521,Homer,it didn't feel like success.
16647,Homer,"don't forget to say ""i didn't do it""."
17603,Homer,"hey, have you ever noticed that the ""crossing the desert"" is a lot like ""the unblinking eye"" and it's exactly like ""the wreck of the hesperus""?"
32927,Homer,i'm safe as long as nothing disturbs this incredibly delicate balance.
26655,Homer,'cause we need to keep medical marijuana legal!
20838,Homer,"i can't make it in today, mr. smithers. i have smallpox... well, it wasn't wiped out in my house."
37638,Homer,this is the song that you hear at the circus / sung by a guy that you see at the circus...
39017,Homer,so do you get satellite radio cheaper in space?
17121,Homer,"ah...there's nothing like rising with the sun for a quiet, peaceful dip in your very own pool."
40554,Homer,well... i dunno... you and i might have different ideas about just how big a big cash settlement is.
31479,Homer,yeah. how'd you afford this kick-ass party?
35809,Homer,oh no you don't.
31592,Homer,which of the twenty-five easy-listening stations should we listen to?
30721,Homer,"boy, you don't need to cheat when you got a system."

27863,Homer,"you guys lead a fascinating life. like, why are you reading the new york times? you don't live in new york."
34686,Homer,"oh, can't a guy rush home from work to see his beautiful--"
32794,Homer,"kids, marriage is like a car. along the way it has its bumps and dings, and this country can't make one that lasts more than five years. with lurleen i just walked past the showroom and didn't even go inside. now let's return to watching the news."

37187,Homer,there's always a catch.
13548,Homer,arrghh!
13736,Homer,"a job's a job. i mean, take me. if my plant pollutes the water and poisons the town, by your logic that would make me a criminal."
29901,Homer,of course we are! if you wanna be.

16319,Homer,"all right, all right! i'll get rid of the trampoline!"
31703,Homer,"all those years i was dreaming of other things, i was actually doing what i really wanted... hanging out with my family, drinking with my friends, making friends with my family, and hanging with my drinking!"

37992,Homer,marge...
22445,Homer,"no way, this guy's a winner. he has a company that makes computers, or a computer that makes companies... anyway, you wouldn't understand."
27263,Homer,if we formed a club we could serve drinks.
17150,Homer,"never! never, marge! i can't live the buttoned-down life like you. i want it all: the terrifying lows, the dizzying highs, the creamy middles. sure i might offend a few of the bluenoses with my cocky-stride and musky odors. oh, i'll never be the darling of the so called ""city fathers"" who cluck their tongues, stroke their beards, and talk about what's to be done with this homer simpson."
29081,Homer,permission to treat this witness as hostile.
33567,Homer,"fair enough! kids, let's practice."
30323,Homer,stamps? those are for snail mail! stamps rule! i mean suck!

23842,Homer,"come on, loosen up. this is paradise."
18170,Homer,"guess what, kids. they're gonna pay us fifty dollars a day to film some of the movie here."
19083,Homer,"oh, why won't anybody believe my crazy story?"
33806,Homer,"yes! yes! in your face, losers! this helicopter is taking off!"
31545,Homer,"oh marge, i'm sure it was just some guy filled with hate."
20851,Homer,"uh, this industry moves so fast, it's really hard to tell. that's why i need a name that's cutting edge, like cutco... or edgecom... interslice... come on, marge -- you're good at these. help me out."
14238,Homer,"dear marge, xxx. homer."
28954,Homer,"okay, we'll go to the convention, sell my lois lane comics, buy some jimmy olsens, and stop edna from making a terrible mistake!"
24214,Homer,"all right, guys. one, two, three."
27709,Homer,"you're preaching to the choir, man."
22042,Homer,"i love you, dad."
39499,Homer,why you...
19475,Homer,"look at these records! jim nabors, glen campbell, the doodletown pipers! now look at her records... they stink! maybe i had that crazy dream for a reason..."

31191,Homer,it'll do for now.
30380,Homer,"now featuring the pox box! pox box not recommended for pregnant or nursing women. like any disease box, results may vary. pox box!"
25139,Homer,"i've decided to disintermediate the local authorities, and send it straight to the nuclear regulatory commission."
18108,Homer,"all right guys, pipe down. i've got some more in the garage."
41143,Homer,"four hundred and thirty-seven. fifty-five. oh my god, three hundred and... hey, a hundred and fifty. oh god, it's two hundred and sixty pounds! i'm a big fat pig."
25422,Homer,oh.
41232,Homer,"i thought this thing was going to be catered. boy, am i hungry. i mean i'm really, really hungry."
35509,Homer,wha?!
39840,Homer,"you see, i'm trying to teach my son here about treating woman as objects."
33770,Homer,"lisa, i found this book in the ""what's wrong with my daughter"" section of the bookstore."
26450,Homer,nice old man. don't break a hip.

31928,Homer,because i'm filled with stress!
13240,Homer,see? you don't have to spend a lot of money to have a first-class wedding reception.

40166,Homer,"marge, she's right."
20883,Homer,impeach churchill!
34225,Homer,"son, if i was interested in fun, i would've run away the day you were born."
38856,Homer,this is so fake.
16275,Homer,you kids do need a baby-sitter.
36992,Homer,i've hidden all our supplies behind a fake wall.
29634,Homer,"oh lord, please help me say the right words this afternoon, as i consecrate another gay union that angers you so."
32870,Homer,"well, this is kind of a cute outfit."
31086,Homer,"you just walked away from the sweetest, most beautiful woman a guy could want. in ten years she never had the last slice of pizza and she's never complained. every election, she wishes she could vote for both guys, because they both seem nice. and there's a light inside her that makes everyone else look better. and you blew her off."
38407,Homer,"you know, i have more cheeks."
15214,Homer,"yeah, lemonade is good."
22582,Homer,"oh, no! she's not gonna make it!"
19340,Homer,i wanted to surprise you with a kicky summer 'do. how many husbands would do that for their wives?
14477,Homer,"listen, marge, uh, how would you feel if i told you the dog ran away?"

30084,Homer,"when the time comes, we won't be in our homes...because we're all gonna go here."
34069,Homer,"i hate traffic -- the band, and the phenomenon!"
30893,Homer,"i see. well, i should be getting to the living room..."
26194,Homer,"okay, family huddle."

26502,Homer,"hm, ""homer's odyssey."" is this about that mini-van i rented once?"
28877,Homer,can i have some peanuts?
20381,Homer,anyone else want a beer?
33621,Homer,"marge, this time i'm going to give you the wedding you deserve. let's get out of here!"
20193,Homer,"oh, it's beautiful! oh! oh, let's put bart's beautiful drawing up on the fridge!"
25566,Homer,"now, honey, poachers are nature's way of keeping the balance. whenever there are so many species that people get confused and angry, a poacher is born."
34767,Homer,"what is it? lenny, i'm on a second honeymoon. you'll have to pick your own lotto numbers. now, where were we?"
18539,Homer,"no it doesn't, it's funny. their clothes are different from my clothes. look at what they're wearin'."

31894,Homer,pay to the order of... stupid reverend... memo: bite my ass ... wha?!
15694,Homer,woo hoo!
18257,Homer,"but all normal people love meat. if i went to a barbecue and there was no meat, i would say, ""yo, goober! where's the meat?"" i'm trying to impress people here, lisa. you don't win friends with salad."
24537,Homer,this'll be the last season.
31364,Homer,"dudes! wanna make some extra spending money? get a free pair of boots? hey baby, you like obstacle courses?"
14234,Homer,"look what i got, marge, a baby monitor."
16198,Homer,flanders! you're the devil?
23274,Homer,"no, no, you're right. it's a joke. everyone laugh at the funny joke . i'll be right back with the real review."
36968,Homer,"preppies? oh, i hate you guys! always partying on deck with your docksiders while us townies are scrubbing the bilge!"
20502,Homer,but you can't leave! we're scammin' an old lady at my house and i need a place to hide out.
37268,Homer,i didn't know you were left-handed.
17356,Homer,i asked for ketchup. i'm eating salad here.
32380,Homer,"hop in, bart, they're gonna let us kill one!"
40971,Homer,"h! of course. that could stand for herbert! it's a long shot, but..."
38033,Homer,"well, as long as i'm paying for the time..."
13354,Homer,so i said: i must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini.
19848,Homer,"glad you're finally back in business, moe."
14069,Homer,"well, it's called a ""flaming..."
27077,Homer,woo! std's!
36139,Homer,why you little...
36268,Homer,fine. don't get your circuits in a bunch.
40853,Homer,"oh, great... all right, what makes you say that?"
24530,Homer,"it was the best thanksgiving ever. i mean, emotionally, it was terrible. but the turkey was so moist."
29935,Homer,"so, ray does exist?!"
29837,Homer,"stupid flounders. hey, i've got a great idea. we'll find some new lady friends."
21153,Homer,i had no idea.
35068,Homer,"marge, not in front of the refrigerator."
39381,Homer,you think you can still do that kind of work?
16209,Homer,woo hoo! ow!

21042,Homer,nu-cue-lar. it's pronounced nu-cue-lar.
21007,Homer,"you know lisa, i've taken a lot from this country. maybe it's time i gave something back."
22236,Homer,"but ginger, honey, i am not the catch i appear to be."
24293,Homer,disgracefully hilarious! you passed out before we could even give you your presents.
18521,Homer,aha!
36585,Homer,i'll get right on it.
23071,Homer,"oh, of course. you're right. you know, i read about a shinto tea house where they practice the traditional... run, bart!"
13567,Homer,"oh great! and uh, try to put a good face on this. tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight."

37093,Homer,now i can finally complete my bucket list.
40600,Homer,"if i said no the first time, what makes you think i'm gonna say yes the second time?"
29589,Homer,"hollywood producers have paid me a fortune, which i've already lost, for the rights to bart's story. so i have to destroy anything that proves that story's not true."
18985,Homer,"oh, i get it."
13911,Homer,of course.
20347,Homer,i thought smithers did it.

25448,Homer,hey kid and man!
28573,Homer,"for more information, visit our website, www.al-jazeera.com. we're not affiliated. we're just piggybacking on their message board."
15155,Homer,oh yeah. the trick is to say you're prejudiced against all races.
25520,Homer,babies of springfield! we need your help! please! skin your knees! put dice up your nose! let cats sleep on your face!
39481,Homer,"boxing, lisa, boxing. there's a world of difference."

20339,Homer,yuh.
21560,Homer,"no, i don't deserve sugar. i'm halfway to my grave, and i haven't accomplished anything. oh, i am not looking forward to my funeral."
29372,Homer,it's el flanderito! run him down!
27229,Homer,where's that kid with my latte?!
16942,Homer,the boot kicked bart. it kicked him right in the butt.
16063,Homer,i hate that lousy dean!
18365,Homer,woo hoo! four more pounds and my dream comes true: working at home...
22344,Homer,"uh-oh. lateral, to bart!"
23661,Homer,"now, this situation is guaranteed to end in pregnancy."
26084,Homer,just a little more.
31397,Homer,"oh honey, don't cry. they're not made from real bears -- just their fur and noses!"
30573,Homer,"oh, come on, honey, you have lots of friends. there's, uh... lisa and...the stove."
16478,Homer,"oh. something's missing. ooh, one of the turkeys fell behind the bed."

37506,Homer,"and when he brings a six-pack to my house, he doesn't take the extras home with him. carl carlson leaves them in the fridge."
38463,Homer,out of my reach? must... make... effort...
22149,Homer,the force?!
23582,Homer,"eww, thanks for sharing!"
19696,Homer,"hey, this is homer simpson sayin'-- i don't sound like that, do i? oh, i don't like having such a hilarious voice."
24643,Homer,woo hoo!
18383,Homer,i pity those poor suckers on the freeway. gas-brake-honk. gas-brake-honk. honk-honk-punch. gas-gas-gas.
27766,Homer,no deal!
28870,Homer,"aw, this is a new low for me."
26732,Homer,"ah, nothing can make me mad out here."
37947,Homer,marge and i get along perfect. we're like george burns and john denver.
23302,Homer,i've given out my share of bad reviews.
23286,Homer,whatever. i'll be at moe's.

21835,Homer,"okay, okay, it was me. i'm sorry i blew your secret. but you don't know what it's like to be a nobody. i just wanted to bask in your reflected glory. reflected glory!"
31385,Homer,"there once was a rapping tomato / that's right, i said rapping tomato / he rapped all day / from april to may / and also, guess what, it was me."
41269,Homer,that cactus is right. i've only got one chance. i got to knock him out.
31845,Homer,well i'm throwing you both out of the game!
18149,Homer,what?

39979,Homer,"well, don't just stand there, boy. help miss botz with her suitcases."
34130,Homer,"marge, my brain is like a computer, and i file away grampa's stories in a very special place."

19690,Homer,"i'm sure we will, honey."
32149,Homer,"if i'm gonna tell that woman the truth, i'm gonna do it in the one place no one can ever be sad."
33754,Homer,"marge, where have you been?"
27291,Homer,you're so smart. shock him.

36113,Homer,you let this monster into our home! where he chewed through our one and only phone cord!
25107,Homer,point of order: i didn't lose all the money. there was enough left for this cowbell.
32838,Homer,"since the dawn of parking lots, man has sought to stuff his guts with food and alcohol in anticipation of watching others exercise. what childbirth is to women, eating trunk meats is to the be-wanged."
13586,Homer,here he is! here's the guy you wanna see.
33702,Homer,"and now, you're gonna visit your grampa while i park around the corner and take a nap."
15415,Homer,"here, bart, you can hold my beer."
15358,Homer,"yeah, tell it, mom."
13327,Homer,"oh son, when you're older, you'll know better."
20700,Homer,"the experts say that if you want an animal to do something, you should do it yourself first to show him how."
23192,Homer,"how did the country lose its way, mel? when did we stop rooting for the man with the flame-thrower, or an acid-spraying gun of some kind?"
16594,Homer,"aw, people can come up with statistics to prove anything, kent. forty percent of all people know that."
14484,Homer,you're not going anywhere.
16877,Homer,"lisa, go to your room."
23454,Homer,that's my girl. let the agriculture begin!
31273,Homer,the truth is that i'm perfect and everything i touch is perfect!
26956,Homer,"yeah, you can kill me, but someone'll take my place. and if you kill him, someone'll take his place. and that's pretty much the end of it. the town'll be yours."
27912,Homer,his wife is dead!
29511,Homer,"dammit! i never win anything! ooh, here's something i'm good at."
18029,Homer,do you have a better idea?

25571,Homer,"a hungry, hungry hippo!"
14652,Homer,"oooh, there's a good one."
32160,Homer,vanderbilt?
17921,Homer,"stupid driving test at the stupid dmv where stupid patty and stupid selma work. sometimes i think god is teasing me, just like he teased moses in the desert."
19284,Homer,no! i only learned that four days ago.
19573,Homer,"uh, your fish are dead."
13544,Homer,bart! shut up or i'll shut you up!
30617,Homer,let me check the navigation system...
33025,Homer,"well, you'll never take me alive!"
32272,Homer,i'm not sure my wife will go for these naughty mud flaps.
29900,Homer,what's in the box?
30844,Homer,"and now i'm using sarcasm to confess the whole thing, so later i can say that i already told you."
20772,Homer,"all right, better put on a pot of coffee, marge. this could take a while."
33649,Homer,just see that my fiancée marge gets this -- my wedding vows.
30208,Homer,"log cabin full of taste, my stomach is with thee. blessed art thou among syrups and..."
32476,Homer,then it was all a dream. i never became a hideous monster.
35732,Homer,the caper is writing a kids' fantasy novel.

31287,Homer,if i can keep down arby's i can keep down you!
34522,Homer,"no, ice cold."
30119,Homer,"wait! before you go, there's one thing i gotta know. what happened to my family?"
31618,Homer,"ooh, a penny!"
40456,Homer,"marge, you're a genius."
14464,Homer,maggie?
36673,Homer,"or a spy from a rival gang! hey, what are you doin'?"
29917,Homer,"flanders, you saw ray on the roof with me!"
16600,Homer,"listen, mr. cat burglar, i vow to go without sleep and guard the springfield museum day and night for as long as it takes, from now on unless you want to taunt me more by giving me an approximate time."
21944,Homer,"hang in there, son. i'm taking us out for our traditional sunday brunch."
35355,Homer,selma? va-va-va-wha?!
33003,Homer,now i believe you.
31219,Homer,beware of el taco belly!
28590,Homer,i can make a bike. i made you.
19809,Homer,"y'know, bart, maybe it's just the concussion talking, but any way you choose to live your life is okay with me."
31583,Homer,the hell we are!
22718,Homer,"uh, yeah. i need something that'll keep me awake, alert, and reckless all night long."
38045,Homer,"all right, son... but you have to pay me back."
19242,Homer,"what... but... marge, it's broad daylight and there's cops everywhere!"
15411,Homer,i like those odds.
21090,Homer,will you look at those morons? i paid my taxes over a year ago.
37302,Homer,"marge, i thought this was an innocuous lunch but it's become terribly ocuous."
17031,Homer,"oh, and how is ""education"" supposed to make me feel smarter? besides, every time i learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. remember when i took that home wine making course and i forgot how to drive?"
24061,Homer,then i insist on walking you home.
34532,Homer,months?
35918,Homer,it's still a great honor!
35884,Homer,you make us beg for a filthy pillow that a barnyard rat wouldn't curl up and die in! and watch pre-taped messages that make crashing look like fun!
24998,Homer,we'll be safe here.
29590,Homer,what shirt? i don't see any shirt.
35702,Homer,"ouch, this place is fancy."
23727,Homer,"hello, police? can you send a swat team to 742 evergreen ter..."
39603,Homer,oooh! credit.
20773,Homer,"come on now, just a little more. little more to the left... to the left there. what did he do this thing? almost... ahhhhhhhhh"
36724,Homer,will you stop saying things that'll make me have to do something?
31523,Homer,"marge, admit it -- you just can't say ""no"" to anyone. that's why you have three kids."
15487,Homer,who are you donating them to?
30718,Homer,you made that tv show really mad.
27813,Homer,hey! these two pieces were already connected -- we're halfway there!
39303,Homer,"all right, look everybody. i have a confession to make."
24095,Homer,"oh-ho-ho-ho, that's great. chicks really dig sensitivity. did you get that, bart?"
13368,Homer,they're holding it at catfish lake. they couldn't call it catfish lake if it didn't have a catfish in it.
19250,Homer,"i'm a father myself, sir. and sure, sometimes my kids can be obnoxious... or boring... or stinky --"
16480,Homer,it's a sign!
31331,Homer,you? don't make me laugh! you couldn't--
17122,Homer,yaaarr--ewwwwwww!!
34732,Homer,"hide a sandwich in this hat. ""mary poppins"" myself to work with this umbrella."
26397,Homer,monkeys cry.
21537,Homer,"dear lord, i know you're busy, seeing as how you can watch women changing clothes and all that. but if you help us steal this grease tonight, i promise we'll donate half the profits to charity."
32546,Homer,"what happened in this room? if only these walls could talk... people would pay to come see my amazing talking walls. and i could use that money to-- hey, a memory!"
24098,Homer,"oh, wake up, ned. you think maude isn't dating in heaven?"
41275,Homer,"no, no! he'll know you're on to him -- quick, shake his hand!"
13934,Homer,no! no!
16126,Homer,"look, the important thing is that we all learned a lesson. these guys learned the richness and variety of the world outside college."
23349,Homer,"relax, i'm fine. but when i do die, i don't want any autopsies."
28319,Homer,that was over soccer results! can you believe they gave giggs a yellow card in the box?
23316,Homer,"so come to the legless frog... if you want to get sick and die, and leave a big, garlicky corpse. p.s. parking was ample."
38894,Homer,"sex mate? clearly you've never been married. but it's great, i'm telling you."

19416,Homer,"okay, quit naggin' me. i won't have any beer. geez, why don't you have a cigarette or something?"
25768,Homer,"please let me win this, lord. 'cause if you don't..."
25142,Homer,"effigy, eh? yeah, nothing burns like an effigy. hey, that's me!"
25531,Homer,"y'know, i always felt sorry for marge, having to do the shopping, but this is kind of fun."
22084,Homer,neeerrrds!
20892,Homer,don't worry. daddy'll fix it.
38677,Homer,what the?
24780,Homer,"a laugh? okay, let's see, what's in the news today?..."
32889,Homer,well i'm not going to digest it!
28686,Homer,"well, then maybe i will."

21227,Homer,"why you little... no one's gonna beat ya, son. you're gonna get such a beating."
38766,Homer,you know what? apu leaving is the best thing that ever happened to this band. we're gonna be like genesis after peter gabriel left.
26355,Homer,uh huh.
19658,Homer,"wait a minute, marge. i saw mrs. doubtfire. this is a man in drag!"
14344,Homer,"oooh, that's a big lock all right. i just don't trust that guy."
38469,Homer,"yeah, yeah, great. i guess my getting-up days are over."
26756,Homer,mm-hmm!
40841,Homer,"don't worry, marge. take a look at this."
13523,Homer,exactly. it's just a bunch of stuff that happened.
15921,Homer,lobooo...
26867,Homer,"now if you'll excuse us, we'll just be... does that ever work?"
39395,Homer,"ladies and gentlemen, esteemed councilmen, boys and girls, retired people with nothing better to do. danger comes in many, many forms, from the dinosaurs that tormented our cavemen ancestors to the --"

29992,Homer,here's a corner.
13204,Homer,"it hurts! it hurts so bad! please, just put one in my brain!"
15061,Homer,"no, she won't. when it comes to compliments, women are ravenous, blood-sucking monsters, always wantin' more, more! more! and if you give it to 'em, you'll get plenty back in return."
34779,Homer,it was poisoned.
33634,Homer,"no matter what i do, marge yells at me. if she's like this now, what will she be like after we get married?"
15231,Homer,"ooh, me too."
38387,Homer,"let them play! we won't look, we'll turn away / go make love, then eat some hay..."
35808,Homer,"mr. burns, i can't go rafting with you because-- wait a minute, could this all work?"
27671,Homer,"it's just an expression, marge."
22004,Homer,"what the heck is this, a tea party? somebody kill somebody!"
36120,Homer,"boy, get out of that cage!"
39192,Homer,is it even cheating?
17276,Homer,must kill family. .
15258,Homer,"no, that's not it. what's his name? the man of la mancha."
21585,Homer,"well, i remember where edison worked. it was menlo park. that's where he came up with the tasimeter, the ore separator and..."
25860,Homer,what'd she say about cupcakes?
28293,Homer,i'm not driving forty-five minutes a day! you can't go to that school!
24226,Homer,"yeah, but just for a minute. it's a funny story; i'll tell you sometime."

17383,Homer,"wait a minute. wait a minute. where's my gummy de milo? okay, don't panic. she can't have gotten far; she has no arms."
20267,Homer,"die, you chalk-faced goons!"
19141,Homer,any sugar around here?
36101,Homer,"you would do that? oh my god, this might be a marge's birthday where i get sex!"
29923,Homer,sorry. give me one that doesn't taste so good.
32474,Homer,noooo!
25803,Homer,i'll meet you in wilmington.
26979,Homer,"i'll take it from here, fake-o."
18298,Homer,don't you ever get tired of being wrong all the time?
27689,Homer,"oh my darling, nothing is too romantic for you. have some more liquor."
19136,Homer,"oh, the hammock district."
40747,Homer,"dad, i'm in love."
14684,Homer,homer j. simpson.
22192,Homer,you gotta live down here.
30547,Homer,"well, there's my x-ray vision, my fire breath... and i can get big laughs with tennis balls."
21347,Homer,the hell i won't. you're forgetting i've got my power sauce bars.
39195,Homer,no deal!
40869,Homer,promise me.
15934,Homer,he's dead now.
29262,Homer,how 'bout cooking up some money because this stupid kitchen cost a hundred thousand dollars.
29504,Homer,think of me babe whenever / some sweet talking guy in a thong / hands you a bong / don't take...
18264,Homer,it's just a little dirty -- it's still good! it's still good!
40520,Homer,i didn't know they still made tv dinners this bad.
39410,Homer,"sorry, no can do!"
22562,Homer,so... lying on the couch and eating stuff isn't the same if you aren't around to see it.
32172,Homer,i wanna say one.
32735,Homer,"but kids, i want you in bed by three a.m."
15143,Homer,just promise me you'll try to be good.
38364,Homer,why you little! i'll teach you to answer peoples' prayers!
19607,Homer,"uh, i lost my map."
20246,Homer,good.
24386,Homer,wooo! i like mu-sic!
18715,Homer,"i just won't say anything, okay, honey?"
20972,Homer,we'll tape it!
33843,Homer,marge! i'm glad you came. there's a kegger down the hall. we can go as soon as i desecrate this corpse.
38155,Homer,this dude gets it.
31644,Homer,avenge me. in flamboyant impractical fashion.
35299,Homer,what the?!
19539,Homer,thanks! i'd love an omelet right about now.
35487,Homer,"flanders, hold up!"
34810,Homer,"back off, you unholy dreamboat!"
16729,Homer,boring.
17514,Homer,"i'd like a beer, please."
25702,Homer,i think ned is gonna be all right...
24808,Homer,"shh-shh, the grownups are talking, honey."
22574,Homer,oh no. i'm out of popcorn.
21866,Homer,it's the job of tomorrow... today!
41350,Homer,"it's poison! whatever you do, don't eat it."
38658,Homer,my ears are burning.
25970,Homer,"hey, where'd that painting come from?"
23459,Homer,go get lassie.
23701,Homer,will you teach me?
19176,Homer,yes!
20598,Homer,nothin' but.
26746,Homer,stop it now.
14575,Homer,yes.
23457,Homer,and... there.
21911,Homer,"never fear, the cosmic fool is here to blow the lid off your conformist, button-down world!"
26171,Homer,no problem. there's plenty of activities inside.
37860,Homer,but christmas is a special time. and i like to spend it in the warm embrace of watching football.
35731,Homer,"come on beautiful, i can't do the job without you, so what do you say?"
24944,Homer,see you on the island.
37690,Homer,you only live once.
27987,Homer,"all right, you're not a coward. and that's beside the point because--"
37549,Homer,you think we'll last twenty-five years?
28269,Homer,"last week's garbage. i missed the pick-up date. but it doesn't matter, because my mom is alive. see?"
30774,Homer,i paid for fifty laps and i'm gonna take them!
28493,Homer,"doing pretty good so far. a key ring for marge, key ring for bart..."
20667,Homer,"relax, marge. this'll all blow over."
31619,Homer,this is my lucky day.
37014,Homer,hm. i cut the wires to something.
20063,Homer,"well, i know one thing in this world that's still pure and good."
36044,Homer,"now, now, now just a second here! now, i know we're not perfect. but, uh, i believe it was sammy hagar who said--"
34009,Homer,"i think the better brains is, are you brains a brains?"
14953,Homer,you bet your sweet... ass!
16952,Homer,"bart, you listen."
21572,Homer,"no one man can do all that. you're a liar, honey. a dirty, rotten liar."
19735,Homer,"i practically insist. shall we say, 5 o'clock? the snacking hour?"
40759,Homer,my name's homer simpson. i'd like to sign up for something.
21301,Homer,"no, i mean it. i'm really serious this time."
13651,Homer,"what is it, boy? what? mmmmmmmm... bar-b-que."
14925,Homer,so what time does this play start?
13712,Homer,"oh, flanders, i, uh, want to give you your stuff back."
22061,Homer,that's the last time i trust the strangest people on earth.
13266,Homer,"behold, as i slept, your uncle claudius poured poison in my ear... poison most foul...so he could marry your mother and become the king."
40391,Homer,"good morning, son! oh, by the way, today's the day of the big tournament, and you'd better win!"
31827,Homer,...our duties as firemen.
14709,Homer,i make a lot of stupid decisions...
23301,Homer,"for you, perhaps."
31354,Homer,"not that army, the one from ""stripes!"""
40156,Homer,"that should just about do it. man alive, there's nothing better than a hamburger grilled to perfection..."
34324,Homer,"yeah, right."
35547,Homer,"well, i suppose if the friend was being horribly tortured..."
31555,Homer,"all night long, baby."
39098,Homer,"excuse me, pardon me, coming through."
27312,Homer,don't be so sure. i've got my legs wrapped around your ass pretty tight.
15665,Homer,happy... valentine's day!
37571,Homer,"hello, everyone."
27695,Homer,"well, my special mix tape will get you going."
24984,Homer,what in the hell are you talking about?
31107,Homer,"oh, no you don't!"
38113,Homer,"uh, okay! um... i can't."
33978,Homer,"we've gotta get marge some professional training. carl, do you know heavyweight champ drederick tatum?"
31040,Homer,when will marge remember us?
19841,Homer,"give me the drugs, lisa."
35213,Homer,yes! will i get to meet dave?
38751,Homer,i still want one.
17685,Homer,"from now on we use regular toilet paper, not that fancy quilted kind..."
32363,Homer,"i was out getting drunk, then killing people!"
29736,Homer,"way ahead of you, marge -- i just ordered a series of tapes on saving money. they should get here soon. i paid a bundle for over-night delivery."
32143,Homer,"stop saying ""security""!"
14718,Homer,a coupla times.
29718,Homer,hmmm. seems a shame to chuck out these cross-country skis. i'll keep one.
40263,Homer,"all right, burnsie."
24424,Homer,...knock you out...
18785,Homer,the accounting department is located on the third floor. its hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. the head of this department is a mr. johnson or johnstone.
21142,Homer,i'm gonna write the best darn article... oh wait.
17532,Homer,not everybody.
36847,Homer,"i have a plan to deal with that. step one: change everything about ourselves until we are super cool, the end."
25938,Homer,cops!
35278,Homer,"well, for one thing, you're never really ready to be a father. but, oh, you know, the other day, bart, the little dickens, said i had an elephant butt. so anyway, i'm strangling him, and i said to bart..."
26594,Homer,"hey, bart. how many more places do we have to search?"
22514,Homer,"will you stop it?! it's easy to blame ourselves, but it's even easier to blame apu. he's makin' us look bad!"
20033,Homer,would you like to see my grammy award?
23453,Homer,absolutely. this is our big chance. the simpsons will be reborn as a bunch of gap-toothed bumpkins.
18874,Homer,"what's wrong, honey?"
34148,Homer,what? pulitzer prize application form?
33992,Homer,"well, we're not going out to help him. we have no idea what hideous creatures might be out there!"
40334,Homer,one for the road.
23000,Homer,"oh, that's great, honey. you tell me everything you can before the commercial's over."
27780,Homer,what are you doin'?
14148,Homer,"oh, marge, i'm gonna be fired. i know it."
25032,Homer,let's see how this plays out.
32749,Homer,who could have done this?!
20639,Homer,can - we - skip - church?
14557,Homer,you play right field.
13297,Homer,"bart didn't get one vote?! oh, this is the worst thing that ever happened to us. alright, allright, spilled milk, spilled milk, spilled milk. what are you so mopey about?"
15424,Homer,just workin' the turkey through. there it goes!
21474,Homer,they didn't hear us in the sewing room.
26542,Homer,we are not paying this bill.
32704,Homer,i'll have you know i love this car as if it was my own child.
24426,Homer,"you know, killing that gator was the best decision i ever made."
24868,Homer,beautiful. we have confirmation.
14837,Homer,i think i'm gonna take a walk.
34934,Homer,"mr. burns, why'd you come to see me?"
27684,Homer,that's right. over the homes of poor people.
37160,Homer,"okay, now to see if i can apply my book knowledge to the real world."
39832,Homer,"oh, thanks, boy."
18060,Homer,i blew it again.
14899,Homer,a beaut from butte.
36929,Homer,"and then... and then wha... and then what happened... what... gee, my story doesn't make much sense except the santa part."
34845,Homer,"oh, i've seen that look before. that's the ""i ate the piece of wedding cake she's been saving in the freezer ten years"" look."
17590,Homer,"not as such, no."
32948,Homer,"uh, we'll stick with the coins."
38601,Homer,and now i banish you from paradise! i'm glad i never bothered to learn which one of you is which.
40155,Homer,"oooo! that was a big mama. heh, heh, heh."
21049,Homer,what's a jib?
40585,Homer,but don't worry. i'll never let on. i'll still do all the bed stuff. maybe it won't be so bad.
14188,Homer,for several years i'd been dating your mother and working at the local fun center.
24658,Homer,"anyhow, those rats'll come crawling back..."
23449,Homer,"com'on, maw. bring the young 'uns! there's no leeches! lots of snakes, though."
28144,Homer,get out!
14841,Homer,"dammit, i said full power!"
30498,Homer,"oh, it's heartfelt. there's no escaping that. thanks, honey."
28030,Homer,"you know, all this walking is paying off -- look how healthy i am."
20012,Homer,he did.
23126,Homer,"well, that was a stinker."
35894,Homer,"because of that dumb viral video with a hundred and fifty million hits, i can't go out in public."
30899,Homer,what's that delicious smell?
34078,Homer,where's the hooch?
13797,Homer,mel brooks is jewish?
16242,Homer,mmmm... invisible cola.
23873,Homer,"uh, miracle boy?"
13489,Homer,"all right, think very carefully. where did you see it last?"
35592,Homer,"oh man, what's this bite gonna do? my wrists are tingling... i feel new powers surging within me..."
27850,Homer,"kids, sometimes when a daddy learns that a mommy always hated him, he needs some time away to think."
32793,Homer,"so i say we roll up our sleeves, and fake a disaster to trick the federal government out of relief money."
15196,Homer,wha-do i do...
15720,Homer,so they say i might have a problem.
27678,Homer,yeah. and to make things even more suspenseful... our plane leaves in a half hour!
35687,Homer,kids! guess what? mom invited me to your fancy dinner!
32610,Homer,happier!
39044,Homer,"elon, elon, elon! i want to say something to you and i don't want you to be inspired by it. i want you to listen."
32955,Homer,wait!
14235,Homer,baby to marge. baby to marge. wah! wah! over.
32455,Homer,and i know how i can knock myself out. i'll look at your bill.
36391,Homer,but you said it so mean!
21461,Homer,cara mia...
22789,Homer,"ooh, i smell barbecue!"
22924,Homer,ow! ohhh...
28135,Homer,"i said, pipe down, amtrak."
27997,Homer,what has he done for me lately?
14576,Homer,uh uh.
26271,Homer,part of me knew that.
28541,Homer,pathetic flanders. thinking he can buy people's love with thoughtful gifts.
16462,Homer,like what?
38032,Homer,no need. everything's fine.
24196,Homer,is everybody happyyyyy?
32114,Homer,what's the point of putting my socks on? i just have to take them off again a week later.
38038,Homer,yeah. and?
27586,Homer,sorry. i just wanna win my son back so badly.
14993,Homer,"sure, honey."
33680,Homer,"i can too! ""there once was this guy from an island off the coast of massachusetts... uh, nantucket, i think it was. anyway, he had a most unusual personal characteristic... which was... um... uh..."
35912,Homer,"zoomy, zoomy, zoomy dateline, nebraska."
39100,Homer,there we go. comin' up... what can i do for you?
16157,Homer,right. that makes sense.
30064,Homer,marge is right -- the rapture isn't coming! there haven't been any ominous signs!
32142,Homer,say it!
34262,Homer,how about bromance?
20599,Homer,oh yeah.
16544,Homer,oh sure... remember when i got caught stealing all those watches from sears?
24099,Homer,"how could she not? the place is full of eligible bachelors -- john wayne, tupac shakur, sherlock holmes..."
14410,Homer,dallas! whoo-hoo!
22948,Homer,"woo hoo! look at me, i can juggle!"
39494,Homer,"whoops. sorry, i wasn't paying attention."
30522,Homer,stop this bus!
19483,Homer,the lighthouse keeper!
40234,Homer,"oh. my dreams will go unfulfilled! oh no. i don't like the sound of that one bit. that means i have nothing to hope for. marge, make it better. please. can't you make it better, huh?"
17757,Homer,it's at times like this i wish i were a religious man.
21085,Homer,no.
35535,Homer,"that's funny, because i have recurring flash-forwards to a nightmarish future."
37134,Homer,"i've told you a thousand times, call me homer!"
13945,Homer,"marge, could we go in the other room? i did something last night i'm not proud of and i don't want the kids to hear it."
21752,Homer,"no, that would make me a great father."
28456,Homer,interesting...
19119,Homer,are you guys working?
31466,Homer,"oh my god. she's gonna jump. marge, don't do it! give divorce a chance!"
21221,Homer,"i came to fight city hall. i wanna shake things up, patterson. stir up some controversy. rattle a few cages."
33389,Homer,okay.
32778,Homer,"okay, bart, it's time for operation: crazy-plan. step one: we chuck the raccoon in there."
23959,Homer,ah ha! prepare to die!
29914,Homer,what am i doing here? let me go!
29525,Homer,"don't forget showboating. that's the cornerstone of my ""pyramid of success."""
35719,Homer,so tired... go on without me.
25575,Homer,it's working!
24303,Homer,hey? how did i get out here?
31900,Homer,i can't believe a mattress could make that much difference...
34481,Homer,do you ever wear your police pants to regular things?
39678,Homer,nice grizzles. nice grizzles. nice grizzles.
30359,Homer,"run, marge! start the car!"
16737,Homer,"no. it wasn't me, i swear. it was... him."
23997,Homer,"racehorse, eh?"
13193,Homer,"and jack sprat? is that him, too?"
30609,Homer,"shock and awe, losers! shock and awe!"
36047,Homer,"wait! if you banish us, you shall be cursed with a thousand-year drought."
17119,Homer,woo hoo!
40266,Homer,your team needs you! c'mon!!!
30102,Homer,"hey, you with the tempura -- your arm broken?"
39675,Homer,femmmmm! wah! gnnn! hrmmerhrr!
28909,Homer,"if you're gonna pick on someone, why don't you pick on someone much bigger than you with a gun?"
40235,Homer,"hey, you did it!"
18707,Homer,and what are you doing with his ball?
40528,Homer,"oh, sorry."
31036,Homer,"marge, i don't have to sit here and listen to your insane ravings about me getting other people's mail."
31594,Homer,hey! nobody cuts me off!
34055,Homer,bonjour.
27591,Homer,not very!
25982,Homer,ayyy.
17941,Homer,my ears are burning.
38200,Homer,"what if i never liked the painting, and only wanted it for money?"
29873,Homer,"mine. oh, move your hand. i get this!"
36447,Homer,"oh lord, why have you placed this fearsome burden on my shoulders?"
30012,Homer,"i wrote it about shelbyville, then changed the names."
33786,Homer,"marge, the boy and i will be making westminster abbey."
33859,Homer,"you know, you're starting to remind me a lot of my first wife."
15903,Homer,your daddy hit the referee.
20637,Homer,knock it off...
28714,Homer,"you know, marge and i have an anniversary coming up."
14395,Homer,"boy, i know you're gonna like your present."
32144,Homer,"i couldn't bear to tell your mother, so i hang out here all day."
14276,Homer,"marge! marge, where's the baby?"
36247,Homer,it's a simple question! are you a: working hard or b:
31033,Homer,"ooh! marge, you wanna go to a wedding of a couple we never met?"
39592,Homer,uh-oh. you missed me.
27526,Homer,"oh, i love this song."
14939,Homer,i mean it made me feel bad. the poor thing ends up being hauled to the nut house when all she needed was for that big slob to show her some respect. at least that's what i thought. i have a history of missing the point of stuff like this.
40725,Homer,she's right! she's right!
16691,Homer,are we in india yet?
31719,Homer,"i've got three bathrooms, don't i? next."
28667,Homer,"oh good, you can use that to take down my dinner order. i'll start with the soup, then a nice mixed grill with a side of wild rice."
38931,Homer,"oh! finally! the business call i've been waiting for! hello, this is--"
40130,Homer,"there you are, my man. and a dollar for yourself."
33220,Homer,lisa? lisa?
18200,Homer,i wish i knew something about the baby i could miss now.
20138,Homer,sorry.
39264,Homer,"what's your name, bart... ner? -- er -- little partner?"
39164,Homer,this is the part of the fairytale where the princess goes back to the hotel and watches tv!
31011,Homer,"well, you know what a man invented? actual paper."
19316,Homer,what the hell is wrong with you?!!
23328,Homer,"oh. well, i'm glad to see my ex-partner is doing so well without me."
27769,Homer,...best quality pork chops.
21823,Homer,did too!
17950,Homer,"yeah, well i won the belching contest at work."
14739,Homer,yes i am.
17475,Homer,get out.
31452,Homer,"marge, let me explain: i had a chance to make a little more money by exploiting broken families..."
21119,Homer,"oh, that's ridiculous, moe. end transmission."
20350,Homer,"you couldn't be more wrong, lisa. if i didn't have this gun, the king of england could just walk in here any time he wants and start shoving you around. do you want that? huh? do you?"
20284,Homer,it was your mother.
33449,Homer,kniiiife!
29474,Homer,"ah yes, detroit-style. very nice. so, you've been at moe's every night this week."
22655,Homer,and a ooga-booga to you too.
15075,Homer,time i wreck your life?
41300,Homer,"uh-oh. she's picked names? who puts this much thought into having a baby? stall, stall, stall!"
23255,Homer,"god bless you, nelson muntz."
39353,Homer,"well, i guess we don't have to do that."
16412,Homer,according to this map there's a krustyburger on an offshore oil rig!
27074,Homer,"hey, what gives? where are all the rock stars?"
35746,Homer,or... your name could be on a book in ten minutes.
37899,Homer,theaters? all i need to see this movie is a laptop and a website based in a country that's really just an offshore oil platform. care to join me?
39151,Homer,"all right, princess. i'll take you to a place that's fun with a capital f."
28967,Homer,"son, seeing sappy movies with a lady has certain ""payoffs."""
36971,Homer,i can't conceive of any.
39767,Homer,"ahhh... ahhh... oh, how was bowling?"
25746,Homer,it knows you're afraid.
23291,Homer,"there's the coffee mug from ""heartbeeps""!"
39459,Homer,yes.
27504,Homer,"dear lord, as i think of you, dressed in white with your splendid beard, i am reminded of colonel sanders, who is now seated at your right hand, shoveling popcorn chicken into thy mouth. lord, could you come up with a delicious new taste treat like he did? i command you!"
17405,Homer,"hmm, i saw that report you did on sasquatch. it was fair and evenhanded. i'll do it."
37357,Homer,no need. i already went online and ordered a new couch just like the old one.
35277,Homer,i miss my friends from drunk driving school. they were so cool.
40999,Homer,"hello, cook? sorry to bother you so late, but i got a hankerin' for some... that's right... don't forget the apple sauce!"
26796,Homer,i bought the issue for richard avedon's pictures of lenny.
36375,Homer,"man, i kicked butt in the gladiator arena today! i won the last package of hot dogs on the ship! i got robbed by marauders on the way home."
41163,Homer,"i can't move, boy."
32751,Homer,flanders! you ate my jerky!
40059,Homer,"good morning, everybody!"
20420,Homer,then why are you running the obstacle course?
34743,Homer,"i have to sign a release so you can broadcast this, right?"
41227,Homer,i want some peanuts.
18940,Homer,uh... partial credit.
18669,Homer,"it's all in the bible, son! it's the prankster's bible!"
31901,Homer,lousy reverend. he's having my sex! while i'm at home with marge not doing anything sexual or erotic.
30751,Homer,i'll kill you! i'll kill your whole family!
30027,Homer,fired... me?
21145,Homer,"ohh, we're never gonna make it. let's just divide up the trillion now, and go our separate ways."
16627,Homer,"buzz off, giuseppe."
29380,Homer,"are you a terrorist? no. ""would you like to meet someone special but are tired of the bar scene?"" no. i will never tire of the bar scene!"
24334,Homer,where are you going? the fire's that way!
22466,Homer,sure you can. buncha no-good do-gooders.
28917,Homer,no son of mine will be marched down the aisle at the barrel of a ray gun.
33230,Homer,"okay. what can i do for you? please, i'm begging you!"
23132,Homer,'preciate it.
21369,Homer,"huh? whuh? hyuwhuh? i'm awake! i'm awake! i'm a productive member of the team! you can't fire me, i quit! please, i have a family! well, let's see what we got in the ol' drawer."
29403,Homer,re-straint! re-straint! re-straint!
25912,Homer,ow!
18852,Homer,i don't know.
21466,Homer,"now they did say bed and breakfast, right?"
30172,Homer,"hi, i'm homer simpson. i live next door. so, is that your whistle?"
22268,Homer,"""hitler is a jerk, mussolini..."""
17375,Homer,i don't know.
28840,Homer,"marge, are you sure we should go drinking together? i mean, who am i gonna complain about while i'm drinking?"
15718,Homer,i'm here for the alch-anon meeting.
19584,Homer,"i had a feeling things would work out for you, honey."
24438,Homer,poor cyborganizer
28478,Homer,"see you in spring, toes!"
33272,Homer,a computer!
28609,Homer,various bug bites and wounds. now stop interrupting your brother.
32369,Homer,"...so, killing people together has really spiced things up in the bedroom."
22067,Homer,"i'm sorry, dad. the way i behaved was shameful. i guess fear made me run away. but love made me come back."
20157,Homer,"okay, once more. where are we going?"
39218,Homer,"okay, kids. prepare to be dazzled. marge! turn on the juice!"
24694,Homer,fire in the hole!
14694,Homer,"moe, i was a hundred miles outta town."
19097,Homer,"oh yeah, that's right. let's watch this."
39766,Homer,"all right, we're clean. now we'll... put maggie to bed."
19740,Homer,that john is the greatest guy in the world. we've gotta have him and his wife over for drinks sometime.
23506,Homer,"you're scaring the customers, honey."
23097,Homer,it burns! it burns!
14504,Homer,makes you look like you've got something to hide.
16685,Homer,"hey, what's that sound?"
25406,Homer,"please, ugly is such a smelly word. who would you rather go out with?"
36826,Homer,beer keg do-nut?
14131,Homer,hey... hey!
36212,Homer,"no can do, baby."
31637,Homer,"this is it. it's taken all day, we've missed our flight to hawaii, but finally, i'll get my revenge."
32758,Homer,you're on your own.
34914,Homer,it's almost over.
38869,Homer,i say we take this bucket home!
17622,Homer,what? did i miss something?
33114,Homer,or you!
37707,Homer,woo-hoo! i'm an attractive concept like liberty!
22501,Homer,"outlook. ""vista."" no. ""spotlight."" ""mosaic."" nah."
30081,Homer,"here's one -- revelation 6:13. just before the rapture, ""the stars will fall to the earth."" so all you hippies out there might want to for that one."
23742,Homer,i guess i'll never find her.
20344,Homer,"close your eyes marge, i've got a surprise for you."
22983,Homer,ow! ow! oh!
17340,Homer,"okay, hotshots, now that my daughter is on your team, i want to make a few things clear."
18319,Homer,what's going on here? i'm so bulgy...
29210,Homer,but ice cream cake...
25998,Homer,"there you go, doll."
25407,Homer,"well duh! he's breathtaking, but bart has inner beauty... like you'd find in a rodent."
22828,Homer,oh yeah? prove it.
22520,Homer,only till eleven.
30052,Homer,"how 'bout ""i love you, honey?"""
27562,Homer,why you little...! why you little...!
24737,Homer,have a good time at your hippie club.
24475,Homer,"yes, better now than when you're too old and fat to get another man."
21302,Homer,"okay, boy, i want you to keep this exercise thing under your hat. that way i won't be embarrassed if i fail."
21032,Homer,ulll.....
23384,Homer,but i was gonna loot you a present!
37188,Homer,"it's gonna be ""yes,"" but don't rush me."
27800,Homer,mmm... bad eggs.
14375,Homer,you think we should bet against them?
36363,Homer,then a kid disappears and it's total panic until you find him at the swim-up bar...
25918,Homer,"but, constance, it only happened because..."
29713,Homer,"i was this woman's husband for a few days, in name only, and beer will soon obliterate that memory. but i don't think this baby could find any greater love on your planet or ours."
33511,Homer,will you kids knock it off? i'm trying to watch badminton!
24419,Homer,that's perfect! we can hide out here 'til the heat's off.
35574,Homer,"marge, my ice cream's melting and i haven't finished my brownie!"
39890,Homer,you want to see where i work?
34050,Homer,"hey, it's not like i want to go. go, go, go!"
26880,Homer,let's just say i'm planning a little surprise for the execution. this cannon is going to be full when i go off. ka-boom!
40696,Homer,"guys, keep it down. i got some last words. i never told you this before, but sometimes when i'm at work, i think of you and smile. so often i think that ... oh, words won't do it. i love you, moe."
37198,Homer,we're gonna get rich off the poor and forgetful! and dead people.
16864,Homer,"are you mad, woman? you never know when an old calendar might come in handy. sure it's not nineteen eighty-five right now, but who knows what tomorrow will bring? and these tv guides... so many memories."
23228,Homer,"he's gone from goofus to gallant, and we owe it all to mind-bending pills."
25167,Homer,mmm... hug.
14468,Homer,just help me look!
19868,Homer,"well -- and i can explain, remember -- i fill the balls with beer that i found at the dump, then i bowl them and some underground pipes take them into moe's."
26190,Homer,...which is society's fault because...
37541,Homer,"all right, all right, i'll be right there!"
36446,Homer,"oh yes, lisa, very seriously. whee."
38093,Homer,"if it's important, they'll call back."
27423,Homer,"well, it wasn't easy, honey, but i'm glad you love me again."
24190,Homer,"check it out. there's island blackjack, island craps, island texas hold 'em... but if, like me, you're mesmerized by pretty colors and spinning things, you'll prefer roulette. four sand dollars on number six, please."
31013,Homer,"let's see, men also have: rocket ships, suspension bridges, constitutional government, snow shoes, brass knuckles..."
17734,Homer,seems like the classy thing to do would be not to call attention to it.
37135,Homer,standard hotel boilerplate. it just says somebody died in this room in the last seventy-two hours.
15647,Homer,stop it. stop it. stop it!
14867,Homer,"herb, i don't think there's a vibrating chair in that bag for me."
20552,Homer,i'll just leave it in here a few years and let it appreciate in value.
27634,Homer,lower. lower!
19728,Homer,give her a break! her husband was killed!
28619,Homer,i just installed a chip that makes it ten per cent more bloodthirsty!
24320,Homer,barney.
17476,Homer,out.
15450,Homer,"say it in english, doc."
30785,Homer,i'm getting blue pants in the morning / ding dong the zipper's gonna shine...
34944,Homer,what the hell?!
27749,Homer,"that's right. and as my first act... mr. burns, you're fired!"
33387,Homer,i don't feel much like eating. i'll never know what would've happened if i'd have been class president.
31658,Homer,this cell phone is so i can call you whenever i need your driving services. i've put in my own ring tone!
17114,Homer,"yes, lisa?"
31668,Homer,"you know, my great-great grandmother was an indian. i guess i should've mentioned that before, huh?"
41095,Homer,he can't ride ponies.
15082,Homer,that's good.
35889,Homer,"i'm still gonna make my flight, right? 'cause if not, you have to put me up in a first class hotel... that's how it works. i..."
37684,Homer,and together we are.
23150,Homer,"yeah, but..."
37637,Homer,son-of-a!
37386,Homer,day by day... day by day... the deacon's job... is pretty okay... pretty okaaay... i'm going to be a deacon... day by day... i'm already a deacon... day by day...
26989,Homer,anybody else?
28003,Homer,"look, he's misspelling words."
13822,Homer,woo hoo!
16042,Homer,"aw, no fair."
21511,Homer,and now for the profit taking.
17942,Homer,"no, my ears are really burning. i wanted to see inside, so i lit a q-tip."
27588,Homer,groovy.
16844,Homer,"right, no reporters."
22420,Homer,"your honor, i'd like to sue the producers of ""policecops"" for twenty million dollars for improper use of my name."
33417,Homer,"is that why you brought me here, spirits?"
22081,Homer,are you sure this is the sci-fi convention? it's full of nerds.
40277,Homer,"you wanted to see me, ""tex""?"
36378,Homer,choke on my numb blue hands!
17688,Homer,marge...
23190,Homer,we shoulda put in the dog with the shifty eyes.
23184,Homer,"actually, i didn't see it, but on the poster it..."
27285,Homer,i just wanted to impress you.
24797,Homer,"oh, y'know, business stuff... downsizing, e-solutions, the glass ceiling..."
16931,Homer,all right. we'll give the stupid elephant to the stupid animal refuge.
40383,Homer,"better yet, you have to mow my lawn in your wife's sunday dress."
28863,Homer,"yes, and you've said that several times now."
30835,Homer,fine. as soon as i finish watching my show.
15780,Homer,uh... yeah.
39958,Homer,"gee, a romantic evening. nah, she's too smart to fall for that."
39394,Homer,wouldn't want to run into him in a dark alley
28062,Homer,"marge, you're trying to hurt me!"
31403,Homer,"oh, jemima!"
29058,Homer,do i get two paychecks?
29622,Homer,lemme get my belt sander. maybe i can grind the ugly off your face.
24590,Homer,television broken?
27092,Homer,bor-ing.
13858,Homer,uh... isn't this the kind of thing your mother's better at?
22856,Homer,"this piece i call ""failed shelving unit with stupid stuck chainsaw and applesauce."""
37833,Homer,"hello, boy. at times like this there's not much you can say... especially if you don't know what happened..."
21254,Homer,"not if we hire more men. and my men will do all your messy jobs. they'll wash your car, scrub your shower, air out your stinkables..."
23428,Homer,"sir, that is an insult! i challenge you... what?"
21037,Homer,bart!
28172,Homer,never mind. i'm death now.
39617,Homer,yeah!
37908,Homer,"ooo, mastermind."
32147,Homer,"no, it's, uh... good news!"
28514,Homer,"mr. mcgrew! i love that blind, senile old man."
18325,Homer,oops.
16689,Homer,i'm aware of that.
30898,Homer,"there's this guy that got killed -- i think it was in miami? so c.s.i. miami investiga-ted-ed it. then a family said how much they loved the olive garden. then i fell asleep. when i woke up, letterman was talking to alias."
36668,Homer,so precious...
13575,Homer,baby.
39902,Homer,"okay, okay. i love bart. well..."
27207,Homer,d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh d'oh...
17760,Homer,"of course i'm right. if i'm not, may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow."
28379,Homer,ants!
37526,Homer,"oh, we're still on for tomorrow night."
19311,Homer,"marge, please, that was twenty minutes ago."
27251,Homer,where do you get those things anyway?
27615,Homer,three ribwiches please. and instead of a shake i'd like a blended ribwich.
39180,Homer,"you got yourself one hell of a show, marge. one hell of a show."
30035,Homer,"his name isn't cameron anymore. he's now ""johnny rainbow."""
39715,Homer,i hope you're not planning to see a certain movie starring certain space mutants that a certain mother didn't want you to see?
25157,Homer,i want you to stick this crayon into my brain.
41579,Homer,"where are we going, daddy?"
26120,Homer,"it's responsible for everything wrong in my life -- my occasional overeating, my fear of corpses..."
35591,Homer,"i guess my life isn't so bad. with the help of my loving family, i even published my first book...and i've finally reached a state of serenity and-- another spider!"
22796,Homer,"fine. i'll drop everything i'm doing just for you. but you'll have to live with the guilt of ruining my saturday. can you live with that, marge? huh? can ya?"
35257,Homer,"uh, super bowl tickets?... playoff tickets?... regular season, bobble-head day?"
29704,Homer,"i would, but marge would kill me... i mean ohh, right."
24860,Homer,they can't sue me if they don't know who i am. i'll just call myself mr. x.
18451,Homer,"""wife: marjorie. children: bartholomew, lisa..."" aha! see, this thing is all screwed up. who the heck is ""margaret"" simpson?"
16912,Homer,"don't worry, son. i'll get you a new elephant."
14301,Homer,"bart, i'll bet you think nothin's gonna top that cactus. well, check out my present!"
25775,Homer,that is completely taken out of context!
31810,Homer,and my own medicine!
33445,Homer,"book club? that's the most stupid boring thing ever. oh, thank you."
38572,Homer,"ooh marge, that was fast. yeah, that's it, baby. grab my chest with your cold icy hands."
20658,Homer,"don't worry, honey. i know exactly what i'm --"
15570,Homer,all in favor of skipping the poem?
38848,Homer,"don't worry, this time i'm gonna write down where i parked."
33292,Homer,what?!
19507,Homer,"then, i insert this old videotape of us working on a continuous loop..."
35126,Homer,and you know what else this whole experience has taught me?
21163,Homer,"oh-ho-ho, i'm not handicapped. i'm just lazy."
38394,Homer,you monster! my knees will be in my throat!
15228,Homer,"no! mr. burns, i'm not leaving until you say you're sorry for what you did to my wife."
38460,Homer,it's a song? i thought we were just riffing.
22255,Homer,"because we love them, jackass."
23400,Homer,"okay, but there's... dan quayle and courtney love... tanya harding... al sharpton...?"
14085,Homer,"how could you do this to me, moe? this bar was going under and it was the drink i invented that saved it."
34916,Homer,i'm too fat to fit in a foxhole.
17429,Homer,"marge, this is so depressing. my only hope is this homemade prozac. hmm... needs more ice-cream."
26522,Homer,"honey, i'm home!"
22292,Homer,"not until you're older, son."
21906,Homer,a saturn?
27752,Homer,mr. burns?
40088,Homer,"enjoy your tartar sauce, boys! enjoy! give me your plates. don't crowd. plenty for everybody."
27469,Homer,"quiet, her muscular ears can hear us."
17050,Homer,"huh? yeah, i was listening. very funny."
16843,Homer,"hey, what's up for today, neddie?"
25132,Homer,i am here to give hope to the least of you. because we all have a crayon up our nose. maybe it's not a crayon made of wax. maybe it's a crayon made of prejudice...
40896,Homer,"ugh, ah, hello, mr. burns. would you like to watch the fight?"
21781,Homer,"sorry, lady. i know you. you're kim basinger"
19776,Homer,you'll thank me on your wedding night.
23957,Homer,"oh, that would be just... you're just yankin' my chain, aren't you?"
13842,Homer,you both toilet-trained?
40061,Homer,"daddy's home, sugar!"
33582,Homer,"oh dad, i never knew you had dreams, or emotions."
18879,Homer,"okay, we'll work this out together. first things first: where is knoxville?"
38978,Homer,change back to what?
36796,Homer,"huh. ""hope."" is this one of those coincidences like jesus on a tortilla or george washington on a dollar bill?"
25755,Homer,if you're happy and you know it say a swear!
32129,Homer,"well, i can see the position of handsomest c.e.o. is already taken."
21490,Homer,"oh, we're surrounded, marge. maybe we should give ourselves up."
16889,Homer,"grooming him, eh?"
19438,Homer,"man, this is crazy. i hope i didn't brain my damage. i'd better check my pupils..."
16266,Homer,will you bring me back something?
15878,Homer,"all right. but if he starts to wig out, try to lure him into the cellar."
18831,Homer,what for?
28757,Homer,which one? tri-city? omni-pay? insta-threat? i've beaten 'em all!
17127,Homer,"you see, marge? you see?"
27394,Homer,you've been living like a king on my dollar... super unleaded gas... silver bullets?
33362,Homer,why did you just exchange that look of guilt?
30782,Homer,it's not supposed to.
25124,Homer,is the capital of north dakota bismarck?
33249,Homer,that's it! ruin a perfect evening!
40268,Homer,"i thank you. you're too kind. glad you enjoyed it, but i can't take all the credit. the batter did his part, too."
29832,Homer,"oh, marge..."
28735,Homer,i want to get a second house. closer to work.
24527,Homer,that's ridiculous! how could i even get all five necessary drops into her cereal?
20455,Homer,"oh, so now you're quitting dinner, too."
40895,Homer,will you quit staring at me like that!
16538,Homer,you broke a promise to your child.
17799,Homer,"oh yeah. when i started this clown thing i thought it would be nothing but glory. you know, the glory of being a clown? i tell ya, it's hard, tiring work, but when i see the smiles on their little faces, i just know they're getting ready to jab me with something."
39247,Homer,"dasher, dancer..."
37224,Homer,"apparently, old folks homes are full of people that used to be things. just like you and me. swear to god."
38109,Homer,i'm hoping we can find a way to coexist.
15770,Homer,"hey, lenny, can you get this sugar daddy off my back?"
28752,Homer,"either way, everyone who works in the kitchen speaks spanish."
36380,Homer,"hey, wait for me!"
14073,Homer,take that off this second!
20304,Homer,she's a witch!
37699,Homer,i'm homer simpson!
28635,Homer,"yeah, i'm pretty unreliable."
20688,Homer,"ooh, why did they have to screw up a perfectly serviceable wagon story with all that fruity singing?"
22515,Homer,we've gotta stop that traitor apu.
32885,Homer,"mom, i can't believe you're here. you keep disappearing and reappearing and it's not funny. you're just like that show ""scrubs""."
40930,Homer,"but if you weren't married to your job, you'd tend to go for a girl, right?"
18335,Homer,craaaaaaaaaap!
37277,Homer,don't wanna hit you. i want your wife.
19372,Homer,i would make it my business to be a third wheel.
33339,Homer,i doubt it -- friday is usually just committee assignments and procedural rules.
34316,Homer,"i don't have to do it with him, do i?"
21131,Homer,starting search for trillion-dollar bill.
41168,Homer,"honey, i'm home!"
33502,Homer,i have come from my workshop in the north pole to say: don't evict the simpsons!
28916,Homer,"relax, what's the worst that could happen?"
31755,Homer,where is he? i know he's in here.
34115,Homer,"did somebody say ""naked bacon?"""
41566,Homer,he who is tired of weird al is tired of life.
18053,Homer,"oh, right."
31097,Homer,"not me -- but we can't get rid of him, 'cause he's friends with richard sakai."
14556,Homer,you're darryl strawberry.
31846,Homer,"foul on the other girl. lisa gets a penalty kick, and every other kid has to pay her a dollar!"
20283,Homer,"sorry, but this is a highly sophistimicated doowhackey. if you don't use it responsibly... kablamo!"
31823,Homer,"oh marge, you gotta get on the net. it's got all the best conspiracy theories. did you know that hezbollah owns little dolly snack cakes? this stuff will rock your world."
19368,Homer,"oh, lisa, there's no record of a hurricane ever hitting springfield."
28103,Homer,"hey, treadmill! how do you like this incline?"
26102,Homer,"it was hard on me, too. i had to wear a suit. oh, you're right. i've gotta make it up to her."
35220,Homer,can we get high from the fumes?
31358,Homer,i'm not gonna surrender. you've seen what the u.s. army does to prisoners. how would you like to be stacked naked in a pile with a hillbilly girl pointing at you and laughing?
32270,Homer,"man oh man, you've got the greatest job in the world!"
28507,Homer,"there's a trickle-down theory here. if i'm happy, i'm less abusive to the rest of you."
37300,Homer,"maybe it's time for a visit from wally, the kissing walrus."
16285,Homer,come on marge. it's fun to smash things. i smashed it good!
16566,Homer,"we don't need a thinker, we need a doer. someone who'll act without considering the consequences."
18205,Homer,"i love you, cletus!"
39411,Homer,"safety? but, sir, if truth be known, i actually caused more accidents around here than any other employee. there were even a few doozies no one ever found out about."
38593,Homer,"no, marge... no! you can't invite a couple of riddlers to stay in the bat cave!"
22812,Homer,"all right, let's see..."
22349,Homer,"yes, if by ""crestfallen"" you mean ""kill us."" listen, let me talk to them. maybe i can smooth this over."
31940,Homer,i can't! that fire siren could sound at any moment.
16372,Homer,"you're right, marge. good work, boy."
26186,Homer,"okay gabriel, this is a ""bar."" it's where i go to drink ""alcohol,"" which is the mortal equivalent of your ambrosia."
37051,Homer,maybe the last words i'll ever write.
19662,Homer,i like him!
35712,Homer,ex-tinct!
27152,Homer,"kids, kids, you're both right."
27829,Homer,"""dear homer, i can't believe you're making this the worst night of my life."""
38154,Homer,"yes, they sold it to us. so now it's our painting. we can hang it on our wall, cut eyeholes in it to spy on people, or... sell it for lots of money which we keep."
39996,Homer,mmmm.
19444,Homer,follow... the... this must be why i'm here! follow the what? follow the what? hurry up!
26823,Homer,"oh no, not the good cheek!"
37660,Homer,this is exactly why circus attendance is plummeting!
24021,Homer,what do you want me to do?
15946,Homer,"ooh, five cents each!"
15965,Homer,"far out, man. i haven't seen a bong in years."
24709,Homer,my uncle still has my nose.
20091,Homer,"marge, you can stand there finding fault, or you can knit me some seat belts."
32958,Homer,"okay boy, this is it. five dollars!"
19697,Homer,ruff ruff! i'm poochie the rockin' dog.
32668,Homer,"good, 'cause i'm parking at it right now."
17251,Homer,"oh, sideshow bob."
30904,Homer,"yeah, well, i'm gonna vote ""no"" on thirty-eight so you can't adopt."
21471,Homer,did that butter churn just move? 'cause if it did...
38165,Homer,"okay milhouse, the guys in back are putting your new bike together."
40731,Homer,but we're early for lunch. let's go grab a burger.
17533,Homer,where? where?
13591,Homer,huh? a check?
36811,Homer,"this boy's grandfather is a shriveled-up corn cob, begging for death! i am his father... i can't believe i allowed you to hit on me."
16667,Homer,"no, don't kill me! i didn't know there was film in that camera in that hat! i was unaware! i was unawaaare!"
33193,Homer,"i know this is hard on you, but in time you'll come to see it's for the best."
29619,Homer,"oh kent, not anything. it has to exist. or does it?"
22175,Homer,"all right, bart!"
36280,Homer,"now, let me raise this beer to toast..."
31746,Homer,i guess i always dreamed that my father would grow old alone.
16230,Homer,you have to kill the head vampire.
27727,Homer,"hmm. what next, megatronics? ""point out problems at your workplace to your boss. to separate yourself from the herd, just tattle on the cattle. hm."
21127,Homer,"uh, i'm homer simpson, your trusted employee."
20466,Homer,i've got lots of quarters.
31820,Homer,i want you all to show some respect for the people who made you what you are. sign an autograph or two... support a charity for something that hasn't happened to a member of your family... let one of us regular guys write a terrible children's book!
29653,Homer,show you what it's like in the real world!
13211,Homer,"squeaky, squeaky!"
40517,Homer,no.
37706,Homer,why are you doing this? wait. are you in love with me?
22154,Homer,aww...
23001,Homer,up-bup-bup-bup.
25853,Homer,"hey, we stayed for your kids!"
35356,Homer,"well, if you insist."
26769,Homer,"in my role as customer, i saw the whole thing."
25027,Homer,huh? but that's impossible.
17988,Homer,"you can be the first to try out the new guest bedroom i built. remember, if the building inspector comes by, it's not a room, it's a window box."
25740,Homer,"oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?"
13390,Homer,it's true. it's all true.
37843,Homer,"look, you kill them, i get rid of them. that's always been our deal. but i do have one question: do you want the head?"
24501,Homer,...m-e-r. okay.
34138,Homer,drop that pillow!
29570,Homer,"after my makeover i'm gonna get you, boy."
30618,Homer,it says that we should turn left at a fat chick in a tu-tu being fed by a midget.
37140,Homer,shows how much she... knooooows! it's hurting my eyes!
24261,Homer,"oh, here we go."
17784,Homer,hurry up -- it's my first day of clown college.
30223,Homer,"marge, no one is saying twelve. nine, ten, tops. see..."
16323,Homer,"yep, it's finally gone."
30613,Homer,"wow! i've seen photos of this, but you can't really experience it until you're here."
20144,Homer,die! die!
20903,Homer,"okay, i won't lie to you. a lot of people saw that. but you gotta keep tryin'."
36752,Homer,now what?
15443,Homer,stop. please stop.
26713,Homer,"oh, i've been there, man."
16248,Homer,promised marge...
19617,Homer,no going through the window for us!
39344,Homer,"tell you what: to celebrate your first day of genius school, whaddaya say we go out for a round of frosty chocolate milkshakes?"
36812,Homer,"beat it, ducks! i'm not old enough to have food for you! i'm sexy! young and sexy!"
34716,Homer,woo hoo! we're region one! we're region one!
17977,Homer,can i have some?
34523,Homer,look at this electric bill! i'm not made of money! i'm made of man-meat and a skeleton!
18666,Homer,it's time to hit him where he lives.
29587,Homer,oh son!... taking your tombstone back to the store will be the happiest thing i've ever done.
18473,Homer,"first, it wasn't 25 years. it was 27 years. and second, she had a very good reason."
22732,Homer,"c'mon out, boy. it's windy."
24900,Homer,"stop it, apu. you're scaring me."
14773,Homer,"oh, baby!"
22126,Homer,shake on it?
31058,Homer,why do you remember them and not me?
29594,Homer,"wow, those jackets are beautiful."
24585,Homer,"wait, stop! we can outsmart those dolphins! don't forget, we invented computers, leg warmers, bendy straws, peel n' eat shrimp, the glory hole, and the pudding cup. i'm not gonna let a few hoop-jumping tuna-munchers push me around!"
24884,Homer,whoa... he's in trouble.
15271,Homer,i married her!
14359,Homer,"all right, dolphins!"
15283,Homer,"kids! if we buy a new car, we get our parking validated for free."
37655,Homer,"trying to kill moe so we'll get his emerald. by the way, i haven't checked, but emeralds are valuable, right?"
31372,Homer,the senior olympics? that's what i was supposed to remember?!
14161,Homer,mmm. the land of chocolate...
15964,Homer,what'd you kids get?
28720,Homer,loveless loners are so lucky. there's no way i can afford to give marge a nice anniversary present.
31514,Homer,why did you let that loser into our home?
23303,Homer,it lost some points 'cause it had a hot wheel on it.
33418,Homer,i guess that would be nice.
28433,Homer,circle of life.
38686,Homer,"marge, please don't say anything. it never makes a difference and then the teachers give us stink-eye during the school fairs."
25798,Homer,"i haven't had buffalo in six hours. marge, how 'bout whipping up some buffalo sausage, huevos buffaleros, and some fresh-squeezed buffal-o.j."
41400,Homer,are you god?
26771,Homer,"here, guys."
35078,Homer,"hey, apu."
34577,Homer,oh come on! leave me alone! i'm trying to save your precious whales!
31184,Homer,"everything. and i learned it all from the greatest gangster film ever: ""shark tale""."
34489,Homer,aw dang! i lost track of time! i'm gonna be late for work.
14037,Homer,"wow, i'm one question away from being a perfect father. ""name another dad you talked to about parenting."""
31125,Homer,"tickets, tickets, who needs tickets?"
24583,Homer,hmm. phone's off the hook. everything must be okay.
35510,Homer,sheez!
33853,Homer,maybe you could come over again. i'll cook you my special microwave burritos. i stop the oven when the middle is still a little bit frozen.
29660,Homer,"hey, why'd you lock the door? we're still inside!"
20940,Homer,"moe, you gotta get me outta here. tell the cops i didn't steal the car. say you lent it to me."
40392,Homer,"see you downstairs, boy."
14207,Homer,"y'ello... oh, hi marge..."
29708,Homer,i am so sorry about what happened. but at least you saw what it was like to be married to me for a little while.
24894,Homer,nobody's visiting my web page anymore. my counter is actually going down.
25752,Homer,okay. is that all there is? / is that all there is? / if that's all there is / my friend / then let's keep dancing...
27933,Homer,stop shoving! the little one isn't getting any.
39243,Homer,wow. can i do that?
22802,Homer,"no, no, i'm into chicken."
16172,Homer,"ah, big deal. who needs his money? we're gettin' by okay."
26328,Homer,"professor van doren, so good to see you."
28601,Homer,wait a minute. what is it my dad always said to me?
35812,Homer,"oh marge, this is the most romantic trip you ever nagged me into."
40659,Homer,"yeah, that's more like it! ""oh, i want to be in that rumba / when the saints go over there.... over there... over there."""
30791,Homer,i'm stuck! and i have to pee. now i'm just stuck.
23213,Homer,just take one bite. if you're not one hundred per cent different...
28858,Homer,uh-oh. here comes the gospel according to puke.
33837,Homer,where am i?
34021,Homer,"of course i do, marge. can you still love a man who's half-beer?"
14835,Homer,i miss my couch.
23147,Homer,"okay, this opening scene should be in fast motion. everybody likes that 'cause it looks funny."
13997,Homer,i'm also fat!
20065,Homer,i want candy!
15929,Homer,"we're gonna let her roam free in the backyard, and nature will take its course."
38840,Homer,you have all taught me a christmas message i'll never forget: the place to get drunk is at home.
41395,Homer,i heard you and mommy yelling again last night.
22800,Homer,i'd like to return this barbecue kit.
18893,Homer,"oh, bad dog! bad dog!"
24121,Homer,will cash be okay?
31909,Homer,"i couldn't find maggie's brand, but i got every other kind i could find. how about ""syntho-nip?"""
27822,Homer,"puzzle piece, come out and play-ay."
28713,Homer,"that's great. i'm honored to drink to apu and, uh... apulina."
38265,Homer,"once intoxicated, we had a great idea."
24919,Homer,who are you and why are you holding me here? i want answers now or i want them eventually.
39815,Homer,but where will i sleep?
16518,Homer,"wait. i see what's happening here. you're just mad because everyone in this town loves gambling except for you. well, that's just sad."
15345,Homer,"so i says, ""kiss my asphalt."" hmm? hmm?"
33931,Homer,one cheese cube couldn't hurt.
17467,Homer,they didn't start chasing us until you turned on that getaway music.
38420,Homer,i see.
34488,Homer,"oh man, this is so awesome! i can't believe i'm having breakfast where the cops do."
32805,Homer,why you little--
18418,Homer,i got someone to cover for me.
24846,Homer,that's right! top of the line!
28680,Homer,no! they were all in their own way totally awesome.
38872,Homer,"yeah, you really went with the purple theme."
23370,Homer,"he's undead, all right."
16529,Homer,"lisa, your mom still loves you. it's just that she has a career, now. she's a slot jockey."
38072,Homer,"uh, listen, boy... maybe you should spend more time with your old best friend. you know, dweebler."
37047,Homer,oh my god. oh my god. this counts as a walk!
26679,Homer,"bill clinton, everyone! he's jimmy carter with a fox attitude."
39358,Homer,"well, i bet it's nothing a little turpentine won't take off. come on, son."
34662,Homer,"or frasier on ""frasier."""
19919,Homer,"geez, that dog has more education than i do. he's some kinda super dog. hey, where'd he go?"
36549,Homer,woo hoo!
24909,Homer,but i don't know anything. at least i don't think i do.
31541,Homer,i've never seen marge like a dvd about a place so much. i'm gonna make her dream come true... by downloading that movie onto her ipod.
15142,Homer,"bart, don't tell your mother, but i brought you some pizza."
26544,Homer,"marge, it's called negotiating."
21291,Homer,"sorry, son, daddy's down for the day. why don't you go capture me some more potato salad?"
23921,Homer,"listen, i worked long and hard for this place. and no one's going to take it away from me. not you, not its rightful owner, not anybody."
40612,Homer,"i'll try this little pink one, here. hmmm, very good. another one."
19720,Homer,"yes. i certainly do. hello there, itchy. i know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish i would go away, but i think we got off on the wrong foot. i know i can come off a little proactive, and for that i'm sorry. but if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog nobody wanted, i know we can make 'em laugh -- and cry -- until we grow old together."
24775,Homer,i'm just trying to work up the courage to ask burns for a raise. or a highly-paid internship. something to solve my money woes.
17124,Homer,"chlorine, eh?"
40138,Homer,hey! pretty slick!
20426,Homer,"i knew it. slowing down already, huh?"
26555,Homer,maybe the red one...
40335,Homer,"sorry, marge. but it's just that i'm still steamed up about that jerk flanders. lousy... bragging... know-it-all... show-off..."
38011,Homer,maggie?!
34332,Homer,well how could i ever hit the hamper if you don't let me practice!
27289,Homer,"just fix it, mr. sasswrench."
25820,Homer,"well, i... there. right as rain, there."
39435,Homer,"don't correct the man, brat. oh, boss, look what we brought... gelatin desserts."
36850,Homer,"thanks, baby. here, have a bracelet made of a seventies educational film strip."
13494,Homer,"she's right. okay, think, homer. don't panic. they don't pick up the mail till noon. there's still time!"
30548,Homer,"bloop, bloop, bloop. bloop, bloop, bloop."
22566,Homer,"c'mon, kids, i went too far."
24343,Homer,"hi, kids!"
20957,Homer,"five, four, three, two, one, lift-off!"
36674,Homer,did you say my dad worked here?
20760,Homer,good morning everybody.
21509,Homer,money in the bank.
34651,Homer,marge! no! stop packing your--
36014,Homer,"oh marge, this is brilliant."
15187,Homer,i wish i could retire.
14091,Homer,you just lost yourself a customer.
27522,Homer,"look, this church is our only option. don't you kids want to live here?"
24963,Homer,"oh, that's it! you can walk home!"
32306,Homer,"okay, we've got time for one more."
16539,Homer,"you promised lisa to help her with her costume. you made her cry, then i cried. then maggie laughed. she's such a little trooper."
25964,Homer,"oh, i just naturally assumed."
21202,Homer,"so long, chicken bone."
23533,Homer,i think so. the bone stopped the bullet.
14995,Homer,"hello, my animal friends. peace be with you."
28660,Homer,whatever. but i think you look great already.
40128,Homer,oooo! what a haul this year. i love halloween.
13670,Homer,"wouldn't it, flanders?"
18187,Homer,saxa-ma-phone. saxa-ma-phone.
36827,Homer,i would be honored to shake the hand that glazed this.
16344,Homer,"i just thought i'd remind everybody. after all, we did agree to attend his self-help seminar."
27227,Homer,"marge, i'm still not sure about this."
15150,Homer,"well, this time you must be punished."
38441,Homer,"marge, if this stupid, one-reactor town won't put on a fireworks show, i will. i've mapped it out."
29338,Homer,you uh...
20648,Homer,"aw, that's my girl. i love you, marjorie."
41075,Homer,"now marge, honey, honey, honey. come on. come on, don't get upset. it's not the end of the world. we all loved that quilt, but you can't get too attached to..."
33605,Homer,people can't smoke indoors in ireland!
39697,Homer,oh no!
29407,Homer,"hey, it's a guy in a goofy burns head!"
15374,Homer,mmmm. hog fat.
35067,Homer,bart's mad because he wanted me to buy him something but i didn't think it was the right thing to do.
16455,Homer,"ooh, i would live in a big mansion?"
34860,Homer,"oh man, this is great. the most evil man in town is in our power. he will do my bidding... at that fantasy football auction. and anything else my limited imagination can come up with."
20737,Homer,"yeah, we could start our own game, where people throw ducks at balloons, and nothing's the way it seems."
23239,Homer,"hey, you found my needlenose pliers."
21048,Homer,"uh, is the poopdeck really what i think it is?"
19532,Homer,we were sitting in barney's car eating packets of mustard. ya happy?
33587,Homer,lousy old man -- makin' me look up at an airplane!
22770,Homer,"uh, um, uh... i think we should see other people?"
14675,Homer,"okay, fudd me."
15535,Homer,what if i sing to you? i gave my love a chicken that had no bone/ mmmm chicken.
17432,Homer,you're both right.
24406,Homer,look. this is our chance.
32341,Homer,"moe the tavern, not moe the person."
31691,Homer,"uh, this is eduardo, my pool boy. he thinks he's an angry rich man."
25069,Homer,"i know, ranch dressing."
16447,Homer,"let's have a little quality time together, just you and me."
37769,Homer,"oh, no, i'm shopping for homer junior, a baby i delivered in an elevator the night i pretended to go to work but was really playing poker!"
34149,Homer,"""when i rode with abe simpson on the tinseltown starliner, i never dreamed his first voyage would be his last? at three o'clock on monday, abe passed away peacefully in his sleep."""
15733,Homer,when i was 17.
37099,Homer,it helps me write.
38796,Homer,"marge, think about what you're saying. it's sir isaac newton's birthday!"
38300,Homer,"ooh, pepperoni!"
24018,Homer,what is this place?!
23050,Homer,"no, no japan. jamaica! i wanna pass the doochie on the lefthand side."
30971,Homer,"see, it goes: ship's wheel, popeye tattoo, gilligan hat, fish with boobs... and back to ship's wheel."
14408,Homer,it's a date! so... do you think the cowboys will beat the spread?
27627,Homer,"welcome to the real world, hippies!"
25922,Homer,sorry.
21674,Homer,what's next?
29721,Homer,aha! huh?
13791,Homer,sure. moe.
22958,Homer,good thing those lesbians knew cpr.
32678,Homer,"happy valentine's day, and shut your gob."
21462,Homer,"bart, i told you not to leave that tv on."
41538,Homer,i've never heard that noise before. are you sick?
23562,Homer,ow!
30230,Homer,"face it, marge -- catholics rule. we've got boston, south america, the good part of ireland, and we're making serious inroads in mozambique, baby!"
36294,Homer,i'm giving you your wish: to be a real boy.
13549,Homer,the boy! this isn't fair! how can you tell who's sane and who's insane?
41107,Homer,"i can't tell you how sorry i am, dad."
29305,Homer,they're a family again. and so are we. what happened?
39912,Homer,hmmm.
14634,Homer,a dinosaur.
34722,Homer,"you know what, honey? just because we can't afford to keep that handbag, doesn't mean that you two can't have one night at the most glamorous place in town."
16609,Homer,"well, no matter what the paper says, i still have a job to do."
33858,Homer,where are my videogames? my x-box?! my wii?!
24941,Homer,bad dog.
16086,Homer,"yeah, you've won this round, dean. but the war isn't over."
32090,Homer,this is wonderful.

21164,Homer,"enfeebled?! oo, i know just the guy! be right back."
27145,Homer,woo hoo!
16463,Homer,"lisa, look out behind you!"
35609,Homer,"uh-oh, it's old man burns!"
21003,Homer,it's my first day.
24560,Homer,oh no!
23206,Homer,"it's all about trust, honey."
36773,Homer,"sorry, boss."
14317,Homer,"yeah, that timmy is a real hero."
35458,Homer,but you learned! you grew!
32782,Homer,"yeah, that's what i mean."
19429,Homer,outstanding.
38642,Homer,the eyes in that picture are following me.
35613,Homer,"thy will be done, lord vader. please don't hurt me. please."
29029,Homer,"that's really sweet, honey."
21878,Homer,great. i'll go shoot myself for bringing this up.
17058,Homer,i went on for hours and they were hanging on my every word. i really think i was born to teach.
26961,Homer,now to spend some quality time away from my family.
35142,Homer,what?! what's wrong with being roman polanski?
40970,Homer,"no, i've called all three herbert powells in detroit. nothing."
15512,Homer,"simpson, homer simpson / he's the greatest guy in history / from the town of springfield / he's about to hit a chestnut tree"
15578,Homer,two more feet and i can fit it in the fridge.
39305,Homer,it is?
35934,Homer,"now lisa, i'm an entertainer. and you can't entertain and inform at the same time. and if you're access hollywood, you do neither!"
20588,Homer,"wow, sweetheart. look at all this seized booty. we could find the drug boat of our dreams!"
37272,Homer,even after we came to school?
35135,Homer,"that's it, boy! i'm eating your yogurt!"
17360,Homer,"well, you can't possibly like maggie best. what has she ever done? nothin' for nobody!"
31037,Homer,she's opening her eyes!
34275,Homer,she used to be my therapist.
19128,Homer,"tired, eh? what you guys need... is hammocks."
15525,Homer,it's my life-long dream.
30351,Homer,"finally, back in the only safe bedroom in the house."
16254,Homer,mmmm... convenient.
21360,Homer,"this may not be the top, but it's as close as a simpson's ever gonna get."
37007,Homer,if jesus had a gun he'd be alive today.
24309,Homer,so you missed some big changes at moe's. he hangs newspapers over the urinals now. you can read the sports page while you pee. very la-di-da.
13996,Homer,"oh, my god. i don't know jack about my boy... i'm a bad father!"
35983,Homer,unspool it into my mouth till that card is at zero.
32855,Homer,"prove it, hollywood!"
31103,Homer,look at that line.
15823,Homer,tell him i'm going to the back seat of my car with the woman i love. and i won't be back for ten minutes.
39343,Homer,"wow! what are you readin' there? comic books? uh, guess you don't want to overheat the old noggin, eh?"
17699,Homer,mmm... urinal fresh.
17968,Homer,"good idea, marge. my mind is going a mile a minute."
37701,Homer,"what happened to us, eduardo? we had so many things we were going to do."
30463,Homer,woo hoo! pizza for breakfast!
35423,Homer,fine.
37151,Homer,i think it's a terence malick movie.
17620,Homer,the black panthers?
30482,Homer,sweet home alabama...
31476,Homer,"oh, your elbow's like an angel's kiss. but you still have to go."
26042,Homer,"i'm sorry i shot you, moe."
26960,Homer,"she's just like clark kent. when there's lots of excitement, she's nowhere to be found. nighty-night, sweetie."
23027,Homer,"come on, lisa! monkeys!"
14149,Homer,"marge, it's not the money. my job is my identity. if i'm not a safety whatchamajigger, i'm nothing."
25766,Homer,"yes, through the magic of caring."
16602,Homer,"dad, the best way for you to help is to set a good example. just stand around and don't steal anything."
14479,Homer,"now, marge. maggie was very young. it's not like we got so attached to her. no. marge, isn't life funny? one day they're babies, the next thing you know, they're off on their own. oh."
13679,Homer,"oh, come on, lisa. i'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt. he's usually all happy and comfortable and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel... what's the opposite of that shameful joy thing of yours?"
32724,Homer,nothing!
33374,Homer,woo hoo!
26460,Homer,and don't you forget it.
37431,Homer,"wow, is that what your wife did?"
20967,Homer,"what way, angel pie?"
32869,Homer,sit on a bench! sit on a bench!
21155,Homer,"it's hard to believe there's a place worse than america, but we found it."
34856,Homer,i thought he was an old clump of rags.
19721,Homer,"now, kids -- i know you loved the old poochie...but the new one's going to be better than ten superbowls. i don't want to oversell it. judge for yourselves."
35698,Homer,is this the chemical kitchen place where you do the crazy cooking?
30673,Homer,the only tummy ache is in my head. i can't stop wondering who my real father might be.
41156,Homer,"oh, why did i have to start my diet on pork chop night?"
17046,Homer,"down the hall, room twelve."
27876,Homer,weird al yankovic!
17663,Homer,listen carefully and my words will shape images as clear as any tv show. it was a tumultuous time for our nation. the clear beverage craze gave us all a reason to live.
19537,Homer,"oh, marge, i've never felt so alone. no one believes me. uh, this is the part where you're supposed to say ""i believe you, homer."""
34341,Homer,must apologize. must apologize.
15865,Homer,hmmm.
32832,Homer,hmm... that sounds like tress macneille.
17152,Homer,hey! get off my sugar! bad bees! bad!
17238,Homer,"lisa, don't contradict your elders."
28584,Homer,that's right. no questions asked.
14130,Homer,"well, i happen to know that he won't sell it for less than 100 million dollars."
19174,Homer,dressing?
29261,Homer,why don't you just kiss her?
30287,Homer,"oh, the rubiest. ooh look! a new restaurant chain!"
23745,Homer,"you and me, chopper to chopper."
17240,Homer,back you robots! nobody ruins my family vacation but me. and maybe the boy.
13647,Homer,"oh, here we go again. look, i don't care if ned flanders is the nicest guy in the world, he's a jerk. end of story."
26793,Homer,"hey, apu, i think she likes you."
39038,Homer,you really came back from that tommy john surgery.
17908,Homer,"i was ashamed, marge. i failed you as a husband and a provider, and at best, i was a b-plus dog. i'll understand if you want to sleep on the couch tonight."
26105,Homer,"yeah, nothing is hurt except feelings."
19930,Homer,laddie?
14456,Homer,let go!
13349,Homer,not those peanuts. the ones at the bottom.
27623,Homer,you don't understand. it's not just a sandwich. it's about brotherhood. it's about freedom. it's about three days since i've had one! i'm getting the shakes... and i'm getting the fries!
38105,Homer,oh yeah!
16428,Homer,"see, i got this friend named... joey joe joe junior... schabadoo."
22288,Homer,serves you little punks right. maybe next time you'll think befo--
31918,Homer,"that's ridiculous. if i had set up those dominoes, i'd be wearing my special domino-setting up kneepads."
25036,Homer,hey? mountain dew?!
40558,Homer,"no, of course you're not going to die. everything's fine!"
23657,Homer,decided? that's classic. decided. babies just happen.
28194,Homer,"okay, that's good! stop there!"
35273,Homer,--just to counteract the self-confidence--
25086,Homer,"see? now wouldn't you love to see that move, performed by a cartoon possum?"
15849,Homer,why'd i laugh?
18776,Homer,but i think the dodo went extinct...
36474,Homer,i'm sure some idiot somewhere agrees with me.
22002,Homer,"let's see. one, two, three... six whiskeys!"
36832,Homer,no one would ever think you're a lame old man.
16530,Homer,"it's always something isn't it? first, i have to drive your pregnant mother to the hospital so she can give birth to you, and now this."
39184,Homer,"well, i was taking a moment to enjoy my after dinner night cap..."
28658,Homer,i also fed some ducklings.
28217,Homer,"all right, i will."
24059,Homer,finally.
25641,Homer,can you drive me to shelbyville hospital?
27725,Homer,"i finally harnessed the awesome power of the hook. well, time for work."
39873,Homer,you mean all white with pink eyes?
34289,Homer,"but this time, on ice!"
38026,Homer,"moe, that's great. how do you get your ideas?"
38354,Homer,sit down.
25589,Homer,overtime for bag boys? ridiculous!
38330,Homer,yo. where's my body?
37468,Homer,it's too small to read.
40346,Homer,wait! wait! there's more...
23072,Homer,looks like he's doing a commercial.
24828,Homer,but it's so much money.
23830,Homer,use your brains to help us. your delicious brains.
20457,Homer,"well, if quitting is the best, maybe i should just quit my job."
41295,Homer,"just smile, nod... and stall, stall, stall..."
28187,Homer,i wish i was death again. that was cool.
23117,Homer,"aww, movie tickets! that hardly seems worth destroying a car."
36371,Homer,"i'unno... lotta barefoot kids kicking soccer balls, shell necklaces... they really hid the poverty nicely."
27226,Homer,"it's not a time machine, moe."
39933,Homer,"well, if the crime is making me laugh, they're all guilty."
17071,Homer,"so, little lisa, apple of my eye. how are things down at the ol' schoolhouse?"
16296,Homer,oh my god. they're gonna drive right into it just to teach us men a lesson. and it's all my fault!
17062,Homer,"look, marge, you don't know what it's like. i'm the one there everyday, putting his ass on the line. and i'm not out of order. you're out of order. the whole freakin' system is out of order. you want the truth? you want the truth? you can't handle the truth. 'cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do. forget it, marge - it's chinatown."
22942,Homer,"yeah, they're not great."
31053,Homer,"those ""freaks,"" as you call them, are some of our closest friends."
41520,Homer,"marge, i need both hands for this game. can you feed me nachos while i play?"
27594,Homer,"woo hoo! i rule this pseudo sport! come back to me, boy!"
26024,Homer,we're rockin' great!
16444,Homer,uhhh.
25670,Homer,hotel? why don't you just stay at ned's place?
25170,Homer,"did you say ""smockron""?"
39819,Homer,"motel, i guess."
21034,Homer,marge!
32402,Homer,"...that's why, to this day, you never see a shark with monkey arms."
27847,Homer,"oh, i didn't realize you've been counting the years. is it that horrible living with me?"
25068,Homer,bring me my ranch-dressing hose.
20039,Homer,"yeah, yeah, that's his problem. he's a nut. it's not about me being lazy, it's about him being a crazy nut!"
16859,Homer,"son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose. it's how drunk you get."
29507,Homer,or maybe a manwich...
39085,Homer,"ditto. you know i've always wanted to blindly follow somebody, and i think you just might be the guy."
38685,Homer,look at me! i'm bart!
36148,Homer,did you guys see that stupid foul call in the game last night?
15053,Homer,"lisa, if you could have one wish, what would it be?"
38818,Homer,"well, if i've gotta spend christmas eve alone, at least no one will see me."
33626,Homer,how'd you check?!
17798,Homer,"i'm beat, and after work i've got to dedicate a new jiffy lube and co-host the ace awards."
41504,Homer,take out wrenched ankle.

28483,Homer,"fine, we'll play it your way."
24973,Homer,they have any father-and-son grifts?
14209,Homer,oh.
25177,Homer,"that's not gonna do it, marge. you need something red."
21602,Homer,"as long as you're here annoying me, let's have a brainstorming session. now, here's how it works: lisa, you say one thing, then bart, you say another. just toss out things and i'll use my inventive mind to combine them into a brilliant original idea."
28937,Homer,"yeah, he's crazy all right."
25548,Homer,mmmm... turbulent.
32080,Homer,me? but that's you!
39822,Homer,"don't listen to him, marge, he's..."

40891,Homer,"oooh, thank you, moe! i always wanted one of these."
15249,Homer,"heh heh, i know what you mean. just let me make sure we're not talking about food."
38775,Homer,i'll never have a per diem.
15226,Homer,i've got a better idea -- get the hell out!
29061,Homer,"no, not him! anyone but him! i've had my problems with him. everyone has. but like every monster, he just wants to be loved."
15013,Homer,"hey ganesha, want a peanut?"
21428,Homer,you mean there's been cake in our freezer for eleven years? why was i not informed?
20875,Homer,"take that, marge!"

29740,Homer,"i'm sorry, moe. marge won't let me spend any money -- even counterfeit money!"
18757,Homer,"dig him up! dig up that corpse!! if you really love jebediah springfield, you'll haul his bones out of the ground to prove my daughter wrong!"
33104,Homer,uh-oh.

39931,Homer,"well, uh... m-maybe you better run off to bed..."
29300,Homer,i thought you two broke up.
21532,Homer,"oh, i can't believe those goons muscled me out of my grease business. i've been muscled out of everything i've ever done, including my muscle-for-hire business."
17325,Homer,"tell me, if he didn't take the money, why is he wearing those fancy clothes?"
33990,Homer,no holds barred.
39373,Homer,i'm no supervising technician. i'm a technical supervisor. i've never done anything worthwhile in my life. i'm a big worthless nothing.
34661,Homer,"man, you're good with the tools when you want to be."
18787,Homer,hello. mr. burns' office.
31977,Homer,"fine, you want out? then go! i can make it on my own! before i met you i had friends and dreams!"

24294,Homer,"wait a minute, barney. you gotta be sober to fly. i mean, it's not like drivin' a car."
16077,Homer,"boy, i can't wait to take some of the starch out of that stuffed shirt."
16202,Homer,"not likely. heh, heh."
35867,Homer,"if those kids can forgive that train wreck of a father, then maybe i can forgive..."
38454,Homer,"no, you're a-wrong!"
29204,Homer,flanders? kill me? you never killed anybody... and you're gonna start with the big dog?
22969,Homer,"don't worry, mr. burns. we're gonna find that monster, no matter how long it takes. besides, i'm getting kind of used to wearing a kilt!"
28398,Homer,can i fight human-style? by slowly poisoning his environment until he loses his fur and becomes sterile?
15430,Homer,eh.
22929,Homer,you flush one down / it swirls around / nine hundred and ninety-nine springs to flush down...
29146,Homer,"now, people have accused this family of not loving our country. but you can't spell u.s.a. without us... eh?"
19553,Homer,it's him!
21286,Homer,"yeah, but can he do this?"
25940,Homer,"i hate to call a judge dirty names, but there's only one way to describe a nasty super witch like her."
35256,Homer,all your money and all your stuff.
19952,Homer,"see that, boy? why aren't you making any business deals?"
35244,Homer,who are you?
26437,Homer,swell.
25933,Homer,"okay, she lives at one ocean view drive. let's start skulking."
15802,Homer,so thirsty... eh. what're you gonna do?
22698,Homer,"ah, touché."
22934,Homer,can't we go home yet? my feet hurt. all this fresh air is making my hair move. and i don't know how much longer i can complain.
37333,Homer,wow. wow. this is the most delicious analogy i've ever eaten. i need to share this insight with marge. put this in your finest styrofoam!
32789,Homer,"all right, that's it, pull over."

15224,Homer,are you kidding? i work like a japanese beaver.
25801,Homer,big deal.
34834,Homer,"what is troubling you, my son? i mean, my girl son?"
23568,Homer,"thank you! thank you! but there was someone else with me on that alley. i'm talkin' about the big man, carl."
34915,Homer,now to take care of the witnesses.
18818,Homer,what am i -- a doctor?
41358,Homer,i'm buying it!
26119,Homer,hey come on...
35926,Homer,"when march madness spills into april -- that's the gravy! when someone messes with you, and you invade the country that did it plus another one -- that's the gravy! when you stick your flag in the moon and say ""now we're done tryin'"" -- that's the gravy!"

20458,Homer,"mr. burns, this is homer j. simpson, the father of the big quitter. well, i just wanted to tell you i'm a big quitter, too, and i quit!"
14045,Homer,"wow, infotainment."
20565,Homer,"okay, folks. get your angel glow sticks! no one gets into heaven without a glow stick!"
22293,Homer,"kids, the carnival's in town for one night only! and they've got cotton candy and hats with feathers and there's no lines because all the stupid kids have curfew! so-- oh, right. sorry."
30036,Homer,i'm not mr. simpson. that ship has sailed. i'm colonel cool! and i'm the captain on this rocket to the stars.
38298,Homer,"don't worry. i won't embarrass you. i will put my napkin in my lap. i will use the utensils provided for me. and if our food is slow in coming i will ""blow my stack"" in a manner befitting the earl of yarborough."
28808,Homer,no way! he's an annoying sneak who's out to steal my wife.
19319,Homer,that doesn't sound like something i'd say.
31898,Homer,"yeah... something has changed, but i can't figure out what. our mattress! i traded it to the lovejoys!"
14390,Homer,"well, lisa, it's daddy-daughter day and daddy needs daughter's picks."
18857,Homer,you made it! did you have any trouble getting past the security guards?
13295,Homer,"mmmmmm, donuts."
21698,Homer,the chair? how come they only do crucifixions during sweeps?
36849,Homer,"but if me and my kids do the same stuff as terence and his kids, i could be a cool dad."
19191,Homer,no one.
35650,Homer,what is perception?
29291,Homer,"you wanna know a little trick? to downsize my derrière, i just tie a sweater around it."
35383,Homer,"lady, i'm not a hairdresser -- i just put a new lid on a couple of trashcans."
23305,Homer,okay.
29846,Homer,"hey marge, why are you with krusty? these kids are too old for clowns."
36372,Homer,"worthless, worthless, worthless..."
23306,Homer,"hm. this pea soup is as weak as the acting, and nowhere near as hammy."
39355,Homer,"can you still see the ball, bart?"
23563,Homer,woo hoo! i'm ten pins away from perfection.
29597,Homer,"yeah, be cool. like us."
26741,Homer,homer mad! homer smash! get revenge on world!
26567,Homer,and in february... it's hot?
30146,Homer,"this theater sucks. my seat's uncomfortable, the screen's only half a screen, and that guy's eating an apple!"
34097,Homer,"you had me at ""five-course,"" you lost me at ""romantic,"" and you got me back at ""dinner."""
39033,Homer,"wow. wow. between your genius and my nothing, we make a great team. come on, give me a hug."
22159,Homer,"aaah, what's the rush? might rain next week."
37980,Homer,"springfield city hall was built for the spencer tracy movie ""meet me at city hall"". it was just a flat wall with nothing behind it for thirty years..."
40191,Homer,"mary bailey. well, if i was governor, i'd sure find better things to do with my time."
32392,Homer,way to go! many happy returns.
26345,Homer,"hey marge, it's that guy who couldn't get any off ya."
32584,Homer,"wait a minute -- if killing myself would make you two happy, then i'm not gonna do it."
34371,Homer,that's all that happened? and i got to miss work?
24639,Homer,"hey, the tv man is talking about us!"
20043,Homer,"lenny, tell mr. burns i've gone home to work on the contest."
21259,Homer,fifty cents? not likely.
37675,Homer,and while i'm at it... burn dumb helpful books!
27389,Homer,"uh, report is a daddy word that means ""loves his daughter."""
31650,Homer,"oh, i can't believe this day is already here: me taking you for your first driving lesson."
39853,Homer,uh-oh. wait a minute. wait a minute. stop the music... quiet please... i have something to say. quiet!
40364,Homer,"okay, that didn't work. this time move your head and don't follow through."

25405,Homer,come on! why won't you go out with bart?
30616,Homer,savages.
39106,Homer,"i've never written an eulogy before, but this time i did. unfortunately, i left it at home."
36633,Homer,um... remember that corvette i had?
28355,Homer,"but we americans are england's children. i know we don't call as often as we should, and we aren't as well-behaved as our goody two-shoes brother canada, who by the way has never had a girlfriend, i'm just sayin'."
39464,Homer,"you think so, huh? well, there's only one way to find out. follow me."
20276,Homer,he's crazy.
36517,Homer,"lousy outdated relics! boy, do you remember what happened the last time we went to new york?"
28512,Homer,"i don't need her, i've got you, astrolabe."
31411,Homer,"one butter-crusted choco-rocket, please."
38565,Homer,hm. that is the kind of nonsense you're always falling for.
37036,Homer,"eat silver, copper!"
19908,Homer,it was in... it was in my pocket.
24657,Homer,no problem.
29453,Homer,i win...

31039,Homer,you monster! what have you done to my face?!
20498,Homer,"marge, i need a small favor. for the next few days, will you pretend to be apu's wife?"
20119,Homer,"hey, uh, could you go across the street and get me a slice of pizza?"
32331,Homer,"hmmm. well, marge, who's the unfit parent now?"
32048,Homer,"i like that. but i'm on a bit of a health kick, so i'll take the low-fat vanilla... with the following mix-ins: snickles, gooey bears, charlottesville chew, nice 'n' many, kat kit, herschel's smooches, mrs. bad bar, and milk dudes."
39997,Homer,so?
23627,Homer,"i'm sorry, maggie. i never realized things between us had gotten this bad."
40041,Homer,"okay. the colors of the italian flag are red, white and what?"
24220,Homer,"oh, moe. there's lots of people uglier than you. like, you ever been to white castle?"
39612,Homer,is that a good siren? am i approved?
16182,Homer,no! my box! my box!
39543,Homer,the den! great idea!
15704,Homer,like what?
16541,Homer,"no no, that's too expensive. just don't do it anymore."
28962,Homer,"marge, you just agreed to raise the kids klingon!"
17395,Homer,"well lisa, remember that post card grampa sent us from florida of that alligator biting that woman's bottom?"
21562,Homer,"oh yeah, they'll put me on a stamp for that."
22692,Homer,what's happening to me? there's still food... but i don't want to eat it. i've become everything i've ever hated.
14782,Homer,forget it. that line didn't work for my dad and it's not gonna work for you.
16764,Homer,wait a minute race! wait a minute. wait!...ah-ha! now i'll bust that pretty face of yours.
32539,Homer,"mmm, pickle..."
18107,Homer,"boy, when marge first told me she was going to the police academy, i thought it'd be fun and exciting, you know, like that movie, ""spaceballs."" but instead, it's been painful and disturbing, like that movie ""police academy."""
16805,Homer,you know stan taylor?
16758,Homer,it's beautiful. it's the most awe inspiring sight i have ever seen.
20185,Homer,lousy traumatic childhood.
34107,Homer,"more vicodin and eggs, please."
41158,Homer,hello? hello? hello taste... where are you?
39069,Homer,"fine. i got it. starting right now, a year-long juice cleanse; every morning, i get a colonic, and i sleep in a sauna every night."
22250,Homer,what if we switched wives? would that help?
31651,Homer,"hey, that jerk cut us off! pull alongside!"
27440,Homer,"wait marge, i don't want you to leave the house without this."
18076,Homer,"yes, it is exhilarating to see the police get their man and save a hysterical woman."
31972,Homer,you stuffed your horn?!
16351,Homer,"so long, suckers!"
28427,Homer,hold on. something doesn't feel right.
29164,Homer,per... our... agreement!
31034,Homer,"mark and tracy, i remember the first words i heard you say: ""i do."""
29073,Homer,"i'm telling you, i'm the pie man!"
30433,Homer,"the sad part is, there were times when i actually had feelings for you. i almost felt i was your father."
18316,Homer,hey!
37744,Homer,"everything will be fine... um... oh you, uh, you like movies? this reminds me of that scene in ""alien."""
29140,Homer,buy me some peanuts and crackerjack... / i don't care if... ow!

34600,Homer,"hey boy, whatcha doing?"
38584,Homer,a ghost!
19088,Homer,"oh yeah. so long, stinktown."
14296,Homer,he's in for some lovin'.
40642,Homer,"till six a.m., my dearest darling and my last day on earth."
36996,Homer,there's no handle on this side!
28880,Homer,"lisa, lisa, your suspicions are important to me and will be answered in the order received. macarthur park is melting in the dark / all that sweet green icing rolling down / someone left my cake out in the li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li- li... li... li... li..."
37274,Homer,i think i have an idea.
26825,Homer,"guys, i just ordered my wife the greatest anniversary present -- a koi pond."
30173,Homer,"um, listen, uh, neighboreeno, i want to start our relationship off on the right foot, so if you need anything... anything at all..."
22704,Homer,"oh, yeah? my left arm says different."
32246,Homer,hey-ey-ey-ey-ey!
35026,Homer,"been a while since our wives got together, huh?"

36857,Homer,t-rex loves decaying industrial-scapes.
24474,Homer,"in about fifteen minutes i'd take off that wedding dress, or you're gonna look crazy."
19597,Homer,"you must hate me, marge. every time i try to help, i just fail miserably."
15114,Homer,"barney! not you, too!"
32233,Homer,"julia, wait!"
14153,Homer,huh? what?
14695,Homer,"lurleen, i can't get your song outta my mind. i haven't felt this way since ""funky town."""
29319,Homer,huh? huh?
27221,Homer,"i know, we'll stay with my very best friend in the world, lenny."
38108,Homer,"gentlemen, i've been thinking. my glorious youth and beauty won't last forever. someday, when the leaves have turned, and the moon has broken apart into chunks of floating cheese, i will be old."
33704,Homer,boy.
25747,Homer,"aw, aren't they sweet. any medical things i should know about?"
35249,Homer,way down here?
16220,Homer,"huh, ooooh, punch!"
17649,Homer,"oh marge, kids, i miss my club."
29087,Homer,"oh, this is so confusing. i'd like a brief recess."
35945,Homer,what's this? some kind of bi-centennial lemon party?
36502,Homer,"i love my homer face yeah that's what i said / right where it should be on the front of my head / stubble, muzzle, overbite, two eyes that really bug / these are the components of my homer-riffic mug / d'oh, oooh, d'oh, oooh, / i shave it close, trim hairs from my nose / d'oh, oooh, d'oh, oooh, i clean my ears, 'cause that's how i hears / i like my / i like my / i really like my homer face"

27339,Homer,purple rain!
27830,Homer,the only dangerous amount is none!
34517,Homer,"we're not gonna get whacked. because you're chief clancy wiggum, and you're gonna figure a way out of this."
16622,Homer,it's mine!
33789,Homer,ant poison? why do i always read the labels after?
28421,Homer,that's funny.
33917,Homer,this montage sounds really exhausting. how 'bout i just do a walking around sad montage?
27415,Homer,we'll just tell the police and then i'm back to being plain old rock strongo.
19783,Homer,"hunting, eh?"
29798,Homer,"really? you mean eat cheese, gnaw through electrical cords, things like that?"
22880,Homer,is he that jerk that revealed the magicians' secrets?
15806,Homer,arrrgh!

27346,Homer,"lisa, nobody likes a shill."
33829,Homer,ha! i can see them now with their bald heads and their blue-haired wives. how i despise them.
17958,Homer,"it's just you and me now, lock of hair..."
28965,Homer,i say you don't exist!
14866,Homer,"well, when is he gonna act like it?"
37259,Homer,just what do you want?!
37794,Homer,"hey, oh oh oh! now maggie, we don't hurt each other in this family."
18003,Homer,"no, no, let me finish. i just want you to know i've always been proud of you. you're my greatest accomplishment and you did it all yourself. you helped me understand my own wife better and taught me to be a better person. but you're also my daughter, and i don't think anybody could have had a better daughter than you--"
24507,Homer,i want to set the record straight. i thought the cop was a prostitute.
18156,Homer,sure! i've had it up to here with these damn rickets!
31499,Homer,angelica was trapped in the suffoclock of sandy doom...
21300,Homer,"yeah, well, i've humiliated my son for the last time. i'm going to get into shape."
38694,Homer,"oh, marge, i can't stand it when you cry at dinner. the pork chops look traumatized. the mashed potatoes can't stand watch. even the children seem upset. so trust me, i will come through for you, baby."
22460,Homer,give something back? boo! get a haircut!
17519,Homer,"but, i keep tellin' ya, i'm not a pilot."
27196,Homer,"with the economy the way it is, you're lucky you get soup."
24016,Homer,"hey, where'd you go?... little man?"
32052,Homer,what's this?!
20659,Homer,oopsie.
36986,Homer,wow. your end of the world is better than my during the world.
23122,Homer,"uh, you're thinking about me, right?"
21971,Homer,uh...
31084,Homer,do you know what you just gave up?!
14787,Homer,"son, come here. heh, heh, heh. of course i'm not mad. if something's hard to do, then it's not worth doing. you just stick that guitar in the closet next to your short wave radio, your karate outfit, and your unicycle and we'll go inside and watch tv."
34150,Homer,how would he know grampa was going to die today? unless... he was going to kill him! but would someone really kill a man just to win a pulitzer prize?
32277,Homer,"ah, my first tow."
22227,Homer,eeech.
30784,Homer,fine.
39838,Homer,"so what should i do, marge?"

14859,Homer,"all right, herb, i'll lend you the two thousand bucks. but you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother."
26901,Homer,"all right, but not the imported."
25805,Homer,"oh, it shows. i was gonna say something, but i thought it might sound you know, weird."
21753,Homer,"aw, four a.m. now i'll never get back to..."
21680,Homer,tell bart to come home!
30923,Homer,"yep, my lucky day."
20355,Homer,"hi, i'm homer s."
13187,Homer,did he have any hobbies?
15992,Homer,"well, anyway, we were all getting tired of--"
20200,Homer,"marge, he's five. his life is over. lisa's the wave of the future."
29360,Homer,"lenny, carl! how ya doin'?"
20462,Homer,"i'm feelin' kinda low, apu. you got any of that beer that has candy floatin' in it? you know, ""skittlebrau""?"
20673,Homer,"oh no, there's that angry mob again."
36803,Homer,hope is all around me!
28305,Homer,we've gone on plenty of great vacations.
27595,Homer,"aw, that's the dumbest thing i ever heard, you stupid little kid."

37493,Homer,you can't not do it!
19061,Homer,"see, marge? who needs a car wash when you can just drive around in the rain."
28322,Homer,"you can't bet on my kids. this is america, pal!"
18637,Homer,"table five, table five..."
25517,Homer,that's me! safety dance!
40491,Homer,why that little liar! i should... and i was gonna play pickle with him.
30550,Homer,"now, restaurant matchbooks for everyone!"
21309,Homer,"hmm... a bushel of apples packed in each bar, plus a secret ingredient that unleashes the awesome power of apples. wow."
25592,Homer,you must be the most boring woman on earth.

21017,Homer,"well, guys, i won't be seeing you for a while."
34921,Homer,why couldn't it have been me?
39821,Homer,barney!
29677,Homer,"how about that selma, flying all of us to china for no apparent reason?"
37556,Homer,how did we get here?

40835,Homer,"""myth: cable piracy is wrong. fact: cable companies are big faceless corporations, which makes it okay."""
30122,Homer,"oh, he'll be fine. and you could still spare my family by--"
39365,Homer,"but -- son, if you don't come out i can't ""hug"" you... and ""kiss you""... and make you feel all better."
28907,Homer,uh-huh. when does training start?
15017,Homer,"fire! what do i do? what do i do? oh, the song! the song! when a fire starts to burn / there's a lesson you must learn / something... something, then you'll see/you'll avoid catastrophe!"
37496,Homer,"...""weapons which they immediately threw down in surrender. the carlsons then let the barbarians in the back gate and joined in the sacking, the looting...and the volcano-ing of the village elders."
31094,Homer,"yeah, i have their baseball cards."
37395,Homer,"marge, you're deleting the two thousand nine oscar red carpet! there were some awesome dresses! and quite a few dis-as-ters."
21541,Homer,"okay, turn on the suction."
38866,Homer,that's right. pick the only two times in history where things got messy.
30149,Homer,i'm stuck. why did i eat that apple segment?
36995,Homer,"creepy? marge, the apocalypse is coming. maybe not tomorrow, maybe never, but it's coming... and soon."
16085,Homer,"in there, guys."
23699,Homer,promise you won't laugh?
32101,Homer,i'm so happy!
33778,Homer,"i see. well, maybe you're not ready for this book. it is more of a big girl thing."
22069,Homer,ow!
25390,Homer,leeches!
18528,Homer,"simpson, homer simpson / he's the greatest guy in history / from the town of springfield / he's about to hit a chestnut tree"
33045,Homer,"eh, he won't get far. not on the crappy breakfast i made for him."
29899,Homer,"oh sorry, son. i wanted you to bring me the stack of tiles from the top shelf. hey, ray's here!"
15260,Homer,fine. i'll look it up.
31394,Homer,i love these covered bridges. it's like driving through cute little houses.
20538,Homer,sheesh! you're the most paranoid family i've ever been affiliated with.
32439,Homer,marge! marge!
29612,Homer,"but i'm only two hundred dollars short of fourteen thousand, eight hundred dollars."
26683,Homer,it's true we're losing money...
39672,Homer,wah-neh! wah-neh!
41131,Homer,"so, have you figured out who gets the money?"
38670,Homer,we're here.
17718,Homer,"well who wouldn't be upset? that new baby in your mother's womb was a ticking time bomb threatening to blow this family eight ways from sunday! hey, where're you going?"
30803,Homer,"sure! you're gonna be all ""i'm-so-stupid! i'm-so-stupid! i'm-so-stupid!"""
17371,Homer,they wouldn't be if you were willing to sit in a hollowed-out wheelchair.
26447,Homer,yes!
38164,Homer,what'll it take to buy your silence?
24880,Homer,what if i just whisper it?
24126,Homer,i'll pay you later.
25316,Homer,this session's under.

30003,Homer,"wait. yes, it's staying down. oh no, it's not! yes it is. no it's not! yep. no. yep. no! yep. no! yep. no. yep. no. yep. no."
33628,Homer,maybe we could bury the rocket ship inside the cake. and that would be a big surprise because i'd forget about it pretty quick.
29989,Homer,where will i sleep?
30856,Homer,i mean the one at the house.
22481,Homer,"sleep tight, hooty."
39267,Homer,"nobody knows. it's a secret. i didn't get my bonus this year, but to keep the family from missing out on christmas, i'd do anything."
35738,Homer,the king of fantasy books on our fantasy book-writing team?
14619,Homer,"oh, come on! i'm sorry, but we just can't afford it. marge, make him stop."
33986,Homer,"marge, i tried my best to talk you out of this. but since you're going through with it, i beg you, just stay out of his way and don't get hurt."
29174,Homer,extree! extree! man driving erratically throws papers out window!
41486,Homer,why does she get to eat before the reception?
29928,Homer,real.
40537,Homer,"oh. what's wrong, marge?"
34928,Homer,you'll be oh so pleased / when the o.j. is freshly-squeezed / and toast is made from homemade
21116,Homer,maybe. but first i need to hear about some other crimes to get me fired up.
37635,Homer,should've chopped off bart's head long ago.
16669,Homer,you're selling what now?
38211,Homer,'cause i'm a grade school hero / lisa never lies / i'm a grade school hero / and heroes never die / just one guitar! slung way down low / yeah one guitar! / where did my lawnmower go?!
24271,Homer,"gold bars discovered by marge? zero. gold bars discovered by homer? well, let's just see..."
36500,Homer,"i cheat on my diet but nobody knows 'cause the damage is on the inside and the first warning sign is sudden death. so, honey, what do you say?"
20870,Homer,now that's a fight i wanna be a part of.
17554,Homer,"tell me the truth! don't tell her i raised my voice. don't. happy family, happy family."
18232,Homer,"what was it? 50-60 thousand dollars? ... moe? look, maybe it would help if you went over all the mistakes you made from the beginning... moe?"
27148,Homer,i bet you would.
25400,Homer,"you know, standing up for the little guy felt good. i'm gonna do it more often."
34525,Homer,how long has this been running?
39179,Homer,"nice. you know, it wouldn't be a revue without songs. tell me about one."
13732,Homer,don't lie to me boy.
33831,Homer,that's not enough.
28753,Homer,"hey, apu, what's with the line?"
29534,Homer,today we're working on poor sportsmanship.
29836,Homer,hey! come back with my patio furniture!

17828,Homer,hey! i'm doing it! i'm doing it! i'm the greatest clown in the world!
30768,Homer,and don't you try to stop us.
26463,Homer,who told you?!
37070,Homer,"oh yeah? the tornado was more of a father to me than you! okay, how about my brother? he's rich."
23082,Homer,i didn't... what is it? lunch?
38114,Homer,"all you gals like chicken dinners, marge."
17249,Homer,phew.
32335,Homer,"what?! oh my god, my sweet margie! okay, listen very carefully: don't do anything they say, remain panicky, and above all, try to be a hero."
19568,Homer,"wait, wait, wait, wait, wait -- back up a bit now. when are the pancakes coming in the mail?"
41233,Homer,pick up bart! pick up bart!
31931,Homer,zombie file grievance.
30976,Homer,"oh lord, please let the soldiers kill this family instead of me."
39747,Homer,"ah, sounds delightful. just you and me and the balladeers."
32786,Homer,"now practice preening to the crowd, el guapo."
24950,Homer,"gee, i wish i could, son, but we've already left the gift shop."
26671,Homer,"as a reminder, marge."
36555,Homer,nope. / not me. / do we even still have that thing?
22592,Homer,woo hoo! let's party!
20194,Homer,"oh, all right. what a- burn it! send it to hell!"
16867,Homer,what's the point of all this cleaning? are we so vain?
35426,Homer,who's alone in the vehicle?
18382,Homer,i don't want to look like a weirdo. i'll just go with a muu-muu.
16221,Homer,correction. free blood.
13607,Homer,then i heard the sound that all arctic explorers dread: the pitiless bark of the sea lion. he'll be killed!
35804,Homer,"of course, of course. family is everything to us company men. now, where shall we go on your vacation?"
35856,Homer,"hey, sweetie. marge said there was some family tension. and at christmas of all times."
25408,Homer,"and face it, you're no prize either. you wear braces, you dress like a kid and you're not gettin' any younger. take what you can get."
18863,Homer,"oh, that'd be great! sleeping bags on the floor, a roaring fire... it'll be just like the time they kicked me out of the sporting-goods store."
36344,Homer,"thank you all for coming to my ""stranded"" discussion group!"
25515,Homer,"so am i, but i don't get all huffy about it."
35447,Homer,blimp assassin three.
24887,Homer,"thank you, folks. and now i'm off to expose more secret conspiracies and..."
37761,Homer,"wow. so now there's two things named after me -- a baby, and a law banning air horns after three a.m."
24112,Homer,"well, why didn't you say so?"
39574,Homer,"oh, so that's it. this is some kind of underwear thing."
21435,Homer,"oh. no. no, i'm the guy. i'm supposed to, uh..."
40086,Homer,"well, sir, they cut the head off a fish and chop up the rest into sticks, and then put seasoned bread crumbs on them."
20093,Homer,my vehicle!
34554,Homer,haven't you learned anything from watching bart drive?
24999,Homer,dad?
39199,Homer,there's no time to be careful.
27882,Homer,"all right, all right."
39322,Homer,"oh, no. he can't mean that."
33377,Homer,"wait a second. if i'd been class president like i was supposed to, i'd be the one with the big mansion and the color tvs and the hot wife!"
21549,Homer,uhh... north... kilt... town?
20876,Homer,"woop, sorry son. i didn't know you, jay leno, and a monkey were bathing a clown."
37065,Homer,"now i know you kids are scared by what happened, but it's bedtime. just go into your dark rooms and shut your eyes."
25849,Homer,"well, i am missing the back of my head. i think you could cut me some slack."
18680,Homer,yay!! we're getting a new tv!!
15175,Homer,"i know you're upset right now, so i'll pretend you didn't say that."
32411,Homer,i gotta find out what color marge's eyes are.
38157,Homer,"are they, marge? if you think about it, aren't they really just the parents of a kid who happens to hang out with our kid?"
19863,Homer,"oh, i'm not going to lie to you, marge. so long!"
21605,Homer,"a-- wait a minute! these aren't exciting new products! you're not even trying. okay, that's it. both of you go to your rooms and spank yourselves."
41347,Homer,"she's right, it was all me!"
21110,Homer,"quiet, honey, you don't know how big this government is. it goes all the way to the president."
19162,Homer,"you just don't understand football, marge."
22733,Homer,"relax, everybody! the navitron auto-drive system is driving the truck for me! but keep it a secret! it's a big scam! okay?"
38525,Homer,"seriously, i am getting so tired of those stupid flandersisms."
25385,Homer,check it out. i built myself a healthy apple.
35570,Homer,"bart, i wanna ask you about something i read in a magazine. are you boys cyberbullying each other?"
14897,Homer,sounds interesting.

29508,Homer,"oh, the prid is gone."
26592,Homer,sweet. sweet! sweet!
36711,Homer,doodie.

27982,Homer,"who are you, my biographer?"
35549,Homer,"no, not the middle seat!"
28853,Homer,"all good points. sleep tight, my drunken angel."
25554,Homer,ow! my eye!
29303,Homer,open.
24128,Homer,i can't do it. i can't kill a man!
17213,Homer,no.
31573,Homer,"you did the right thing, boy."
34605,Homer,who wants feet steak?
21525,Homer,oh i'll say. look at that redheaded kid. there must be twenty dollars' worth of grease on his forehead alone.
31631,Homer,"oh, right -- revenge!!"
25315,Homer,i think you're underreacting.
32566,Homer,"well, let's see how you do against twenty-year-old homer."
37105,Homer,"don't worry, marge. we'll get 'em. unless we die on this icy mountain road. then they've won forever."
18773,Homer,"um, what do i do in case of fire?"
26948,Homer,"i've been driving all night, hand's wet on the wheel... there's a voice in my head that drives my heel... it's my baby callin' on the telephone... i got some pizza and i'm bringin' it home..."
31380,Homer,"oooh, moe's a poet! he has a soul! flutter your wings! it's teatime in buttercup junction!"
30713,Homer,send up two hams!
13995,Homer,"oh, that's a hobby!"
38216,Homer,ooh!
36818,Homer,"where did these ""devil donuts"" come from?"
13190,Homer,they had a sale on skulls.
34908,Homer,you said nobody gets hurt. those were your exact words!
33504,Homer,he's nailing something to our door.
20508,Homer,"hey! they got chairs with wheels, and here i am using my legs like a sucker!"
14622,Homer,i know you're a good man... and i have a dog that's very sick...
17813,Homer,i want a free car because i'm krusty. krusty the clown! get it? krus-ty!
38535,Homer,familyicious.
40601,Homer,"oh, try me."
15355,Homer,"maggie, can you say ""daddy""? dad-dy?"
40807,Homer,"i was afraid you'd cancel our date so i stayed away from you completely, even though it meant skipping school for three weeks and graduating this summer... i hope."
32464,Homer,"whoa, whoa, whoa -- slow down, sexy beast. why don't you take some time to savor the front?"
29323,Homer,"oh marge, i'm just being polite."
14400,Homer,"look, what's the problem? the kids are happy, you smell like meryl streep, and i've got that foot massager i've always wanted."
37614,Homer,see?
24053,Homer,i need a shirt! gimme a shirt!
29910,Homer,"yes he does. he's on his way and when he gets here, we'll have ever so much fun! you'll see!"
36540,Homer,"i hope you enjoyed the show tonight. and if you're worried about when the air conditioner fell on my head, rest assured it was a stunt man and his family is being well taken care of."
21058,Homer,hmm. what would the captain say in my spot?
22491,Homer,"oh, they're newlyweds. they'll just talk things out and top it off with some lovin'."
17872,Homer,"uh, could i just get a look at that?"
25680,Homer,"hey, how 'bout that?"
30711,Homer,"aw, dad."

37265,Homer,"it's not for me to judge, ned because... i am the better man!"
36061,Homer,well i've got a really big secret for you... i'm not wearing any underwear.
14331,Homer,"pfft, my heart is just fine."
40426,Homer,the hell with this.
33227,Homer,"dear lisa, you make me so happy... really, really, really happy. sorry, he told me i needed a hundred and forty-four letters. what was my point again? oh right. bouvier or simpson, i cherish you."
34537,Homer,"oh, that's just great. i discover electricity and they want to take it from me!"
14591,Homer,yeah!
27463,Homer,"marge, that was amazing! it's like i'm married to shaft."
22688,Homer,"oh, you're just jealous 'cause you don't have the belly for it anymore. mr. no-belly... mr... hasn't-got-a-belly..."
23806,Homer,"lisa, i'll do the dishes when i pick it out of the chore hat, and it's not a practice. see, there it is. but that was a practice. the system works!"
31839,Homer,so... i thought it went real well. until i swallowed the whistle.
14998,Homer,"yeah, he appeared before me in a dream, and i knew that was special 'cause i usually dream about naked... marge."
37774,Homer,oh baby!
32134,Homer,somebody's gotta do 'em.
36205,Homer,wow!
32899,Homer,my mother's dead.
35091,Homer,"hmm, the boy's acting really weird. i did everything that tv show told me to and he's still not happy."
38070,Homer,i could fly too if i didn't have a wife and three kids!
35977,Homer,leaving? why on earth would you think that?
38362,Homer,flanders! can we borrow your spatula?!
35838,Homer,now i hate him too.
20866,Homer,"that's where you're wrong, pal!"
32329,Homer,gonna make it! gonna make it!
40767,Homer,not to me there isn't!
24867,Homer,"nelson has never steered me wrong, honey. nelson is gold."
20001,Homer,"oh, yeah, they're always trying to screw ya."
41199,Homer,"but you can tell, right? she looks around and sees everybody else's dad with a good education, youthful looks and a clean credit record and thinks, ""why me? what did i do to deserve this fat old piece of -- """
37735,Homer,it's a tough economy. money doesn't grow on trees.
30600,Homer,"charge! i mean, yes sir?!"
40381,Homer,"what, are you afraid to make a real bet?"
31505,Homer,don't say his name! in your mouth it sounds like dirt!
39014,Homer,"hey elon, if you're interested, you could come to the nuclear plant where i work tomorrow."
26072,Homer,are you sure you wanna do this so fast?
38654,Homer,"uh, look, i just wanna ask... can we be friends?"
24311,Homer,"oh, so you're better than me, is that it?"
15851,Homer,"marge, i ate those fancy soaps you bought for the bathroom."
33359,Homer,no. yes.
28766,Homer,"your mother's right, honey. katie couric didn't just become the world's most famous dwarf, she escaped from the circus and went for it!"
28088,Homer,"and now, to all my dear friends, i say... get the hell out of my yard."
27279,Homer,you'll understand someday when you have kids.
28035,Homer,"marge, you don't know what you're saying!"
19506,Homer,"don't worry, i have a plan. i saw this in a movie about a bus that had to speed around a city, keeping its speed over fifty, and if its speed dropped, it would explode. i think it was called ""the bus that couldn't slow down."" first, i hook this common vcr into the security camera system like so..."
19457,Homer,knock it off!
23688,Homer,stupid mongoose! get the snake! the snake! do i look like a snake? ow! ow! he bit me show's over! show's over! next show is eight o'clock and ten!
37413,Homer,the crows weren't racist -- the people who drew them were.
17294,Homer,phew. i'm back.
17842,Homer,"hey, are you like one of those english guards who can't laugh or smile or anything?"
28508,Homer,"oh, this is sadder than ""tuesdays with morrie."""
35013,Homer,are you gonna kill me now? 'cause i'm super ready.
31557,Homer,"a green spinner to build suspense... and then the big finale, the:"
23527,Homer,"so, mindy? how did you want to pay me the hundred and fifty million?"
19600,Homer,woo hoo!
39409,Homer,same here.
25155,Homer,"oh, that would be heaven!"
16603,Homer,hey!
40157,Homer,"the burgers are getting cold, guys. holy moly."
18630,Homer,say. that ayatollah thinks he's better than america. is he right?
31842,Homer,"thanks, honey. after what you said to me, i watched hours and hours of soccer. i almost saw a goal! but there were so many ads for spanish cell phones..."
14141,Homer,cuz... i...
25033,Homer,"i told you, my memory is fuzzy. fuzzy!"
19816,Homer,"or so you'd think, except he's done it so many times before."
33531,Homer,you just rest those rods and coddle those cones -- everything's taken care of.
15735,Homer,one for you... one for me... one for you... one for me...
13844,Homer,huh? what?
33818,Homer,"we can't afford to move to waverly hills! their house prices have commas in them. as it is, our lawn is just green-painted cement."
19194,Homer,"brawled his way up from the boxcars, did he?"
30254,Homer,"look, if you promise never to tell her, i'll let you be in the movie."
28188,Homer,hmm...
29297,Homer,"ah-ha! here's a mistake. it says the capital of kentucky is frankfort. dream on, pal."
27618,Homer,"wow, this is amazing. i could follow the ribwich from town to town."
35587,Homer,ow!
36040,Homer,"it's fun, but not as fun."
26244,Homer,but it's my banjo.
23252,Homer,and mark mcgwire gave you an autographed bat.
29189,Homer,"oh, i can't stand seeing one of my children like this."
29699,Homer,"boy, this is easy. maybe i am the world's greatest acrobat."
36737,Homer,"just listen. if you kill those guys, you'll be as bad as they are."
33288,Homer,that banner has really paid for itself over the years.
26935,Homer,"ooh, ooh! here's my commercial!"
21640,Homer,"i thought i had a great idea, but i must've seen it on this poster."
17404,Homer,y'ello?
32360,Homer,"well, they're not as pretty as you, marge."
19958,Homer,"oh, i hope you learned your lesson, lisa. never help anyone."
39623,Homer,hey flanders! look what i got!
23496,Homer,a sprout!
40107,Homer,"i don't have a thousand bucks! but you do, don't you, marge? you do... you do. you've been squirreling it away, haven't you? saving it for a rainy day, that's what you said, right? right? right?"
37901,Homer,and best of all... we'll never have to sit through another annoying commercial again!
21626,Homer,women will like what i tell them to like. now here's something for everyone.
19094,Homer,promise not to laugh? i always wanted to own the dallas cowboys.
40087,Homer,"well, you only get this tiny little cup of tartar sauce to dip it in and i always run out."
37985,Homer,reality!
21056,Homer,"ooh, comfy."
28056,Homer,my feet are inside me.
19779,Homer,"ohh, my son doesn't stand a chance! the whole world's gone gay!"
20909,Homer,"aw, come on, moe. think of all you have to offer besides money."
40680,Homer,"oh, i really wanted to do that one."
17664,Homer,"the information super-highway showed the average person what some nerd thinks about ""star trek,"" and the domestication of the dog continued unabated."
20335,Homer,"pushy kids think they can tell me what to do in my house. i tell you parents these days, they don't know how to rear children."
16047,Homer,what do i do!? what do i do!? in the name of god you've got to tell me!
17644,Homer,"brothers, brothers."
34237,Homer,"blackmail your father in space, will you?!"
19018,Homer,"people know your name, but you don't know theirs. it's great."
31221,Homer,"not if i can help it, lisa!"
22355,Homer,run!
22650,Homer,"i'm sorry, lisa. oh, it's not your fault. i know we love each other, dad, but we're two very different people. and, much as i hate to say it, as time goes on, we'll probably just drift further and further apart."
27543,Homer,la la la la la la la. nothing left. la la la... la... la.
37276,Homer,"but, there is one condition..."
28821,Homer,refuse to answer on the grounds that i what?
31508,Homer,look out! it's the grumple!
20204,Homer,"well, our little girl has a gift and we're willing to do what it takes to help her."
15419,Homer,"no, sweetie. ""daddy."""
21438,Homer,"oh, sorry."
27459,Homer,"it's like we're at cheers. i loved that show. because you always knew it was only a half hour till ""wings."" then you could just sleep till monday."
26320,Homer,"okay, you pick one out and i'll punch it to death."
16399,Homer,"observe, boy. the secret is to take tiny bites, like so:"
13214,Homer,d'oh!
14202,Homer,someday i'll buy you a real castle.
34875,Homer,the hangman's here!
32815,Homer,ten percent lycra.
39712,Homer,what! those cute little monkeys? that's terrible. who told you that?
17060,Homer,"marge, i didn't tell 'em personal stuff."
25796,Homer,whoopsie.
38336,Homer,"uh, marge? 'scuse me. uh, i think i need a reboot."
34669,Homer,and i'm not a locksmith!
37351,Homer,"thanks, honey. so you're not cool with any of the toys?"
37669,Homer,you cost me a piece of all of that!
26496,Homer,"here we are: branson, missouri!"
40244,Homer,"uh... simp-sons, sir."
13787,Homer,"um, grace under pressure is no..."
18017,Homer,you got it.
15312,Homer,"absolutely! my prices are so low, you'll think i've suffered brain damage."
15556,Homer,"bart, warm up the car. we're going to duff gardens."
29793,Homer,"stupid prison guard job thinks its so big. everyone gets a prison job but me. all my best friends are guards. they think they're so cruel and corrupt, but they're not."
21365,Homer,"why don't you tell me, son? see any interesting flags up there?"
36432,Homer,we used to be like them.
22490,Homer,"i'm picking it up. ""sala"" seems to mean jerk. and i think ""manjula"" means some kind of spaceship."
29299,Homer,"all right, boy, which con did you work here? copy off another kid? pay attention and take notes? well, take note of this!"
36569,Homer,what the?
22106,Homer,semi-imported. keep 'em comin'.
39087,Homer,"no, marge! you have to listen! that place you sent me to changed my life!"
20946,Homer,hmm... this could be useful...
38747,Homer,cover...
37758,Homer,"good game, everyone. i never dreamed a night where you'd discovered i was cheating and beat the crap outta me could end on such an up note."
24193,Homer,"now, over here i've brewed up my favorite beverage: beer. it's mostly dristan and holy water, but it does the job."
39969,Homer,"no. i said sampson, not simpson."
14396,Homer,"all right, marge. i'll tell you, but first you have to promise you will not get mad."
15422,Homer,i can't wait till they throw his hatless butt in jail.
19050,Homer,"this baby's sure to kill something. okay, now everybody -- stand back while i celebrate freedom. bart, give me your matches."
37237,Homer,a little cream?
18446,Homer,"best six hundred bucks i ever spent. c'mon, boy. we've earned this saturday, now let's make the most of it."
29829,Homer,"well, maybe i was partying so hard with my single friends last night, i forgot the rules."
24938,Homer,"oh, marge. it's me, the real homer!"
15795,Homer,"ahhh, what noble visionary thought up april fool's day?"
15711,Homer,i'm trying to knock you out.
33771,Homer,it tells you how you can get popular.
38055,Homer,what? did you owe me some money?
16990,Homer,shut up.
15465,Homer,can i have a free calendar?
39868,Homer,that old gag.
38873,Homer,"wait, are you telling me we're prisoners in this cage?!"
17370,Homer,"ma-arge. they can't carry enough candy. they have puny, little muscles, not big, ropey ones like you."
37219,Homer,what's wrong?
27719,Homer,do your homework!
34368,Homer,hey boy.
13216,Homer,"long have we awaited the coming of the white man, and carl."
23280,Homer,how about groin-grabbingly transcendent?
32978,Homer,"hey, ned."
32014,Homer,"i had to fight! lenny said his dad is hulk hogan, and i know he's not!"
14777,Homer,this is real.
33386,Homer,you lie. you love me!
21796,Homer,i can't read.
26246,Homer,okay.
23994,Homer,"mmm, that's terrific, duncan. you're ten for ten. now, let's look in the rulebook and see if horses can play in the nfl."
22979,Homer,"all right, a gross-out contest! grandma plopwell, you've done it again."
19225,Homer,"...and larry and i have so much in common, marge, way more than you and me. if i could be stranded on an island with anyone, it would definitely be larry!"
40190,Homer,"oh... oh, i hate halloween."
16271,Homer,that's it! i'm calling my buddies. marge is not the only one who can have a girls' night out.
26251,Homer,okay. lemme check the specs.
21193,Homer,hey wait! stop! i have garbage!
17014,Homer,yabba-dabba-doo!
41322,Homer,"greetings, friend. do you wish to look as happy as me? well, you've got the power inside you right... etc."
14445,Homer,she's startin' to give.
34692,Homer,"now that i have all this free time, i thought i would do you a huge favor."
20390,Homer,o-kay!
26026,Homer,seems to me i already did.
34838,Homer,"no, she does, totally, but uh... with a happier ending. goodnight!"
24988,Homer,dog for sale!
19961,Homer,"in that case, he should've made the week an hour longer. lousy god."
28981,Homer,"we don't have boarding passes, but we need to get on that plane for reasons that are utterly insane."
40901,Homer,"marge, lisa, maggie..."
27321,Homer,"whoa, wait. frank grimes wasn't married. how could he have a son?"
13203,Homer,"i wish when i grow up, i'll be richer than everybody!"
16327,Homer,"all right, all right, you win for now, but some day you'll rust."
40648,Homer,"come here, boy."
33475,Homer,goodbye.
21257,Homer,what-what-what. what button? where am i? who took my false teeth?
38147,Homer,"baby, you saw something in this painting, and you were right."
15266,Homer,"..._______ calendar? hmm... ooh, mostly mozart is in town."
15063,Homer,"is that lisa? ooh, i gotta call heaven -- there's an angel missing!"
20564,Homer,pfft! facts are meaningless. you can use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true. facts shmacts.
27237,Homer,perfect.
31971,Homer,"oh man, i love oktoberfest. oktoberfest!"
39286,Homer,"hey, barney, which one is whirlwind?"
28229,Homer,i made this when i was five. i had to do something -- your pencils were all over the place.
38777,Homer,"backstage pass, you just became a payback rage pass."
22860,Homer,what's going on here? you weirdos love this stuff.
37092,Homer,name another.
13612,Homer,"marge, you have a nice body. and if you'd like to see me in a costume, you have only to ask."
17553,Homer,did you talk about me in therapy today?
28191,Homer,"just one of life's mysteries, like why is my nose jammed full of army men?"
28162,Homer,does this mean they'll never cancel the jim belushi show?
14577,Homer,got it.
34873,Homer,"did i? anyway, the bloody hangman set to his gory work. bodies piled up like those stackable plastic chairs."
39378,Homer,why not? i think after all these years i deserve an explanation.
17787,Homer,"ooh, i've never had a pair of pants that fit this well in my life."
19824,Homer,"uh, gee, i'd really love to want to help you, flanders, but uh, marge was taken prisoner in the... holy land and uh..."
32699,Homer,"yeah, i can't believe all those years i used to drive that old piece of... what the?!"
21917,Homer,"no, no, no. marge was definitely freaked out."
39567,Homer,"lisa, i'm sorry. i didn't mean to yell. go ahead -- play your blues if it'll make you happy."
28577,Homer,"marge, wait."
38412,Homer,"well, as we say in russia: ""goodbye in russian""!"
17245,Homer,"nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh, guys. now, i'm not very political -- i usually think people who vote are a bit ""fruit-y"" -- but, for some reason, this birch barlow really speaks to me..."
15135,Homer,he's the boy you love to hate.
25166,Homer,"huh? oh, you want a hug. well that, i know how to do."
29361,Homer,it's awesome. you know what i've gotten into? sleeping 'til noon.
20826,Homer,the leader knows all and sees all.
28087,Homer,"only teasing. we've flown in the finest busboys from france... i mean, america!"
32400,Homer,she's wearing white? she must have rolled the odometer back to zero.
28736,Homer,"but marge, it was all for you. to buy you all the nice things you deserve. the flowers, the earrings, the bob seger boxed set, which really only needed to be one disk, but the box was nice..."
40441,Homer,"marge, are we ever gonna see him again?"
34784,Homer,never mind.
32184,Homer,i thought she said polar bear.
33321,Homer,"when you're older, you'll miss these fun activities."
28375,Homer,"hmm, dare i pour caramel over the cotton candy?"
16356,Homer,"ah, mcgarnigal. eases the pain."
21907,Homer,fine. i guess the juice business is more important than the ideals our hippie forefathers refused to go to war and die for.
40180,Homer,"-- art sure no craven, ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore -- tell me... tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's plutonian shore!"
29812,Homer,there's gonna be a breakout tonight.
19417,Homer,"marge, we're missing the chili! less artsy, more fartsy!"
38434,Homer,you pay lenny and carl to be my friends?
39707,Homer,it's good! it's good! it's good!
33435,Homer,must be in the glove box.
33856,Homer,be sure to dig around in the gunk.
37694,Homer,"back in fifth grade, you either had to write to a foreigner or a prisoner. i picked a foreigner because the prisoners wrote back too fast. we'd write each other with our dreams of the future..."
32632,Homer,i live in that place!
33089,Homer,"marge, i thought of a new thing -- it's called ""biking out."" it's a combination of biking and making out."
26150,Homer,"son, we are about to break the surly bonds of gravity and punch the face of god."
34081,Homer,lisa! lisa!
14910,Homer,"bart, don't ask stupid questions. is there any frontal nudity?"
13291,Homer,me concur.
34455,Homer,okay.
26906,Homer,wrong answer.
26494,Homer,we've gotta go after them.
25365,Homer,and my dream is to get rid of bart.
19103,Homer,okily dokily.
32966,Homer,i'll use my one phone call to find out all about it!
28021,Homer,"that reminds me, we gotta pick up my slacks at that dry cleaner in shelbyville."
36870,Homer,"parenting? let me tell you ""cool parents"" something. parents are supposed to be lame... so their kids have something to rebel against... by becoming cool just long enough to get married and have kids -- for whom they are lame! it's nature's way!"
33228,Homer,kitten calendar.
21478,Homer,i don't think anything i've ever done is wrong.
27357,Homer,i think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
22801,Homer,a man in an apron!
34736,Homer,"now, everyone onto the hot tub."
34808,Homer,super-team -- fly!
30484,Homer,"marge, spending time with you is more important to me than all the pie-eating contests in the world."
20074,Homer,they sure are.
40856,Homer,and did you pay for those clothes you're wearing?
32993,Homer,"here you go, son. shell casings."
17703,Homer,i'm gonna make it after all!
24496,Homer,"honey, i'm home! the boss is coming to dinner and i need a clean shirt."
16191,Homer,"well well, look whose come to apologize."
40001,Homer,good lord! what have those little hellions done now?
37312,Homer,fleeing didn't work. i have no choice. i will have to... do whatever the other thing was!!!
15029,Homer,c'mon.
23604,Homer,it's a glandular problemmmm!
25158,Homer,"deeper, you pusillanimous pilsner-pusher."
31230,Homer,"cool, a carpenter's library!"
16446,Homer,"yeah, good."
24091,Homer,but don't take my word for it. listen to this testimonial.
39772,Homer,marge?
16139,Homer,"well, i also do a delightful impression of him. i paint a frownie face on my butt and pull down my pants."
36133,Homer,"look at me, i'm mr. fatso! it's funny 'cause it's so preposterous."
39013,Homer,"mmm, raisin detra."
19389,Homer,"hey, i got off pretty easy."
37604,Homer,weird thing under a tarp.
23938,Homer,and you're invited.

32774,Homer,i thought you might have trouble with this. that's why i'm assigning someone to keep watch over you. someone you'd never expect.
33703,Homer,don't shake your fist at me!
25342,Homer,my tennis stick!
27111,Homer,can i have forty guest passes?
15919,Homer,i'll miss sheriff lobo...
38602,Homer,i know just the place.
32238,Homer,"well that's it, i'm retiring from the opera. it's just too popular."

36536,Homer,go where?
39223,Homer,oh! big jar this year.
41437,Homer,"you're right marge, i could never leave you. not even for you. if there was a dot or a squiggle different, that would be too much."
17415,Homer,"hey, that's a half truth."
16396,Homer,ohh... what does it matter? we're doomed!
19670,Homer,okay. question two -- who was your last employer?
26340,Homer,"aw, looks like a little angel. now to save me marge."
17902,Homer,"rabsolutely rothing, rarge."
41410,Homer,i cleaned out the garage and lost fifty pounds!
27464,Homer,i'd rather talk about our feelings. i feel that illegal performance-enhancing drugs are too common these days. rebuttal?
23277,Homer,"okay, what restaurant should we review?"
31344,Homer,nope. i'm gonna stay here and let them test their laser-guided super weapons on me -- like that one!
35194,Homer,problem solved. generation awesome does it again!
21383,Homer,lisa!
28482,Homer,"come on machine, take my dollar!"
13237,Homer,it's always me.
15708,Homer,"hey, barney. i think you've had enough."
37470,Homer,fifty bucks per bag? i guess i'm only bringing one guitar on this revenge trip.
40083,Homer,hello?
40639,Homer,"i'm not done yet, marge. what's that word you use for when you and i... you know..."
17115,Homer,i understand. let us celebrate our new arrangement with the adding of chocolate to milk.
40123,Homer,and... and?! what about loving me?
36838,Homer,"okay, our first hang-out with the cool new neighbors. i've already ""blown them away"" -- their words, i assume -- so don't screw it up."
31689,Homer,"i don't know. you can put horseradish on your dead mother for all i care. the point is, i'm rich, rich, rich! just look -- my dog has his own jacuzzi!"
41431,Homer,that's renaissance homer.
21816,Homer,imagine films.
21220,Homer,"oh, oh, oh, i get it. put on a big show for the cameras."
28708,Homer,i was so close.
26470,Homer,tell that to the good men who just lost their lives.
30682,Homer,"so, you don't have any shrunken heads?"
28316,Homer,touch that mini bar and you're dead!
14101,Homer,"moe, moe, moe, moe, moe, moe, moe..."
29321,Homer,i believe it was the school's tuba.
23884,Homer,"okay, who needs another lamb rack?"
31799,Homer,now to make a young woman's wedding day all about me!
13624,Homer,wowww -- a shoehorn! just like in the movies!
35666,Homer,"look, honey, a family's like a team. and on every team you have the slam-dunking megastar and... the referee."
22765,Homer,"sorry, i already gave him a name. ""land monster."""
32175,Homer,woo hoo!
40884,Homer,huh? what the? i know you -- come back here...
39544,Homer,do you know where my keys are?
20117,Homer,so hungry... can't leave car... huh...
31733,Homer,"oh, why did i borrow that roof from him?"
30727,Homer,you mean fun homer? i'm afraid serious homer has him locked up till you're at your snooty torture camp.
17742,Homer,okay.
39419,Homer,"hmm. when you put it that way, it does sound a little far-fetched. but that's the lug you're looking at. and i vow to continue spending every free minute i have crusading for safety. of course, i'd have a lot less of those free minutes if you gave me the job."
19513,Homer,"no time for you, old man!"
16082,Homer,"yeah, but this is what they're doing on campus. besides, it isn't costing us - i swiped the cinderblocks from a construction site."
13449,Homer,"joke's on them. if the core explodes, there won't be any power to light that sign."
32649,Homer,like which kid's their favorite! it's lisa.
23166,Homer,watch out! comin' through! mach schnell!
33781,Homer,what do you mean? and who are you?
28007,Homer,"barney, you ever notice how hard it is to drive with your knees?"
33664,Homer,"oh, marge. this is a definite high point for our marriage."
13572,Homer,was the door locked?
25813,Homer,so much for the legendary gypsy hospitality.
17772,Homer,"no, no! shut up! shut up! stop it, stop it! i can't take this anymore. i can't let that brave man out there die alone. i'm surprised and disgusted by all of you. especially his children. i'm goin' out there."
20491,Homer,what's the big problem?
16107,Homer,ow! why you little...
25770,Homer,all my love has come back in trophy form.
17165,Homer,"mmmm, chocolate... / mmmm, invisible cola. / mmmm, forbidden donut. / mmmm sacrilicious. mmmm, / mmmm, free goo. mmmm, something."

30410,Homer,"well, i'd better go."
38368,Homer,"thanks, moe, i... huh. must've left my wallet at home."
28644,Homer,i gotta get a job before marge finds out i was fired.
14392,Homer,"good, good... you call moe."
31994,Homer,why you little... i'll teach you to trick your sister!
25283,Homer,"how embarrassing. you take over, bart."
38571,Homer,stupid blood. asking me for a favor.

28173,Homer,leave everything to me.
25195,Homer,"hey, i thought real doctors hated chiropractors."
31766,Homer,"oh, deal with it."
37755,Homer,"yeah, that guy didn't even look over once."
36890,Homer,"finally, a woodcutter that will do what i tell him."
30164,Homer,"ned, i had no choice. it was just so funny!"
28452,Homer,"welcome to the homer simpson show. i'm your host, next card. homer simpson it's great to be here in next card. springfield my guests are...moe szyslak, local businessman, carl carlson, raconteur, and lenny leonard, three-time juror. gentlemen, what's on your minds?"

28860,Homer,"ahh, the germans. you just can't stay mad at 'em."

40982,Homer,oh.
40935,Homer,"oh yes, plenty of fish. we just don't have any bait."
27593,Homer,"you know, i could save money by buying separate nuts and mixing them at home."
26873,Homer,i'll kill you if you don't give me some peanuts.
15361,Homer,daddy.
14066,Homer,"a ""flaming homer""."
20847,Homer,"oh yeah, everybody's making money off the internet except us. we've fallen behind. way behind."
15896,Homer,woo hoo! the greatest day of the year.

26631,Homer,"hey, it's me. i got marge on the other line and she is totally bumming me out."

41189,Homer,"tomorrow... ugh; oh, marge, i'd love to, but i was planning on... sleeping... eating a big sandwich... watching t.v... spending some time with the boy. spending time with the boy. the boy needs attention, marge."
29063,Homer,"what if he started pieing good people? not because he wanted to, but because he was being blackmailed by his boss?"
24277,Homer,"that lying , rail-splitting , theater-going freak!"
37406,Homer,"well, uh, i was just leaving, but moe... had an accident."

26659,Homer,"oh, man, i can't believe we spaced on the date."
34891,Homer,why can't you support my gibberish? i'd do it if you were stupid!
41185,Homer,"just a popularity contest?! excuse me, what's more important than popularity? now, bart, do you really think you can win?"
21222,Homer,"you'll never silence me! i'm the last angry man, patterson! a crusader for the little guy!"

26021,Homer,"it's the family bar. right, kids?"
16376,Homer,hmm.
32730,Homer,"bart, it's me!"
19755,Homer,"marge, the boy was wearing a hawaiian shirt!"
39876,Homer,"i'm gonna miss you, son. and listen... while you're seeing all those great sights, always remember that you're representing your country. i guess what i'm saying is, don't mess up france the way you messed up your room."
40002,Homer,"we're so sorry, we're so sorry."
34390,Homer,"flanders, that stuff's been here for thousands of years. but the breakfast buffet at this hotel, which is included in our package, closes in ten minutes!"
19053,Homer,the beer!
33766,Homer,you're no help.
16614,Homer,no wait! i know where the burglar is!
21539,Homer,mmm... i knew i should have attached those somehow.
38932,Homer,"come on, kids! there's nothing you'd be interested in here."
36777,Homer,aww. that'll be my screensaver.
25215,Homer,"wait a minute, no investor could bend like that."
15533,Homer,what if i undo this button?
20519,Homer,"when i get old, marge, i want you to promise you'll put me in a home. it's like being a baby, only you're old enough to appreciate it."
28227,Homer,i think the government has better things to do than to read my mail.
25800,Homer,aww...
27536,Homer,"everybody, look at the much-needed rain. thank you, god. now turn the rainwater into wine."
27310,Homer,i did it!
17788,Homer,stop it! you're killing me! seattle...
24045,Homer,we can hike anytime. this is our chance to see cars driving.
27990,Homer,everything is going according to plan. i'll just keep thrashing around like an injured seal.
38890,Homer,where are you taking me?
13552,Homer,"oh, of course i've heard of you. i mean you'd have to be living under a rock not to know -- what'd you say your name was?"
27210,Homer,why can't they just be happy for my success?
30322,Homer,stupid best friend flanders.
29941,Homer,and what's the network?
32901,Homer,i'll tell you what she didn't want -- me to be a jerk to her and then she dies.

30695,Homer,"mason, come see my room!"
39947,Homer,"krusty, i'm man enough to admit i was wrong, and i'm sorry i fingered you in court. i sincerely hope that the horrible stories i heard about what goes on in prison are exaggerated."
22950,Homer,"oh, arthur fortune!"
23554,Homer,damn! could my life get any worse?!
22329,Homer,"it's a deal. hey, moe. wanna come with me and wally to the super bowl?"
33015,Homer,you know what your problem is? you haven't become as bad as the people we chase!
34016,Homer,"oh, there's so many men around the world, of every shape and size / i want to nibble on jamaican jerks and teriyaki thighs..."
36749,Homer,"i'm in an abusive relationship with life. it keeps beating the hell out of me, and i'm too cowardly to leave it. maybe i could drink myself to death."
33318,Homer,are you guys dangerous?
30422,Homer,"wow. a robot kid would be a blast. we can confuse him and make his head explode. ""this statement is a lie. but if it's a lie then it must be true. but if it's true, then it must be..."" kaboom!"
27622,Homer,"i'm sorry, honey. i can't be here tomorrow. it's the last day the ribwich is in san francisco."
29945,Homer,"and if i wanna see it, what time should i watch it?"
22748,Homer,"this is red barclay's shipment. on time, as always."
20316,Homer,"what did i tell you, marge?"
38233,Homer,you don't know the new me of the last few days at all!

20279,Homer,"this mountain of stairs used to make bedtime a grueling chore. but not any more, baby!"
17568,Homer,"hey, how come you guys got better chairs than me?"
26351,Homer,one squeaking-spring symphony coming up.
20008,Homer,"i wish i had a nickel for every time i've heard that. take me out to the ball game / take me out to the ball! so what's new, grimy?"
14050,Homer,"is anything the matter, my son? talk to me, young man."
17100,Homer,a bouquet of po...
18381,Homer,"well, i use a computer!"
24806,Homer,"well, you could treat me with a little respect."
16000,Homer,"hey, fellas! i'm back."
13903,Homer,is there a problem with that?
29930,Homer,fascinating!
38960,Homer,i'm ready to go to school.
15886,Homer,marge! i passed!
22189,Homer,"one day soon i will come for you, and then the game will begin. could be in the middle of the night. it could be when you least expect it. or whatever's good for you. i don't care."
37854,Homer,"oh, you know what this means, kids?"
33809,Homer,"yeah, it's clear to me now the best thing i can do as a parent is simply check out."
25854,Homer,"won't you marry me, bi-ill? / i got the wedding gown bi-ill / 'cause weddings are ni-ice..."
31310,Homer,"hey boy, where's your mud buddy? i have a little job for him."
18435,Homer,"i'm gonna have to shut it down myself. fat, don't fail me now."
20908,Homer,"oh, yeah, i got that."
38896,Homer,"suddenly, this trip has gotten interesting."
35393,Homer,not a good time.
34351,Homer,i'm saving my yelling for where it does some good. lisa! you're a wonderful child! keep up the good work!
36448,Homer,does jesus have a big part in this thing?
35861,Homer,"oh, they found it. but don't tell him. this is way cheaper than a nursing home."
26800,Homer,here you go. don't worry. i soaked it in the toilet to soften it up.
20857,Homer,"ooo, they have the internet on computers now..."
20821,Homer,i've never been so happy.
18390,Homer,bart and lisa have to go to school while i get to stay home. nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah.
30792,Homer,why you little...!
22143,Homer,potatoes are clean. the poison must be in the steak.
29887,Homer,i didn't really check. i mainly bought this house for the view.
14831,Homer,herb!
33023,Homer,what have you done to my family?
21987,Homer,yeah... pinchy?... pinchy?!... oh... pinchy!!!
27608,Homer,i could lick you all day long.
26812,Homer,"good night, lisa."
35791,Homer,"it's a rat race, but it looks like i won."
14959,Homer,"uh-oh. here, boy."
23486,Homer,it's time to harvest our radioactive supercrop!
38746,Homer,"that was not my intent. okay, covercraft: hands in."
34871,Homer,"ker-shaw, ker-shew / i'm after you / with my bloody noose / strong enough to hang ten moose / ker-shaw, ker-shew / it's just a story, but it's really true!"
20188,Homer,yeah.
35927,Homer,so get on the boat... the gravy boat.
20031,Homer,"yeah, that's me all right. and the guy standing next to me is president gerald ford. and this is when i was on tour with the smashing pumpkins. oh, and here's a picture of me in outer space."
37871,Homer,vegetables?!
34935,Homer,uh... uh...
35493,Homer,i'm waitin' for ya.
29965,Homer,"you get better, son. meanwhile, the rest of us will be going to the ""library."""
34566,Homer,"i'm trying to be a sensitive father, you unwanted moron! lisa, where were we?"
24969,Homer,"oh ho, ho, that's beautiful! we could make a fortune."
22348,Homer,stop eating our tickets!
13823,Homer,"c'mon, everybody. we're going to the fanciest restaurant in town!"
33240,Homer,but we're the more powerful country for a few more years.
14266,Homer,"oh, sure."
32890,Homer,you left a hole in my heart that could never be filled. so i filled it with food. but i'm never full.
28274,Homer,woo-hoo! woo-hoo!
27013,Homer,"marge, you were like a wild beast. so voracious and prowly."
30063,Homer,"okay, but it's tough for me not to think about their hardship."
29147,Homer,fifty stars and thirteen stripes...
22017,Homer,"oh, i blame myself for this."
25421,Homer,i'm trying to get a refund for this ticket. is this the executive office of the ball club?
32166,Homer,"so long, suckers!"
27253,Homer,i can't remember the last time i cried like this.
40420,Homer,"good to see ya. well, gotta pick up my old man! 'bye!"
40176,Homer,"-- or madam, truly your forgiveness i implore; but the fact is i was napping, and so gently you came rapping, and so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, that i scarce was sure i heard you."
38711,Homer,all camping is pointless. you drive hundreds of miles to shower and sleep in a place with no bathroom or beds. i guess what i'm trying to say is: where's maggie?
41205,Homer,"been a little slow these past few months. not much to steal in the desert, you know."
16311,Homer,yeah. what's the deal?
34463,Homer,smithers. what a marshmallow.
25966,Homer,"geez moe, you've been a real crank lately."
26754,Homer,"c'mon barney, if you're gonna be general grant, you have to have a drink."
37362,Homer,"funny how the brain does that, huh?"
33891,Homer,killing makes me hun-gry
41496,Homer,fine!
29815,Homer,"marge, they're gonna kill me! i only did what i had to do to survive... in a style befitting a french monarch."
14399,Homer,"only in forty-eight states. besides, it's a victimless crime. the only victim is moe, heh, heh, heh. and it's brought lisa and me together."
16999,Homer,pfft. what do babies know?
34119,Homer,"oh, i love going to aquatic parks -- they have worse rides than amusement parks, less fish than aquariums -- but the parking is ample!"
27325,Homer,"goodnight, sleepyhead. do you have to poop?"
31047,Homer,i do eat a lot of crap.
38283,Homer,"oh, i can fake attentive. i've been watching a football game this whole discussion."
33473,Homer,"don't worry honey, we'll come out ahead. i ripped all the copper wire out of the walls."
15868,Homer,ed sullivan.
39426,Homer,"look, you'd better get this all out of your system right now. i don't want you embarrassing me at my boss's picnic."
37553,Homer,"my only secrets are my marathon time isn't four twenty-six, it's never; i often go online to see how lindsay wagner's looking now - fabulous; and i once pushed a kid off a swing and he broke his wrist or something. but it's no secret how much i love my margie."
21028,Homer,i like you.
30176,Homer,lookin' good... feel the burn...
26193,Homer,gimme that beer!
30749,Homer,boy! push down on the bumper! then i can back the car up and save myself.
39178,Homer,how do you transition between scenes -- hard blackouts or spotlight fades?
13921,Homer,i was hoping it'd be money.
21706,Homer,"oh, my god!"
24387,Homer,"oh, no, it's a lost child! don't worry, folks. i'll tackle him."
20380,Homer,"here's some more chocolate curls, gun buddies."
25713,Homer,mmmaybe a little morphine would refresh my memory.
15559,Homer,but i wanna go to duff gardens. right now!
16801,Homer,i am invincible! invincible!
35347,Homer,lousy saint louis cardinals. can't win the nineteen eighty-five world series on classic sports.
37536,Homer,"um, marge, i have to go."
23528,Homer,cash'll be okay! or stock? does your company have stock?
21176,Homer,would you... stop that! you're a helper monkey. this isn't helping!
26987,Homer,"ohh, i gotta get rid of these guys."
20170,Homer,guessing how much elvis weighed...
18708,Homer,and all those other balls?!
18131,Homer,stupider like a fox!
21805,Homer,"ooo, me-ow."
15162,Homer,"all right, marge. i swear to you, the next time he does something wrong i'll punish him and make it stick."
41332,Homer,don't be the boy. don't be the boy.
30745,Homer,ow! someone's hitting my butt with something!
16916,Homer,he took bart too?
16644,Homer,"oh, something stupid like bart would say. bucka bucka or woozle wozzle. something like that."
20010,Homer,that got it.
21822,Homer,"well, he expressed an interest."
29710,Homer,now let's see... which one is ling?
26586,Homer,does that include tip?
22638,Homer,no it's not.
24314,Homer,i don't wanna talk about it!
27520,Homer,"he's not giving it to me, god is. because i prayed for it."
37957,Homer,not a word.
29344,Homer,"okay. i'll run as fast as i can, but i'm full of potato salad."
38446,Homer,"if the expendables movies have taught us anything, it's that people do their best work after they're old and forgotten."
33851,Homer,woo-hoo!
17750,Homer,will you all stop worrying about that stupid comet? it's going to be destroyed. didn't you hear what the guy in the building said?
40168,Homer,don't play dumb with me. we found your book.
15377,Homer,i can't afford that!
32682,Homer,"really? you people are idiots! that's the dumb-- what a stu-- i mean, that sounds fair."
40173,Homer,aag!
39557,Homer,"oh, sure i would, princess. i have feelings, too. you know, like ""my stomach hurts"" or ""i'm going crazy"". why don't you climb up on daddy's knee and tell him all about it?"
37376,Homer,that would save us several hundred bucks.
26081,Homer,"um, has the ship sailed on my foot massage suggestion?"
38841,Homer,what the? this isn't halloween!
14846,Homer,you weren't so glad to see me.
35116,Homer,you ever notice that pizzas have gotten so small lately?
22056,Homer,"h-heyy, let me off this thing."
23951,Homer,who's the greatest billionaire in the world?!
31022,Homer,at least everyone knows i'm smarter than you.
33906,Homer,"eh, they can go to hell. bart?"
38496,Homer,"c'mon, lick it!"
28148,Homer,it must have been moe!
38855,Homer,come on! start this thing! i'm not impressed.
21970,Homer,"well, i guess this is it, ol' pal. this is your big day."
27187,Homer,"well, that cinches it. lisa gets the prize for the best off-the-cuff response."
15452,Homer,could you dumb it down a shade?
22479,Homer,"just try it for two weeks. if you're not completely satisfied, you can be busty st. claire."
30710,Homer,only a true father would lead his son to believe he belonged to someone else.
35303,Homer,"oh c'mon, now you're a tree?"
35245,Homer,"oh, okay, wait, let's start again."
29152,Homer,what genius put a prison on the middle of an island?
29662,Homer,you monster!
20147,Homer,ow!
14983,Homer,it's good for what ails ya...
33684,Homer,"i have not! oh right, you think i do."
14570,Homer,"yeah, but none of my friends can watch me."
18240,Homer,"come on, eat the can. come on."
41550,Homer,"we are sadgasm, and this song is called... ""politically incorrect."""
22093,Homer,woo hoo!
16133,Homer,oh no! burns' birthday!
34964,Homer,fuhgetaboutit!
36520,Homer,"you're sellin' milk, j.j., and i've got a sour stomach."
33481,Homer,no problem. just let sir fix-a-lot slay this chore.
41414,Homer,nothin's gonna ruin this one.
26410,Homer,rainier wolfcastle.
18869,Homer,ummm... do you have a crush on anyone?
34650,Homer,thirty-nine.
18742,Homer,the dastard!
39725,Homer,"ooooh, that's some ball."
13299,Homer,and?
24633,Homer,no problem.
28608,Homer,pretended.
36224,Homer,"so, what's on the agenda?"
21371,Homer,aha. there's some glue.
40144,Homer,tell you what -- let's sleep on it. okay?
25611,Homer,"ooo, can i have dinner?"
20625,Homer,...down...

40960,Homer,"oh. hee, hee. sorry."
39866,Homer,marge! marge! marge! get the door.
31212,Homer,"boy, get dressed. you're going to a jazz brunch, as punishment for all the racket you're making!"
25773,Homer,"hey, what's the deal?"
15755,Homer,then i got this scar sneaking under the door of a pay toilet.
31168,Homer,"marge, we've gotta get buck and tabitha back together. this is the most important case of our careers!"
15691,Homer,where?
32914,Homer,"okay, this is it. i've got one last chance to make up for the things i said to my mom. i will avenge you!"
33643,Homer,what the?
14856,Homer,it's drinking the water!
16520,Homer,"ah, come on, lisa, there's no reason to... let's go see mom."
32809,Homer,well... it might be cold outside.
36939,Homer,"if it doesn't matter, then i call snickers."
18455,Homer,here lies... walt whitman?!!
27366,Homer,i did it for the insurance money.
20446,Homer,"oh, really? do reeky players get the game ball?"
19890,Homer,"oh, well... fun's over, but i still have my wonderful money."
37068,Homer,good point. we'll find somebody else.
26044,Homer,"all right, i'm sorry... but i will not save the rainforest."
16274,Homer,wait a second...
38939,Homer,"no, but we're having fun trying. wait, i mean three."
24036,Homer,"now that you're a champion, you'll have your pick of the fillies."
23456,Homer,hang on.
33579,Homer,"hey, flanders! why don't you join us? afraid you'll get your moustache wet?"
25845,Homer,good ol' table.
29454,Homer,"i've never been so embarrassed. and the worst part is, this is brunch so you've ruined two meals! i'll see you all at lupper!"
15340,Homer,hello... plow king? i was wondering if you could plow my driveway on top of forbidding widow's peak.
34543,Homer,"oh. well i'm not crawling back to big electricity! from now on, the simpsons are living intermittently."
34981,Homer,i'll take care of this.
27565,Homer,mmmmm... garnish.
38986,Homer,what the? lasagna in bed?!
37644,Homer,you're gonna be sorry you said that.
16249,Homer,hello? can i get some help? snack related mishap!
30375,Homer,"i dunno, maybe. plus my wife won't let me inside because the baby's got chicken pox."
24234,Homer,"you don't love me. the only thing you love is your ear, nose and throat pavilion."
18486,Homer,"it's all thanks to our anonymous tipster. but who are you, and why did you tip us off?"
13923,Homer,"nah, we're not gonna be doing that."
35261,Homer,"come on, party pooper -- bust a move!"
28157,Homer,"you kids have got to learn that actions have consequences! eat fire, punks!"
27683,Homer,"i say, i say... my groin!"
17181,Homer,"oh, mindy, we have to fight our temptation."
15577,Homer,i'll give it a good home.
20728,Homer,oh-ho-ho-ho! ow! my leg!
19905,Homer,mayday! mayday!
25834,Homer,she's not the boss of me.
23261,Homer,i'd sure hate to be him.
24534,Homer,"we put all the craziness behind us, and now it's time to get back to what matters: the show, and the sunday comic strip."
29632,Homer,"yeah, ""bride of the monster."""
26137,Homer,"just a second, son. i've gotta put on my contacts."
18284,Homer,"ah, the miracle mile -- where value wears a neon sombrero and there's not a single church or library to offend the eye. it truly is a miracle."
20069,Homer,"you've really done it this time, bart! you're in for the punishment of a lifetime!"
39950,Homer,"hey, turn it up. i love hearing those whack-os."
15021,Homer,"hey, wait a minute... flanders is a regular charlie church and god didn't save his house!"
21606,Homer,i don't see why not. they're my kids. i own 'em.
33681,Homer,there you are!
25161,Homer,who wants lottery tickets?
38484,Homer,you poor woman. dealing with bart has turned your mind to ketchup water. you rest. i'll be the boy's father now.
35115,Homer,the good doctor has just the prescription.
25133,Homer,"yes, nelson?"
34154,Homer,"dad, i don't have the right words to say how i really feel about you, but at least i know how to beat up a guy who does."
18256,Homer,that's a typo.
19501,Homer,omigod! the ship!
36684,Homer,"well, it's a good thing i didn't because i'd be pretty devastated right now."
27686,Homer,"oh, we'll be upstairs, in the bedroom making love... ly rope ladders in case there's a fire."
23041,Homer,"maybe you're right, ned. maybe you're right."
25295,Homer,"with that little outfit on, everyone's gonna think you're playing in the tournament."
25097,Homer,animotion.
30229,Homer,"marge, you bring bart home now! once you go vatican, you can't go back again."
38161,Homer,"so even if we gave kirk and luann some of money, the knowledge of what they could have had will eat away at them, like piranhas devouring a wounded yeti."
18392,Homer,"yes, honey?"
34058,Homer,"oh i don't think so! you know that woman you've been playing ""hide the baguette"" with? she's the first lady of france, carla bruni!"

16866,Homer,shazam.
19514,Homer,"please, don't hurt me!"
34467,Homer,"well, at least we've got the best brand ceiling insulation."
18639,Homer,"okay, let's give it up for the new guy. now let's all turn around and pay attention to me again. hello? hello?"
14498,Homer,"""maybe it's the beer talking, marge, but you've got a butt that won't quit. they got those big chewy pretzels here... ... five dollars? get outta here."""
27091,Homer,"i'm so hot for me, i'm so hot for me / i'm so cold..."
36002,Homer,what the! that idiot cut me off!

35373,Homer,"what do i do? patty's gonna kill me! unless... i kill her first! i put the body in the car, i dump the car in the lake, i put a james taylor cd in the stereo so they think it's a suicide..."
38819,Homer,"what if i left now, and gave you guys my popcorn and soda?"
35357,Homer,you are such a gentle kisser.
15841,Homer,they're fine.
23877,Homer,"yeah, you're right."

36503,Homer,wait for the gap... wait for the gap...
29550,Homer,"flanders. eh, i guess you've got some late night problems too."
18748,Homer,but you have proof! we could go get that confession out of jebediah's fife.
15956,Homer,really?
28964,Homer,i'll right-side you!
28867,Homer,"nice work, cruise control."

22368,Homer,"follow me, boys. we're finally going to the sup... ow!"
37017,Homer,"now, everyone relax and pretend we're about to be hit by a soft brick wall."
17826,Homer,okay.
35358,Homer,hey!
34786,Homer,"yeah, the decent thing to do is bury him at sea."
21533,Homer,"oh, what's the point?"

39789,Homer,"two-hundred and thirty-nine pounds?! i'm a blimp! why are all the good things so tasty? from now on, exercise every morning."
22674,Homer,"so i said to that nurse, ""you can take your free tetanus shot and shove it."""

20387,Homer,"marge? sorry. marge? oh, sorry. marge?"
24161,Homer,"oh, god! oh, god! oh, god! oh, god!"

20906,Homer,stop kissing that cat and get in the car!
30755,Homer,"well boy, you made the right choice. i think this is the first step to a new, closer relationship between us."
40219,Homer,"kids, please leave the room. i don't want you to see this."

27763,Homer,"oh! oh, yeah."
20730,Homer,do i like chicken?
36283,Homer,when i'm done with my robo-botomies.
20166,Homer,"now, if you'll allow me, i think i have a solution that'll satisfy the town and let sgt. skinner keep his dignity."
14349,Homer,mm-hm.
15322,Homer,call mr. plow / that's my name / that name again is mr. plow.
30092,Homer,"goodbye, stupid earth!"
29538,Homer,i'm the worst thing to happen to sports since fox.
39206,Homer,it's your sister.
37040,Homer,how long have you been in there?
31869,Homer,no more lazy saturdays for you.
39289,Homer,what are the odds on santa's little helper?
14270,Homer,"well, listen to me, mr. bigshot... if you're looking for the kind of employee who takes abuse and never sticks up for himself... i'm your man. you can treat me like dirt and i'll still kiss your butt and call it ice cream. and if you don't like it... i can change!!"
14895,Homer,"ah, kids' letters from camp."
19945,Homer,"oh, but daddy doesn't feel so good."
26596,Homer,so that means i don't have to pay the fare.
30875,Homer,the big screen tv?
35236,Homer,"marge, sweetie, do you know how low, low prices are ""insane?"" well, sometimes people can be too."
36285,Homer,sonofa-- why did you do that?
40778,Homer,i'm... a spare. excuse me.
21258,Homer,woo hoo!
20602,Homer,you're all nuts.
18088,Homer,that's why it was so funny. but they're not.
16443,Homer,"ah, home to my loving family. what more can a man ask for?"
19801,Homer,unnghh!!
32262,Homer,"wow, i'd really like to meet this guy."
22551,Homer,"but that's not for awhile, right?"
16056,Homer,son of sniglets??
26810,Homer,that is called parenting. i'm going to moe's.
20554,Homer,ahh. we elected the wrong carter.
31274,Homer,i've never felt saferrrr!
24506,Homer,and that horrible act of child abuse became one of our most beloved running gags.
25721,Homer,run!
27696,Homer,"oh, no! that's maggie's mix tape! then maggie must have gotten..."
16900,Homer,"marge, please don't humiliate me in front of the money."
24042,Homer,"no they didn't. they just surrounded it with something wonderful -- like a raisin covered in chocolate, or a monkey in a cowboy suit."
26140,Homer,"this is launch master homer, counting down. five, four, three..."
39928,Homer,and he had a big nose.
17693,Homer,"actually, your mother hadn't told me yet. at that time, i had no idea maggie even existed."
41444,Homer,"ouch! oooch! eeech! ouch! ooch! oh, stop it!!"
37712,Homer,"well, what was your childhood dream?"
16490,Homer,yes we do. the cookie told me so.
15703,Homer,the man never drank a duff in his life.
23640,Homer,"good girl, maggie. you knocked down all the pins. but you stepped over the line just a little bit, so i'll have to give you a five."
39720,Homer,"i'm glad you asked, son. being popular is the most important thing in the world."
22500,Homer,now to trim away the fat.
22552,Homer,sweet...
18670,Homer,"for the last time, bush, apologize for spanking my boy!"
38375,Homer,let them ruck the night away!
13456,Homer,"aw, old man burns is gonna kick off if he doesn't get some double-o-negative blood, but nobody at the plant has it."
39398,Homer,"hey, if they think i'm gonna stop at that stop sign, they're sadly mistaken."
39667,Homer,"g-g-good night, s-son. s-sleep tight."
32098,Homer,i came to relax -- you think of it!
21903,Homer,"profits, profits, profits! what kinda hippies are you? peter fonda must be spinning in his grave."
30105,Homer,"wake up! the rapture is coming in half an hour! there's no time to waste! marge, grill a chicken! no, make sandwiches! and some kettle chips would be nice! original, not barbecue!"
24767,Homer,"financial panther, eh?"
38733,Homer,music! beautiful music!
21794,Homer,"yeah, you owe me that much."
14611,Homer,"hey, you did the best you could."
31964,Homer,"we're not thieves, we're scavengers! like the beautiful vulture, or the heroic tapeworm, or america's sweetheart, the maggot."
26292,Homer,"ah, there's nothin' better than relaxin' with my favorite magazine."
36725,Homer,"that was four screams! stupid a.f.i. boy, never go into their director's training program!"
35230,Homer,eurocentric! when do we have wacky adventures?
22567,Homer,i've seen plays that were more exciting than this. honest to god. plays.
19635,Homer,oh... okay.
25525,Homer,"""olive oil?"" ""asparagus?"" if your mother wasn't so fancy, we could shop at the gas station like normal people."
30575,Homer,it's a risk i'll have to take.
20097,Homer,all i had to do was walk a few blocks from the port authority bus terminal to my train at penn station...
34509,Homer,playing nursemaid to chief wiggum.
18496,Homer,"oo, look, it's maggie!"
30095,Homer,wait for it... wait for it...
26379,Homer,do you have any jobs for a man who wants to die? something indoorsy.
39553,Homer,ohhh... get out of the corner!
21240,Homer,it is?
38495,Homer,come on. lick it!
20815,Homer,and it didn't cost us a dime.
34507,Homer,"well, if you really want me to stay..."
16488,Homer,"yeah, yeah."
14106,Homer,i guess so.
15264,Homer,woo hoo!
33383,Homer,i respect your choice. now drive back to the clubhouse and order me a tom collins.
18305,Homer,"oh, no. better ride this one out in the closet."
26382,Homer,oh no! this is how faceless joe lost his legs!
41571,Homer,but i need it...
31159,Homer,okay.
15439,Homer,"oh ni-ight, di- vine. hey, my voice just changed."
35747,Homer,no.
37120,Homer,finally! a supervisor!
29404,Homer,"lighten up, marge. this is my chance to relax with people from work i never get to see. like this guy."
16739,Homer,"i'll field this one. the only danger is if they send us to that terrible planet of the apes. ...wait a minute, statue of liberty... that was our planet. you maniacs! you blew it up! damn you! damn you all to hell."
39658,Homer,"the first thing you learn about surviving in the woods, boy: conceal your nakedness."
14933,Homer,huh?
24030,Homer,"go, son! do it for the normals!"
34253,Homer,"marge, those groves of cherry blossoms will bloom every year, to remind the world of the sweetest, most forgiving woman who ever lived... am i off the hook?"
21933,Homer,"not so fast, pig! we're making a stand. a freaky stand! you can smash this drug barn all you want, but first you'll have to smash our heads open like ripe melons!"
36128,Homer,"hm, sounds like a lie, but what could he be covering up?"
26736,Homer,this looks suspicious... but delicious!
18872,Homer,i have no idea who that is.
33073,Homer,"if that boy thinks i'm paying to put him through four years of puberty, forget it! stupid kids... think i'm made of hormones..."
27959,Homer,"heck no, the amish did it. who knows more about electricity than the amish?"
15601,Homer,i can't think with all this noise!
32595,Homer,this is great! i must be the first gullible husband to overhear snippets of surprise party planning and think it was my wife having an affair.
31111,Homer,good riddance. their drawings suck and they look like hippies.
17972,Homer,hm. barney's movie has heart. but football in the groin had a football in the groin.
19773,Homer,"okay, that didn't work. but i know something that will..."
34173,Homer,"man, a lion would not want to see that on his x-ray!"
24087,Homer,a man who's not afraid to cry.
13485,Homer,where's the letter?
22959,Homer,"ooo, arthur fortune. you know what that fabulous man just did? he gave the springfield zoo two male pandas, and got them to mate successfully."
20431,Homer,will you hug meeeee? hug meee!
39577,Homer,"then you've heard. oh, god. what are we doing to do? the lanes were kinda warped but, oh, the food!"
34526,Homer,are you calling me fat?
17102,Homer,my tattered rags are caught on your coffee table.
28974,Homer,we're alone now.
13722,Homer,i said do it!
41129,Homer,"dad, no! gimme that."
33820,Homer,"i need to rent an apartment in the worst part of waverly hills -- the crappier, the better."
21993,Homer,"there, problem solved."
34117,Homer,"no, you said ""naked bacon."""
14542,Homer,i have a secret weapon.
23331,Homer,i didn't say stop!
13260,Homer,stop that crying!!
29601,Homer,"have you read them all? okay, good."
40772,Homer,"oh, you may not remember me. i'm homer simpson. i mooned for rebuttal."
33618,Homer,i need that paper quick!
40845,Homer,they must think people will watch anything.
21008,Homer,would you be proud of me?
17494,Homer,so are you gonna say something nice now?
30373,Homer,can't even go in my own kitchen... bart's in there right now licking frosting off my eggbeaters.
18364,Homer,"oh, two-twenty-five?! that means i lost weight!"
18263,Homer,thanks flanders. i have to agree that everything certainly... huh?
14753,Homer,ooooh.
20239,Homer,"why -- oh, i give up."
29977,Homer,"güten abend, my brave, bavarian overlords. the best wurst in town."
36216,Homer,all right.
20733,Homer,"oh, we'll see about that. gimme ten rings."
14795,Homer,what the...
29636,Homer,you handsome devil. someday they'll let you and me get married! can you imagine the children?
24281,Homer,especially when we send it to him piece by piece.
17411,Homer,"marge, kids, everything's gonna be just fine. now go upstairs and pack your bags. we're gonna start a new life under the sea."
23258,Homer,here we are kids -- the zoo.
13583,Homer,"now listen. i'm bringing michael jackson home to stay with us for a few days... isn't that cute -- he's heard of you! now, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some beer on ice."
19487,Homer,"a machine? earl's a machine. oh, that's just perfect! homer's desperate search for a soul mate has yielded a lighthouse-keeping robot! oh, wow!"
21342,Homer,wow! look how far i climbed! and i'm not even tired!
32633,Homer,he's got my vote.
17216,Homer,"now, to absorb some local color through the magic of am radio."
40423,Homer,this place is depressing.
19815,Homer,unless he gets out somehow.
36271,Homer,i got it...
16994,Homer,i'm not stealing it. hotels expect you to take a few things. it's a souvenir.
16297,Homer,marge! marge!
39145,Homer,"princess, why did you put on that coat? you're obviously cold. may i escort you to the radiator?"
34521,Homer,"now, shave off your moustache and drink the hairs in a cup of cocoa."
28122,Homer,"ooo, a hotdog!"
30175,Homer,"hey coach, do you mind turning down the music? my baby's trying to take a nap."
36407,Homer,i wish i could pull down my zipper and that guy would come out.
22308,Homer,let's see. ten percent off carpet cleaning. ten! two pizzas for the price of one at doughy's.
31008,Homer,"hey, it says here ""the book"" was written by tom stoppard. this isn't a book, it's a play! book."
34106,Homer,...don't look at that...
35975,Homer,"no, no, no, no, let's see how long we can keep 'em waiting. everyone act like we're buckling up to go home."
30355,Homer,uh... this is all i could find.
13200,Homer,int. lakeside mansion - kitchen - present
28426,Homer,"okay, you wanna go over there."
36386,Homer,"oh man, marge is pissed. look at her... flaring her nostrils... drumming her fingers... making small noises like she's yelling at me inside her head..."
23262,Homer,"hey, i smell cake! cake that says ""farewell"" and ""best wishes""!"
37102,Homer,no one steals my kids... except me... from that theme park jail... that i never told you about... except i guess i just did... we're all caught up now... let's go!
32286,Homer,"hey, when you married a man who would, years later, without warning, become a tow truck driver, you knew what the deal would eventually be."
32988,Homer,just warming it up. now to melt the cheese in this croissant...and get rid of a little excess earwax...and smoke a relaxing cigar.
29317,Homer,"one of you ate tin cans, one of you ate health food. how you solved crimes i'll never know."
32099,Homer,drunk!
34596,Homer,woo-hoo!
14519,Homer,"well, he just goes... ohhh"
16879,Homer,"heh, heh, it does look like al gore."
29600,Homer,"eh, who needs tourists? they never buy my maps to stars' homes, anyway."
36656,Homer,sorry. check out my new t-shirt.
15110,Homer,spare my family. take me. take me!
28639,Homer,i can't see! i'll have to steer by the reflection in my watch!
40121,Homer,i've never been more awake in my life.
32020,Homer,move it!
20285,Homer,"bart, are you in there? have you forgotten our little ""kablamo"" talk?"
19794,Homer,"hey, boy, wake up! your old man found some deer!"
25259,Homer,yes! that's what i wanted!
18248,Homer,"this barbecue will be hard, thankless work, but i'm sure you're up to it, marge."
25200,Homer,"yeah, right. i did 'em while you were studying."
20724,Homer,"did ya hear that, bart? the carny code. bart, did you hear that?"
13957,Homer,"yes, sir."
21070,Homer,"on second thought, go right."
13928,Homer,need money. need money.
37659,Homer,"you killed burnsum? now who is gonna say ""step right up""?"
40312,Homer,it was so quiet you could hear each individual smart-ass remark.
16162,Homer,yes. we'll send the eye.
41478,Homer,i've met some jive turkeys in the seventies but that turkey's the jivest.
36461,Homer,welcome to marriage! another good man bites the dust.
18197,Homer,"shut up, judge!"
21789,Homer,"yeah, tell you the truth, i'm not even sure."
27925,Homer,can you shoot one where i'm rambo and my wife is betty boop?
37564,Homer,swag! i'm gonna grab forever / stuff that i really don't need / swag!
22746,Homer,woo hoo!
37034,Homer,now to sleep the sleep of the just.
31226,Homer,don't tell me how many times to think!
14044,Homer,"that's my boy. nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah!"
24644,Homer,"those rich, snobby indians."
29296,Homer,all right.
29904,Homer,something like that.
16504,Homer,"uh, let's see... 18... 27... 35. dealer busts. looks like you all win again."
30236,Homer,he's a pig who can predict football winners... in advance!
22892,Homer,"wake up! wake up, springfield!"
33463,Homer,fine. i'll invite him. but he has to wear the outfit i choose.
16535,Homer,"no, lisa. the only monster here is the gambling monster that has enslaved your mother. i call him gamblor. and it's time to snatch your mother from his neon claws."
20089,Homer,"goodnight, barney. don't forget to bring back my car back tomorrow. just slide it under the door."
31910,Homer,"kiddy cork? ""thumbstitute?"" ""accuteat?"" ""bink 182?"""
14371,Homer,"me too, honey."
18438,Homer,let go! i gotta get to the tank!
14256,Homer,big shots with their stainless steel lunchboxes...
27777,Homer,"how did you ever run this place? you've gotta turn away your family, fire your friends, work until the wee hours of the afternoon..."
24761,Homer,can we go now?
41090,Homer,"stop it, both of you. grampa smells like a regular old man, which is more like a hallway in a hospital."

17365,Homer,"oh my god, marge. a penalty shot, with only four seconds left. it's your child versus mine! the winner will be showered with praise, the loser will be taunted and booed until my throat is sore."
17149,Homer,"all right, pal. where'd you get the sugar for that tea?"
19556,Homer,it's gone. and we still don't have any proof.
22095,Homer,even during ramadan?

28234,Homer,"i barely know my mother. and every time i see her, she's taken away again. and when a man doesn't have his mother, he winds up like me."
40733,Homer,"hey, don't worry barney. it's a big school. there's gotta be a girl nobody else wants to take to the prom."
28768,Homer,the school sent this dealy over for maggie. his name is phonic frog.

27968,Homer,"but as for you, santa's little helper, you are a selfish coward and a bad dog!"
31176,Homer,"wow, your paintings have brush marks and your statues have wieners!"
16123,Homer,computers can do that?
13877,Homer,"whew, i'd hate to be that kid's father."
37477,Homer,"ooh, phew, oh, that's a lot of letters."

14602,Homer,what do kids know about spending money?
24742,Homer,"marge, she's gonna narc on our stash."
32209,Homer,"eh, i'll think about it."
35153,Homer,"don't feel bad, boy. everyone makes mistakes. yours is just public and expensive."
16913,Homer,done.
29599,Homer,"lisa, the world is a very complicated place. and when you get right down to it... cannonball!"
33402,Homer,"marge, the way i feel about you is as real and lasting as my hairline."
36607,Homer,sorry guys. private family moment.
40996,Homer,"wai-wai-wait, wait, wait. let me see if i got this straight... it's christmas day, four a.m., there's a rumble in my stomach..."
22694,Homer,"he called me ""greenhorn."" i called him tony randall. it was a thing we had."
27033,Homer,so you're just gonna let me walk out of here sober.
31171,Homer,but i wanted to do it with you.
34780,Homer,"well, it was rhubarb."
35192,Homer,"great idea, but i don't have any money."
36030,Homer,then why am i paying eight hundred dollars a year in dragon insurance?
22956,Homer,"good luck, mr. burns. and if you get in trouble, i wrote some jokes about how white people are different from black people."
38552,Homer,"uh, mr. burns, i'd like you to meet... mother hubbard standee."
20207,Homer,"excellente! muchas gracias, señorata!"
20533,Homer,screw him.
13209,Homer,"why, of cour-- no."
16771,Homer,woo hoo! sold!
26858,Homer,"marge, i can't say no to a helpless old lady. they put spells on you!"
36003,Homer,"i'm gonna run his plates, find out who he is, then change his springface profile picture to a shot of a monkey. get that, marge? a monkey!"
14274,Homer,the hospital?
40225,Homer,"but you do get to express yourself. in the lovely home you keep, and the food you serve."
36769,Homer,but i'm not alone. i'm doing some face time with lenny.
38440,Homer,"marge, when you're broke, that's when you've got to keep up appearances. the fourth of july is the one day a year when our city puts on her high heels and tube top, and leans into america's car window. god bless her."
27871,Homer,"well, i'd better go. but before i do, marge, there's something i want to ask you."
38613,Homer,expensive toys for grownups they don't open or play with.
37239,Homer,are your kids gonna be there?
27862,Homer,"you are? hm, which will win out? my old-fashioned prejudices or the fact that i've already mixed my laundry with yours. i'll have to sleep on it."
37033,Homer,"we're cool, right boy?"
17298,Homer,nooooo!
18086,Homer,". fooled you flanders. made you think your family was dead. didja get it? they're not, though."

40808,Homer,she's with him.
29119,Homer,don't forget maggie!
30483,Homer,"lord, i'm coming home to you / alabama!"
18969,Homer,"there can only be one truly great music festival a lifetime, and it's the us festival."
30077,Homer,the world will end next week! spend your children's college fund! thaw that turkey now!
31868,Homer,"i got hung up at the snack stand -- watching those hot dogs rolling and turning, not a care in the world."
21959,Homer,perfect.
27434,Homer,i'll take it.
19350,Homer,"okay, ready."
35137,Homer,stupid kid. all you do is cost me money. money i could be wasting!
17242,Homer,"die, bad robots, die! with a dry, cool wit like that i could be an action hero."
13202,Homer,but you let in homer glumplet.
25681,Homer,you're doing that the sucker way. try a little vitamin g.
17194,Homer,"all right, all right! i'll walk in the mud!"
15495,Homer,"oh well, i could use a good laugh."
18791,Homer,"no time, marge. i think mr. burns wants me to do some long division."
29608,Homer,it brings me great joy to unite two such loving people. photo mouse pads for sale out back.
41493,Homer,huh? hm? what the--
30177,Homer,you're a god!... i can't think of any more!
29283,Homer,do you know what a boob is?
14714,Homer,a friend bought it for me.
21129,Homer,"well, mr. burns, you always come off as kind of a gruff, crotchety loner, but we both know that deep down inside..."
35709,Homer,now that's my kind of foam.
20879,Homer,i also have to go. booo!
31003,Homer,"all right, i can see this is all up to me."
32265,Homer,sometimes you want to work?
20231,Homer,ohh! saxomophone.
30470,Homer,"excuse me, mr. bartender sir, may i have a sugar-free ginger ale? and uh, make it flat -- the bubbles burn my buds."
15178,Homer,"ah, sweet soft-hearted marge. you just can't see the big picture. if i stick to my guns, the boy could wind up chief justice of the supreme court. if i fail, the best he could do is judge at a ""mister tight buns"" competition. i can't let that happen, i won't let that happen and i can't let that happen."
25954,Homer,"yeah, uh, digging for anything in particular?"
31923,Homer,john lennon?!
39988,Homer,"you know, marge, this is just like when we were dating."
36999,Homer,"uh-huh, where's the kids?"
39752,Homer,"whoop! don't worry, this frosting'll come right off. beauty, isn't she?"
26912,Homer,"look at him over there, eating that apple. what's he planning? what?!"
32224,Homer,"not me, they love me."
39640,Homer,"now don't worry. our situation isn't as bad as it seems. and you're forgetting, i'm an experienced woodsman. now you all stay here for a minute while i go over this way and try to get my bearings."
41033,Homer,"bullseye! and another thing. when i gun the motor, i want people to think the world is coming to an end! vroom! vroom! vroom!"
29032,Homer,"somebody ought to take him down a peg. or, should i say, down a pie."
25143,Homer,stop that! the fire inspector would be appalled.
24143,Homer,hmm... this doesn't look so bad.
18604,Homer,marge! someone broke the toilet!
24906,Homer,how did i get here? what is this place?
36616,Homer,"yeah, no kids to ruin it."
18127,Homer,found 'em!
22546,Homer,"wow. did you see that thing, marge? so powerful. so commanding. so forceful and raw. it didn't ask, it just took."
35900,Homer,yes. yes! got it!
26015,Homer,i think it's pretty obvious. i'm turning our garage into a tavern. the kind moe's used to be.
17347,Homer,"sucker. competitive, violent, that's why you're here."
36218,Homer,"it's just dream hail! ow! oh! ow! dream hail! hey, there's a dream truck!"
21096,Homer,here you go. keep using nuclear power.
36906,Homer,goofing on it made me feel wise!
22642,Homer,yes it is.
39081,Homer,"ooh, like fat albert."
32617,Homer,"marge, that was a joke!"
37379,Homer,"it's an honor, sir."
28991,Homer,noooo!
35619,Homer,"y'ello. hey, barney... a free movie screening? of course i can go! i just need somebody to hold down the fort."
25089,Homer,"oh. yes, of course. uh, she's behind that plant."
39925,Homer,perhaps a little something for the trip back to the cash register.
28447,Homer,you're on!
16098,Homer,"aah, the college road trip. what better way to spread beer-fueled mayhem?"
37363,Homer,the brain is so stupid.
35438,Homer,when we see each other again you'll be an old man and i'll be a baby!
34504,Homer,"don't die on me, clancy. you said our friendship was special. well if it was so special, wake up you fat sack of..."
31321,Homer,it was either kill him or kill no one!
33106,Homer,i know -- i was hoping the number might be zero.
22557,Homer,"are you saying i'm gay? because if that's what you think, then just come right out and say it."
23606,Homer,"oh, lord... you saved me. i guess you had some higher purpose in mind."
36829,Homer,you're from portland? i've heard of people being from there.
15307,Homer,stop!
26797,Homer,woo!
14137,Homer,ow!
34413,Homer,your parents made you?
34717,Homer,no fair! we just went to church!
16492,Homer,"well, maybe i want to. but then i think about marge and the kids well not the boy, he drives me nuts. sometimes i'd just like to..."
23133,Homer,"door, marge."
34381,Homer,why you little...
28716,Homer,i don't wanna go home! i'm not done talking to me!
13874,Homer,no.
32812,Homer,"yeah, me too. since her father re-abandoned her, she's cut the word ""pop"" out of all of our foods."
29264,Homer,those are good too.
21692,Homer,"aww... ohh, you look like a little tiny dinosaur."
29797,Homer,"squealin'? no, i just wanted to help him."
31250,Homer,that shirley is quite a gal. we should fix her up with barney.
20484,Homer,then just tell her you're already married.
39828,Homer,"i don't really know, sir."
35440,Homer,"yo, lenny... ...do you know anything about... flying the blimp while drinking..."
24198,Homer,"oh, what happened?! i gave you a glittering vegas, and you turned it into a skanky atlantic city!"
40468,Homer,"here you go, bartasaurous."
29371,Homer,"screw the market, we're going to mexico!"
27439,Homer,it's all my fault my wife got mugged.
25043,Homer,i can't believe everyone was in on it.
22534,Homer,"if you won't stop, then i'll stop you!"
21066,Homer,"yes, he is handsome in an ugly sort of way."
28878,Homer,"i can't talk to my wife for twenty-eight days? sir, she is not an alcoholic! you can't put me on hold! i'll put you on hold!"
27667,Homer,what?
19799,Homer,"me too, son."
39204,Homer,how many grades does this school have?
21564,Homer,cold.
35481,Homer,"guys, quit telling the truth!"
31704,Homer,"marge, you're my real dream come true. and i get to live you every day."
18719,Homer,poor aunt hortense... woo-hoo... woo-hoo...
17918,Homer,"hey, let's do that two thousand pound man thing. i'll be that carl reiner guy, you be what's his face."
26629,Homer,i could walk up to the president and blow smoke in his stupid monkey face and he'd just have to sit there groovin' on it.
36508,Homer,"pfft, look in the mirror, unplanned miracle."
27924,Homer,"coming, sweetie!"
26696,Homer,"while i wait for my family, i'll tell you about the time my baby shot my boss."
18951,Homer,"when you go to the polls tomorrow, please -- vote ""no"" on proposition 24!"
40206,Homer,"i bet you could afford it, though."
24520,Homer,rocks!
15071,Homer,if it wasn't for me you'd still be queen. you must hate me.
33648,Homer,"thank you, that's very... more sarcasm."
19615,Homer,no sir. i am not.
30066,Homer,judgment day is at hand.
41582,Homer,what?! no! no! no! bongo!!
29192,Homer,"""all my daughter ever did was tell people to think for themselves. i may be her father, but when i grow up, i wanna be just like her. except still a dude."""
26439,Homer,one of the wheels broke off my chair today. but i didn't make a movie about it.
20725,Homer,"yes, sir!"
25986,Homer,what's the gag?
31199,Homer,"hey, if i poisoned them, would i be doing this?"
17143,Homer,woo hoo! a four day weekend!
20094,Homer,"oh, i don't want to go to new york city."
32430,Homer,"hors d'oeuvres, big fancy desserts... and my wife is paying for everything. now i know why pimps are so happy."
21277,Homer,marge... ix-nay on the ash-hole-tray.
19959,Homer,i made a bad mistake and lenny sent me home to think about what i did. but i don't remember what it was so i'm watching tv.
30152,Homer,why you little... i'll teach you to have a libido!
38598,Homer,"if you fall asleep with them, will you even burn to death?"
26052,Homer,you will be aroused by a shampoo commercial.
19859,Homer,really? i heard good.
28913,Homer,"see you monday. oh wait, monday's martin luther king day. i'll see ya when i see ya."
19624,Homer,"you got it, buddy."

13496,Homer,"locked, eh? well, i just might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old mr. lock. step aside, boy."
25932,Homer,"now, time for ""operation: judge-get-back-at."""
26116,Homer,"it was one of those lazy summer days you thought would last forever. and to kill the boredom, we sang."
35271,Homer,"well, it was your idea to give him self-esteem in the first place!"
27611,Homer,i have eaten the ribs of god.
17812,Homer,"well if we agree, then why are we arguing?"
35178,Homer,"oh, because lisa won't tell me what flower it's from."
22259,Homer,"well, i only saw them from the back, 'cause they were so busy gang probing you."
41167,Homer,what a family.
14525,Homer,"bart, this is your teacher? i should start going to parents night."
33796,Homer,must finish poet's corner... or bart will work for noah... with his hot mom...
19528,Homer,"no, i'm sorry."
31525,Homer,"marge, i have no idea what you were just thinking about. why would you think i did?"
36830,Homer,"wait a minute, you have kids?! you can't have kids! look at you!"
39699,Homer,ah!
38889,Homer,"so, what do you eat, space broccoli?"
27429,Homer,what do i do now?
14014,Homer,"all right, i will! son, i don't think you should let me help you."
39277,Homer,but... but...
34829,Homer,"oh i'm sorry, maggie, but even at your age, i'm sure you understand things can't always go your way, and that's why... i can't believe we didn't get that stupid elf!"
19808,Homer,amen to that.
18449,Homer,"listen here. my name is homer j. simpson. you guys think i'm dead, but i'm not. now i want you to straighten this out without a lot of your bureaucratic red tape and mumbo-jumbo."
19320,Homer,okay. love you.
30988,Homer,"hey, i've been driving drunk since i was twelve! but first...who's gonna help me pee?"
38888,Homer,and away we go!
24547,Homer,"that horoscope was baloney. nothing happened except for the pick ax in my head, the rattlesnake bite and the testicle thing. what's for dessert?"
27363,Homer,"oh, what have i done? children don't remember bad birthdays, do they?"
31164,Homer,"oh, we're gonna have a lot to talk about at your three o'clock."
41187,Homer,"now, go get 'em."

27462,Homer,"alright mom! / yay, mom! / woo hoo!"
26239,Homer,"the simpsons are goin' to mars, so pack your... or maybe i'll think of something else."

25874,Homer,bo-ring.
28504,Homer,why do the things i love always burn?
28987,Homer,you keep thinking that!
28464,Homer,"well, i took bart's advice last week, so i guess it's lisa's turn. now, if you'll excuse me..."
26420,Homer,i'm rich!
29888,Homer,"some day that bowl will overflow, and i'll be there."
34865,Homer,"don't worry, boy, another girder always swings in for you to walk on right when you get to the end."
39708,Homer,it's good to see you all in church.
39232,Homer,"marge, well, let me be honest with you."
25384,Homer,i am a washing machine. do what i say.
13978,Homer,bart! you can't weld with such a little flame. stupid kid.
29389,Homer,"son, when you grew up, i grew down. but now i can see you need your dad more than ever."
28341,Homer,"your honor, i've completely disappointed my wife. that's punishment enough. you understand these things, you're a grandmother."
21092,Homer,"no, because... you see i went ahead and... year-wise, i was counting forward from the last previous..."
17563,Homer,"aw, it didn't work."
15157,Homer,"all right. all right. bart, go to your room."
34356,Homer,"oh, there's a nickel."
39467,Homer,"oh, you think so? well, let's see what's behind door number two."
40926,Homer,"one seafood burrito, apu."
19313,Homer,the one down the hall.
22005,Homer,"but it's funny, marge. the guy's sick."
38542,Homer,"i love you, marjorie. and i've had my share of failures, sure. and sometimes i get pretty nervous. but thanks for talking it out with me. i think i can finally get to sleep now."
39862,Homer,oh marge! i still hurt! marge! marge!
37896,Homer,"bless you, boy. that was the greatest thing i've seen on a computer that i can talk about with you in the room. how did you know how to do that?"
35247,Homer,yes?
34469,Homer,"i never thought i'd say this, but i wish mr. burns was back."
41415,Homer,here we go... here we go... here we go...
15969,Homer,hmm... baby on board.
19020,Homer,"you know, the one with all the well-meaning rules that don't work out in real life -- christianity."
40106,Homer,"dirty trick. okay, i'm not gonna kill you, but i'm gonna tell you three things that are gonna haunt you for the rest of your days. you ruined your father. you've crippled your family, and baldness is hereditary."
40979,Homer,"okay, brother! grab the next plane to springfield. we got a couch that folds out..."
35185,Homer,"oh yeah -- we better ""grump it up."""
16869,Homer,"shove it, buddy."
35768,Homer,"it's never good. i always wind up being chased by hounds, or falling through a trap door...or being a peg in your game of human croquet..."
30123,Homer,"buddy, you just made yourself a powerful enemy."
27750,Homer,"no, it's entirely within my power. furthermore, there never were any nuclear inspectors. check and mate. now, king me!"
15516,Homer,bo-ring!
30601,Homer,a lamborgotti fasterossa? that's the car i think about when i make love to my wife.
23936,Homer,"what's that, a theme park?"
27735,Homer,i gave mr. burns the best years of my life. and how much respect does he give me?
32706,Homer,it's too much work. why don't you come and get me?
27009,Homer,"you mean, they're gonna try to sell us time shares?"
40488,Homer,that's my boy.
28374,Homer,"whoa, marge, get a room!"
35317,Homer,"not bad, not bad. marge, how much do they pay us for doing this?"
39429,Homer,are you sure that's enough? you know how the boss loves your delicious gelatin desserts.
29170,Homer,"okay, three bucks."
21712,Homer,"come here, you little--"
15807,Homer,arrrgh!
14387,Homer,"oh, violin guy!"
15313,Homer,"shut up, boy."
25669,Homer,"he can hear you, rachel."
30318,Homer,woo hoo!
27509,Homer,"oh lord, i see thou art working through thy imperfect vessel, marge. for thou art most wise..."
35589,Homer,"oh, marge. this is the purest love there is: patient, supportive... ooh, cleavage!"
39533,Homer,and there's nothing wrong with hitting someone when his back is turned.
38012,Homer,"awww... wait a minute... since marge is wearing my glasses, i can see everything she sees. uh-uh, i shouldn't watch this."
34248,Homer,surprised?
16814,Homer,yeah.
19442,Homer,hey buddy! get back there with the other rocks!
24373,Homer,you gotta hide me. death is after me! and i don't entirely trust these cowboys.
37132,Homer,when you're older.
24833,Homer,no one told me the plant was closed!
31702,Homer,"relax, marge. i wasn't gonna kill him."
33099,Homer,videogames -- the reason this generation of americans is the best ever.
39834,Homer,are you still mad?... you are still mad. no need to say it. i'm your loving husband. i can read you like a book. i'll just have some milk.
30860,Homer,"lenny, this tv is amazing. if you're not careful, i might just spend the rest of my life on your couch."
19515,Homer,yaaaa...
22855,Homer,"i give you ""botched hibachi."" the tricycle is on loan from the maggie simpson collection."
27649,Homer,me too.
17586,Homer,it is. it's been happening to me all my life.
36384,Homer,looks like that guy's got turret's syndrome!
18327,Homer,ow!
16469,Homer,"uh, murphy, you are elf a controllably i think a we nam- myo-renge-kyo."
40621,Homer,"beautiful language, isn't it, marge?"
38851,Homer,"fine. but i'm not paying for the insurance. oh, what the hell, give me the insurance."
16304,Homer,"ahh, the daily newspaper."
38993,Homer,can we cuddle for a little while?
22428,Homer,"and it doesn't stop in the bedroom. oh no, i'm taking charge. kids, there's three ways to do things -- the right way, the wrong way, and the max power way."
28952,Homer,and a one and a two and a...
37236,Homer,hey flanders. can i borrow some sugar?
19887,Homer,i'll be right back.
21556,Homer,half my life gone! and i'm only guaranteed thirty-eight more years.
35290,Homer,i want you to know i'm cured.
41541,Homer,"here's what i say to that: no soup for you! because i am ""master of my domain."" newman."
41378,Homer,going somewhere?
18299,Homer,mmmm.... sprinkles.
32829,Homer,"ooh, laughter house! with the world in the shape it's in, we could all use some comedy."
15088,Homer,didn't even pull the string that time.
37097,Homer,"hey, if they can watch 'em for the rest of their lives they can certainly do it for a weekend."
24787,Homer,woo hoo!
41007,Homer,"hi'ya, team."
32074,Homer,woo hoo? liberals? woo hoo?
37633,Homer,how 'bout this one?
28882,Homer,my demons and i are closer than ever. next year we're gonna visit every major league baseball park. i'm just goin' in to bust marge out.
19637,Homer,agreed.
18998,Homer,how do you figure?
13173,Homer,love... conquers... all.
40580,Homer,"moe, i wish he'd shut up."
26202,Homer,wolves and cougars ate our roast beef!!
31925,Homer,"well son, your uncle homer is, like eighty percent of america, whacked-out on prescription drugs."
31152,Homer,"why, 'cause i'm fat?"
17773,Homer,and it was a baby ox.
36067,Homer,"you know what's great about you, marge? after all these years you can still shinny up the donut, and then pull me up after you."
15646,Homer,liar!
31198,Homer,lady. man. lady. man. lady.
41087,Homer,"oh no, we'd never give him away, but, we're moving to another country where dogs are forbidden. hear what? oh, sure. c'mere, boy! put that prowler down. come here! come on boy! say it, boy! say ""i love you"" for the nice man! i lub you. good dog! good doggie! isn't that amazing? see you soon. woooo! wooo!"
15761,Homer,"hey, what does this job pay?"
25019,Homer,colgate cavity patrol?
19446,Homer,"oh. you want me to climb that, huh? no problemo."
36593,Homer,a reason? what could it be?
25913,Homer,ow!
41475,Homer,...unnecessarily big tvs?!
27835,Homer,yeah.
30275,Homer,uh-oh. that might have broken the phone. i'd better call moe.
35530,Homer,sure. why not.
24632,Homer,read my lips: yes.
13690,Homer,"can i leave, mr. burns?"
38301,Homer,is there no end to your fault-finding?!
32768,Homer,uh... are you sure you want lisa to keep dancing?
21074,Homer,i guess that's it. ladies and gentlemen... we're in a tough spot and i don't know if we're gonna get out. please remain calm and think of your loved ones.
38400,Homer,"okay, sweetie, i'll call the van houtens."
31253,Homer,he wants to grind his own corn. maybe it'll finally shut him up about the high price of cornmeal.
35471,Homer,"don't panic, son. we can bust up teachy and preachy. here's what we do: i'll take flanders out and remind him of the joys of the single life. you scare rod and todd by telling them krabappel will become their evil stepmother."
32108,Homer,"oh, tell me more!"
33890,Homer,"no, dear. i'm a man, dear."
24381,Homer,"well, enjoy your sightseeing. i promise i won't leave this bed."
33631,Homer,"but there is, marge! the first two letters..."
33269,Homer,"so... now that we're alone, um... death to america, right?"
29742,Homer,"marge, your penny-pinching rampage has gone too far."
14264,Homer,"no, marge, i just can't. i mean, look at me. i'm a trainee... they won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce. but i can't buy you a decent wedding ring."
23551,Homer,the cooling tank just blew and they're taking lenny to the hospital.
29933,Homer,it's ray! i see him again! monster! you don't exist.
36997,Homer,the one thing i couldn't prepare for.
34391,Homer,after we see the stations of the omelet bar.
27700,Homer,"suicide, eh?"
23070,Homer,it's worth every cent. i'm tired of fumbling with round fruit.
37337,Homer,"moe, can you think of a way to please a woman that starts with ""f""?"
18855,Homer,"hi, lisa. how's your spring break going?"
15591,Homer,that's what you think .
41008,Homer,i dunno.
33282,Homer,bart?
40000,Homer,ms. botz? ms. botz?
22434,Homer,"max power doesn't abbreviate. each letter is as important as the one that preceded it. maybe more important. no, as important."
40352,Homer,"that was just a practice shot, boy."
24803,Homer,yes. i humiliate myself for fistfuls of cash.
13799,Homer,"yeah, krusty, tell us."
30163,Homer,"okay. flanders, you see..."
18253,Homer,pork chops?
34405,Homer,why you little...
20227,Homer,wowww...
32003,Homer,i'm still alive! you call that playing to win?!
28771,Homer,"why do you always take the children and not the fondue sets? why, santa, why?"
20260,Homer,"oh spade, why did you put farley in charge of the bees? hey buddy, down in front."
34172,Homer,"oh bart, you say that now. but when you're grown up, you'll just think it. now you stay here and i'll get your sister."
36117,Homer,"son, do you have a minute?"
24493,Homer,but we never saw people like us on tv.
41463,Homer,"oh, hair. i'll love you when you're old and gray."
34585,Homer,"absolutely. he's young, he's got two cute kids... he'll be moving in with a sexy lady octopus in no time. they'll have to sell their old place... too many memories. but if i'm not mistaken, there's a little whale-a-puss on the way."
29889,Homer,"sorry about that, pal."
32004,Homer,"this is our life now, milhouse. we're dumpster folk."
21586,Homer,that's boring. you're boring everybody. quit boring everyone!
32019,Homer,"c'mon, everybody. time for the family portrait. let's bunch together now. here we go."
18162,Homer,no. no. no. ewww. why is this on the floor?
24837,Homer,oh. i'm so stupid.
28823,Homer,"your majesty, can i go home now?"
41123,Homer,"excuse me. excuse me, have you seen an old man with a lot of money? he looks like me, but he's wrinkled? hello, have you seen a..."
19101,Homer,heeeeey...
17666,Homer,not on my shift.
38051,Homer,where's... my... mon... ey?
40201,Homer,"sorry, sir. it's just me, homer simpson. is everything all right?"
37162,Homer,"sure, what do i care?"
37410,Homer,"tent, eh?"
33709,Homer,"yeah, busboys get all the chicks."
28216,Homer,"marge, i don't know what this is, but sometimes you've just gotta go with your gut."
35706,Homer,this better be dinner theater!
26525,Homer,quit suffocating me. i'm going to moe's.
29359,Homer,woo hoo!
25831,Homer,ew! nasty!
36264,Homer,we're the same temperature we've always been.
27295,Homer,"guys, bob is my only hope. back off and give him some room to think."
26883,Homer,i want to confess. i killed and robbed the old lady all by myself. marge is completely innocent. the only thing she's guilty of is loving too much the murder i did.
32921,Homer,that's the highest point. and only fifteen minutes to go.
14216,Homer,that's the card. give it here.
26039,Homer,got that cat right in the leg.
34216,Homer,oops -- the frisbee went into the bushes. why don't you go find it?
26668,Homer,going cold turkey isn't as delicious as it sounds.
13609,Homer,"oh, you're right."
21616,Homer,ow!
27189,Homer,"you took a twenty-karat diamond, and made it gleam / like a big spaghetti dinner, smothered in whipped cream."
31617,Homer,ew! silver!
36104,Homer,i repeat. one...
22283,Homer,touchdown!
40289,Homer,"that's right, ned."
23090,Homer,could someone please whack my hernia back in?
38089,Homer,never!
26230,Homer,i don't know.
18550,Homer,i wanna price some flip-flops and smell the new tires and consult the pharmacist for some free medical advice!
25689,Homer,"don't say that, ned!"
25188,Homer,"oh god, my back..."
29711,Homer,ling?... ling?... ling?...
33705,Homer,"look, man, i don't want any trouble. c'mon -- here, here, just take my wallet. leave me alone, okay?"
18126,Homer,"pile in, everybody! no time to wipe your feet!"
27983,Homer,"boy, you're now second best in the family, right ahead of marge."
38180,Homer,our cushion!
23121,Homer,okay...
31633,Homer,"is it ""the count of monte cristo?"" 'cause i love that story."
21358,Homer,"ew, dad. ""tell my beloved wife my last thoughts were of her, blinding and torturing abe simpson. cheerio."""
26085,Homer,"wow, mr. burns, how did you do that?"
41121,Homer,casino?
19898,Homer,i filled the balls with a funnel.
41377,Homer,"whoa, he's getting serious. is this what i really want?"
30306,Homer,you know everything.
31090,Homer,but do you also remember that you're an enabler?
34022,Homer,to love!
36459,Homer,uh-oh.
32407,Homer,"hey come on, why don't you cheer up with a glass of ocean spray? oh boy -- forget that. how about some... cap'n crunch? uh, seven seas italian dressing? no, no! uh, chicken of the sea tuna? billy ocean cd? the history of atlantic records?"
30378,Homer,and would they pay handsomely for the privilege?
26134,Homer,seems kinda pointless now.
34004,Homer,"well, this day can't get any crazier."
14928,Homer,"because i don't care, okay? i can't fake an interest in this, and i'm an expert at faking an interest in your kooky projects."
39127,Homer,that's where all the problems are!
30078,Homer,"funny story, kent. it's the end of the world! god loves you! he's gonna kill you!"
40162,Homer,"oooh, thanks."
18230,Homer,why? that was the problem in the first place. you were going broke because we were your only customers. wasn't that the problem in the first place? that you were going broke... moe?
30654,Homer,"okay, christmas, christmas... you know how your paper boy always sends you a christmas card with his home address on it? what's up with that?"
16189,Homer,"eh, it's about the same. uh-oh! look out, smithers!"
22090,Homer,"oh, how was i supposed to know it's not a real spaceship?"
32383,Homer,no one likes a know-it-all.
37719,Homer,"um, actually, my hero was the actress who provided rocky's voice, june foray. a true legend in the voiceover community. i'm just gonna stay on the plane and think about her influence."
37204,Homer,tights? robes? this stupid locker must have belonged to some old lady.
17912,Homer,daddy has very important work to do. he's looking through the want ads to find a part-time job.
30062,Homer,"yeah, i'll bet the cats would be psyched about that. thanks marge, you've put my mind at ease. now how about a little ""rapture"" for mama?"
31189,Homer,"okay. take it, take it! just don't hurt me!"
31496,Homer,he killed greystash!
26023,Homer,"she's so sleepy, she doesn't know what she's saying. hee, hee."
30577,Homer,i wish. i made these at work.
25478,Homer,kids gone?
28072,Homer,i see. do you have any suggestions?
19902,Homer,"to alcohol! the cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems!"
33206,Homer,you what?
20997,Homer,"uh, maybe."
38959,Homer,i'd be too nervous. have you noticed that she's kinda hot?
30403,Homer,you're not saying no.
15688,Homer,"your conscience? lisa, don't let that pushy little weenie tell you what to do."
20877,Homer,oooh! oh! krusty!
34853,Homer,"up, a father has his secrets."
33539,Homer,"whoever's biting me, stop it!"
38643,Homer,isn't all great art kind of a mirror?
15333,Homer,"oh, what am i gonna do?"
23292,Homer,let me see.
24976,Homer,would you?
38672,Homer,why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little... why you little...
34874,Homer,possibly!
24987,Homer,dog for sale!
32952,Homer,this is the first book i've ever finished reading or pushing things into.
20896,Homer,to marge. and all the blissful years i've spent hiding from her in this bar.
32136,Homer,"oh, it was great! flew to tulsa on the company jet. did my job in a way consistent with what i already told you. because that's what you do. when you have a job."
23095,Homer,marge! your shoe!
25921,Homer,"your honor, i'd like to be tried separately."
24546,Homer,"nah, he'll get tired of biting in an hour or so. snakes: nature's quitters."
24468,Homer,"hey, yeah. you could load it up with lots of swears. that's what david mamet does."
34265,Homer,would you like to wear mittens or go commando?
34350,Homer,"don't know, don't care."
20607,Homer,lumber. we need lumber.
35040,Homer,"well, i've put it off, but today i'm finally getting this garage organized--"
23043,Homer,"i'm squeezing... i'm squee-zing it. hey, i squeezed so hard it went into my hand."
33603,Homer,"moe, something terrible has happened! the irish have become hardworking and sober!"
38332,Homer,"hey kids, wanna chase grandpa homer around the house?"
23330,Homer,uninspired.
21513,Homer,"marge, if you don't mind, i'm a little busy right now achieving financial independence."
17171,Homer,gotta go.
21313,Homer,"ranier wolfcastle! oh, i love your movies and your power sauce bars and your taut, rippling--"
40233,Homer,"uh, mr. burns... uh, mr. burns..."
19360,Homer,tele-panhandling.
20087,Homer,"hey everybody, i'm peter pantsless!"
19622,Homer,oh?
28446,Homer,wanna play some air hockey?
31346,Homer,i will!
17949,Homer,"but, i'm still hungry."
38351,Homer,i think that's about to change.
29336,Homer,"oh. well then, carry on."
28534,Homer,"get back to your bong, hippie."
35556,Homer,this is no way to treat the talent!
16511,Homer,"no! please, please, please, please, please..."
38270,Homer,but i did learn something from all this. the sprinklers in this park come on at three a.m.
30374,Homer,"noooo! bart, that's a really bad storage area!"
37209,Homer,"my dad's always been so angry. maybe if we help him be who he is, he'll finally be happy."
39676,Homer,plemk heh feh.
40307,Homer,who'd've thought it? a free ticket to a big league park but i was too tense to enjoy the game. every ounce of concentration i possessed was focused on the task at hand.
39000,Homer,you-- get-- out!
39454,Homer,"bart, please. five bucks for a kiss."
33060,Homer,i'm going to moe's.
38414,Homer,do you want to be more alone?
40217,Homer,"and some reporters and camera crews, but you don't need to feed them."
13897,Homer,"""scot-tish deer-hound."" hey, this is a dog!"
27607,Homer,you seem like an impartial observer. but i've been fooled by so many people in costumes.
40311,Homer,but they didn't care.
21191,Homer,"ow-ow, stupid-trash, rotten-stinky, hate-world, revenge-soon, take out on everyone... garbage water! oh-ho-ho!"
36776,Homer,okay.
15544,Homer,all aboard!
35668,Homer,"that's good, marge -- get all the terrible ideas out of your system."
32173,Homer,denny's.
26937,Homer,"have no fear, springshield's present!"
22509,Homer,wouldn't you like to know?
16087,Homer,"hello, dean? you're a stupid head."
28999,Homer,you monsters! you followed us!
41161,Homer,"great, fine, go nuts!"
13774,Homer,"look, i get enough admiration and respect at work. i don't need it here at home."
39193,Homer,"i don't get it. football players can do the quarterback sneak, and baseball players can steal bases. why can't i just remember which cards have been played?"
32883,Homer,you're alive! and you baked a pie!
21310,Homer,"gym? what's a ""gym?"""
18717,Homer,our savings?!
14419,Homer,huh?
17875,Homer,"no, my invention! all my money problems could've..."
37217,Homer,who?
37482,Homer,"give us some answers, or you'll get a mouthful of rotten shark fermented in its own urine."
27134,Homer,"there's no need for apologies, guys. you're rock stars! you're supposed to be reckless and destructive, and be celebrated for behavior that would land normal people in jail."
26104,Homer,"no, huh?"
19903,Homer,"alright, men. get ready to blast off!"
31568,Homer,so that means... it is opposite day.
24479,Homer,what are these things in the mashed potatoes?
25299,Homer,the name of bart's partner? i'm all ears.
30839,Homer,my son's been ape-napped!
34165,Homer,you... can't... do that...
21151,Homer,"oh, you're gonna love it in cuba, marge. there's shredded pork everywhere."
14713,Homer,"uh, then maybe you better not look at me."
14819,Homer,herb?
13617,Homer,yeah! damn right!
39785,Homer,tell him i'm going to the back seat of my car with the woman i love. and i won't be back for ten minutes.
35581,Homer,"how did this happen? last thing i remember, i was decorating the house for halloween."
30377,Homer,so you want maggie to infect your kids?
20092,Homer,throw it away! nothing good has ever come out of new york city!
27511,Homer,"well, we could live with a stopped-up drain."
40275,Homer,oh yeah? and where might that be? oh.
20083,Homer,"uh, yeah. i've always said the boy could use more confidence."
24524,Homer,"that slugfest at the state fair was really a blessing. it gave us a chance to pursue solo projects. i returned to my first love, the legitimate theater."
24934,Homer,huh?
16286,Homer,you got real purdy hair.
35214,Homer,how 'bout don johnson?
21925,Homer,"aww, you're just saying that."
37704,Homer,"did you just fart, sir."
24949,Homer,so she was made of chimps.
30920,Homer,"y'ello. you want my opinion on current movies?! well, first of all, they're all perfect. also: when's the cap'n crunch movie coming out? and will it be ""r"" or ""hard r""?"
32695,Homer,"mrs. simpson, may i take you for an evening drive? our loaner awaits!"
38549,Homer,"don't worry, marge. they can't beat us. because we're family-run."
41021,Homer,"oh, great."
40480,Homer,"oh, that never works. he's a goner."
33151,Homer,yeah. i missed her like five times.
17562,Homer,what should we do until you get back?
26219,Homer,"marge, you're speaking to me."
22816,Homer,why?! why must life be so hard? why must i fail in every attempt at masonry?
36940,Homer,my dog.
17523,Homer,"good news, everybody. because i endangered lives, we can fly anywhere we want."
30775,Homer,i'll have to go to every store in the pants district to find another pair like these.
26334,Homer,"drivers, start your engines!"
37472,Homer,i've already taken care of that.
33328,Homer,hey! that was--
35871,Homer,absolutely. let me just redistribute our thingies amongst our various bags.
37030,Homer,it's not that kind!
35536,Homer,that robot took our jobs!
21059,Homer,fire the torpedoes!
32475,Homer,huh? why do i look like me again?
23901,Homer,poor guy. he lost his leg.
18511,Homer,there's nothing to worry about. now everyone go to sleep. good night.
38621,Homer,"mr. burns, we did it! everyone in the neighborhood sold us their gas rights."
24188,Homer,"anyhoo, i'm about to share with you a modern-day miracle. something that has revitalized cities from east st. louis to biloxi, mississippi. the magic medicine of... casino gambling!"
15172,Homer,"no, it's true. you know, when i was a boy i really wanted a catcher's mitt. but, my dad wouldn't get it for me. so i held my breath until i passed out and banged my head on the coffee table. the doctor thought i might have brain damage."
32345,Homer,"don't worry, sir. i'll handle this cleanly, quietly and bart!"
21918,Homer,"uh. pretty, uh, freaky, huh?"
38903,Homer,it does look delicious.
16960,Homer,"i'll miss you, son."
28071,Homer,you mean... like give her full custody of the kids?
19393,Homer,i... what?
20116,Homer,"hey! i'm not a bum... thanks, but i don't need... okay, if you insist, but... spare change, lady? lousy cheapskate..."
30290,Homer,don't laugh! they're doing the best they can.
30605,Homer,"hey, that guy in first class is taking a tv out of his armrest."
40318,Homer,okay. i wonder why stories of degradation and humiliation make you more popular.
34282,Homer,that's my marge! high-five!
38941,Homer,no i'm not.
23869,Homer,that had nothing to do with the bucket.
40267,Homer,"as i got up in front of them, i felt an intoxication that had nothing to do with alcohol. it was the intoxication of being a public spectacle."
23281,Homer,we make a good team. a groin-grabbingly good team!
24379,Homer,my pockets hurt.
15349,Homer,barney!
40378,Homer,"ah, ""may the best man win"". the mating call of the loser."
27398,Homer,"... pay attention to you, my sweet little father-loving pile of forgiveness. yes."
31147,Homer,"buck, you've got a beautiful woman with a hot body that any man would fantasize about, even while making love to his own marge."
34777,Homer,i don't trust that guy. i bet he killed everyone on that boat himself.
30190,Homer,"okay, ned. get ready for your welcome home surprise."
24298,Homer,oh. my name is homer and i'm planning a trip to st. louis.
31158,Homer,don't tell the hamburger in my car.
30415,Homer,"i'm a-comin', boy!"
24964,Homer,"stupid, non-magical son, can't pay to fix my car."
20437,Homer,"what is it, sweetie?"
31699,Homer,"oh, spirit. are you gonna show me my future? my snow-flecked grave, mourned by no man? well, it's not too late for me to change!"
26262,Homer,"well, well. if it isn't the woman who's too busy saving the world to save her own marriage."
35925,Homer,"take that, centers of art and commerce. and this country has something extra that makes our meat the juiciest, most melt-in-your-mouth, stay-in-your-heart meat in the world. that's right, i'm talkin' about the gravy of freedom!"
15756,Homer,thanks a lot carl. now i've lost my train of thought.
27754,Homer,"hey, that looks fun! do me!"
15902,Homer,just squeeze your rage into a bitter little ball and release it at an appropriate time. like that day i hit the referee with a whiskey bottle. remember that?
32180,Homer,"oh, i can't wait to taste that hot fudge, and caramel, and crushed nuts, all slathered over a delicious... elderly corpse?!!!"
20261,Homer,war! hunh! good god y'all! / what is it good for? / absolutely nothin'! say it again! okay!
38505,Homer,i finally got over my sea sickness.
30759,Homer,"thank you, colonel."
15579,Homer,suggestion noted.
18817,Homer,for knocking mr. burns out a third story window.
18210,Homer,son of a bitch...
28995,Homer,"oh, right."
38134,Homer,"she's gone, honey. she's gone."
23660,Homer,"kids, come and get it!"
40619,Homer,i want fugu!
24948,Homer,he's very good.
24821,Homer,"i don't need to rehearse. ho, ho, ho, merry... line!"
19169,Homer,"son, there's only one thing punks like that understand: squealing. you've got to squeal to every teacher and every grown-up you can find. coming to me was a good start."
14954,Homer,i wear short shorts!
23414,Homer,"sir, i demand satisfaction."
38067,Homer,don't interrupt! i just thought it would be nice if we shared an interest.
31941,Homer,any moment...
26848,Homer,but what about the axe?
33882,Homer,conrad birdie? coming here to sweet apple?!
40485,Homer,"look, i know i can't stop you. the only thing i can do is ask you to promise me you won't jump the gorge."
37575,Homer,"they're called ""superoos,"" son. with pictures of the cast of ""the expendables""."
26133,Homer,why? he'd just bury it.
37691,Homer,i'm tired of livin' once.
32113,Homer,this is our relish tray. i'd like you to film it for insurance purposes.
20794,Homer,what kind of beer?
20589,Homer,"well, i bet there's drug dresses and drug vacuum cleaners, too!"
20763,Homer,"aw, you can't outsmart carnival folk. they're the cleverest folk in the world. just look at the way they sucker regular folk with those crooked games. that's it! fire! or..."
20318,Homer,let's get that! the suffocation thing!
36650,Homer,what the--? i'm not gonna gamble with my daughter's future.
29187,Homer,"well, that loser milhouse has always had a thing for her. don't you love it when nerds don't know they're nerds?"
32225,Homer,"die, you stupid cobra, die!"
34950,Homer,ten minutes? i can't wait that long! i left an ice cream cone in my cup holder!
36815,Homer,those aren't our regular donuts! they're huge... with crazy toppings! gummy worms! churro chunks! russian nesting donut!
18512,Homer,do i smell cookies? where's the cookies?
14938,Homer,yeah. how blanche was sad and how that guy stanley -- should have been nice to her.
40395,Homer,"news flash, lisa! bart is not a horse. eat your steak, boy."
33762,Homer,a thousand dollars?! that's what my house is worth!
24097,Homer,hello? mailman?
19677,Homer,"no, no. leave it in."
21693,Homer,that is one vicious baby bird.
18990,Homer,"cool concert, am i right?"
37270,Homer,"help me, flanders!"
16755,Homer,ants!
32210,Homer,"thanks! you know, of the three tenors, you're my second favorite! no wait, i forgot about that other guy. sorry, you're third."
25152,Homer,is there no place for the man with a 105 iq?
30037,Homer,neither. i'm both.
35866,Homer,is it snowing down here?
32767,Homer,"marge, i'm taking lisa out of that stupid-- what the?"
25217,Homer,they'll pay for what they did to my can.
26782,Homer,yes. you are scum.
32630,Homer,what? not allowed to get one right?
35024,Homer,"hm, better check last year's return."
35047,Homer,time to punch in.
19342,Homer,"oh, i've just made things worse. a few clumsy gestures aren't going to make up for 10 years of neglect. marge deserves someone who will treat her right. marge deserves a fresh start."
27315,Homer,your king needs these stilts!
17508,Homer,"wait a minute. there's something bothering me about this place. i know - this lesbian bar doesn't have a fire exit. enjoy your death trap, ladies."
41210,Homer,"hey, moses, keep 'em comin'."
18047,Homer,why you little...
36949,Homer,almost... holy moley...
39546,Homer,bart!
27742,Homer,"i have a plan to get to the top, but i have to do some pretty rotten things to get there. i'm not sure i could look at myself in the mirror, or any highly-polished metal."
32232,Homer,"that's good. you've calmly accepted that you will never have the only man you could ever love. now, i think it would be best if you left."
25427,Homer,"yes, sir."
32580,Homer,your stupid invention made me realize my life is worthless!
20176,Homer,"lisa, knock off that racket!"
40894,Homer,"now, c'mon. take all this, and this, put it in the closet."
13191,Homer,screw you!
36441,Homer,i'm your jesus! me!
15678,Homer,"ah, sweet pity. where would my love life have been without it?"
23437,Homer,"i was afraid of that. well, goodbye, my gentle neighbor. you know, i've always wanted to tell you how mu..."
16985,Homer,"where we'll get... a free room, free food, free swimming pool, free hbo - oooh, ""free willy!"""
32467,Homer,ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. ow. ow.
36415,Homer,but i'm a married man.
21820,Homer,"oh, there's that movie script i wrote. where did you find it?"
27035,Homer,fine. there are plenty of other ways for me to alter my consciousness.
36265,Homer,play balll!
22639,Homer,"oooh, here's something you'd like. ""when animals attack magicians."""
22318,Homer,"oh, please, can't you let me slide this time?"
18588,Homer,"i don't know. you know, some guy. otto, i guess."
31424,Homer,"what's the matter, son? don't you have enough money for ice cream?"
20113,Homer,ow.
39051,Homer,nothing.
13146,Homer,that's 'cause i've eaten sixteen pieces of pie.
41367,Homer,don't eat it. it's been in his ear. don't eat it. it's been in his ear.
28596,Homer,"first of all, thank you. secondly..."
22632,Homer,"if you've got to do something, click this pen."
25341,Homer,everybody's been dumped but me. i'm undumpable.
24687,Homer,"yeah, it's hopeless."
27381,Homer,"ah, the information i've been waiting for."
35940,Homer,mozart!
20785,Homer,"marge, marge, marge. remember when those smooth-talking guys tried to sell me a time-share vacation condo?"
27443,Homer,now dr. hibbert said to use a number from one to ten to describe how anxious you are.
27193,Homer,no dice. take your fun and adventure outside.
19187,Homer,"oh, why me?"
21217,Homer,"but this isn't like a loan application or a will -- you signed away my dignity. and i'm going to get it back. lisa, do i have my pants on?"
36023,Homer,"hm, the french have gotten into the wine game. good luck catchin' up with the big boys."
26531,Homer,burn this guy! he lost our good bucket!
26532,Homer,wow.
20443,Homer,look at him go!
24684,Homer,"yeah, we're heroes... but where's our parade?"
16005,Homer,"i'd like to thank you on behalf of the group, and i hope we passed the audition."
35168,Homer,well why couldn't you have said that a minute ago? don't take any of my ideas.
31193,Homer,no problem. i'll be back in ten minutes.
32326,Homer,can't be late for lisa's big day...
41406,Homer,"hey, what's going on here?!"
16979,Homer,all right.
28354,Homer,"please, your majesty, i know that i, like many other americans, have behaved like a total buffoon."
27753,Homer,"eat crowd, old man!"
33366,Homer,i've gotta know.
17635,Homer,woo hoo!
24958,Homer,"okay, we'll move. we don't want any trouble, fellas."
26505,Homer,it was the end of the trojan war. clever odysseus had come up with a plan to destroy the trojans once and for all...
39801,Homer,"oh, this is the most fun i've had in my whole life."
23485,Homer,shut up and kiss me.
35739,Homer,but why?
32679,Homer,loa...ner?
31750,Homer,"hey selma, want some rice?"
28470,Homer,"you can't leave, i'm your ride home!"
14745,Homer,i'm sorry lurleen. all i wanted to do was share your beautiful voice with other people and i've done that. now i better get out of here before i lose my family.
32016,Homer,"ooh, a thermos! with seven cups of coffee still in it! oh wait, six!"
14659,Homer,"why marge, you frisky little devil."
34637,Homer,why you--

40560,Homer,"oh, dr. hibbert from johns hopkins medical school?"
13510,Homer,"yeah, well i'll be on my --"
26455,Homer,that hurts. but i just have one question: do you want my son to be disappointed in you?
19549,Homer,i kill me.
29792,Homer,but he misread my pee! he misread my peeeee!
26252,Homer,"wow, my vision is coming to life!"
24719,Homer,"this is perfect! if i know fat tony, which i don't, he'll be distracted by his hosting duties. come on."
27970,Homer,"quit following me, you coward!"
41197,Homer,"ohh, pretty creepy. still, i'd rather have him chasing me than of the wolf man."
32623,Homer,cups... newspapers... bottles... tricycle... lawn chair... un-cashed checks...
18825,Homer,"oh, it's just bart and a mysterious stranger."
33231,Homer,but it's glowing.
33201,Homer,"and these days, betting in a bar is safer than any stock, bond or real estate investment."
13961,Homer,awww.
21208,Homer,"uh, it's like the measles. good to get it out of the way."
14271,Homer,you mean?
37381,Homer,church bulletin? church bulletin? find out in whose loving memory this week's service is. the answer may shock you.
35847,Homer,"oh marge, how would you like some ""future sex""?"
14182,Homer,"no, everything's fine. your mother uh, just, broke her leg."
13142,Homer,so cool.

16102,Homer,those bastards...
16276,Homer,here you g... nnnnnno.
36389,Homer,"no, just my marriage."
35014,Homer,"wow, the killers have been kind to me... while the people who were supposed to protect me treated me like dirt! what kind of a world is this?"
29982,Homer,"marge, i know this is ill-gotten, but can we use it to..."
14155,Homer,no.
28827,Homer,"oh my god! maggie, you're talking!"
33200,Homer,"really? well, i did bring this envelope full of money."
25876,Homer,fine.
24575,Homer,"oh, that's all you got? huh? huh?"
34813,Homer,"well, nobody loves his kids more than me!"
21704,Homer,"i know you are, but what am i?"

25447,Homer,don't worry. duff's not gonna let me waste away to nothing.
37331,Homer,marriage is so tough. every second it could explode catastrophically. makes me not want to come home from my job at the nuclear plant.
22665,Homer,woo! sensory deprivation kicks ass.
33801,Homer,but that makes no sense!
18021,Homer,we can't lose. look at the name of the dog i bet on.
30674,Homer,"there's only one lifeguard whose name begins with ""m""!"
37560,Homer,"even better, i never unpacked from the time we went to hawaii."
16587,Homer,"you better have a good reason for doing that, boy."
19041,Homer,"i forgot my swimsuit, too. but i improvised."
21646,Homer,i borrowed your wallet!
27891,Homer,wow. wow. i never realized you felt about me that way. we should really take some time to talk and...i'd just end up hurting you!
17751,Homer,"lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials is so we don't have to think all the time. just like that rain forest scare a few years back. our officials saw there was a problem, and they fixed it. didn't they?"
14520,Homer,"oh fudge, that's broken."
20609,Homer,come on! it'll be fun!
13760,Homer,"simpson, it's all up to you. it's showtime!"
34502,Homer,oops.
23607,Homer,"not anymore, ron. now, i'm looking for something to dedicate my life to. something noble, but easy."
21173,Homer,can he get a duck?
32711,Homer,i'll bet no man would touch you.
16925,Homer,huh?
20477,Homer,whoa...
32353,Homer,marge is a professional assassin!
25391,Homer,"welcome to real life, lisa. you can't fight city hall, aka blockoland. so don't even try."
33232,Homer,"marge, i installed all the low energy bulbs!"
29057,Homer,i already work for you.
15804,Homer,"row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream..."
18338,Homer,"ooh, erotic cakes!"
35011,Homer,"wha-- oh, oh, uh, mr. burns? uh, you were cool too."
38083,Homer,i like how they cut them down from a hundred and forty characters to a more manageable twenty characters.
21422,Homer,run!
31486,Homer,angelica trembled as she looked up at the stern but wise whiskers of headmaster greystash...
26595,Homer,taxi!
30781,Homer,"it's called ""headvertising."" it creates brand awareness without relying on traditional media."
36677,Homer,"now, what was that singer's name again?"
15308,Homer,"get out of here, you lousy... season!"
21200,Homer,"i never apologize, lisa. i'm sorry, but that's just the way i am."
14690,Homer,"marge, let's end this feudin' and a fussin' and get down to some lovin'."
17934,Homer,call off the debt?
38325,Homer,"amen, baby! did you make potato salad for the wake?"
16962,Homer,because one of them hung out with me for a week trying to get my character down.
40139,Homer,"okay boy, let's see you talk yourself out of this one."
33995,Homer,really?
39555,Homer,lisa?
22480,Homer,fine. hooty mcboob it is.
39335,Homer,"it could be one of these chemicals here that makes him so smart. lisa, maybe you should try some of this."
25426,Homer,i'm sorry to hear that.
33293,Homer,bo-ring!
22715,Homer,i bet ol' red caught himself a mess o' catfish with these fishing sticks.
38340,Homer,why you little! i'll teach you to emulate my sloppiness!
40481,Homer,"okay, okay. i'll try."
34439,Homer,"well, if i made any sense today, it's because all the stuff you've told me all these years has finally seeped in."
21577,Homer,de de de de de.
37603,Homer,hope it pays off for youuu...
40882,Homer,he's not home.
30299,Homer,"i love you, marge."
17634,Homer,woo hoo!

21317,Homer,"heh, heh, heh. go ahead. try and grab some flab. go on. ju--"
36956,Homer,"i made it, kids! i am king of learning-ton castle!"
34541,Homer,"don't worry, i'll go see what's wrong!"
23033,Homer,"ohh, don't worry, sweetheart, i'll get us the money. even if i have to get a second job."
20192,Homer,brilliant! i have absolutely no idea what's going on.

26506,Homer,stupid king of troy. i think i speak for all the greeks when i say this war has gone on for too long.
27575,Homer,"did you see that, boy? your mom thinks you're still here!"
19039,Homer,i left a few helpful notes around the house...
39138,Homer,feminine?!
19318,Homer,i don't wanna go to that.
29486,Homer,"marge, my darling! thank god you're home! i've been dying to hear your feelings!"
35716,Homer,"all right, that's it! forget it! no toys for anyone!"
26780,Homer,"let's say this pepper got married to this salt shaker, and along comes sexy mrs. dash..."
28839,Homer,and it's a perfect time... i just got fired again.
20868,Homer,"why, yes. yes i do."
36406,Homer,"well, why can't i hang out at the bar all day? my wife doesn't wanna be with me."
31714,Homer,"marge, we're not going to have to worry about money ever again. because i've got a plan..."
39867,Homer,"oh, hello principal skinner. i'd get up but the boy crippled me."
28699,Homer,"flanders, i'm gonna do something i shoulda done a long time ago."

21979,Homer,"what's your problem, veggie? you don't even eat lobster."
32189,Homer,my pleasure. if ever i would leave you / it wouldn't be in summer. / seeing you in summer i never would go...
36620,Homer,"honey, i'm sorry. it's just that we have a hard enough time handling three kids."
39160,Homer,what the?
36806,Homer,"marge, up to now i thought your hair was blue cotton candy, but now i know it's a solid loaf of brain."
16800,Homer,"losers! losers! kiss my big springfield behind, shelbyville!"
26418,Homer,"all right, son. we'll all go -- first class!"
39920,Homer,"did you hear that, marge? my boy speaks french."

31978,Homer,oh please take me back. the dating scene is a nightmare. i'm begging you!
24179,Homer,"well, ak, it's because god is powerful, but also insecure, like barbra streisand, before james brolin. oh, he's been a rock."
22537,Homer,ow! prickers! owwww!

17520,Homer,"uh, yeah, um, uh as a change of pace, i'm gonna let you do most of the work. i think you're ready for it, alan."
27873,Homer,"the kids are cool, but marge is still judging me."
29235,Homer,i've got you deep in the heart of me...
23173,Homer,hel-lo.
24391,Homer,all for homer... all for homer...
39999,Homer,i don't like the looks of this.
16822,Homer,but... all right.
37747,Homer,you like lies? here's a few: college is expensive but it's worth it...
34715,Homer,"uh, what region is america?"
40401,Homer,woo-hoo-hoo!
37489,Homer,"well, we won't know that till after."
29142,Homer,bill clinton? what are you doin' here?
16727,Homer,"what, what does it say? i want to see."

32227,Homer,"so did you see the show tonight? remember the part where i forgot the words and i just sang ""uh-oh spaghetti-os"". i'm hoping they send me a case."
19066,Homer,"right. bart, you stay home and tape the hockey game."
25194,Homer,"yeah, there's some neat stuff on the front."
31429,Homer,"whoa marge, for the first time in my life, i'm excited about going to work!"
19258,Homer,"you know, i don't know."
14901,Homer,"she, uh... good for her."
23789,Homer,stupid sexy flanders!
35637,Homer,"do this, do that. lousy roz, thinks she's so big..."
25672,Homer,"well, aren't you gonna invite me in?"
17845,Homer,"really? look, boy! now i'm in australia! now i'm in america!"
22901,Homer,"shut up, shut up, shut up!"
14654,Homer,easy... easy... how'm i doing on the right?
29153,Homer,yes.
19790,Homer,"that is a very immature attitude, young man."
36707,Homer,"i am turning my back, because i can't stand to look you in the face."
20539,Homer,"i'd like a yellow boat, please. with extra motors."
16823,Homer,c'mon! we've been here for fifteen minutes. can't you see they're sucking the life out of us?
22658,Homer,oh no. no freezing.
27374,Homer,how did you know?
24416,Homer,"yeah, but first i talked to the engineer. he said there's a procedure for dealing with events of this nature."
23785,Homer,"that suit's a little revealing, isn't it?"
31976,Homer,"split up?! marge, no! we can fix this marriage!"
38296,Homer,"hello, marjorie."
32754,Homer,"yeah, that's it, don't be shy..."
40336,Homer,"get this. he said... he said... well, it wasn't so much what he said, it was how he said it!"
33146,Homer,"well, that takes care of those three -- want to go play some lakeside boggle?"
28221,Homer,there's coffee in the thermos.
31690,Homer,he loves it!
18061,Homer,mmmmmm.
21743,Homer,"hello-- oh, great. mormons."
25934,Homer,"it's only the milkman. hey, maybe i should be a milkman."
23883,Homer,"yeah, well you went to a cow college!"
19986,Homer,put it in! put it in!
14343,Homer,why didn't you say that before!
39256,Homer,and why is that?
18080,Homer,"marge, you being a cop makes you the man, which makes me the woman. and i have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which, as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing."
22912,Homer,"lucky stiff. i'm working my ass off here. good steak, honey."
17078,Homer,but i'm not in the cla...
15554,Homer,"yes, son. i'm the best mono-thingy guy there ever was."
15054,Homer,"uh, was your second wish to be entered in the little miss springfield pageant?"
17561,Homer,that's just a carp swimming around your ankles.
27542,Homer,la la la la la la la la la.
33596,Homer,uh-oh.
25245,Homer,"whoa, whoa, this is gettin' kind of pricey."
20681,Homer,"well, they put us on the ""waiting to exhale waiting list."" but they said don't hold your breath."
33440,Homer,"i won't be insured until three o'clock?! okay, until then, i have to avoid any serious injuries or accidents on my property, or i'm ruined."
27388,Homer,mom? don't you think i could read the report by myself?
18195,Homer,"listen. yes, i know."
16551,Homer,"eh, that's no big loss."
22396,Homer,"hey, what's going on? that guy's not homer simpson. he's fat and stupid."
17862,Homer,"yeah, that's right barney. this year i invested in pumpkins. they've been going up the whole month of october, and i got a feeling they're gonna peak right around january. and bang, that's when i'll cash in."
33611,Homer,"let me say i've always admired the irish. knute rockne, larry bird, and especially mr. potato head."
26574,Homer,take me to the hotel / my hands are on a guy's ass / boy this dude must work out...
21785,Homer,"so, what are you two kids doin' in my neck of the woods?"
20150,Homer,"we'll see, honey."
39980,Homer,bye kids. watch out for the boy.
34179,Homer,potato!
30266,Homer,"look, we've been down this road before. i do something stupid, your mom leaves, we eat waffles."
24236,Homer,i know what you mean. our dog had that.
32887,Homer,"every time you go, i feel abandoned. but not this time. i'm not gonna let myself get hurt."
39852,Homer,hep... heyyy... whoooo... look out... yeah... da da da da da.
15928,Homer,"now kids, while your mother's gone, i don't wanna have to wash any dishes. so, from now on, drink straight from the faucet or milk carton, and we'll eat while standing over the sink or toilet."
37615,Homer,"ow, this rug is hard on my knees. ow, this rug is hard on my knees. ow, this rug is hard on my knees."
15164,Homer,"bart, didn't i ask you to watch maggie?"
38472,Homer,"oh lisa, honey, you can't insulate yourself from life. why i could live till a hundred or a bus could hit me tomorrow. that's why i never plan more than four seconds ahead."
35571,Homer,"marge, i parented!"
18333,Homer,"piece of cake, son!"
13259,Homer,"just one minute left to get into heaven! there's gotta be some good deed i can do. c'mon, think, think."
38921,Homer,what?! when were you gonna tell me?
17252,Homer,"it's the rapture! quick, get bart out of the house before god comes!"
19938,Homer,marge!
26170,Homer,a grizzly bear with a chainsaw. now there's a killing machine!
32507,Homer,he cheats at uno!
39830,Homer,anybody home?
15719,Homer,my name is homer and i'm just here because the court made me come.
15382,Homer,it on a crooked '50's game show!
17815,Homer,"hey, what are these holes?"
28031,Homer,you see? i'm finally thin enough to wrap this thing around my arm.
21904,Homer,"oh, yeah? when's the last time you freaked out the establishment? you guys are total sellouts."
39130,Homer,plant-watering guy.
31038,Homer,she doesn't recognize us!
16049,Homer,"must destroy mankind! ohh, lunch time."
30279,Homer,"ew, lemon cream! you're goin' in the marge pile. i mean i love you so much..."
24876,Homer,i am not. or am i?
24389,Homer,bring on the rappin' granny!
15171,Homer,"someday you'll thank me for this, son."
18824,Homer,oh. i guess that's not him then.
19435,Homer,"what's happening to me? okay, retrace your steps... woke up, fought with marge, ate guatemalan insanity peppers. then i -- ohhhh."
37053,Homer,what women really want is a guy who's confident enough to go completely downhill after marriage and know she'll still love him.
38573,Homer,the bed is lifting me! the elevator at work can't even do that! i demand you put me down right after the sex!
28257,Homer,"oh, stop it."
39622,Homer,all right. all right! i'll take it.
19650,Homer,come on. there's no need for that baba-ma-bushka.
17783,Homer,that's it! you people have stood in my way long enough. i'm going to clown college!
24869,Homer,i did it. i changed the world. now i know exactly how god feels.
28461,Homer,"boy, everybody loves my show."
16011,Homer,oh no!
24233,Homer,hmm. this isn't nearly as complicated as moe made it seem.
41103,Homer,"yeah, right."
27491,Homer,"flanders, what's your secret? you never get arrested, you don't buy your clothes at ""mr. blob"" and look at your beautiful lawn. it sickens me."
30793,Homer,"don't leave me! i hate to be alone! except when i'm watching tv, then leave me alone. but right now, don't leave!"
14288,Homer,"as the years went by, your mother and i were blessed twice more."
15205,Homer,hey! then i could follow my dream. living in the woods and keeping a journal of my thoughts.
36026,Homer,"women and shoes, am i right?"
26103,Homer,"how about benihana, where dinner is the show?"
15490,Homer,"dear lord, i'm really scared about this operation tomorrow. if something happens, please look after marge, and make sure my kids grow up right."
35074,Homer,"well, if they care that much about whether you have a mini-bike, then they weren't really your friends."
35656,Homer,is there any better feeling than cutting in line because a plastic badge says you're special?
37123,Homer,"listen to your sister, boy."
16641,Homer,"there, there."
35895,Homer,"they love me! the quiet homer simpson that kept it all bottled up inside is dead. this is the birth of homer simpson, blowhard! i'm on the roll of my life! gimme a scratcher!"
24327,Homer,"lenny, carl, i know a lot of people bad-mouth you, and focus on how you suck, but not me. to me, you're true blue."
26268,Homer,"well, good work, blue-hair 'n' brocko-witch. okay, that was mine."
16346,Homer,"thank you. very, very much."
17544,Homer,"well keep it up, then."
14181,Homer,"yeah, and i have the same tightness in my chest and profuse sweating i always get."
24771,Homer,consider it done.
14090,Homer,"you just lost yourself a customer, moe!"
37874,Homer,"come on, i'll drive you to the airport."
20902,Homer,relax. all i smell is garlic and fish.
38518,Homer,does this answer your question?
28625,Homer,can you do my back?
14380,Homer,"lisa, you've picked the winner every time! you must have some kind of special gift."
31169,Homer,"oh, so now we're judging each other based on things we've done. real fair. class act."
24995,Homer,"oh, of course, of course. it's just that..."
22333,Homer,c'mon!
34151,Homer,beware of marshall goldmannn!
18217,Homer,"hey, marge, remember when we used to make out to this hymn?"
35999,Homer,"man, this website makes talking drunk to my wife so much safer."
32614,Homer,"set the table, marge!"
13901,Homer,i'll take it!
17211,Homer,"ah, the interstate. fasten your seatbelts, kids. we're on our way to itchy and scratchy land!"
23571,Homer,"yes, bart's weird friend."
27093,Homer,but rock stars are supposed to be about drinking and getting drunk and boozing it up.
37760,Homer,good as new. and thanks for loaning me your sweater for the ride home. it may be a little stretched out.
27431,Homer,"hey, your early porno movies! are any of these hetero?"
28418,Homer,"okay, it's probably the tag. but just to be sure..."
32348,Homer,"now all i have to do is think of a clever line before i pull the trigger. oh, that's a perfect one. but i don't need to say it out loud, 'cause i'm by myself."
23171,Homer,"hey, come on, turn that down-under frown upside down. we're not finished yet."
30873,Homer,my collection is complete. forty years of the family circus.
23343,Homer,he's dead!
32200,Homer,nei cieli bigi guardo fumar dai mille comignoli parigi.
19261,Homer,"geez, look at this place. we gotta do something."
13898,Homer,"now lady, i'm buying this pony for my little girl, and i don't care what it costs."
34909,Homer,"well, bart learned a lesson, and most important of all, we don't have to stop and pick up dinner."
30913,Homer,"marge, meet pro football's newest team: the springfield meltdowns!"
36872,Homer,"oh no, it's true!"
27976,Homer,fine.
13484,Homer,"oh, marge, you saved me from making a big mistake. y'know, i finally understand the meaning of mmphm hnmph."
41511,Homer,"b-b-b-b-but the poncho. hit the road, square."
20714,Homer,"who, me?"
17675,Homer,"ooh, lovely desk. it would be too bad if someone, oh, i don't know... didn't use a coaster!!"
14823,Homer,"oh, goodbye, old girl. we've had a lot of great memories."
40599,Homer,no!
19154,Homer,"say, what's going on?"
15297,Homer,no.
29878,Homer,next song. / that's what i meant. / absolutely.
21824,Homer,you lie!
22967,Homer,check.
31301,Homer,"that's ridiculous, talking fudge."
32897,Homer,asleep with your eyes open? mom?
34994,Homer,ayyyy!
28206,Homer,"all right. ""drought threatens to turn west into dessert""? yum, yum. i think i'd like some whipped cream on my wyoming!"
34355,Homer,bart!
30801,Homer,"hey bar-boy, dance around like an idiot. like this!"
31303,Homer,"well, back to the drawing board."
23887,Homer,"oh, you just know what everyone should do, don't you, marge?"
31674,Homer,did she mention she was knocked up?
36866,Homer,"yeah, that's right, the friendship between the simpsons and the whatever-your-last-name-is-es-es is over!"
31548,Homer,"it's not sugar, it's caramel!"
40031,Homer,hmmmm
19916,Homer,"hi marge, hi santa's little helper, hi kid -- hey, that's not santa's little helper."
30252,Homer,because you look even more beautiful now than the day i married you.
21897,Homer,"okay, okay. narc."
31526,Homer,"yeah, but there's something else. there's this loser staying in our house. marge says she's gonna kick him out, but then she never does."
15662,Homer,and then when he's lying on the ground...
27992,Homer,"i'm sorry i was ever mean to you. marge, prepare the celebration ham."
27372,Homer,"ooh, pie."
30241,Homer,...expiration date oh-six oh-eight.
38585,Homer,don't yell at me! i'm a double widower! but i can handle all the ghosts you can float at me!
38310,Homer,"um. excuse me, lisa."
36007,Homer,fish out of water!
28205,Homer,"too soon, huh?"
16200,Homer,"hey, wait. if i don't finish this last bite, you don't get my soul, do you?"
31558,Homer,"oh, so, forming an angry mob, eh? who we goin' after?"
19838,Homer,don't laugh at me! i was once like you!
41442,Homer,"see what your monkeyshines have done, boy?!"
26030,Homer,it's the law. my hands are tied.
30567,Homer,"i'll take that... too slow, drooly joe... peek-a-boo! i steal from you!"
22775,Homer,"oh, poor eve. what are you doing out there in that horrible place?"
18904,Homer,"all right, that does it. if i'm gonna be trapped inside the house i gotta go out and buy some beer."
14261,Homer,marge?
17456,Homer,no.
18239,Homer,"it was good, but not great."
37731,Homer,oh. it was all just a dream.
19592,Homer,"oh, thank god. it's only grampa."
36839,Homer,"great, marge, now that's in their heads."
14955,Homer,"the perfect chance to make my patented, space age, out-of-this-world moon waffles."
19979,Homer,"i'd like the phone book for hokkaido, japan, please."
40793,Homer,do the hustle!
22831,Homer,"oh, i got that, lady."
18139,Homer,woo-hoo!
38842,Homer,no.
39484,Homer,"oh, come on, marge. why scrimp now on the off-chance that they'll actually get in someplace?"
16815,Homer,hey what gives? i thought you had a satellite dish.
14596,Homer,"you don't understand, marge. the lottery is the one ray of hope in my otherwise unbearable life. uh, the lottery and you."
40607,Homer,"oh, okay, okay!"
17096,Homer,"all right, brain. it's all up to you. if you don't think of what it is, we'll lose marge forever."
34394,Homer,"ned, i'm an american tourist. i'm just here to see some sights, try goofy new food and spread some shekels with my carolina panthers credit card."
23231,Homer,really? with butterscotch on it?
17282,Homer,can't. frozen.
38273,Homer,don't worry. it's bottom all right.
40907,Homer,oops.
22547,Homer,canyonero...
23182,Homer,"i'm tired of running away. did ""braveheart"" run away? did ""payback"" run away? it's time we showed those suits what we're made of."
22070,Homer,"i'm sorry i ran off again. oh, i guess dad must be dead by now. when i get better, and after i've built those shelves for the kitchen, we'll visit his grave..."
38374,Homer,how is it my fault?
35827,Homer,it's closing?! but where will people find clips of old tv shows if they're not housed in a giant building? where? where?
30445,Homer,oh no! i've been killed!
39831,Homer,how's your mom?
37772,Homer,"um, november."
16718,Homer,how about me?
21923,Homer,"aww, it was sweet of those guys to blame an oaf, but really it was my fault. i just don't have the discipline to be a hippie."
18895,Homer,maybe it's time we put grampa in a home.
13215,Homer,"all right simpsons, welcome to our new home."
35304,Homer,"how many more, sir?"
29041,Homer,"let's see...cartilage, cartilage, muscle, nerve!... artery...bullet."
28033,Homer,"calm down, stresserella!"
33725,Homer,"well, at least i can eat again!"
28543,Homer,uh... is it despair?
19182,Homer,"hey, what's this?"
27181,Homer,"well, someone's tucked in to an insane degree. goodnight!"
36840,Homer,"""star wars"" chewy's just a man in a costume, so he's not scary."
35546,Homer,except me!
36993,Homer,see? these are our bug-out bags. in here is everything we need to survive.
38461,Homer,i don't!
13383,Homer,oh.
31871,Homer,"i hate shopping. i'm bored, my feet hurt, i'm too big for the choo-choo train... hmm, where's the ""husband chair?"""
25192,Homer,my back!
32377,Homer,"oh, i'm not decent. let me throw something on!"
27919,Homer,"what? it said ""take one."""
30671,Homer,"lifeguard, huh?"
18647,Homer,"hey, jerk! move your fanny!"
15504,Homer,"bart, the saddest thing about this is i won't get to see you grow up, because..."
32370,Homer,crème brûlée! crème brûlée! or in english: burnt cream! burnt cream!
40445,Homer,"damn, no spots."
36717,Homer,this is how i get out of doing the dishes.
33142,Homer,"coming, marge!"
20597,Homer,you betcha.

13654,Homer,the fly was funny and a booger was the icing on the cake...
24307,Homer,"if i didn't, i'd lose their respect."
32446,Homer,old one?! they're convincing marge to dump me!
35465,Homer,"okay, time to go back in the... night-night... this is harder than it looks... don't you humiliate me in front of my kid... i thought we had a deal, man!"
31701,Homer,wow. i have a pretty good life after all.
27203,Homer,"oh, we're gonna do a little more than just ogling."
26972,Homer,"speed it up, ugly."
17662,Homer,"it all began about two years ago, before maggie was even born. bart, you were lisa's age and lisa you were the age bart was several years ago."
13747,Homer,"hey, when do we get the check for this?"
15243,Homer,my hammock! do you understand? mine! don't look that way.
38275,Homer,"yes i did! i heard ""competitive eater""!"
40409,Homer,"halftime, marge, halftime."
18282,Homer,"i understand, honey. i used to believe in things when i was a kid."
31804,Homer,"he's trying to make me look like a bad father. maggie, take the wheel!"
27807,Homer,night... glorious night...
14876,Homer,"son, if you really want something in this life you have to work for it. now quiet, they're about to announce the lottery numbers."
24169,Homer,really? you're proud of me?
26603,Homer,you ain't pretty no more!
20135,Homer,it's gonna be dark soon. i'll never make it out of here with this rotten boot on my car.
13638,Homer,who's that?
18780,Homer,hmmm. one of these must be a breakfast maker.
26965,Homer,you had me at comfort.
34234,Homer,sorry boy. you have school tomorrow.
17455,Homer,no.
15621,Homer,so that's it!
29034,Homer,comic book guy! don't do the crime if you can't do the key lime!
23573,Homer,next question.

36370,Homer,"boy, thanks to you, we're having fun -- ""before you were born"" fun."
17338,Homer,"lisa, if the bible has taught us nothing else, and it hasn't, it's that girls should stick to girl sports, such as hot oil wrestling, foxy boxing, and such and such."
23659,Homer,"well, don't worry, i can help ya. i'm all about ideas."
32669,Homer,"for the next two hours, we'll be kid free. it'll be just like the time we lost them at the mall."

35150,Homer,"""family, today i graduate from my anger management class."""
23319,Homer,"i don't need lisa to write a good review. ""the food at the gilded truffle really..."" uh... what's a good word?"
40521,Homer,there's peas in my fruit cobbler.
39762,Homer,"lisa, i'm not scared. i think it's a great chance to spend some time with you kids. your mother always gets to be alone with you, and now it's my turn. does the time always drag like this?"

13185,Homer,the album cover's gonna be a naked girl with stars for boobs.
34375,Homer,"no! if you go near her one more time, we'll be sued into the poor house and have to eat garbage forever."
35161,Homer,oscars? what are you talking about? my son gave me this list of awesome things to do in l.a.
33546,Homer,professor frink! help me figure this out!
29701,Homer,a.

13188,Homer,kids? no way! you'll never see a couple of rug-rats tying me down!
29880,Homer,"don't worry, honey. i found us a roofer last night, and you'll never guess where."
34103,Homer,"ooo, look! ""congress of the crow!"""
25452,Homer,"oh, so hungry... can't give up... must continue fighting evil corporation."
13640,Homer,"yeah, your other speech was a little more crowd pleasin'."
24679,Homer,why me?
25393,Homer,"you're right, honey. hear that, kids? the simpsons are going to blockoland!"
21138,Homer,"hey, that guy looks like you."
23469,Homer,"and for those who face nature unafraid, it is they who reap the... ah... i'm down."
14302,Homer,there's only one can of beer left and it's bart's.
13946,Homer,"i'll work form midnight to eight, come home, sleep for five minutes, eat breakfast, sleep six more minutes, shower, then i have ten minutes to spend as i please. then i'm off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy."
39167,Homer,"and the older one, i can't tell her what to do. and she's only twelve."
34128,Homer,nope.
38647,Homer,"all set. when he starts gnawing at you, i'll whack him with this broom."
37926,Homer,"have you forgotten what you promised at our wedding -- to love and cherish, to aid and abet?"
16654,Homer,"oh, stomach churning... bowels clenching... not much time. must finish."
27937,Homer,"check it out, beavers. delicious motel furniture!"
35280,Homer,i guess it's just how i was raised.
17732,Homer,i needed more money to support my growing family. and there was only one place in town that a man like me could make it.
17247,Homer,i can't take this anymore. let's switch back.
27525,Homer,sweet.
36340,Homer,the kids are away and maggie's napping...
22429,Homer,"yeah, but faster."
33928,Homer,is that all this temporary job was to you: a gig?
29417,Homer,phobos? that's a good job for me.
41312,Homer,you cool it -- i'm hungry!
25029,Homer,"well, look at that. but who called the police?"
13406,Homer,i am the champions / i am the champions / no time for losers / cause i am the champions / of the worlllld!
31915,Homer,"okay nappien, do your stuff."
19139,Homer,oh.
29216,Homer,"please spare me. i'm not a murderer, i'm not. and i've never known the pleasures of a woman... or a proper eating apple!"
34337,Homer,must win fight... must win fight...
26207,Homer,it's okay. we're married.
23188,Homer,"okay, that's it. let's get ready to meet our public."
33514,Homer,"i know it seems that way, because i'm such a vivid storyteller. now here's another story called ""bart's mistake."" we were walking home when"
40416,Homer,"son, this is a tradition. if you start building a balloon for every flash-in-the-pan cartoon character, you'd turn the parade into a farce."
16746,Homer,i can't stands no more.
30818,Homer,"now to begin ""operation: slight edge""."
20713,Homer,do do do do do...
14754,Homer,"gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing out, i'd find out where he lives, and tear him a new bellybutton."
15798,Homer,and that's the story of april fool's day.
33450,Homer,got it!
38745,Homer,we are more than just a garage band desperate to do anything other than hang out with our families. we are now a cover band. and we shall be called... covercraft. because we play covers and this is our craft.
35472,Homer,just the opposite of real life.
29593,Homer,not her! she'll hunt us down relentlessly -- like a bloodhound mixed with a student loan officer!
31369,Homer,"is it our anniversary? no, we don't have one this year. hmmm..."
27614,Homer,"oh, sweetie, you're the most important thing to me in the whole world. only very serious daddy business can tear me from your side."
35623,Homer,"marge, i just saw the greatest movie. guess what happens when a mop is replaced with an octopus! i'll give you a clue, it's funny!"
39005,Homer,um...
20914,Homer,i'll do it!
14179,Homer,"well, what color is it? blue or purple?"
25538,Homer,"oh, the bag boys are on strike! i'm shaking."
23680,Homer,"no, marge. no!"
15873,Homer,"marge, i have my pride. i'm going to go to night school, earn my high school diploma, and get back my most improved odor trophy!"
38000,Homer,ow!
27599,Homer,well... i am bald and important. where do i sign?
29088,Homer,whee! recess!
14680,Homer,"that's right, except for the pick-up truck."
24763,Homer,blue spanish eyes / teardrops are falling from your spanish eyes...
26210,Homer,"look, i married her, but that is as far as we went. we never, ever made whoopee -- or even mouth whoopee."
20861,Homer,"this is it, marge. i poured my heart and soul into this business, and now it's finally paying off! we're rich! richer than astronauts!"
30937,Homer,"oh, the cereal's just a metaphor."
26773,Homer,"marge, why are you crying? you're not in any physical pain. the only kind of pain a man can understand."
36699,Homer,aww.
26734,Homer,"hello there, flan-didly-danders."
23531,Homer,i don't know why we ever left in the first place.
14803,Homer,"lose weight and listen to new-age music? wow! what do you think, marge?"
17390,Homer,oh no! the candy conventioneers tracked us down!
24785,Homer,you're the boss.
31623,Homer,little do you know that the count of monte cristo is in fact an old acquaintance of yours.
13531,Homer,"mmm, thanks -- it looks... hey, wait a minute! just because i'm wearing a pink shirt, it doesn't mean i'm some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! although it is tempting --"
32934,Homer,"you monster! on another subject, next thursday i have to leave work early. i assume that's cool."
32753,Homer,you stay right here.
35241,Homer,tell him how you feel.
21713,Homer,"daddy would like a word with you, barty!"
29269,Homer,stupid bart. bagpipes getting down with an octopus... that's classic.
29862,Homer,i wouldn't ruin a surprise for lenny.
27821,Homer,"or when i messed up taping ""city slickers 2"" and cut off the end. was curly's gold just a legend?"
13362,Homer,"marge, marge."
16140,Homer,now i'm not saying mr. burns is incontinent...
25231,Homer,no problem.
27706,Homer,nobody loves oily homer...
20740,Homer,"not right now, son. daddy's talking to a policeman."
19817,Homer,yeah! you do your own dirty work!
17290,Homer,i've gone back to the time when dinosaurs weren't just confined to zoos. ok. don't panic. remember the advice your father gave you on your wedding day...
20333,Homer,let's see what happens when he walks into my store. then we'll see who's worried about five day waiting period...
22762,Homer,"no, you're too kind. and wise, and righteous... i can't believe you don't have a girlfriend."
17574,Homer,"i do... now. anyway, i'm gonna follow them tonight and see where they go."
35111,Homer,"sweetie, you've always been beautiful, but now you're my silver belle. let me get the camera we use for precious moments and insurance claims."
16828,Homer,"the flanderses are not geeks! okay, rod and todd are... and the wife has a thing for me, but she hides it behind a mask of low key hostility. but we've got to give this thing a chance. i want the two families to take a trip together this weekend."
31300,Homer,"you're right. starting tomorrow, no bread before dinner."
23240,Homer,"wake up, honey!"
37303,Homer,"conversation, conversation... you look great."
39240,Homer,so?
29253,Homer,"of course not. why would i want to look at a nude woman i'm not even married to? i mean, i wouldn't even know how she could improve me."
33910,Homer,do you want the golden globe?
32757,Homer,"that wasn't a defeat, it was a phased withdrawal."
27715,Homer,"tip one, ""live each day like it was your last."""
13605,Homer,those kids don't know what they're missing.
26107,Homer,do me! do me!
20160,Homer,and why am i here?
39737,Homer,"of course i know! sure! you really thought i forgot, didn't you?"
25658,Homer,"oh, thank goodness everyone's okay!"
20130,Homer,frontsies... backsies... i'm with them... v.i.p... coming through... very important person... they gave me frontsies...
36171,Homer,"one more announcement: make sure you whack ""piñata me"" and not real me."
22444,Homer,"oh, i spit my gum in there."
29848,Homer,much better.
26476,Homer,no way.
25239,Homer,"get that one! faster! you got half time for the other ones. oh, good. oh no, that one's slowing up! oh, good. oh, that one's wobbling! oh, up... you got that before i even said it."
39055,Homer,simpler time.
38499,Homer,we're on an old-time boat!
32055,Homer,"i've never been to war, but i imagine it feels just like your first kill. the happiness swept me away!"
18567,Homer,"well, you're closing. it's getting late. my kids are probably wondering where their daddy is. there's gotta be some other place we can go. think, moe. think."
14708,Homer,"really? well, i should warn you... i'm not great with figures..."
39563,Homer,no.
35123,Homer,uh-oh. usually when it gets this quiet mr. burns is standing behind me.
25559,Homer,just like jimmy carter.
13526,Homer,"oh thank you, marge -- pink?"
20174,Homer,"hey there, meathead. what are you watchin'?"
22353,Homer,"okay, moe. i believe you had me by the throat. reverend lovejoy was working the body..."
20419,Homer,you're not gonna make the team with that kinda attitude.
13635,Homer,bart! get out of the spirit of st. louis!
39855,Homer,marge!
14002,Homer,huh?
17881,Homer,"uh, i need an another extension on my mortgage payments."
20738,Homer,and how...
32239,Homer,and i know something much more fun i can do on my back.
18881,Homer,"y'ello, oak ridge? this is springfield nuclear. we need to order a... uh...t-437 safety command console."
25661,Homer,christ be with you.
14760,Homer,"oh, would you two knock it off? i hate all the programs marge likes. but it's no big deal. you know why?"
41436,Homer,"marge number two, how would you win my whoopee?"
25907,Homer,but...
27531,Homer,"you're right, marge. i'll make it up to them. by throwing the bitchin-est beer bash this church has ever seen!"
31835,Homer,i'm your father now.
25179,Homer,"not now, honey. daddy's busy."
34827,Homer,drive all the way... get the wrong elf... ain't no glass... i'll show 'em -- i'll buy ten more gallons of their stupid gas!
35056,Homer,everyone in that live studio audience is dead now.
25614,Homer,or is it the right?
39057,Homer,artists.
35775,Homer,"uh-oh, a meeting with the mayor. how do i prepare for that?"
32237,Homer,"get lost, you waste of a moustache!"
34140,Homer,"marge, how can anyone be mad at himself? it's impossible. watch."
16214,Homer,"heh-heh-heh. lisa, vampires are make-believe. just like elves, gremlins and eskimos."
38804,Homer,gimme another one.
24057,Homer,"and poor ned didn't get a chance to say goodbye. well, from now on i'm never gonna let you leave the room without telling you how much i love you and how truly special... this is really eating up a lot of time. maybe just a pat on the butt. yeah, that works."
14884,Homer,"marge, am i crazy, or is my back getting hairier?"
28453,Homer,ever notice how seats are too small for normal-looking guys like me? theaters... airplanes... why even here. look!
16659,Homer,bor-ing.
32244,Homer,hey-ey-ey-ey-ey!
19197,Homer,"uh, sure."
20195,Homer,get it away!
32387,Homer,more bread please.
31841,Homer,hand ball! direct kick!
31190,Homer,"okay pretty boy, where's fat tony's fifty bucks?"
21928,Homer,"sleep gentle hippies, sleep. let old homer jay set things right."
27778,Homer,"yes, yes. if i keep putting work first, i'll lose everyone i care about, just like you did."
32959,Homer,five dollars cash!
30423,Homer,"now, i'm a man who likes to strangle his kids. do you think i could..."
40784,Homer,"bart, pay attention. you may be telling this to your own son one day if something breaks."
23912,Homer,and the bed never needs to be made. check it out.
27068,Homer,you can't just leave me out here! there's not another woman for miles!
39671,Homer,tangy.
40375,Homer,i said now!
19793,Homer,no... this whole thing is my fault. i've been a lousy dad.
32452,Homer,fashions.
16903,Homer,this town is full of deadbeats. we can't afford this elephant.
25041,Homer,but skinner got shot!
21714,Homer,but i look so youthful and hunky.
16902,Homer,"well, that was under our old price structure. under our new price structure, your bill comes to a total of seven hundred dollars. now, you've already paid me four dollars, so that's just six hundred and ninety-six dollars more that you owe me."
35659,Homer,"man, how many quarters does this game take?"
36898,Homer,it's real to them!
36477,Homer,"yeah, but we make sure never to go to bed hungry."
36203,Homer,just like my hair.
18765,Homer,"hear ye, hear ye, hear ye!!"
28574,Homer,i am rudy giuliani. do as i command you. i am rudy giuliani. do as i command you.
23467,Homer,"oh, a little bit of everything."
37990,Homer,"glasses, find me a great gift for my wife. under five dollars."
34823,Homer,i'll take... that one.
29012,Homer,"quiet, the commercial's on! if we don't watch these, it's like we're stealing tv."
26597,Homer,woo hoo!
32848,Homer,uh-oh. there's already an on-set romance.
32449,Homer,what's your secret?
37241,Homer,"hello, police? i'd like to report a buzz-kill in progress."
39034,Homer,"well, i'm not one for just talking."
32884,Homer,i'm fighting the robber -- you go get ice cream!
40932,Homer,excellent.
30260,Homer,when will you be back?
20278,Homer,i said i'll take it.
16262,Homer,"what the... oh, i don't know... a little show called ""doctor quinn, medicine woman""?!"
40118,Homer,i don't know... a hundred and two?
30357,Homer,stationary camera.
18129,Homer,"i don't care what excuse you've got, nothing's gonna stop me in the middle of this speech, you're gonna -- lemon tree?!!"
25582,Homer,here's why they shouldn't get anything. one...
28201,Homer,oh t-shirt. bless the loom that fruited you.
21843,Homer,our dog isn't famous. and you kids aren't exactly john and joan cusack. and you. you couldn't open a movie if your life depended on it. i'm about ready to ankle this family.
40210,Homer,"well, he's got my vote."
18984,Homer,"hey, a freak show!"
26517,Homer,mmm! that's the next best thing to eating lenny.
32769,Homer,maybe you're drunk.
38691,Homer,"excuse me, but grass is poking through."
26411,Homer,"these courtside seats are great. thanks for the hookup, wolfie."
33378,Homer,"marge, i still would be married to you, but you would just be hotter."
24471,Homer,ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow! ow!
37858,Homer,"oh, i don't know. it won't seem like christmas without opening up a giant credit card bill in january."
23794,Homer,whoa-whoa-whoa! don't go nuts.
22523,Homer,"hey, look! it's elton john!"
22223,Homer,welcome to my world.
36118,Homer,i've been thinking. i really shouldn't have put you in there and left you there while we were having pizza without you. so i'm gonna let you out with my apologies.
36087,Homer,"well, i rented that plane."
17229,Homer,oh look! it's the twelve noon robot parade! hurry up or we'll have to wait for the twelve-oh-five parade.
28901,Homer,is it lenny?
22374,Homer,"wally, i'd be lying if i said i hadn't."
37143,Homer,this calls for decisive action -- like l.b.j.'s use of the period of mourning following the assassination to push through the civil rights act.
17850,Homer,punishment?!
13326,Homer,i promised i wouldn't eat? never! you lie!
40823,Homer,who? oh.
15463,Homer,"i made an ""h""."
15448,Homer,hi.
36647,Homer,"i put it in the bank. that place is great! on their wall, they had a photo with an old couple walking on the beach with their pants rolled up."
29814,Homer,"what happened to the guards?! okay, okay. don't panic. maybe they'll tire themselves out with their chant."
13177,Homer,ew. that tastes horrible!
34946,Homer,since when is all this against the law?
36299,Homer,"okay, what's an appropriate movie for you boys?"
32371,Homer,"oh ma-arge! want some com-pany? as always, silence means yes."
38406,Homer,"walking distance, marge. i've been looking forward to this all week!"
27314,Homer,"well, duh."
27510,Homer,"marge, he's way the hell up there."
33443,Homer,fine. back. and we can't let anyone else get hurt on our property.
24651,Homer,"don't worry, we have plenty of supplies to get through tomorrow. and then a wave of disease should help to -- hey!"
32428,Homer,a better one!
22089,Homer,follow me.
13959,Homer,you did?
37877,Homer,"wait, you guys saw the new radioactive man sequel?"
27102,Homer,"wait, don't go! i wanna keep on rockin'. c'mon guys... a-one, a-two..."
22564,Homer,"well, that's a turn-off."
14443,Homer,"well, okay. but you have to swear you're comin' back."
34688,Homer,okay.
22982,Homer,fours?
18199,Homer,what i wouldn't give to hear lisa play another one of her jazzy tunes.
23816,Homer,marco!
26723,Homer,that's just so obvious!
15492,Homer,cloud goes up. cloud goes down. cloud goes up. cloud goes down...
35265,Homer,"marge, he's laughing, that means he's happy. has the joker taught you nothing?"
33412,Homer,are you kidding? we couldn't even convince you that bruce wayne is batman.
27180,Homer,did you label the meals so i can tell which is which?
13446,Homer,nah.
26468,Homer,"yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. we'll call you. or send you some fruit."
25012,Homer,"thanks, woo, it took a lotta grifting."
38562,Homer,"oh, that's fine then."
29098,Homer,"she sure did. now if lisa is finished with her shenanigans, i'll tell you why i didn't show up..."
35505,Homer,"larry, my man!"
25871,Homer,"oh, this punishment is so cruel."
31215,Homer,"woo hoo! what's next? a contract with groove-tone records? take the g-train, baby. groove-tone!"
28417,Homer,is this thing hurting you?
24940,Homer,the dog thinks so...
20661,Homer,i knew this would happen.
22144,Homer,"yesss! nobody messes with the mayor when homer simpson's on -- aw, crap."
32138,Homer,"well, explanation-wise, the fact is that... i lied. i didn't get the job. you see when i got there..."
28820,Homer,plead the fifth amend-what?
23965,Homer,"shut up, net face."
32562,Homer,another man... with my wife... in my house... on top of my tv guide?
22652,Homer,"nah, you must be thinking of your mother. i'm always exploring alternatives and expanding my horizons into realms of... can't we just go in?"
24191,Homer,"so, how you doin'? stayin' out of trouble?"
34869,Homer,you're welcome!
33840,Homer,you make words into dudes.
23558,Homer,lenny...
41273,Homer,"oh, you don't want to know what i really think. now, look sad and say ""d'oh."""
36049,Homer,i mean a thousand years of perfect weather.
40514,Homer,oh. what are you doing?
25344,Homer,which one am i? serena or venus?
40095,Homer,"karl, you gotta help me. mr. burns wants me to make some speech to his executives and -- what do you want?"
18497,Homer,uh... maggie?
21661,Homer,"well, that's it."
16263,Homer,where you going?
25778,Homer,"run, children! run!"
26685,Homer,mr. burns has left the building!
15628,Homer,"ehhh, maybe this was a mistake."
36895,Homer,"that's right, your lord sticks his hand in his pants. and yes, it is the same hand i tapped you with."
31269,Homer,"welcome, ladies and gentlemen, honored guests, and out-of-town roller-coaster weirdoes."
13866,Homer,"oh, me and my trenchant mouth."
23575,Homer,"um, how 'bout one not touching your ass?"
14584,Homer,wait a minute. isn't anybody gonna follow in my footsteps?
13273,Homer,"oh, right."
14068,Homer,try lighting it on fire.
17241,Homer,"what're you, the narrator?"
17284,Homer,"y'know, marge, i've had my share of troubles but sitting here now with you and the kids, in our cozy home in this beautiful, free country, it just makes me feel that i'm really a lucky guy."
36465,Homer,bart! don't call me that!
22877,Homer,"no, no, andy, no!"
20581,Homer,ah.
13660,Homer,"hmm, let's see."
17684,Homer,"don't worry, marge. i've come up with a perfectly balanced budget. there will be exactly enough money for you, me, bart and lisa, if we make a few small sacrifices."
34056,Homer,where i should've been all along...
18652,Homer,"first bush invades my home turf, then he takes my pals, then he makes fun of the way i talk... probably..., now he steals my right to raise a disobedient, smart-alecky son! well, that's it!"
26336,Homer,"oh, what do i do? what do i do?"
30767,Homer,"son, i'm doing something i should have done a long time ago... taking you to vegas!"
28082,Homer,so you don't want to kill me anymore?
24519,Homer,"no, something that rocks. that's the sound of today."
27865,Homer,"well, get used to it, 'cause i'm gonna stay."
34771,Homer,"don't fight it... that's it... that's it, a little more... how's that?"
17580,Homer,"stonecutters, eh? how do i join?"
19705,Homer,"you mean ""meep meep""?"
34755,Homer,"they sound good in my brain, then my tongue makes not the words sound very good, formally."
18483,Homer,"do i know what ""rhetorical"" means?!"
24994,Homer,"hello, is the lady of the house in?"
15137,Homer,if you don't start making more sense we're gonna have to put you in a home.
15392,Homer,"bart, i told you not to use that word. call me ""daddy."""
23958,Homer,i don't wanna!
29725,Homer,a spider!
19689,Homer,"shut up, flanders."
34802,Homer,"okay, okay. if a mosquito bites you, does it become a vampire too?"
16150,Homer,"i think i'm so big. blah, blah, blah."
30890,Homer,"listen up, stonehenge. i made a drawing of the places on marge you can't touch. especially the hair."
22054,Homer,"well, actually, you did..."
15613,Homer,"it's that record club. the first nine were only a penny. then they jacked up the price! it's not fair, it's not fair i tells ya."
35631,Homer,"do you know what i just learned? my job is the reason i get those checks every week! and now that i'm demoted, the checks have gotten smaller! not in physical size, but--"
36587,Homer,"for the third time this year, yes!"
23290,Homer,welcome to the humiliating world of professional writing. but this is only the beginning...
31652,Homer,"eat marshall tucker, idiot!"
32746,Homer,"my hindu friend, this is a chance for your kwik-e-mart to get in on the ground floor of a delicious new taste sensation."
27582,Homer,"you know son, i've been doing a lot of thinking. i was wrong to exploit you, and i won't do it again."
35354,Homer,"yeah, that's his thing. anyway, fat tony and i think this is a chance to patch things up between you and selma. plus it's a free weekend at the beach."
26099,Homer,"tonight? well, you better get your hopes up."
30280,Homer,hello? marge? where do we keep the socks that don't smell like feet?
40308,Homer,"oooh, red hots."
16226,Homer,super fun happy slide!
21197,Homer,"that was yesterday, moron!"
39693,Homer,no!
27342,Homer,"well, here's ours. we're going to disney world!"
31580,Homer,"oh mother sea -- giver of fish, taker of boats, toilet to the world, the greeks called you poseidon, the romans... aquaman. look into thy starfish heart and protect our souls, so we might live to go tubing on thee again."
29649,Homer,woo hoo! no pressure!
25352,Homer,"well, it all starts when the nulecule comes out of its nest..."
25498,Homer,but i'll just draw bunny faces on them to scare maggie away.
24580,Homer,"yes, i will have fries with that."
39470,Homer,it's worse than you think. i just trampled these poor saps' flower bed.
32081,Homer,uh-huh. see you at five then.
15728,Homer,deer.
28089,Homer,i am homer tribal chief / i am wearing tiny briefs / braves teach value boys should know / now extended drum so-lo
37447,Homer,"guys, this science exhibit that told me how stupid it is to play the lottery."
22256,Homer,"anyhoo, we came out of walmart, when suddenly one hundred spaceships..."
15160,Homer,can't he be both like the late earl warren?
41276,Homer,as...? as...?!
15091,Homer,my baloney has a first name / is h-o-m-e-r / my baloney has a second name / it's h-o-m-e-r.
23278,Homer,"great. now, let me think... the food was... not undelicious..."
39991,Homer,"come on, marge. let me carry you over the threshold."
36440,Homer,woo hoo!
39418,Homer,"i can't do it, mr. burns."
36444,Homer,"yes, sweetie?"
26733,Homer,must suppress rage.
28370,Homer,"yeah, it's impressive. but i still haven't found the perfect gift for marge. only imperfect stuff for me."
14259,Homer,"yeah, what do you want?"
22193,Homer,"in the impulse zone. if you want to be like me, you gotta make snap decisions. like this."
16491,Homer,but they're so sweet.
13937,Homer,let go. you're ripping it.
22167,Homer,"i wouldn't do that, reverend. you see, ""saint flanders"" is as crooked as you or me!"
32664,Homer,"and one moonlit night, i finally had fun at a mini-golf course."
28195,Homer,"yeah, she must have some kind of super-chore in there! like getting the rat out of maggie's room!"
23170,Homer,"oh, crap! here they come!"
31659,Homer,"hello, bart?"
18809,Homer,got it.
28222,Homer,they all do.
36414,Homer,sounds like you're turning into wife number two.
41160,Homer,do i have to do anything?
29863,Homer,i'm sorry. i'll just sit over here until you stop being mad at me.
13325,Homer,mmm... hors doovers.
20327,Homer,"ooo, i like the sound of that."
21797,Homer,i recognized the logo.
33397,Homer,"debbie, i forgot i have an english paper due on monday. would you read ""to kill a mockingbird"" for me and if you could write down how boo radley fits into the southern gothic tradition, that would be great."
18681,Homer,"look at these low, low prices on famous brand name electronics!"
19587,Homer,"hey, fat tony! you still with the mafia?"
30753,Homer,i'm gonna double kill you! and then i'm gonna bury you in a shallow grave. then i'll dig you up and kill you again! that's the beauty of a shallow grave.
37727,Homer,"son, it was so beautiful! i went faster than the speed of sound."
24357,Homer,"quizmaster, yes... that would entertain me briefly."
16066,Homer,something i should have done a long time ago...
35100,Homer,"well, now it's time for the best kind of bonding -- sitting next to each other in silence, staring blankly at the tv."
22380,Homer,you're thinking of all the other years. this year's shows are classics.
24856,Homer,hey!
40898,Homer,"no... no i... it wasn't me... it was it was my wife's, my wife's idea... yeah, yeah... i would never..."
15365,Homer,he'll tire himself out soon.
18966,Homer,"hi there! been a while since i set foot in good vibrations music. where can i find the latest releases by ""bread?"""
23039,Homer,sweet.
29517,Homer,stupid internet... whole world laughing at me...
27755,Homer,mr. burns' reign of terror is over.
19621,Homer,why get up? here's a little move i've been tinkering with. say i want that bowl of dip.
37364,Homer,"probably one of bart's dirty friends! boy, why are your friends so dirty?"
27225,Homer,"1895, forget it. we'd be too late to save lincoln and too early to save kennedy."
25432,Homer,"well, okay. but you can't silence homer simpson. i'm the friend of the downtrodden. and i'm not gonna forget what i saw here today."
29350,Homer,"yeah, that's how it starts."
30049,Homer,"i always was, honey. look. cameron's about to sing the song i wrote for him. he's about to learn the most important lesson in the music business: don't trust people in the music business."
39687,Homer,"they've got us cornered, boy. we'll never get away. give me the head."
15055,Homer,"i sent in an application for you. i couldn't find a big enough photo, so i sent in that funny drawing of you on roller skates."
36960,Homer,butter.
28141,Homer,moe?! what are you doing here?
40563,Homer,don't mind if i do.
40556,Homer,whiplash! oh no!
13801,Homer,why you little...
25556,Homer,"hey, mister?"
19214,Homer,twenty of the suckiest minutes of my life.
23943,Homer,"well done, mr. lenny. well done."
31208,Homer,and a circus fire!
18286,Homer,i want a colossal donut. just like the one on the sign.
20529,Homer,"ahh. is this the life, or what?"
30662,Homer,i hope i never hear that god-awful nutcracker music again.
31399,Homer,"make my daughter cry, will ya! eat syrup, jerk!"
30854,Homer,i am so stoked about lenny's party. he said he's gonna make a surprise announcement!
31488,Homer,tomorrow? but she's in trouble now! i'll just read ahead without you.
15086,Homer,"happy birthday, son!"
26261,Homer,wait. you went to a sugar factory? were there oompa-loompas?
39032,Homer,"come on, i want cream! give it up! cream and sugar are one thing too many!"
26534,Homer,"i don't know, but that would be hot. ""once upon a time there was a young prince of denmark."""
26762,Homer,apu?
23843,Homer,that's me!
35179,Homer,yeah. but lisa won't tell me how to make it.
30580,Homer,"hey marge, where you goin'?"
25102,Homer,yes!
31281,Homer,you always find an excuse not to make out.
37085,Homer,"man, you sure can talk surfer talk."
23304,Homer,"oh, that's classic."
15939,Homer,with my...
26130,Homer,"ooh, a movie! i call the couch!"
29329,Homer,same one.
20523,Homer,you could fake your own death...
18726,Homer,wow.
27812,Homer,"oh, i hate this. it's making me use my arms."
33221,Homer,"lisa, sweetie... please, look at your daddy."
37750,Homer,"no, i didn't!"
31494,Homer,angelica was trapped in the suffoclock of sandy doom...
39487,Homer,"now, i appreciate that, honey, but we need one hundred and fifty dollars here."
35788,Homer,i really should look at this picture a little longer.
22703,Homer,why you gotta... come on! ah! now i'm gettin' the hang of this thing. i don't know why i didn't become a trucker before.
34632,Homer,"moe, my in-laws are coming. i need something strong enough that i forget i hate them, but not so strong that i tell them i love them."
18788,Homer,it's mr. smithers. he's calling for you.
38861,Homer,"hey, captain squid! if you really want to be nice to us, how 'bout some snacks?"
14070,Homer,"moe, i haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. do you think my drink had something to do with it?"
24545,Homer,cloopid blore-apope!
26179,Homer,why you little...
19897,Homer,"you forgot one thing, wiggum."
34068,Homer,gotta leave early to beat the traffic. now to get on route two-oh-five and it's a straight shot home. for crying out--
34386,Homer,"hmm, let me think... take my family to a war zone... on a bus filled with religious lame-os... in a country with no pork... in a desert with no casinos... ooh, where do i sign up?"
13447,Homer,"son, i'm proud of you. i was twice your age before i figured that out."
37384,Homer,church bulletin? church bulletin? church--
33774,Homer,"let's try what chapter seven calls ""un-sults"" -- insults disguised as compliments. hey, lenny -- it takes a lot of courage to wear suspenders when you're not in the circus."
20078,Homer,"son, for the last time, you're staying at military school."
26215,Homer,"faster... faster... faster... oh, you do that like a pro..."
26294,Homer,what the hell is that?
23489,Homer,"brace yourselves, everybody. you're about to see the hugest, juiciest, possibly super-intelligent vegetables man has ever known. you might want to crane your necks upward now to save time."
33707,Homer,"marge, we came to an appointment in the middle of the day. that's the most a parent can do."
27965,Homer,flames? searing pain? a black cat? i must be in heaven.
39161,Homer,"guys, thanks for bailing me out. but i still have a huge problem."
40523,Homer,twenty million women in the world and i had to marry jane fonda.
24631,Homer,damnit!
37970,Homer,who told you that?
21676,Homer,i hate folding sheets.
37200,Homer,one thousand dollars!
31641,Homer,you don't frighten me!
29062,Homer,i can't sleep. i keep thinking about the pie man.
24003,Homer,good horse. here's one taco and you'll get another when you win.
17566,Homer,"all right, econo-save, you just made the list."
24144,Homer,"aww. hi there, little fella."
38919,Homer,it's called a double standard. one of the bedrocks of parenting.
38955,Homer,"go get it, boy!"
34613,Homer,moe's leaving town?!
22071,Homer,it's a miracle! you recovered!
25340,Homer,yeah.
15014,Homer,"no offense apu, but when they were handing out religions, you must have been out takin' a whiz."
37634,Homer,one random disorder free with every schizophrenia.
27130,Homer,test one-test two-test three-test four you test me like the water in el salvador...
24953,Homer,i can't afford that.
41126,Homer,"dad! please, you gotta quit while you're ahead. you understand that, take all your money and leave now."
25771,Homer,i'll call.
19203,Homer,"well, i don't think it's that unlikely."
37658,Homer,what the hell does gooble goo mean?
19264,Homer,just a minute!
36786,Homer,"dough, sauce, cheese, topping. dough, sauce, cheese, topping."
36181,Homer,"son, i'm afraid the uralarm whiz-no-more 9000 is no joke."
28663,Homer,why don't you admit i know it's around here somewhere?
24793,Homer,baby made a boom-boom.
32627,Homer,"i don't know about you, but i don't want to live in a future where food is brought by waiters... where the chairs aren't attached to the tables... and where i can't ditch my kids in a pit of dirty balls. i say we rebuild the fast-food district -- bigger and better than ever!"
26402,Homer,in south carolina.
38075,Homer,"ooh, campus! do you have a statue of the founder i can stick a funny hat on?"
38687,Homer,what camping trip?
39807,Homer,"man, you get a lot of nutcases in here."
33614,Homer,"oh my god, she fainted! let's go get smelling salts!"
41577,Homer,little homer had a dog / and bongo was his name-o / b-o-on-on-go / b-o-on-on-go...
21225,Homer,"well, we'll see about that."
14757,Homer,hear hear!.
17479,Homer,"but when i do it, it's cute."
38376,Homer,i just did that because it was a series of funny words!
15408,Homer,"yeah, well bart can kiss my hairy yellow butt."
40957,Homer,twen... forty-eight. this is it.
24159,Homer,you don't have tv? but what will i watch while i'm sitting on the couch?
29613,Homer,opposite? yuck!!
21265,Homer,"yes, i gotta work hard, honey. daddy made a lot of crazy promises."
31988,Homer,no. and never bring it up again.
16109,Homer,"hey, that's not the wallet inspector."
37221,Homer,those things?
27420,Homer,damn it!
32547,Homer,"dad, i can't remember what i did last night. do you have any idea?"
29639,Homer,"if anyone knows a reason why these two should not be joined, let them speak now... or forever hold their peace."
24383,Homer,par-ty! par-ty! par-ty!
38526,Homer,okily dokahama?!
34601,Homer,my little einstein.
16597,Homer,uh... marge?
16211,Homer,"marge, look at all this great stuff i found at the marina! it was just sitting in some guy's boat!"
40372,Homer,and?
38252,Homer,"oh, come here."
17342,Homer,"come here, you butterball."
21077,Homer,"mr. moe, prepare to surface."
20651,Homer,"wow, this really restores your faith in..."
13312,Homer,i can hold these nails in place with my tail.
22678,Homer,wait. there's a place like that in springfield?! then why are we eating this crap?
26417,Homer,canada? why should we leave america to visit america junior?
34841,Homer,"well, if you check your purse i think you'll find... the seven of clubs!"
33246,Homer,"care to cut? watch this, lenny."
24202,Homer,"not bad, lisa junior. but god's palace is way up on the moon...so if we want him to hear us, we've gotta crank up the volume."
19275,Homer,"what the... ""president eisenhower celebrates 40th wedding anniversary... not pictured: mrs. eisenhower."""
38436,Homer,crap!
19914,Homer,wow! a golf shirt! with my corporate logo on it!
38946,Homer,yeah you are too.
24199,Homer,because you're all terrible sinners.
28740,Homer,wait 'til he puts his unsuspecting butt on that toilet seat.
30407,Homer,i came to get my mail.
24513,Homer,"oh, my leg! this is the worst pain ever! stop pummeling me! it's really painful! owww!"
27240,Homer,"all right, let's take that..."
33425,Homer,"...three, two, one. happy new year!"
29746,Homer,"well, i invented a popsicle made of mountain dew."
29030,Homer,"aw, hey, let's turn that frown upside down."
27999,Homer,everyone's against me.
20689,Homer,singing is the lowest form of communication.
15167,Homer,don't point that thing at me. i said you're not going to the movie and i'm sticking to it.
39516,Homer,"but what's a day off from work when i'm never gonna see my beloved son again. oh, bart. oh, bart."
35971,Homer,dammit! why do kids have heads?
37220,Homer,"you were a world-famous wrestler? spill the beans, old man. word beans!"
37520,Homer,but somehow our anniversaries didn't get better than that first one on the train.
22240,Homer,"chop, chop, dig, dig. chop, chop, dig, dig. chop, chop, dig, dig..."
38729,Homer,i did a lick?
32373,Homer,"now, how 'bout the neck of my butt..."
22182,Homer,"wellity, wellity, wellity..."
37330,Homer,okay... this should do it.
40403,Homer,ow.
30789,Homer,i'm just gonna get a tiny chip to put on my desk at work.
21108,Homer,"okay, but could you pay me under the table? i got a little tax problem."
31569,Homer,i don't know what to say.
39790,Homer,"oh no! two-hundred and thirty-nine pounds. i'm a whale. why was i was cursed with this weakness for snack treats? well, from now on, exercise every morning, homer."
26507,Homer,"anyway, over torture, one of your soldiers mentioned that you collect giant wooden animals. we hope you don't have a horse."
30627,Homer,"yes, tell us your story. but it better have a beginning, a middle and an end. and you'd better make us root for the protagonist."
20005,Homer,"oh. oh, i'm sorry."
30871,Homer,oh marge! i love you! i love you! i love you!
25061,Homer,"i think i know my own life, ned."
18616,Homer,good ol' evergreen terrace. the swankiest street in the classiest part of pressboard estates.
34039,Homer,"stupid carl... ""update the phone list, homer!"" ""you put my contact lenses in backwards, homer!"" i'm sorry, honey."
19941,Homer,can lenny have it?
21806,Homer,i'll get it! i'll get it!
39763,Homer,"okay. we've eaten, and eaten well. now, what else do we have to do? well, let's check the list your mom left us."
18729,Homer,"hey, they need volunteers to play old-timey people in the parade. look, i can be a butter churner, a typhoid carrier... an apprentice! i think i'll be an apprentice, marge."
35552,Homer,what will you guys use when there aren't newspapers anymore?
37975,Homer,i'm watching videos of idiots wearing these glasses and not paying attention to the world around them.
39291,Homer,"don't you believe in me, son?"
16836,Homer,"so, here's to my best friend, ned."
32121,Homer,behold my two-seventeen average... and weep!
27401,Homer,"uh, lance uppercut."
27911,Homer,don't yell at ned!
18914,Homer,uh-huh.
30813,Homer,that's a story for another day.
20055,Homer,i'm hiding from th-th-th-th-the ghost.
14864,Homer,"i dunno, herb. people are afraid of new things. you should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it or something."
22722,Homer,"i whole-heartedly-agree. oh-man-i'm-really-wired. this-is-a-big-mistake-i-can... ohhh, here comes the sleeping pills. so drowsy. pep-pills-perking-up-again. i-could-drive allll niiight..."
30047,Homer,"um, at the end of your song, remember to look into the spotlight. it makes your eyes twinkle."
40080,Homer,"ooh, i like this."
31261,Homer,"we need to replace them with kick-ass ""going-down"" parts."
19651,Homer,"oh, there's no way i could --"
18624,Homer,"marge, that's the rhinestone nights fashion gun. i need it to rhinestone-up my old clothing."
15650,Homer,hey!
35019,Homer,stuck in this backwater burg where all you can count on is your family. and the only one who ever shot anyone is the baby.
28309,Homer,would an american dollar encourage you to leave us alone?
26817,Homer,"oh sure, when a man does it, it's smutty. but if a woman did it--"
29265,Homer,your mother's about to show us her new recipe.
13839,Homer,"well, if you wanted to, you could give me my body back."
14074,Homer,"nah... marge, i'm too upset to eat -- i think i'll go to moe's. ."
37090,Homer,"oh, uh, well, he wanted to be here, but i'm gonna decrease the volume of my voice and mumble so you can't really understand what i'm saying..."
23390,Homer,just like the dead clown promised.
21407,Homer,"if i hadn'ta taken a stupid risk with that cherry picker, i never would have found you."
38627,Homer,marge? why didn't you sign?
16335,Homer,"marge, can i go outside and play?"
25093,Homer,"uh yes, i see that it's in bill form. excellent."

40478,Homer,"i can and do. go to your room, bart! there, i've done it. i'm glad somebody finally stepped in and put an end to this nonsense once and for all."
22644,Homer,"well, that's a relief."
38410,Homer,"well, you know--"
38699,Homer,"look, i really need a campsite. my wife is making sandwiches!"
17484,Homer,i think lisa needs another push on her new tire swing.
26101,Homer,"why look, it's chad sexington!"
15917,Homer,"but, i'll miss ""sheriff lobo."""
22469,Homer,"no, i just thought it was cute when you called him..."
16963,Homer,"right back atcha, son. aw."
35050,Homer,he's washing his hands.
20827,Homer,and he's going to take us to a wonderful new planet.
26367,Homer,just for twenty-five years.
15999,Homer,we all went our separate ways.
31874,Homer,sure feels weird lying on top of the covers.
25072,Homer,woo hoo!
24526,Homer,i literally chewed the scenery.
25105,Homer,"okay people, let's keep this short. we all want to get home to our families."
23610,Homer,no. i don't want your pity or your money.
26701,Homer,woo hoo!
28984,Homer,it is.
23591,Homer,but she said i...

40170,Homer,huh?
19035,Homer,"hey. hmm, somebody's travelin' light."

16635,Homer,why not? i remember my first after-school job. i was in a band.
15336,Homer,i don't know.
14746,Homer,"just so i don't wonder... you would've gone all the way with me, wouldn't you?"
28683,Homer,"apu, do you sell crazy straws? i've got a guy with a broken back and i'm tryin' to cheer him up."
37848,Homer,"someday soon. as in, what are you doing this friday?"
21010,Homer,there's a question that's crossed out.
39916,Homer,"so, he's going to prison?"
38318,Homer,pfft! i'm as healthy as a horse.
29212,Homer,everything's comin' up homer.
31673,Homer,"why would i go to utah? i love booze, caffeine, and monogamy."
24466,Homer,"oh. ohhhhh. well, now that i look even closer..."
26009,Homer,i'm gonna tell moe exactly what i think of his...
16977,Homer,"i know you can read my thoughts, boy. meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow/ meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow."
15294,Homer,i'll take it!
14190,Homer,"i was 24 years old, with a beautiful girlfriend and a job with a future..."
31905,Homer,you would be.
25059,Homer,"my car, your roof. it's only fair."
40344,Homer,dear neighbor... 
40632,Homer,"doc, you gotta get me out of this. i'll make it worth your while."
32854,Homer,what else?
31578,Homer,should i hit him with a shovel to spare him the pain of drowning?
15489,Homer,"shut up, flanders."
35319,Homer,"honey... on a non-stone fruit-related topic, i booked us a couples massage."
18499,Homer,"okay, so we can't go over the fence."
39944,Homer,"yes, i do."
28497,Homer,"oh, if i buy this, i won't have anything left for a christmas tree..."
33248,Homer,"shut up, old man."
14655,Homer,"uh huh... easy... easy... perfect. all right, everybody out the window."
21045,Homer,we have orders not to fire on anybody but greenpeace.
29381,Homer,"let's see, i can make that... you can get that by smashing open a golf ball... that you can find in any player piano..."
19886,Homer,boom.
41146,Homer,"oh, shut up."
22618,Homer,"it's called caring, marge."
29470,Homer,"but i don't wanna take care of the kids... um... how many cigars are they allowed to have? bart sleeps in the microwave, right?"
34319,Homer,no problem. you can unload.
13637,Homer,"oh marge, grow up."
29215,Homer,you're not the boss of me.
27435,Homer,"no, no worries. this is what all those hours of playing tetris were for."
13208,Homer,no problem.
40058,Homer,"good morning, moe's tavern!"
17752,Homer,there's that word again.
39604,Homer,i'd like to see your finest rv. do you have something that's better than the land behemoth?
17357,Homer,"moe, what are you doin' here?"
21055,Homer,me?
36801,Homer,"uh, excuse me, reverend, but i'm here to talk about something a little more important: hope."
41398,Homer,"you okay, daddy?"
21016,Homer,nighty-night!
14006,Homer,"well, he is building a soapbox derby racer."
25765,Homer,my kids wear these hearts to remind them they are always loved.
13551,Homer,"i'm homer simpson, from the simpsons."
23841,Homer,"this place is a blast. all we have to do is endure two hours of blinding pain, then it's nothin' but shopping and surfing."
15186,Homer,"yeah, but what're ya gonna do?"
26272,Homer,i'm with you all the way. but first...
33243,Homer,"ah, interesting. why just the other day i was reading that science is used to make bombs."
37481,Homer,we did it!
41569,Homer,marge-a-rine / marge-a-rine / marge-a-rine / marge-a-rine / marge-a-rine...
38501,Homer,i'm the lame ass? the only lame ass on this boat is you and all the other lame asses.
26117,Homer,"wait a minute. i remember falling in the mud, but i don't think that's why i've been screaming..."
35773,Homer,"you know, you're kind of a downer."
14607,Homer,i've got so many tickets i can't lose!
15421,Homer,i hope you never say a word.
27703,Homer,dr. hibbert? you're the teacher?
40163,Homer,marge and i played that old game before we were married.
35959,Homer,"folks, because i love democracy so much, i command you to vote for this man whom i alone have selected as your next president:"
18555,Homer,pfft. must have been a pretty slow century.
34789,Homer,then... his story was true!
27311,Homer,you saved my life!
15686,Homer,"yeah, they'll do that."
19331,Homer,all right.
18479,Homer,any undelivered mail for homer j. simpson?
13939,Homer,you're looking for help?
27473,Homer,marge?
27267,Homer,"so, this has become a game of wits, has it?"
30973,Homer,"outta my way, you god-fearing buckleheads!"
15132,Homer,bus-ted!
24167,Homer,"mmm, i can see the house is falling apart without me, so here's the new order: bart, you're the man of the house. lisa -- i'm promoting you to boy. maggie's now the brainy girl. the toaster can fill in for maggie. and marge, you're a consultant."
24744,Homer,"i'm sorry, i wasn't listening. i was lost in your eyes."
18992,Homer,"okay, i'm heading out now! more butt support! more butt support!"
35745,Homer,"stupid, stupid, stupid! we forgot to create a fake author!"
16464,Homer,"no, lisa, i swear to you. i'm one-hundred percent completely serious. you've got to turn around right now before it's too late."
25216,Homer,nooo! my spine-o-cylinder!
27516,Homer,i couldn't help it. those pews are so comfortable.
18898,Homer,bart's room.
16769,Homer,"yeah, maybe i do have the right... what's that stuff? anyway, thanks, marge, lisa."
27138,Homer,rock and roll! woo hoo!
21165,Homer,mind if i take him for a ride?
19545,Homer,"thank you, son. and do you think you could stop the casual swearing?"
23778,Homer,useless? this flash cube has two flashes left!
17021,Homer,"whew. don't try to eat these so-called ""chips."""
29064,Homer,"no, i'm not. and here's a picture that proves it."
23520,Homer,"there, there. we had quite a scare today. but you're gonna make us millions. yes you are."
38023,Homer,"marmaduke was horrible today! also, marge is in therapy and she didn't even tell me!"
23885,Homer,lisa? ham hock? tri tip?
16115,Homer,"well, dean, i'm really sorry for the running-you-over prank."
34044,Homer,lemme try.
18474,Homer,i 'unno. i guess i was just a horrible son and no mother would want me.
34828,Homer,woo hoo!
23714,Homer,oink! oink! oink!
29756,Homer,"boy, i wouldn't mind driving that to the holland, michigan tulip festival."
23611,Homer,i do what now?
26510,Homer,"now, i can return to ithaca, and my sweet wife penelope."
20079,Homer,marge? you got that? marge?!
23917,Homer,look how loud i have to yell!
24408,Homer,"well, i'm gonna try anyway."
37889,Homer,the motorcycle dudes are chicks!
29275,Homer,"twinkle the kidd, i love you!"
40583,Homer,"no, no, no. you think this is about money? well, it's not. it's worse, marge. i'm afraid that from now on when i look at you, i'm not gonna see the wife by my side or the mother of my children. i'm just gonna see the dame who blew my one big chance."
32654,Homer,"like all young people, i had a musical dream."
38592,Homer,wait a minute -- that's not something people really feel. what's going on?
16496,Homer,"hey, there's something you don't see in a toilet every day."
34042,Homer,"ocean view, obstructed."
18678,Homer,"oh, he wants that corn so much!"
33957,Homer,"hm, i don't know -- kernels are kind of big."
13401,Homer,good! give up!
22486,Homer,door's unlocked.
15404,Homer,wow. a baby and a free burger. could this be the best day of my life?
17510,Homer,"here, puff! here puff!"
33027,Homer,"i loved you, man!"
26297,Homer,everyone here has a six pack and i'm the only one with a keg.
30730,Homer,"boy, if you were half as smart as you think you are, you'd clean up your act."
39856,Homer,"jeez, louise. look at this mess."
25804,Homer,"raise your arm... okay, the other one..."
26178,Homer,they told me it would be like this on the outside.
14341,Homer,over... over... over...
28997,Homer,"all i wanted was a second honeymoon, and now the floor is made of lava."
40595,Homer,"shut up, boy."
25327,Homer,i think he's trying to psych you out.
18268,Homer,"lisa, you ruined my barbecue. i demand you apologize this second!"
41457,Homer,so... uh... i feel that... fellow wildcats...
14974,Homer,"ah, my beloved family. how was church?"
16759,Homer,"... giver of life, mother of us all."
38342,Homer,hey! where's my junk?
24720,Homer,that violin's gotta be around here somewhere.
28706,Homer,"marge, i've got it all figured out: lee harvey oswald wanted to steal the jack ruby."
33571,Homer,hot tubs!
24024,Homer,my horse must lose!
36504,Homer,there's the gap!
34437,Homer,celebrate your commonality. some of us don't eat pork. some of us don't eat shellfish. but all of us love chicken!
26799,Homer,"wait, wait. you forgot to eat a light bulb."
30071,Homer,this whole deal is scientifically proven. the book of revelation has four hundred and four verses... add the number of people at the last supper...
27950,Homer,only losers buy wood. we're going to nature's lumberyard.
35858,Homer,"no, don't worry, i have my invisibility cloak. now where did i put it?"
23441,Homer,"come on, carter, build us a house, you lazy bum."
29642,Homer,"oh, i just love it here. so many things, and so many things of each thing!"
31460,Homer,"if it would win you back, i would gradually eat all the parts of a motorcycle. i hope it doesn't come to that. could you please just give me a sign that you still love me a little?"
22908,Homer,i've never wanted a beer worse in my life.
19043,Homer,"it's low tide, boys."
32788,Homer,"dad, are you sure you're okay to drive at night?"
22201,Homer,i don't think so.
14248,Homer,"handle first, handle first..."
37367,Homer,"ooh, a nose-hair trimmer!"
14604,Homer,"look closer, lenny!"
27972,Homer,"god no, it sucks."
16941,Homer,disregard.
13808,Homer,"i am very, very proud of you kids."
20636,Homer,"c'mon, kids. let's try the lights!"
40021,Homer,it's so unfair... just because he's different.
26875,Homer,here's my underwear drawer.
30431,Homer,"lisa, the zoo opens up a whole new world for the animals. in the wild they would never experience boredom, obesity, loss of purpose... you know, the american dream."
13594,Homer,shut up.
20505,Homer,you're already in a home.
17778,Homer,best in the west. it rhymes.
30861,Homer,"you're right, lenny. i..."
40749,Homer,uh-huh.
29009,Homer,"marge, i guess we'll just have to make love in heaven. i'll bet it always works up there."
34593,Homer,i am pretty full.
16743,Homer,who's doin' what now?
36820,Homer,"okay, where did you get these donuts?"
28041,Homer,how 'bout we take a family walk around the block?
34495,Homer,really? me?
19771,Homer,well it's been two hours. how do you feel?
19253,Homer,"sorry, sorry. my fault."
14781,Homer,"oh, everybody says that when they hear themselves on tape."
38244,Homer,fine. marge is always complaining i never fix things. give me another.
24809,Homer,"she's right. yes, i may be naked and reeking of panda love, but i've got to stop this before it goes too far."
17218,Homer,don't mind if i do.
33345,Homer,"okay, chapter one... uh... uh... writing is hard."
31450,Homer,woo hoo! i'm gonna be on time!
39097,Homer,right here.
39570,Homer,what th...
21375,Homer,museum? i don't like the sound of that. what did your mother say?
18326,Homer,yes.
14912,Homer,"you see, marge, while you're off in your little world, you forgot that other people have problems too."
25264,Homer,"keep walkin', flanders."
16355,Homer,"oooh, it's that new show about the policeman who solves crimes in his spare time."
32587,Homer,"hey, what's going on here?!"
38730,Homer,oh my god... i'm amazing.
14049,Homer,"what is it, boy?"
23893,Homer,"out of the way, baryshnikov!"
23073,Homer,"mmm... fifty dollar pretzel. hey, what's baby huey doing?"
33488,Homer,"yeah, you'd treat her right."
26225,Homer,"my lady's glass is empty, moe. bring her another cookies 'n' creme martini."
19663,Homer,i hide a bottle of schnapps in the baby's crib.
37904,Homer,"well, what'd you think?"
25087,Homer,you're right. that suit gizmo could be worth billions. and i'm gonna get a piece of the action!
33802,Homer,shut up!
24447,Homer,worse.
27716,Homer,i don't wanna die! i'm so young.
35145,Homer,observe.
29379,Homer,www.nuclear-secrets.com.
29826,Homer,"listen to me! this whole building is unsafe. they cut corners everywhere. people, it's a death trap!"
34067,Homer,classic.
17256,Homer,stuck-up riverdale punks. think they're too good for me.
23023,Homer,larry flynt is right! you guys stink!
40946,Homer,i thought i said knock it off!
19840,Homer,"oh, come on marge, relax! lisa's in charge. she's the responsible one."
40974,Homer,"woo woo! the h stands for herbert! herb, were you adopted?"
17602,Homer,i think i have to do it again. my blindfold came off.
35348,Homer,"fat tony! are you gonna cut my head off and leave it in a manger scene at christmas? and then an old italian nun finds it. and she's all... no, no, no, oh, no, no! he's too beautiful to die! ohhhh!"
18923,Homer,"yeah, when those immigrants get deported, there'll be more elbow room for regular joes like you and me, apu."
34907,Homer,"all right, you, gimme back my phone, and nobody gets hurt."
25904,Homer,"ah, son, it's a little chilly. maybe you should wrap a blanket around your head."
21776,Homer,"i'm soaring! soaring majestically like a candy wrapper caught in an updraft! higher, marge! higher!"
30788,Homer,silly indians. our god made their god.
41004,Homer,america.
29847,Homer,"hey, man, she's not my lady anymore. we split up, it's all cool, i... i'll kill you!"
32013,Homer,all the other moms gave their husbands twenty.
40723,Homer,"okay, just everybody remain calm."
33490,Homer,we live in a house that is trying to kill us.
27838,Homer,marge... did i ruin your life?
16401,Homer,"this ain't one of your church-picnic flaregun-firings, flanders. this is the real thing..."
33211,Homer,have i made the bet yet?
16595,Homer,"oh, kent, i'd be lying if i said my men weren't committing crimes."
28502,Homer,"gorgeous, huh? and quite the bargain."
17220,Homer,"north. ""south."" nuts to this! i'm going to take a shortcut."
28324,Homer,"you mean ""macbeth""?"
35287,Homer,"dr. zander, you made me see my life through bart's neck, and i swear, i will never, ever strangle my boy again."
17133,Homer,hard to the left!
18202,Homer,"todd smells. aw, i already knew that."
22900,Homer,a mascot contest?! i'm sure to win that. unless one of you jinxes me.
19750,Homer,"no, no! i'm not setting foot outside this house until that man is gone!"
36944,Homer,feed it to the dog.
32770,Homer,okay.
32592,Homer,"so marge wasn't cheating on me, i never hit her, and my family is throwing me an awesome party. thank god i figured it out before i did anything stupid."
24777,Homer,mr. burns... i was wondering if i could get a raise.
23502,Homer,"addictive, eh?"
20036,Homer,the car won't start. and i don't feel very good today. i am at work.
18266,Homer,it's just a little airborne! it's still good! it's still good!
23844,Homer,aloha / aloha until we meet a-
33886,Homer,wouldn't it be easier if i just took acting lessons?
35157,Homer,i'd like to thank mr. speedy pants repair for sewing up my pants just before the ceremony...and the woman who has inspired me everyday for the past twenty-five years... the cute one from the bangles. see you at the cool party!
34866,Homer,where's the other girder?
22022,Homer,"well now that's what i always thought, but somehow..."
28315,Homer,"aw dad, i wish there was something i could do."
29167,Homer,now to do something i've never done before -- help out an old man.
25616,Homer,"he shoots, he sco-- my thumb!"
27940,Homer,"quick, find the master log! there's always a master log."
23807,Homer,"c'mon, eat, you lazy fish."
22966,Homer,"uh, to work in your power plant?"
22862,Homer,i don't get it. why don't people like my art anymore?
18695,Homer,huh?
32680,Homer,wow. this is the kind of car you see in commercials! how much am i paying for this?
15685,Homer,really?
13935,Homer,no! you can't see... come on!
40390,Homer,"marge, give me your honest opinion. this? or this?"
37518,Homer,"just call me borders books, 'cause i'll always be here."
29224,Homer,"help me, science!"
29076,Homer,"wherever injustice shows its ugly face, i will be there! for i am the pie man!"
24010,Homer,"well, he's not gonna be intimidated anymore. we're gonna toughen him up -- give him a new badass attitude. all those other horses will be shaking in their horse dealies."
17713,Homer,"hmmm. with little, tiny, baby-sized gifts. well... i'll be in the tub."
22294,Homer,"marge, kite."
40797,Homer,"i'll take that as a compliment. so, will you go out with me? please say oui."
36308,Homer,gotta have that!
23628,Homer,what are you pointing at? the ocean?
28888,Homer,"marge, i did it out of love. love of not being arrested. but i realize now that nothing is more important than you."
29883,Homer,high-five!
19243,Homer,the abandoned warehouse!
21073,Homer,you mean water?
35017,Homer,"the pressures got to him so he started to eat. soon, he was known as ""fit fat tony,"" then just ""fat tony"" for short."
24288,Homer,hey flanders? can your god do that?
40371,Homer,i'll show you who charlene is! now start hating!
16599,Homer,oh sorry. i'm a little nervous.
33157,Homer,so that wasn't marge's glider parked outside the motel five years ago! i'm getting out of this marriage while i'm still young and handsome.
38969,Homer,"pff. wife? three kids? steady job? if i did, i'd secretly be very sad. you could tell by how much i would eat and drink and just sit on the couch."
17947,Homer,it was a gummy bear.
23012,Homer,"houston, we have a problem. a sexy problem."
31597,Homer,may we? may we? mais oui!
25348,Homer,sorry.
20830,Homer,"i'm glad i'm back! because the moment that sweet, sweet beer hit my tongue, i was born again!"
26604,Homer,"aw, look. i've made some friends. and now, go do my bidding... whatever it may be!"
17593,Homer,what?
16853,Homer,now how 'bout that game at the pitch 'n putt?
32188,Homer,which grow in what?
36019,Homer,"that's right, sucker! it's valentine's day, and i've got a date with some fastballs!"
32835,Homer,we're not here for the game. the game is nothing. the game is crap. the game makes me sick!
36060,Homer,"yep, i never realized how much i hated every single one of my friends and relatives."
31718,Homer,"of course, you idiot, 'cause i'm wishing for more money."
20273,Homer,now that's the marge i married.
25182,Homer,i can't complain.
40857,Homer,"well, run for the hills, ma barker, before i call the feds."

15083,Homer,that's bad.
17997,Homer,keep it down in there!
31461,Homer,"if you won't talk to me, i'll send in polaroids to show you how sad i am that i let you down."

32801,Homer,"wait a minute -- he's a deadbeat dad, and yet he's getting as much love as me, a dad too lazy to run away!"
35563,Homer,they always come up with such catchy ways to make us pay for things we don't need for kids we didn't want.
16762,Homer,and that is that.
20062,Homer,"but, marge...!"
30101,Homer,"moe, what happened to your eponymous tavern?"
15637,Homer,"well, i'd better get you home."
33690,Homer,"man, that made me thirsty."
33711,Homer,"i know, i know."

18768,Homer,"um, is this the chair i'll be sitting on?"
31781,Homer,"okay boy, do something annoying. but leave yourself room to build."
21505,Homer,"hey, this hot dog tastes different."

34362,Homer,"and when you're out of my sight, you must constantly twitter me exactly what you're up to, even though i don't know what twitter is and have no desire to find out."
26889,Homer,"well, i'm glad everyone's all right, but i think you should be ashamed -- toying with a human life for tv ratings."
28328,Homer,"but please, find it in your jewel-encrusted heart to forgive me."
20669,Homer,head of the line! a family could get used to being shunned. huh? huh?
29446,Homer,dammit.
23993,Homer,"marge, your pro-mop, anti-horse agenda has been clear for some time. but don't worry, i have a way for duncan to earn his keep."
19723,Homer,"well, i guess i learned my lesson. the thing is, i lost creative control of the project. and i forgot to ask for any money. well, live and learn."
37605,Homer,you laugh now but you won't be laughing soon.
30199,Homer,"catholic school, eh...?"
30809,Homer,"oh, why did i lead you down here to find those stupid coins?"
16203,Homer,mmmm... forbidden donut.

37783,Homer,it's true. even the other guy in the elevator. he's right here.
33004,Homer,he'll be here sooner or later.
32963,Homer,"yeah. i'll tell you what, at least help me buy the boy a gumball. do you have change for a nickel?"
24469,Homer,"why? it's just a cute little weasel. hello there, mister weasel."
22852,Homer,"frankly, i'd be a little turned on."
15218,Homer,"marge, marge, marge, let's file this under ""r"" for arrivederci."
27419,Homer,now what are you gonna do? you can't shoot all of us.
37968,Homer,as long as we keep drinking this.
36326,Homer,"well, islands are always entertaining, from gilligan to iwo jima."
35341,Homer,oh my god!
34013,Homer,help me or kill me!
18683,Homer,"sold! you wrap it up, i'll start bringin' in the pennies."
36476,Homer,and what he says is true because it's in all caps. are you gonna argue with caps?
17496,Homer,"i'm with you, dad."
33966,Homer,"pay the man, boy."
19509,Homer,skoal! wait a minute -- this is duff!
37484,Homer,what the hell is this?
18231,Homer,"moe? hey, moe? oh, you're thinking about all the money you blew, aren'tcha?"
35882,Homer,don't tread on pee! we probably have rights!
26829,Homer,what the hell is that noise?
22788,Homer,"where do you think you're going, missy?"
31520,Homer,has the boom been lowered?
31610,Homer,"oh sorry, i wasn't listening. i was checking out my reflection in this yellow water. lookin' good."
37308,Homer,"well, you didn't have two beers with your lunch."
26996,Homer,we're out of donuts!
17808,Homer,"hey, he didn't give me a ticket! this is an intriguing development."
23361,Homer,y'ello?
19946,Homer,"here you go, honey. that's about all the recycling i can handle today."
40216,Homer,"ah... great toast, marge. hmmm. oh, by the way, the night before the election mr. burns is coming over for dinner."

31015,Homer,"oh, why did women invent sleeping on the couch?"
35104,Homer,"oh, thank you, prior obligation!"
38721,Homer,i'll take those.
25113,Homer,hmmmm.
37006,Homer,"well, just because i imagined it doesn't make it any less true. and now all those people are on their own."
16315,Homer,absolutely! and this is just the beginning! i've got some big plans.
29390,Homer,"get back in the garage, old man."
22203,Homer,hey! lance murdock!
36726,Homer,now how would you qualify for that?
38025,Homer,i guess the only choice is to come clean and tell her what i know... and how i know.
35964,Homer,my fellow americans... i am full of crap.
14769,Homer,"oh marge, i went to thousands of heavy metal concerts and it never hurt me."
21002,Homer,it's my first day.
23198,Homer,thank you for getting me out of work.
22528,Homer,how the hell should i know? just get in this cage.
13590,Homer,"stupid junk mail... ""you may have already won!"" yeah, win this... ""here's good news for homer simpsoy""... i'll see that he gets it. how dumb do they think i am?"
17995,Homer,"hugh, there's something i want you to have. my dad gave me his cuff links to wear on the day i married marge, and they brought us good luck. i couldn't imagine a happier marriage. we don't have many traditions in our family, but it'd mean a lot to me if you kept this one alive."
26298,Homer,"that's it, we're outta here."
23734,Homer,"oh, that's sweet."
40573,Homer,a million dollars. my wife cost me a million dollars.
24325,Homer,"good day, then is right."
15275,Homer,"come on, marge, let the people see your pretty face."
18019,Homer,"don't worry. as soon as they find out he doesn't have any money, they'll throw him out. believe me, i know."
41409,Homer,"hey, what's going on here?!"
15872,Homer,what can i say? it hasn't been easy staying in my rut...
28420,Homer,jeez! i don't know why bear hugs enjoy such a great reputation.
24937,Homer,"if i know me, he won't like being kicked in the crotch."
39260,Homer,"so, what do you think kids? beauty, isn't it?"
14489,Homer,"marge, dogs love the outdoors."
30829,Homer,i heard in study hall you were babysitting tonight.
26129,Homer,"now do you believe dead rats float, lisa?"
38581,Homer,can you be more specific?
43205,Lisa,"hey, watch it! / watch it!"
50020,Lisa,i can't go home. something happened this week that completely changed me!
47108,Lisa,"mom, i know dad cares about you, but his feelings are really hurt. why don't you just say you're sorry?"
46405,Lisa,"dad, you shot moe!"
48565,Lisa,it's christmas! it's christmas! it's christmas!
47202,Lisa,is there a problem with your father?
46034,Lisa,something's wrong. terribly wrong.
51771,Lisa,"i've been emotionally dealing with that all week. so, yes."
50486,Lisa,oh my god! do you realize what this means?
41782,Lisa,yes!
44337,Lisa,play dead!
43617,Lisa,"red, green, yellow, orange! i remember all of these!"
50498,Lisa,all strapped in?
48992,Lisa,oh. oh.
48319,Lisa,"aw dad, we'll miss you so much."
50346,Lisa,"uh, how'd i get from inside there to over here?"
42882,Lisa,but she's better than me at everything that makes me special.
42682,Lisa,if anyone wants me i'll be in my room.
44757,Lisa,an earring? how rebellious in a conformist sort of way.
47470,Lisa,"okay, okay, don't get discouraged. every me they reject gets me closer to the me they'll like."
45280,Lisa,i'm really not the chuckling type.
42287,Lisa,"hey, wait... that's not a dummy!"
43875,Lisa,"hey, what's hap--"
47018,Lisa,"intransigence. ""i..."""
44946,Lisa,where are they going?
41623,Lisa,"so how do you like being a walrus, dad?"
47041,Lisa,no! connect!
43957,Lisa,excuse me.
51734,Lisa,"whoa, this place sure has changed since dizznee bought the rights to cosmic wars."
44450,Lisa,never mind.
50089,Lisa,"really?... they sound like... i mean... well, the thing..."
49422,Lisa,the test is almost over and i haven't done a thing. i've blown my whole future.
49628,Lisa,i'm in.
43470,Lisa,"compared to them, the public schools are a haven of enlightenment."
50824,Lisa,lisa simpson superstar!
43678,Lisa,"the next time hans sprüngfeld was seen, he had changed his name to jebediah springfield."
45574,Lisa,"principal skinner, i thought public schools were required to have access ramps for the disabled."
48431,Lisa,i can't eat this.
48471,Lisa,"shut up! i just said ""shut up."" i'll punish myself by going upstairs."
42008,Lisa,"moe, this is l.s. calling for h.s."
47048,Lisa,"okay, paperclip, do your stuff."
51297,Lisa,"new kid? um, have you made any friends?"
51304,Lisa,i'd better go.
46311,Lisa,"first place, here i come. look out!"
47603,Lisa,i can't believe you stood mom up.
52120,Lisa,ow! mom! bart threw a book at me.
51899,Lisa,hey!
51399,Lisa,you like this?
51426,Lisa,i have about eight of them.
48178,Lisa,idioto! idioto! idioto!
44633,Lisa,"point of order. if we want to learn anything, we must respect..."
42784,Lisa,ow! that was a big one.
52348,Lisa,and they're not shy about expressing it.
45414,Lisa,"with our superior intellects, we could rebuild this city on a foundation of reason and enlightenment. we could turn springfield into a utopia!"
45060,Lisa,"oh, geez!"
43247,Lisa,"hi, dad."
51316,Lisa,my new best friend isn't what i thought. she's a... republican.
46797,Lisa,...while you're spending the week at...
50236,Lisa,security!
50006,Lisa,i can hear you.
48193,Lisa,"yeah, but he's a wanted killer in our community!"
52172,Lisa,capital city -- yeah!
43834,Lisa,"bart, these look real."
44421,Lisa,mom!
50115,Lisa,he's not! he thought he was better than the laws of probability. anyone else think he's better than the laws of probability?
49948,Lisa,"well, i am one: flattered and two: intrigued. lisa simpson."
47256,Lisa,"well, i am proud of my light."
52321,Lisa,"we're really proud of you, dad."
45685,Lisa,bart did it! and they're gonna try for a field goal.
44868,Lisa,area 51? i found area 51!
46704,Lisa,i'm more than okay!...
44262,Lisa,no.
45240,Lisa,dad! don't you remember? it's our special saturday.
48550,Lisa,no! we have to read it together.
43670,Lisa,"--ha ha ha ha ha. oh my god! our town hero is a fraud! ""i write this confession so that my infamy will live on long after my body has succumbed to my infectious diphtheria."""
47973,Lisa,did i forget to mention yoooouuu?
51265,Lisa,a word you should know since it was on a vocabulary test you aced.
50939,Lisa,"i bought you a ticket for the mypad raffle, dad."
44470,Lisa,did anyone stop that robber?
42791,Lisa,"wow, i never thought principal skinner could become any more of a square, but there's the proof."
52063,Lisa,his face is so flesh-colored and sad.
46485,Lisa,whaa?
42375,Lisa,"well, here's my house."
42099,Lisa,"oh, bart."
43824,Lisa,"no, not what he said -- what he is. grandfather. as in ""grandfather clause"". apu, how long ago did your visa expire?"
45430,Lisa,"wow, dad, you're surfing like a pro."
42233,Lisa,left a good job in the city -- workin' for the man every night and day...
48563,Lisa,"thank you, thank you, thank you!"
44607,Lisa,"i was wrong about the cooders, dad. they're the nicest of all the transients you've ever brought home."
48805,Lisa,"bart, that's not a restaurant, it's somebody's house."
44766,Lisa,"who needs college, mom. we're trillionaires! let's buy dune buggies."
48292,Lisa,"hey, i know how we can save bart."
47936,Lisa,i'm sure everyone's happier with santa's little helper here to love them.
51096,Lisa,the trial's not over and gravy is dead animal juice.
52179,Lisa,"well, a blockaded bishop is of little value, but i think you're referring to a pawn."
43137,Lisa,"sounds like you had a good day today, dad."
47931,Lisa,"well bart, i really appreciate what you're gonna do for me."
49897,Lisa,"ants have six legs, bart."
42465,Lisa,that's as bad as the tasteless itchy and sambo cartoons of the late 30s. the writers should be ashamed of themselves.
47996,Lisa,"ladies and gentlemen, i have a confession to make. i didn't have my usual songwriter tonight..."
52210,Lisa,"it's not yours, bart! this is family glue!"
41759,Lisa,"no, no. he's fine."
42499,Lisa,"dad please, for the last time, i beg you, don't lower yourself to the level of the mob."
47525,Lisa,"i can't believe the ""gathering shadow"" was senate redistricting!"
51602,Lisa,the last day of school. field day. when you learn to balance an egg on a spoon...
52058,Lisa,we'd kill ourselves!
44235,Lisa,complete confidentiality? oh. and i'm sure he's as good as dr. hibbert. it says so right in his ad.
45448,Lisa,but you promised me we'd do something japanese.
50872,Lisa,"i think it's ""new car smell."""
44563,Lisa,"bart, what were you doing outside?"
48267,Lisa,mad beast!
42162,Lisa,"so, bart, will you be joining me in the bucolic splendor of kamp krusty?"
44725,Lisa,"oh, kenny, look at the interplay of light and shadow. it's so luminous and vibrant."
43713,Lisa,exactly.
46341,Lisa,we just spliced in some home movies. whaddaya think?
52175,Lisa,but i can't go back! not after i've seen the bright lights of capital city. i'll wither and die like a hothouse flower.
49693,Lisa,global warming can cause weather at both extremes -- hot and cold.
42038,Lisa,"mom, he's doing it again. bart, quit it! quit it! hey quit it! quit it! quit it! quit it! quit it! mommmmm!!"
44091,Lisa,we'll help you.
46750,Lisa,top suspects?
42665,Lisa,"dad, maybe this will cheer you up."
47913,Lisa,i'll bet she's sneaking food from someplace else! let's follow her!
47817,Lisa,i think he swallowed the remote.
50762,Lisa,do you actually serve those items?
50235,Lisa,"oh really? well let me ask you this, how many kids bring a gun to meet santa?"
51457,Lisa,you've been changing your dna?!
51884,Lisa,"hey bart, last one in the fountain's a rotten egg!"
43256,Lisa,"i know they look a little silly, but his feelings will be hurt if you don't wear them."
44942,Lisa,"that's it, don't be shy..."
45579,Lisa,"don't you think there's something weird going on here? we spent all day selecting fabric swatches, and then our guest speaker was ""phil from marketing""."
43963,Lisa,those are the odds they're giving in vegas.
45824,Lisa,"some of us have grammar school in the morning, you know."
50658,Lisa,polo!
42336,Lisa,we understand.
45926,Lisa,i wonder where goldilocks was.
48518,Lisa,who was that?
52282,Lisa,make it two.
42749,Lisa,"don't worry, bart. it seems like every week something odd happens to the simpsons. my advice is to ride it out, make an occasional smart-alec quip and by next week we'll be back to where we started from, ready for another wacky adventure."
49421,Lisa,"well, that's it."
50568,Lisa,what happened to me? in one vulnerable moment i became the thing i hated most -- a literary fraud.
52065,Lisa,"snap out of it, bart. face the facts. all those hours we spent staring at krusty, we were staring at a crook."
44399,Lisa,"okay, dad..."
43167,Lisa,"i know those words, but that sign makes no sense."
50800,Lisa,"let me explain. i have a chance for a grim but tolerable life, but only if i give up hope. now if you don't mind, and with all due worship, i would like to be alone."
47495,Lisa,you can do it. red!
48976,Lisa,i thought i turned that tape off.
44433,Lisa,i won't.
45732,Lisa,"oh, no!"
48380,Lisa,"uh, give me your lunch money."
51965,Lisa,ew! how'd you get a name like that?
48573,Lisa,"dad, there aren't any places left to sit."
49535,Lisa,"wow, the truth in boardwalking law has really done a number on this place."
49865,Lisa,"""dear fellow organic gardening enthusiasts: i'm afraid i am too sad to post my list of garden-friendly snails. yet again i have seen the bitter truth of how difficult it is to be smart and accepted."" ""with mulch love, lisa simpson."" mulch love, that's cute."
42997,Lisa,"bart! we did it! now we get to keep our house, and you get to go back to fourth grade!"
48270,Lisa,you worked at moe's?
41671,Lisa,"oh my god, you've been challenged! well lisa, let's see how you respond."
46817,Lisa,that's cheating! bart cheated!
44239,Lisa,"um, excuse me, mr. smithers, bart may be seriously hurt. could we possibly go ahead of you?"
41747,Lisa,"it's like an ox, only it has a hump and a dewlap. hump and dew-lap. hump and dew-lap."
44527,Lisa,i am home.
41886,Lisa,"oh, no! maggie made a wish!"
43769,Lisa,thanksmombye!
43021,Lisa,so here's where you're hiding.
48485,Lisa,"whatever, i've got some paper to mâché."
42174,Lisa,our nature hikes have become grim death marches.
51683,Lisa,it's not my birthday. although maggie's is pretty soon.
46399,Lisa,"it's not fair, dad. why should an animal die just because you and moe are fighting?"
48898,Lisa,"it was a diabolical scheme, and every member of his family played a part!"
46778,Lisa,hip hip...
48574,Lisa,ta-da!
47816,Lisa,hmm... the tv changes channels every time the dog barks.
47671,Lisa,i couldn't be prouder.
47435,Lisa,"well, it's nice you have your best friend back."
43902,Lisa,does this mean you still want to be friends? even though i tried to cover up my nerdish... leanings?
51711,Lisa,look at all these monstrosities.
47156,Lisa,"according to this contract, we have to change his name to ""suds mcduff."""
41734,Lisa,"perhaps he realized how hollow the pursuit of money is, and took his own life."
42630,Lisa,"dad, look, i made fish sticks. they're burned on the outside, but they're frozen on the inside so it balances out."
50364,Lisa,"no, i shouldn't -- i won't."
51128,Lisa,"milhouse, are you okay?"
46260,Lisa,this is the place i've read about! where dr. bushwell lives among the chimps!
47546,Lisa,"grampa, how do you sleep at night?"
50308,Lisa,and i locked the back door!
52506,Lisa,there is no cure for zombie-ism.
44598,Lisa,okay. we get our room and board free anyway.
52357,Lisa,"yuck. quit it, dad."
41842,Lisa,hey there ten-year old. i couldn't afford to get you a new drum...
44800,Lisa,"what does that even mean? mom might not see through you, but i do. you don't care about any of these people."
46385,Lisa,"judge snyder? motion to declare a writ of ""boys will be boys."""
48196,Lisa,sideshow bob!
50203,Lisa,"all right. mr. burns, i'm gonna show you that not all of us in this town are vindictive and cruel."
41941,Lisa,"mom, instead of milk for dinner, can i have a ""virgin moe?"""
42725,Lisa,that's awful!
45058,Lisa,"dad, you gotta get us out of here! use the remote!"
45920,Lisa,hey!
49728,Lisa,larry!
43988,Lisa,"oh, okay. can i stay up?"
46947,Lisa,"'bye, mom!"
46031,Lisa,you gave bart one.
41683,Lisa,ah.
48018,Lisa,we've got school tomorrow.
47335,Lisa,"krusty, your dad's a rabbi -- how could you not have had a bar mitzvah?"
51366,Lisa,"you could do what ""everybody loves raymond"" did."
49217,Lisa,not anymore!
42583,Lisa,"dad, do you notice anything strange?"
49441,Lisa,for years... for years...
47799,Lisa,no.
42625,Lisa,"dad, sit down."
41628,Lisa,"oh, can that tuna! we can get your brain to work the same way you always get the tv to work -- by hitting it!"
46925,Lisa,"blackening our hair was a great idea, dad. i look just like a powerpuff girl."
47523,Lisa,"don't worry, they're just getting the plot out of the way so it won't slow down the ."
46717,Lisa,"actually, i'm off campus. i, um, share a house with a couple of girls, a couple of guys."
42699,Lisa,"thanks. ""mr. simpson. stop. your constant letters are becoming a nuisance. stop. if you do not cease, i will be forced to pursue legal action. stop. signed, boris karloff, hollywood, california."""
42600,Lisa,"but, no, we killed mr. burns."
46573,Lisa,let's go where it's quiet.
44884,Lisa,"are you sure you don't want to go to a doctor? i mean, a drawbridge did close on your head."
46857,Lisa,whatever bart is saying is a lie. mom! what happened? your endowment's bigger than harvard's.
46015,Lisa,"ooh, it's morning. i gotta get back!"
46335,Lisa,they're always laughing. laughing at nothing.
45089,Lisa,"all right, i guess you're supposed to go through this stupid door..."
52278,Lisa,"please, dad."
51655,Lisa,no! no! no! no! that's super hell!
51512,Lisa,martin took my topic. what do i do?
48537,Lisa,comic book guy! have you seen our mom?
46221,Lisa,"third row, near the aisle."
42817,Lisa,oooh.
46989,Lisa,"well, i'm not done yet. principal skinner said if i win the state finals, i can go to the spell-lympics!"
51085,Lisa,sorry.
44106,Lisa,we have our own suggestions for the new nanny. would you like to hear them?
41954,Lisa,"dad, if the new baby is a girl, can we name her ariel?"
52335,Lisa,"hello, mr. powell"
50559,Lisa,"sitting in a coffee shop -- i couldn't feel more like a real writer! oh, better set up my wi-fi in case i need to do some research! but if i'm gonna use their free internet, i really should buy something."
47142,Lisa,i'm sorry. i only sent you the wrong way because i thought you were luke's girlfriend.
51490,Lisa,where'd he go?
49646,Lisa,"it was an accident, i swear!"
52132,Lisa,"that wasn't scary at all, bart."
43163,Lisa,"bart, you can't actually call these places! don't you know how expensive international calls are?"
47942,Lisa,"wow, krishna krisps, amazonkers, lollapalollipops -- these sound like my kind of snacks..."
49829,Lisa,"...and though hiram, mabel, and eliza are no longer among us, their truth goes marching on. thank you."
51985,Lisa,no.
45290,Lisa,"wow, my mind just created that out of nothing. this tank is releasing the full potential of my brain."
50867,Lisa,it's moe with wings!
51245,Lisa,"help me, doctor!"
51090,Lisa,and do you think this boy took those eggs?
45092,Lisa,"oh, great. so i'm dead now? fine, i'm sick of this stupid game anyway."
52363,Lisa,keep on truckin'? what does that mean?
51646,Lisa,one jumbo joe to go!
45758,Lisa,co-president? are you crazy?
46041,Lisa,"dad, how can you put a price on your dignity?"
52028,Lisa,"yes, you are."
47695,Lisa,cheating!
43931,Lisa,that waffle iron's been in the shop forever.
46945,Lisa,"stop it, please! i'm trying to eat."
44784,Lisa,"but that trivializes the whole idea of kids news. i mean, let's be honest. bart's not exactly the brightest penny in the fountain."
47841,Lisa,you make those same stupid jokes every field trip!
42407,Lisa,"please don't leave me, george."
41718,Lisa,"bart, grampa's a kindly old man who trusts us. are you sure it's right to take advantage of him?"
41602,Lisa,"um, have you eaten onions lately?"
46077,Lisa,we did.
42814,Lisa,"oh. that is so cool, that is so exciting, that is so... crappy."
44175,Lisa,"that's a trust, janey. a sacred trust."
42064,Lisa,"no, i want to get him a beer."
43148,Lisa,we're saved!
50014,Lisa,thursday we got attacked by bees.
47312,Lisa,this is even worse than you think -- look!
46549,Lisa,"hey, where's our parents?"
42913,Lisa,"hey, ralph. want to come with me and allison to play anagrams?"
45911,Lisa,"folks, we're just having a little family tiff. if you'll just bear with us..."
42950,Lisa,"okay, bye-bye / bye / bye, grampa."
42541,Lisa,why haven't you hung up your gold record?
48086,Lisa,"okay, gotta keep calm. if scooby doo has taught me anything, it's that the only thing to fear are crooked real estate developers."
46406,Lisa,"how'd they get your bar back to normal so quickly, moe?"
47298,Lisa,sir ian mckellen! you're my favorite shakespearean actor!
44618,Lisa,dad and all these other people are obviously the products of mental conditioning.
42477,Lisa,"no, we're just curious."
46056,Lisa,"you have to offer people something: a joke, an opinion, an idea..."
41870,Lisa,no bart. knowledge.
43786,Lisa,"langdon alger? oh, i don't like him anymore... okay, but you've got to promise you won't get mad or tell anyone, especially bart."
47587,Lisa,dad?
43938,Lisa,your world is incredible! and you speak english!
48091,Lisa,but wait. how am i supposed to sleep with that spooky cemetery outside my window?
44566,Lisa,"sorry, daddy."
48079,Lisa,i can't keep sleeping in mom and dad's room.
49977,Lisa,how shortened?
43239,Lisa,hugh should take it easy because of his fall.
50620,Lisa,"oh, dad! i'm so glad you've heard the voice of reason."
49247,Lisa,"oh, that's so sad!"
46392,Lisa,a hole for what?
43639,Lisa,how much did it cost?
50649,Lisa,"wow, i've created something incredibly popular!"
44139,Lisa,"you should try out, dad. you have a funny voice."
49930,Lisa,she doesn't like lying on the beach! she likes being in the ocean!
50817,Lisa,a mockingbird without a song...
51121,Lisa,"milhouse, seeing you there... saying nothing... it's the cutest you've ever been."
44855,Lisa,may i sit there?
49263,Lisa,i'm through with crosswords! my innocence died in those four hundred and forty-one little boxes.
44127,Lisa,nope.
42845,Lisa,what are you writing here? a play?
43248,Lisa,thanks.
47257,Lisa,"you mean i can come to the school after hours, weekends, even during the summer?"
51993,Lisa,the simpsons have entered the forest.
47895,Lisa,oh boy. let's get out of here before dad does a bad impression of mom.
47768,Lisa,...ask me no more questions / i'll tell you no more--
51592,Lisa,i would've found a friend eventually. you couldn't wait a damn decade until i got into college?
52374,Lisa,yea!
43165,Lisa,"office of the solicitor general? ""office of the prime minister?"" ""hopping mad collection agency?"" what is all this stuff?"
44853,Lisa,"hi, larry."
47438,Lisa,"look, just because milhouse is gone doesn't mean you have to pretend to be my friend."
46611,Lisa,"that's just you, bart."
44212,Lisa,"well, he's not here! nobody's here! and none of you should be here! you've all been tricked!"
49918,Lisa,but i don't know how to drive.
44962,Lisa,i am not wearing this.
41618,Lisa,"i just had a worrisome thought! if there can be two incarnations of the simpsons, why couldn't some evil marketing entity produce millions of others?"
41792,Lisa,why? what's wrong with it?
50914,Lisa,all day i have vitamin burps.
51794,Lisa,"let's see... what rhymes with ""jebediah""?"
46057,Lisa,you can't post that on the internet. you don't even know if it's true.
51040,Lisa,why do you think bad guys are so cool?
42110,Lisa,poor santa's little helper. i'm starting to think we'll never see him again.
46472,Lisa,"mom, dad, my spiritual quest is over..."
47793,Lisa,how many men do you know?
43565,Lisa,"just shut up and listen. there's something fishy about grandma. whenever we ask her where she's been all this time, she changes the subject. and just now when a police car drove by, she ran into the house."
46021,Lisa,"no, mom. it's a memorial forest now. if i'm alive, they'll cut it down!"
47378,Lisa,"mom, i'm not sure god responds to threats and intimidation."
47325,Lisa,he made it! he's finally protected from man.
43848,Lisa,oops.
51845,Lisa,"a dog! all right, dad!"
48721,Lisa,are you sure?
52224,Lisa,that's all right.

47532,Lisa,we come from the real world.
44861,Lisa,22a?! then where the heck am i?
48724,Lisa,maybe it was the same person who tied each of the dog's feet to a toy car.
51409,Lisa,and the worst one of all is--

49595,Lisa,yes. but they're my own original creation.

48501,Lisa,fur is murder! when's the krusty movie coming out?
49405,Lisa,can you keep her quiet?
50813,Lisa,"look at me! you did help me, by allowing me to inappropriately focus eight years of rage and rejection on you. it was like a great sneeze. and now i can say what's good about me. and i can say it as lisa simpson! just not that loud."
42684,Lisa,"dad, are you listening to me?"
50315,Lisa,i'm sorry i was so stubborn. i hope you're not mad.
42602,Lisa,mom?!
43306,Lisa,"so if we were in school this week, what do you think we'd be learning?"
43035,Lisa,you mean those leagues where parents push their kids into vicious competition to compensate for their own failed dreams of glory?
45272,Lisa,"dad, why did you have to take away my room?"
46231,Lisa,"actually, it's just ordinary salad dressing."
43867,Lisa,"uh, mom, i'm kinda trying to go for a different look this year."
47236,Lisa,i can't believe nelson is more popular than me.
50381,Lisa,you're just gonna stand there?
42260,Lisa,ew!
48539,Lisa,i hope everything's okay.
41874,Lisa,"here you go, bart. it's a long shot, but, that's all i can do without learning ancient hebrew."
49630,Lisa,and people will remember you were there?
49990,Lisa,"and when you wag your tail, it really lights up a room."
47395,Lisa,maybe you should let dad read your book before you submit it to publishers.
44259,Lisa,i didn't. i just wanted to leave.
50680,Lisa,"grampa, would you help take me on a foolish romantic mission?"
49034,Lisa,i would strongly support that measure.
47217,Lisa,"sorry, sorry, sorry!"
48546,Lisa,"dad, can't you read me a story for a little bit?"
44424,Lisa,wave of da future!
42840,Lisa,"oh, look. bart's all alone. maybe i should keep him company, at least for a little while."
46436,Lisa,"hey, what's that over there?"
50079,Lisa,"well, that depends."
44726,Lisa,you have to listen to the notes she's not playing!
51937,Lisa,he'll give you good advice. he's the toughest simpson alive.
47870,Lisa,"no, i'm giving it up!"
46508,Lisa,"gabriel, are you okay?"
47545,Lisa,"taco, please."
44978,Lisa,ahhhh!
46786,Lisa,i guess guns really are the answer.
44452,Lisa,"stop! doesn't the bible say ""judge not lest ye be judged""?"
41722,Lisa,"grampa, what a question?"
50740,Lisa,"and dad donated something, too."
49463,Lisa,so many rings! but which one is the key to finding the gem?
44925,Lisa,krusty's speak and say?
51675,Lisa,i am judging you.
47746,Lisa,oh! that'd be wonderful! oh i'd -- i'd have to ask my mom.
48156,Lisa,oh my god! spend a summer in rome!
44921,Lisa,this should be in a museum.
46229,Lisa,"i have isolated the chemical which is emitted by every geek, dork, and four-eyes. i call it ""poindextrose""."
51783,Lisa,that's even worse!
44732,Lisa,hello. my name is lisa simpson.
51481,Lisa,"i'm definitely getting this one. oh, but i forgot about this one! oh my god i never even saw this one!"
48740,Lisa,no you didn't -- your plan was to burn the corn.
47180,Lisa,i don't think dad is accurately portraying native american life.
47413,Lisa,who is it? is it ralph?
50078,Lisa,i plan to attend an ivy league school myself. i do have a 4.0 gpa.
50460,Lisa,skinner's involved in this. deep.
47349,Lisa,"it's saturday, december sixth."
43384,Lisa,"sorry, grampa. it's just that, for a second, it looked like dad had melted."
50032,Lisa,i came to share in the esteem that the world bestows on its artists.
52221,Lisa,baaart! you're wrecking it! let go! i worked forever on this!
48624,Lisa,i'll be good.
43671,Lisa,"oh, it's just the excitement of studying jebediah."
43344,Lisa,isn't anybody gonna show up?
44619,Lisa,we toil in the fields and he rides around in a rolls royce?
47017,Lisa,could i please hear it in a sentence?
48179,Lisa,"well, some people in europe have the impression that america has made some stupid choices in the past, oh, five years. so for the next week, i'm from canada."
47713,Lisa,"sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six..."
46487,Lisa,"oh, i'll send you an email greeting card."
44034,Lisa,what do you feel? what's inside you right now?
41904,Lisa,it's not my fault. it's the reed.

49028,Lisa,you can just drop me off here.
43604,Lisa,"then, with your last ounce of strength, you pointed to w and s. waylon smithers."
50367,Lisa,"willie, if you will?"
43626,Lisa,just buy it. you don't have to rationalize everything.
48913,Lisa,"ralph, they have no right to do this to you. they just want to use you."
50285,Lisa,"well, as a feminist, virtually anything a woman does is empowering."
50898,Lisa,"i've read every expert on poker, and watched jennifer tilly's dvd."
52492,Lisa,garden brains.
46594,Lisa,he must have dropped this.
42138,Lisa,you've gained thirteen pounds.
48192,Lisa,"see? s'fine. go on, go on with the thing."
45628,Lisa,"dad, where are your clothes?"
46986,Lisa,free tibet!
45895,Lisa,"and i'm directing the ""making of"" video."
43347,Lisa,you didn't know him! nobody knew him! but he was a great man! and i won't rest until all of springfield knows the name of bleeding gums murphy!
42378,Lisa,i get the idea.
45669,Lisa,"mom, i lost dad and bart."
52242,Lisa,aren't you forgetting something?
44842,Lisa,dad?
47524,Lisa,that character is just a tired stereotype.
47889,Lisa,it's so embarrassing mom is making us wear clothes from goodwill.
47376,Lisa,coltrane?
46569,Lisa,see?
43421,Lisa,"wow, mom. you didn't have to go to this much trouble."
45303,Lisa,"the worst part is, you pick out your own cow and they kill it right in front of you!"
49415,Lisa,what did i get wrong?
46954,Lisa,"dad, are you hurt?"
47341,Lisa,"it's great, dad. you have tremendous power. and now it's time to put it to use."
51872,Lisa,"all right, dad!"
49753,Lisa,"all right, it's all hooked up."
51821,Lisa,"dad, do you have anything i can eat?"
44099,Lisa,no.
50527,Lisa,goorsha! goorsha! goorsha! goorsha! goorsha!
42716,Lisa,action! i've got to talk to that woman who invented malibu stacy and see if i can get her to --
49702,Lisa,"we'll be closer than best friends for the rest of our lives. but you'll never know what that's like, because you won't ever have a brother."
51340,Lisa,"organic gardening is an essential part of twenty-first century education, teaching both hands-on--"
52291,Lisa,why are we waiting for dad?
46386,Lisa,woo hoo!
45495,Lisa,"dad, you're being cruel for no reason -- what will people think?"
46007,Lisa,and hanging christmas stockings!
50475,Lisa,i like routine. i like routine.
49276,Lisa,um... i'm also returning this kitten calendar.
46265,Lisa,greenpeace?
45694,Lisa,it looks great. i can't believe we scrubbed that old man smell out of a hundred and thirty-seven rooms.
49363,Lisa,"mom, please don't do that."
48904,Lisa,i think it's exciting -- springfield is the center of the political universe. i feel like a pundit in a think tank!
50838,Lisa,can't dad take bart while we seek out culture?
48189,Lisa,"dad, don't act like mussolini!"
44982,Lisa,lucky parameciums.
45644,Lisa,"look, they're rusted through."
50603,Lisa,"ms. dubinsky, can you please just tell us why you hate krusty?"
50647,Lisa,"wait a minute, grownups are on this?"
42679,Lisa,like what?
44968,Lisa,eww!

50207,Lisa,"yes, technically it's you. but like i said, people change and--"
47497,Lisa,"go on, maggie, you can do it."
52505,Lisa,"no, that's what happened in your false memories."
46978,Lisa,"skewed tour? the traveling festival of rock 'n' roll, skateboarding and extreme sports?"
50871,Lisa,me neither.
50926,Lisa,you don't feel any pain.
50474,Lisa,you know i hate surprises!
42923,Lisa,"sure, i guess."
48971,Lisa,i can't take it anymore! the stress is killing me! i'm on a freight train to crazytown!
47909,Lisa,"for your information, springfielders can be intelligent and articulate. i happen to know because we're from springfield."
45141,Lisa,that's one grade i truly earned.
51005,Lisa,"don't you see, you're taking women for granted. and aside from being lumped together and generalized about, it's the one thing all women hate."
48962,Lisa,act like you're shopping! we can't be seen together.
43005,Lisa,okilly dokilly.
45110,Lisa,"i need a miracle. come on, you owe me."
44668,Lisa,"no, dad, it's to fight soil erosion."
45180,Lisa,"wait, there's a commercial!"
44753,Lisa,ralph! ralph! ralph! ralph!
49623,Lisa,i don't want to talk about it.
42774,Lisa,"dad, how would you like to be sold to an ivory dealer?"
51260,Lisa,he got a hundred on his test?! that's impossible!
42380,Lisa,"ralph, i think you're nice but, i'm just not ready for this kind of thing. do you understand?"
45188,Lisa,"... that's right, homer simpson."
43885,Lisa,"okay... thanks. that's very, uh... ""rad"" of you."
50748,Lisa,this group is adapting children's classics for the stage to entertain generations of survivors.
48521,Lisa,it's tom wolfe! he uses more exclamation points than any other major american writer.
43742,Lisa,i don't know. but it looks like you might have a little competition all of a sudden.
45723,Lisa,"okay, i finished the gardening sequence."
47644,Lisa,don't call me chief.
43669,Lisa,"the secret confessions of jebediah springfield? ""know ye who read this: there is more to my life than history records."""

52244,Lisa,i reached him.
49370,Lisa,okay... best friend.
50501,Lisa,"bart, you wanna see something cool?"
52087,Lisa,dad dances?
42106,Lisa,can't you see i'm reading a third-rate biography of copernicus i found at the bus station?
51491,Lisa,nooooo!
50697,Lisa,"if i didn't know better, i'd say it was a town meeting."
46333,Lisa,i can't remember the last time dad sang us a torch song.
43624,Lisa,"oh, you look so sophisticated -- just like mary hart!"
49915,Lisa,i'm gonna get real help. just try to keep her wet.
50126,Lisa,"it's the most exciting play in baseball! go, bart!"
45626,Lisa,"no they won't. we'll all pitch in on the housework, right guys? guys...?"
47698,Lisa,i guess dad has to be my hero now.
50429,Lisa,yes... no... i don't know! it means that... that life is full of unexpected things and you should never give up. and you're cute in the moonlight.
48694,Lisa,"you don't even know the rules! this could be my new thing, and you're turning it into a joke!"
46793,Lisa,another proud moment for the simpsons.
45908,Lisa,what kind of song should we play?
50038,Lisa,mom! take me home!
52013,Lisa,happy birthday!
43936,Lisa,"oh, my poor little guys. that bart is so rude."
42710,Lisa,that's it! i'm calling the company!

51474,Lisa,"""this includes feeding; bathing; cleaning of droppings and barfings; and, when the time comes, burying or flushing."""
47286,Lisa,"no, it doesn't."
51463,Lisa,"uh... bob, you can't kill us without a little singing, right?"
51721,Lisa,"mom, i'm just a kid. but i say if dad isn't here christmas morning, that's the kind of thing families never recover from."
46222,Lisa,"my study is entitled ""airborne pheromones and aggression in bullies""."
44415,Lisa,oh yeah?
48057,Lisa,this stinks -- my room is the only one that faces that cemetery!
46163,Lisa,cut it out! you're a grown man!
45805,Lisa,and it's still got a roll of film in it.
44758,Lisa,can i?
51740,Lisa,are we there yet?
41836,Lisa,"no one wants your stupid police badge, bart."
49563,Lisa,"ooh, a doctorate!"

42420,Lisa,i want the most intelligent hamster you've got.
48447,Lisa,pleased to meet you.
46856,Lisa,"bart, this is all your fault."
47023,Lisa,wha?
43159,Lisa,"bart, water will only go the other way in the southern hemisphere."
50039,Lisa,"goodbye, guys. i'll try again when i'm older..."
45693,Lisa,why are we cleaning this room? i don't think we were even in here.
43572,Lisa,"you know, gramma, i used to think maybe i was adopted. i couldn't understand how i fit into this family. now that i met you, i suddenly make a lot of sense."
44841,Lisa,but it's the last day of the isis exhibit!
49774,Lisa,oh my gosh. it's the mascot from the 1924 games in chamonix!
51037,Lisa,i know. it's weird to me too.
47283,Lisa,"okay, let me take figure skating."
48446,Lisa,"yes, i am."
42980,Lisa,i thought this was a secret ballot.
46819,Lisa,ow! you are such an immature-- punch buggy white!
43173,Lisa,"thank you, bart. i promise i won't make fun of you later for this."
43548,Lisa,dad?

47880,Lisa,"listen, i've got a plan to get ling back. but we must be discreet. you never know where there might be a spy."
52518,Lisa,"oh, poor bart. my daughter thinks i'm a lousy mother."
45752,Lisa,"as you know, we've inherited quite a budget crunch from president trump. how bad is it, secretary van houten?"
46864,Lisa,"well, you saved krusty's reputation."
48924,Lisa,goodbye! / see ya later!
47294,Lisa,maybe you could give us a personal tour of your country.
44302,Lisa,there's a can.
46233,Lisa,a gift certificate from j.c. penney?
42782,Lisa,it couldn't possibly be bottomless.

46696,Lisa,bravo!
43157,Lisa,"it never spins the other way. in the northern hemisphere, water always drains counter-clockwise. it's called the coriolis effect."
42673,Lisa,"hush, field trip boy."
47129,Lisa,wanna play a little longer? it's only ten and the moon is awful big.
51886,Lisa,"no, me!"
50109,Lisa,you disobeyed your manager!
51252,Lisa,"if every student pledges not to cheat, and to turn in any cheater, no one will cheat the system because they'll be the system."
48427,Lisa,"otto, help me!"
45730,Lisa,dad?
47406,Lisa,leaving!
43303,Lisa,"but dad, by striking they're trying to effect a change in management so that they can be happier and more productive."
50167,Lisa,oh yeah?
44101,Lisa,"um, there's a hair in my soup. but i'll just eat around it."
42014,Lisa,my third husband bought me this.
48818,Lisa,shout!
41667,Lisa,question two: using what you learned in question one...
52255,Lisa,"but, mom! if you take our cartoons away, we'll grow up without a sense of humor and be robots."
48181,Lisa,"when mount vesuvius erupted, people were overcome by volcanic ash so fast that they were frozen in whatever position they were in at the moment of their death."
51049,Lisa,"lisa simpson, hi. as second grade student-faculty liaison, i'd like to welcome you-"
50110,Lisa,"here's what: you're off the team! get him outta here, boys."
52369,Lisa,"look, mom, i finished my patch. it depicts the two greatest musical influences in my life."
49167,Lisa,"hey, what are those boxes in the back?"
50743,Lisa,it's so diverse! i've died and gone to a pbs kids show!
43141,Lisa,"no, dad, i don't think..."
44893,Lisa,wowww. it's magnificent.
49456,Lisa,hm...
48150,Lisa,and i will be your campaign manager!
51867,Lisa,"dad, eat something. it's got mustard on it."
44584,Lisa,"you like musicals, don't you dad?"
46514,Lisa,doesn't it bother you that you're breaking up our family?
50349,Lisa,"i do, i do!"
43491,Lisa,the whole world wants me to eat meat. i can't fight it anymore.
51074,Lisa,ms. cantwell! wait!
52442,Lisa,wow!
48295,Lisa,"listen, we can trade mr. teeny for bart. we just have to find a way to get him up there."
47302,Lisa,why did you let him be his own barrister?
46714,Lisa,um... i'm a teacher's aide in a very special class.
41654,Lisa,whuh?
45836,Lisa,got that right. / durn tootin'. / boy howdy.
52418,Lisa,and there weren't any jewish cowboys.
44369,Lisa,don't do that. why should we both be outcasts?
43439,Lisa,we give up.
42332,Lisa,mr. lanley! aren't you gonna ride the monorail?
49781,Lisa,a dime? what do you think i am -- a pay phone from nineteen eighty?!
47650,Lisa,"they're so beautiful. and their breath smells like peppermint! no! no! i won't take your blood ponies! go on, sweetie. go on. shoo!"
43843,Lisa,no.
44864,Lisa,"okay, the museum's got to be north of here. now which way is north...?"
43622,Lisa,"hey, mom! there's something in here!"
50487,Lisa,"well, it means that you can communicate!"
45968,Lisa,"i'm all for ethnic diversity, but this is just pandering."
45125,Lisa,what?
51405,Lisa,thanks for taking us in. our family always appreciates asylum.
49671,Lisa,what happened to miss hoover?
49710,Lisa,you left a trail of lost winter clothes.
50359,Lisa,"raymondo! i mastered the slide pass -- and i've almost mastered the denver slide pass... and, why is there always a ""denver"" version of things?"
44836,Lisa,this exhibit is a once-in-a-lifetime event. it's the first time these egyptian artifacts have been allowed out of england.
41771,Lisa,"although i am aware you are looking at me, i would look exactly the same even if you weren't."
52155,Lisa,"try not to spill anything, dad."
49112,Lisa,"wow, i guess nelson's the hot thing now. my movie will probably never be seen."
47906,Lisa,"ah, rats."
46016,Lisa,"oh, no."
46217,Lisa,please? it's for science.
47629,Lisa,he's got a tree in his eye!
41999,Lisa,"well, i like the 49ers because they're pure of heart -- seattle because they got something to prove -- and the raiders because they always cheat."
43498,Lisa,that's why i ran away from home.
44402,Lisa,what a perfect way to end our day in new york.
48046,Lisa,"look, all i'm saying is, you really should think twice before..."
45608,Lisa,yes. the madness ends here.
42146,Lisa,dad? dad?
49351,Lisa,"i have a best friend! you heard me say that, didn't you?"
45821,Lisa,what? / how could you?
49890,Lisa,there's only one ant left!
43836,Lisa,"generation x may be shallow, but at least they have tolerance and respect for all people."
46249,Lisa,"i know, but..."
43061,Lisa,"great game, bart."
50885,Lisa,where'd you get that shirt?
41834,Lisa,it's funny how two wrongs sometimes make a right.
49350,Lisa,i'd love to!
42466,Lisa,"yeah, sort of."
50553,Lisa,you're group-writing a book?! but the only reason anyone would ever do that is... profit!
42441,Lisa,so we'll march day and night /
49720,Lisa,...clark gable owes me a book. and he never paid me for the shoeshine. but his big blue eyes could melt the butter you kept in your pocket for lunch. lunch butter we called it.
46234,Lisa,"no, dad! didn't you listen to anything i said?"
50171,Lisa,do you have to wax this floor now?
42239,Lisa,stop this float!
45686,Lisa,you won a grammy.
48553,Lisa,"c'mon dad, read the last chapter! everyone says there's a big surprise -- i bet angelica discovers that she's a wizard!"
44373,Lisa,"oh, it's too hard. my hand is slipping."
49618,Lisa,yeah?
46375,Lisa,creative sentencing is common these days. that's why bill clinton is our new mailman.
42650,Lisa,"thanks, mom."
42539,Lisa,dean martin still packs 'em in.
42476,Lisa,maybe he just doesn't take us seriously 'cause we're kids. let's put a grownup's name on it.
46178,Lisa,"dad, i'm so proud of you. if you need some inspiration, here's a book of mike farrell's core beliefs."
47840,Lisa,sure am!
51916,Lisa,"oh, brother."
48255,Lisa,i understand.
48348,Lisa,are we gonna do any actual math problems?
50037,Lisa,"it's called ""applause."""
48369,Lisa,i have to go.
43602,Lisa,"we'll be safe here till mom and dad, the evil overlords gets home."
50727,Lisa,thank you!
47326,Lisa,"i don't know, but whoever's in there is taking their sweet old time."
43929,Lisa,"ooo, waffles!"
43551,Lisa,"hey, leave my dad alone. just because he's overweight doesn't mean he's bad. he's a sweet man and he has real feelings."
48584,Lisa,bart!
51210,Lisa,"dad, you're scary when you're calm and focused."
49866,Lisa,somebody posted a comment?
45973,Lisa,don't you call me a--
49364,Lisa,"mom, stop! this is our thing, not yours!"
44164,Lisa,run!
45637,Lisa,"okay, guys, dinner's ready..."
49943,Lisa,it's the baby whales' dad!
48028,Lisa,"well, at least your name's on the bowl."
46292,Lisa,west springfield?
47418,Lisa,"that's not true, bart. mom and dad value us equally, and... oh, you're right. 'kay, go ahead."
52316,Lisa,"hi, dad. i think stealing cable is wrong. so i'm choosing not to watch it in the hope that others will follow my example. it's the last you'll hear from me on the matter. thank you for your time."
51894,Lisa,the dad has a shirt on.
46489,Lisa,"yeah, i wanted to spend christmas with you guys."
46547,Lisa,mmmmm.
44653,Lisa,the law has spoken.
45193,Lisa,doughy's has terrible pizza.
41964,Lisa,"how do you mean, dad?"
48696,Lisa,"dad, i'm impressed! you've become a much better referee."
48965,Lisa,don't make me say indian again!
44734,Lisa,"...but i have something more important to say. for reasons beyond my control, i will soon become vapid, sluggish, and slow-witted. so before that happens, i want to share some things with you that have really meant a lot to me..."
43131,Lisa,"you're worried about telling dad, aren't you, mom?"
42472,Lisa,no way.
43305,Lisa,"relax? i can't relax. nor can i yield, relent, or... only two synonyms? oh my god! i'm losing my perspicacity!"
50473,Lisa,"actually, i do have a speech prepared!"
49056,Lisa,lisa's brother.
51204,Lisa,exactly!
44289,Lisa,"i normally don't laugh at other people's misfortunes, but on behalf of the recycling community: ha! it couldn't happen to anyone more deserving."
45078,Lisa,uh-oh. i don't like the sound of that.
47553,Lisa,why are we even going? last year uncle tyrone was bitter and depressed.
43378,Lisa,he's ready to give up the drudgery of the professional mambo circuit and settle into a nice teaching job.
46127,Lisa,"dad, you're just going through a classic oedipal anxiety. you remember the story of oedipus, don't you?"
50426,Lisa,"all right, sister. what's your game?"
49388,Lisa,so you're saying he'll look like you in ten days?
48969,Lisa,bart! no! don't do...
44953,Lisa,"oh, earrings! wow, thank you so much, alex. but these are for pierced ears."
49232,Lisa,"grampa, everyone knows that the only real test of skill is the new york times puzzle, edited by will shortz!"
41918,Lisa,"i just called to say i love you, dad."
45477,Lisa,why is the zero made out of glass?
49605,Lisa,"mom, isn't that book the bible of right-wing losers?"
44059,Lisa,"yes, but the records only go back to 1978, when the hall of records was mysteriously blown away!"
49033,Lisa,"sir, i didn't get this ""skepticism"" merit badge falling for promises like that."
43427,Lisa,i don't know. they should be here.
41858,Lisa,come on...
44358,Lisa,"that's how they want you to feel. but if you just hang in there, they'll eventually accept you."
47427,Lisa,"hi, janey... branford marsalis' car broke down outside your house? and he's just jamming 'til wynton shows up? oh..."
45696,Lisa,"i hate to be a killjoy, but do you really think we can win playing ""stars and stripes forever""? it's so beginner band, and we're advanced beginner band."
49244,Lisa,"in my young life i've seen that every time i'm about to achieve true happiness, some little piece of me says ""you don't deserve this."" and another little piece says ""i agree."""
45715,Lisa,"now remember, we have to leave nature just the way we found it. everything we pack in, we pack out."
51375,Lisa,no thanks.
50877,Lisa,i know why they're here!
52251,Lisa,"mr. murdock, my brother is thinking about jumping springfield gorge on a skateboard."
45658,Lisa,"ohh, i don't like the looks of this."
46313,Lisa,"...as the circulation returns, the subject prepares for a long and painful recovery."
44740,Lisa,doctor?
46610,Lisa,god spoke to me -- i must obey.
42500,Lisa,if the snakes were in here we could protect them.
47055,Lisa,"dad, have you looked at this earnings report?"
46806,Lisa,it's wednesday night!
50128,Lisa,"maybe it was, but according to my calculations, you're a great brother fifty-one percent of the time."
52500,Lisa,i have to decide whether to make milhouse human again. i even prefer the way he smells now. some meat went bad in our freezer and my heart skipped a beat.
41738,Lisa,"yeah, mom! guess what? for a dollar a man sold me thirty-five caspers and a dozen lois lanes."
42557,Lisa,no.
45767,Lisa,"bart, get out of here!"
44639,Lisa,wait a minute... we had a cooler full of snacks on the bus.
43115,Lisa,don't you see? getting what you want all the time will ultimately leave you unfulfilled and joyless.
51617,Lisa,"so milhouse got the redemption he deserved... and so, in a way, did bart."
46970,Lisa,"no dad, it means bart would be a legal adult and free to move out of the house."
52057,Lisa,with all our hearts!
42067,Lisa,"dar-ryl, dar-ryl."
45160,Lisa,dad! what a nice surprise.
43765,Lisa,ready!
51237,Lisa,you're rotating it in the wrong direction!
41717,Lisa,mom! you wouldn't dare.
51235,Lisa,i could do what i want to bart's head?
44315,Lisa,no! it's evil! please stop recycling!
45135,Lisa,"aww. way to go, ralph."
44783,Lisa,"zork? what is ""zork""?"
45063,Lisa,and now he's dead.
50773,Lisa,"mr. szyslak, i have a feeling there's going to be one more act to this story."
47855,Lisa,"you'll see. oh, you will see."
50158,Lisa,no! that's not gonna happen to me! i'm gonna make sure nothing distracts me ever!
47499,Lisa,so maggie's not a genius?
50593,Lisa,"um, i think we're supposed to get off here."
42081,Lisa,what's the point? they'll never notice.
42060,Lisa,"""though i'll be inoculating babies in kampuchea, my heart will always be with you."""
42751,Lisa,we got the recipe from the fruit punch advisory board.
47565,Lisa,let's go find mom and dad!
52504,Lisa,"thanks, but milhouse and i are in a pretty good place."
49656,Lisa,sorry -- i have a tea party at janey's.
50339,Lisa,affirmative.
43883,Lisa,me? unlikely. my goony brother's always going to libraries. i usually hang out in front.
44768,Lisa,i know. i already jumped to that conclusion.
47568,Lisa,i'm going into the gold medallion club... with silver-level membership!
51979,Lisa,okay.
51353,Lisa,and i also wanna say that if--
47989,Lisa,"dad, i'm sorry you're hurt, but you left me no choice. you were obnoxious at a level not even permitted in show business."
42648,Lisa,"well, i know it's absurd, but i dreamed the boogeyman was after me and he's hiding..."
50613,Lisa,"you know, symbols can often rile people up. the swastika... the new york yankees logo..."
51176,Lisa,what is it? what is it? what is it?
50531,Lisa,whoa! / cool!
50803,Lisa,why do you keep telling me what i'm gonna do? this isn't about me.
48727,Lisa,make her stop!
51689,Lisa,but you just said that--
45768,Lisa,i can't relax! being president is hard work. maybe you should try doing something with your life.
42885,Lisa,"ah, that used to be my face in the mud..."
43294,Lisa,"no, don't! stay down, monty! don't get up! stay down! stay down, boy!"
52165,Lisa,we want a catcher / not a belly scratcher!
42179,Lisa,"and now the effort of writing has made me lightheaded. so i close by saying, save us! save us now! bart and lisa."
49586,Lisa,"you know, i think those shirts should say ""insecurity."""
50441,Lisa,"no problem, just some cobwebs."
49299,Lisa,"dad, we have to do something -- all the bees are dying!"
43298,Lisa,"i've never seen them fight like that, bart. i'm worried that all this posturing and saber-rattling could lead to a teachers strike."
45074,Lisa,"i didn't quite get the point of it, dad. why would lenny want someone to saw his legs off?"
49379,Lisa,"yes! i mean, yes -- there are dragons everywhere! green ones, chinese ones, chubby bald ones..."
48949,Lisa,"bart, martin could be seriously hurt, or worse."
47888,Lisa,"mom, why are you so worried about money?"
46310,Lisa,there's the school!
42754,Lisa,"and i'm going to the park to jam with the little white girls blues quartet. wanna come with me, daddy-o?"
49577,Lisa,"l'ecole, c'est moi!"
48260,Lisa,"i'll stay with you, dad."
50812,Lisa,to thank you!
42446,Lisa,now who's laughing? now who's laughing?
44806,Lisa,"oh, bart, you'll have to ride your bike pretty fast to get out there in time..."
49380,Lisa,and so the queens--
49697,Lisa,"fine. get this on in two minutes, lose the attitude, and for god's sake, suck in that pooch."
46511,Lisa,"dad's on the log. now mom, you get the car and pull them to safety."
49353,Lisa,my best friend is so cool!
46005,Lisa,awww.
51183,Lisa,"orwell, obscure? the author of ""animal farm?"""
49423,Lisa,"oh well, maybe it'll be more fun to be a regular, average, stay-at-home..."
43254,Lisa,what about my family's tradition?
43686,Lisa,"hi, mr. hurlbut."
43722,Lisa,"what happened, dad?"
51883,Lisa,tough choice.
43289,Lisa,that's cats.
43331,Lisa,bleeding gums was my hero and i never got to tell him how i felt.
47983,Lisa,my kitty died on christmas eve
45526,Lisa,mom.
47584,Lisa,"i'm drawing a picture of my newest hero, the pie man."
44743,Lisa,so i'm not doomed!
47682,Lisa,"mom, a letter from ovenfresh industries!"
50090,Lisa,"okay, bottom line: i need an extra-curricular activity, and no one else will coach you loveable losers."
46779,Lisa,hip hip...
44251,Lisa,didn't you hear i almost killed my brother?
50821,Lisa,some day i'll design a solar car!
52213,Lisa,"maggie, i'm about to unveil my centerpiece to the family!"
45408,Lisa,this is so cool. i feel like i'm back in the renaissance.
46707,Lisa,you think i'll pass gym this term?
51115,Lisa,"oh. okay. if you'll excuse me, i have to go think of you in a different light."
44245,Lisa,"dad, i'm not on drugs. i was just trying--"
45306,Lisa,"mom, is this the one you want?"
50438,Lisa,band books?!
48911,Lisa,"leave him alone, you vultures!"
51206,Lisa,i think someone i love is a terrorist. does that make me crazy?
44502,Lisa,"principal skinner, remember how i didn't sue when i found that scorpion in my applesauce? well, i'm calling in a favor."
43200,Lisa,"wow, you can see into the... present."
50799,Lisa,solitude?
43858,Lisa,"mom, why don't i have any friends?"
49790,Lisa,"there must have been some good ancestors -- grampa, don't you know any?"
43330,Lisa,what happened to mr. murphy?
47847,Lisa,we have to do something about it!
43716,Lisa,"jebediah springfield was... jebediah was... great. i, um, just wanted to say that i've done some research and, uh, he was great."
42815,Lisa,it looks like part of scratchy's arm.
41728,Lisa,you grab a bucket and a brush and clean harder and faster than you ever have before.
50629,Lisa,"hi, guys, what are you doing?"
44845,Lisa,"well... if it would put your mind at ease, i could take a limousine. although that would cost two hundred dollars..."
51377,Lisa,all that's left is bart.
49543,Lisa,old comedy writers who now have to work at our kitchen.
47865,Lisa,"stupid, selfish bart. like he's ever gonna do another nice thing for me..."
47529,Lisa,"no, he lives at the ""cosmic wars ranch"" in northern california."
46463,Lisa,lenny and carl?
43685,Lisa,no baseball bat.
49088,Lisa,"no dad, i want you to play homer simpson."
47928,Lisa,milhouse?! uh! i've been turning him down for the prom since kindergarten.
42224,Lisa,isn't this dangerous?
49259,Lisa,"you stopped being my daddy as soon as you bet against me! all i have now is a mom, which is why i'm taking her maiden name! from now on, i'm..."
46708,Lisa,"you're reading ""gravity's rainbow?"""
45614,Lisa,"what's in the box, mom?"
50868,Lisa,i thought i was the favorite.
42526,Lisa,he's a big tv star.
45234,Lisa,throw your peanuts!
47634,Lisa,my poem has become an elegy. an elegy no one will ever hear.
52008,Lisa,"why don't you watch ""krusty the clown""?"
42615,Lisa,"um... uh, well... uh..."
46923,Lisa,"you read the ""loves his daughter"" by yourself?"
43514,Lisa,like that old woman who couldn't find the beef?
50932,Lisa,"bart! i can't eat bugs anymore. please, please, take my grasshoppers as far away as you can and release them into the wild."
51041,Lisa,do not. that's ridiculous-- it's just-- it's that-- he's-- he's a rebel and only i can change him!
45316,Lisa,"excuse me, uh, pharaoh? i think moses here has something to ask you. go."
46396,Lisa,can we go to bed now?
44367,Lisa,"ech, i'm tired of being an issue, bart. maybe everyone would be better off if i just quit."
42280,Lisa,daad!
48095,Lisa,new pony?
51705,Lisa,gosh... that was a hard sleeping bag to roll up.
42995,Lisa,you were ronnie to his nancy!
49057,Lisa,of course he did. his food is laced with growth hormones.
44274,Lisa,let's all walk laddie.
47020,Lisa,"with you here i can't fail. attention, everyone. i was asked to take a dive. but i won't do it. i-n-t-r-a-n-s-i-g-a-n-c-e."
41799,Lisa,"hello, sir."
51583,Lisa,want some more smoothie?
50321,Lisa,cheech and chong are from springfield?
42073,Lisa,a homemaker! i might as well be dead!
48368,Lisa,what the hell are you talking about?!
45138,Lisa,"because after all, education is the search for truth..."
42746,Lisa,"yeah, dad. how many people have seen the ice caps and the deserts all at once, or the majesty of the northern lights from one hundred miles above?"
43863,Lisa,bye-bye lisa simpson.
41830,Lisa,you give that back. that belongs to me! that's mine!
48944,Lisa,forget it.
47171,Lisa,where do you keep the fish 'til it's done?
42470,Lisa,scratchy is getting a haircut. then itchy -- the barber -- chops scratchy's head off with a razor!
49613,Lisa,"mom, i came here to tell you it's not too late to back out."
50048,Lisa,nelson?!
49439,Lisa,"but mom, you'll miss the eclipse."
50162,Lisa,"mom, is something wrong?"
44107,Lisa,"maestro, if you please."
44898,Lisa,"oh! we can't touch it, dad. it's behind a velvet rope! a velvet rope."
48084,Lisa,"bye, dr. nick."
48502,Lisa,"well, you'd better hurry. i don't think dad can last much longer where he's hiding."
45964,Lisa,but...
49396,Lisa,homer simpson.
51146,Lisa,"all the greats are here -- jellyroll jones, boston cream basie, birthmark billy jackson, grabass walker, the fatneck sisters, and... bleeding gums murphy?!"
51784,Lisa,"he's taking your homer-isms and turning them into his own great ideas! this is the most inspirational moment of my life, but, unfortunately, this is my stop."
45573,Lisa,i'll be in my room.
50178,Lisa,"i have a future! thank you, mom!"
44053,Lisa,"well, i'm really not thinking about that now."
47725,Lisa,"nothing. like many women, i still have an unhealthy obsession with my weight."
49025,Lisa,ballet is unnatural and unfair to women. i shall now cast off the shoes of oppression!
44431,Lisa,"""dear lisa, may your new saxophone bring you years of d'oh!"""
51641,Lisa,"wow, mom! you're gonna open a sandwich store?!"
48222,Lisa,i already made up a yard-sale sign!
44267,Lisa,"and so handsome! bart, i just love him!"
50621,Lisa,"dad, no!"
46801,Lisa,"look, there's dad!"
42667,Lisa,what? who? huh? what?
49242,Lisa,"dad, i could actually win this thing!"
50238,Lisa,can it really be christmas when one of our parents is facing the german army?
52436,Lisa,"unless the next word was burp, you didn't have to."
46967,Lisa,"this isn't ""bart sad."" it's ""bart's ad."""
50481,Lisa,what?! i'm telling mom!
45623,Lisa,but they...
47908,Lisa,they're saying springfielders are stupid hicks.
47721,Lisa,"yeah, a little. those mean girls just get to me."
47580,Lisa,"my theme is ""if music be the food of love."" the setting features tuning forks, champagne flutes and of course, chopsticks. and for dessert, ella fitz jell-o."
47918,Lisa,"well, i don't care what you say, she still loves us more. don't you, snowball?"
49792,Lisa,"well, are you gonna help me or what?"
43971,Lisa,"hey, i think i got a pai gow!"
52113,Lisa,dad is taking this in a less than heroic fashion.
48347,Lisa,yes.
49742,Lisa,"i agree it's cliché, but she does have a certain-- unicorn!"
42931,Lisa,aw.
42507,Lisa,"mom, i need more o.j."
50848,Lisa,but we're here to ask if you have an idea for a couch gag.
49945,Lisa,do you think they'll be okay?
49061,Lisa,he wants to know your name.
51914,Lisa,"i'm not greasing the wheels, dad. i like my teacher."
51778,Lisa,his company perfected electric cars and then gave away the patents! he changed the way hollywood drives!
47571,Lisa,how 'bout the floor is made of lava?
44109,Lisa,bart!
42010,Lisa,"oh dad, you must've bought me every malibu stacey accessory there is."
46890,Lisa,precisely.
52107,Lisa,"everyone knows you're faking it, bart."
47697,Lisa,"i don't want mickey mantle, i want my mom."
48869,Lisa,yes.
47829,Lisa,"the way i was raised, by mom, i learned the truth can't be swept under the rug."
50251,Lisa,"nein auch im winter, wenn es schneit..."
50723,Lisa,gramma!
43161,Lisa,"see, the southern hemisphere is made up of everything below the equa... this line."
41665,Lisa,"they're looking at me! all right, lisa -- time to show these jazz legends how we swing in the suburbs."
42462,Lisa,it's so sad that krusty is ashamed of his roots.
49304,Lisa,how long is that?
46958,Lisa,i'unno. buddha?
44126,Lisa,we've crushed her gentle spirit.
42189,Lisa,sorry.
46699,Lisa,who wants to put on a leotard and get screamed at?
43408,Lisa,"hey, chief wiggum, what are you doing? what's going on?"
47916,Lisa,"hey, that's the smell of her real family! the simpsons! and for your information, our walls have a bunch of dead raccoons in them. but we are saving up the money to find them!"
45664,Lisa,excellent.
44062,Lisa,"mo-om, let's just grab what we can and get out of here. this storm is making people crazy."
42097,Lisa,i know. i know.
51505,Lisa,what you do is horrible: ripping off geniuses who spent years perfecting their styles.
48577,Lisa,after brazil.
47891,Lisa,that's a bread compartment.
46800,Lisa,"dad, you knew this day was coming."
44216,Lisa,b-e-d -- bed!
43360,Lisa,good-bye.
42317,Lisa,daaad!
43734,Lisa,the judge says it's okay as long as you pay mr. lampwick royalties.
47391,Lisa,we're not paramedics!
46298,Lisa,just like me!
50087,Lisa,"what, you can't stand the idea of a girl coaching a boys' baseball team?"
49442,Lisa,dad! come in the kitchen! quick!
42646,Lisa,mommm!
48175,Lisa,milhouse! just what is going on?
46128,Lisa,oedipus killed his father and married his mother.
44403,Lisa,"what a magical city! can we come back next year, dad?"
42647,Lisa,i just had a bad dream.
46482,Lisa,no!
43590,Lisa,don't you see? that would be taking the easy way out --
47106,Lisa,"""nancy drew let out a low whistle. 'this isn't an old windmill at all. it's a new windmill!'"" no dad, i'm sure she won't be killed."
44818,Lisa,"uh, what a terrible waste!"
47540,Lisa,"dad, i still have a couple-a questions about this. mom never drives drunk, and the crash was in your car. also, the driver's seat was adjusted for your stomach..."
52325,Lisa,"dad, bart ate a green bean during the blessing."
46154,Lisa,"otto, what are you doing?"
43057,Lisa,"don't worry, i'm wearing my lucky rabbit's head."
45281,Lisa,"yeah, ya know some of that all-natural stuff is really very well --"
46422,Lisa,"mom, i believe you."
47718,Lisa,"this is the perfect test -- if i can have one dab of frosting and then stop, i'll know i've conquered food at last."
48637,Lisa,no you haven't!
52007,Lisa,"hey bart, where you going?"
48015,Lisa,"dad, we love you, but we just don't think the world is coming to an end. yet. a hundred years, global warming... we're goners. but for now, do you think you could lighten up on this ""left below"" stuff?"
44718,Lisa,"hey, angel pie. can you drive me down the libarry? i wanna rent us up some movies."
41973,Lisa,"i don't know, the dolphins."
48525,Lisa,but... i deserve... acknowledgement...
45387,Lisa,"well, most of us."
49626,Lisa,thanks... but i'll pass.
49507,Lisa,"you were born while they were married so legally, no. but in the sense someone calls you one when they're angry, yes."
42601,Lisa,you're the head vampire?
49819,Lisa,"martha, you are the best."
48970,Lisa,...whatever the heck you're doing.
47935,Lisa,"also, gerontological studies have demonstrated that animal companions can slow the inevitable decline of--"
41754,Lisa,"wait, dad, he's smiling."
50699,Lisa,"dad, where are we going? do we have a plan?"
45718,Lisa,that doesn't sound like bees.
49985,Lisa,"so that ""natural selection"" was the origin of this species?"
49497,Lisa,"sorry we missed your special day, grampa. we'll definitely go next year."
50545,Lisa,but why are you working at a dinosaur show? and why did you run away from me? and how did angelica get a new wand after baron mortdeath burned the wandwood forest? and--
49714,Lisa,"and, bart, maybe charlie can't be your little brother, but you'll always be a big brother to me."
43792,Lisa,"mom, dad threw his beer can at the miracle gro guy on tv. can i recycle it?"
50363,Lisa,raymondo's greatest secret!
49284,Lisa,yeah.
51973,Lisa,how?
47398,Lisa,what if they parody it on mad tv?
43983,Lisa,how was what? what?
44600,Lisa,"oh boy! / all right, free money! / wow!"
47177,Lisa,"you know what mom really loves? julienne potatoes. and for dessert, peach crumble."
42522,Lisa,"two wrongs don't make a right, bart."
43855,Lisa,"heyyy, great, a friend... or a companion... ... stuffed animal..."
49762,Lisa,"well, i agree it's not the most pleasant job in the world, but..."
41852,Lisa,our dad... now he belongs to the ages.
51323,Lisa,"listen, we're both eight years old. can't we just play monopoly or something?"
50633,Lisa,i have no friends.
45766,Lisa,"i am proud to honor the players of the negro leagues of rollerball. and as we strive for the desegregation of all deathsports, we cannot help but be inspired by..."
47363,Lisa,oh my god! i just had my most brilliant idea ever!
43139,Lisa,"don't you realize what's happening, bart? your comet is gonna collide with the earth and every living thing in its path will be killed."
45370,Lisa,"yeah, me too."
45595,Lisa,did you see that?
45511,Lisa,"bart, with these powers, we can become superheroes!"
48568,Lisa,"oh, man. now he's even mooching our lunches."
47766,Lisa,...hind the 'fridgerator...
50334,Lisa,"aw, come on, bart, it's fun!"
43761,Lisa,sure i would! i can always learn about owls this summer at bird camp.
49648,Lisa,"dad, no! that's the last book in the world!"
45085,Lisa,"mom, no, wait! we can make a deal!"
50241,Lisa,"mmm-mm, that is some sweet pig meat. but as for christmas trees... i used to love them -- until last year, when i went tree shopping with mom..."
42421,Lisa,how can a hamster write mysteries?
45230,Lisa,"hey, why don't you come to the wild animal park with us?"
47640,Lisa,"perfect. you're our tv critic. ralph, what about you?"
47963,Lisa,"and if i win, i'll be on itchy and scratchy..."
51798,Lisa,"yeah, with that mental patient who thought he was michael jackson."
43940,Lisa,the devil? what devil?
50010,Lisa,do you think that i could be an artist in the city?
50977,Lisa,it's bart.
44123,Lisa,"we'll miss you, shary bobbins."
45525,Lisa,"actually, he's homer simpson. that's bart. i'm lisa..."
45159,Lisa,no he doesn't. trains are regulated by the federal department of transportation. and recent studies have shown that...
45002,Lisa,"homer simpson, welcome to your life!"
44609,Lisa,they're squatting in our house?
47366,Lisa,there's the enemy. give 'em all you got.
52048,Lisa,"can, too."
42920,Lisa,poor ralph.
44580,Lisa,but we would have had each other anyway.
45787,Lisa,no!
46124,Lisa,practicing tennis.
46872,Lisa,i think we might have termites.
48396,Lisa,the sound of the baby must have triggered a primal mnemonic response in mom's brain.
52080,Lisa,"awww, dad."
47351,Lisa,"dad, you don't have to out-do mr. flanders. just remember the spirit of the season."
49579,Lisa,"caitlin, hi! do a reading at your bat mitzvah? a sheynam dank!"
51542,Lisa,"oh, well, you're very wel--"
45681,Lisa,i think godzilla's bigger than superman.
41829,Lisa,hey!!
49975,Lisa,"dad, i'm gonna need some help getting this off."
50886,Lisa,are you playing poker with my college fund?
46215,Lisa,"excellent, now don't mind the squeegee."
49073,Lisa,i am a born filmmaker!
52275,Lisa,"nothing, but you might say yes the ninety-ninth time."
47425,Lisa,"bart, there's spiders in your hair."
50234,Lisa,"oh, i know what you're after. the toy you never got."
42977,Lisa,i hope that flu doesn't affect his performance out there.
44184,Lisa,"yes, he had a brother robot named rod, who was two space-years older than him."
50509,Lisa,"wow! while i was sitting here feeling sorry for myself, bart's invention actually changed someone's life!"
42256,Lisa,"hurry, bart!"
47770,Lisa,spitballs!
52230,Lisa,"dear log, my brother is still missing, and maybe it's my fault because i failed to take his abuse with good humor. i miss him so much already, that i don't know..."
52086,Lisa,"mom, you look so glamorous."
51744,Lisa,now what?
49695,Lisa,"when maggie's nightlight goes out, her onesie becomes a funsie. this announcer has never seen diapers so dapper!"
52273,Lisa,"as usual, the playground has the facts right, but missed the point entirely. sushi is considered quite a delicacy."
42440,Lisa,so we'll march day and night / by the big cooling tower / they have the plant / but we have the power.
47653,Lisa,you can't leave now! we're the only thing stopping mr. burns!
43040,Lisa,"i have to join the team, or i'll get an ""f"" that will haunt me for the rest of my life."
44348,Lisa,look at how disciplined they are. they're just like the terra cotta warriors of xian.
46582,Lisa,plus he'll work for scale.
46398,Lisa,"hunting? dad, no!"
42756,Lisa,they're having a great time and i'm stuck in here.
48005,Lisa,good.
47486,Lisa,"well, i'm sure a lot of great people have started with less."
43576,Lisa,wow! / air show! / cool! /
48752,Lisa,i've got a visual.
51022,Lisa,"well, milhouse, you might get past the bouncer at the jazz club because they're in no position to turn anyone away. but it doesn't matter, 'cause we can't pay for the gas and the cover fee anyway."
47461,Lisa,really?
42586,Lisa,you're probably right. let's just go back...
46139,Lisa,venus simpson? you're replacing me?
46036,Lisa,"oh, dad."
49634,Lisa,"i never said ""kill!"""
41887,Lisa,yaaayyy!!
44997,Lisa,"it's because they are kids. and so are we. c'mon, alex, we've only got nine, maybe ten years tops where we can giggle in church, and chew with our mouths open, and go days without bathing. we'll never have that freedom again."
45765,Lisa,"no, i didn't."
51860,Lisa,"i don't care what that stupid test says, bart. you're a dimwit."
52269,Lisa,"thursday -- meatloaf night. as it was, is now, and ever shall be."
44306,Lisa,"mr. burns, if you want people to do a good job, you can't bully them. you have to show them they're appreciated."
52169,Lisa,whatever doesn't kill me can only make me stronger.
49261,Lisa,"hey, bouvier was jackie kennedy's maiden name."
43449,Lisa,hmmm... pablo neruda said laughter is the language of the soul.
43512,Lisa,hmmmmm.
51187,Lisa,three awesome kids and a life of regret!
44365,Lisa,lisa. you're talking to lisa.
46861,Lisa,"dad, look!"
51064,Lisa,better switch to social studies.
46943,Lisa,"uh, guys? mom just left the basement!"
49111,Lisa,"well, i uh..."
50081,Lisa,"uh, that's it."
48705,Lisa,no.
46891,Lisa,i can't believe you went to the movies with the teacher. what happened to the bart simpson who put the mothballs in the beef stew?
46172,Lisa,"thank you, dad."
48394,Lisa,"i'm lisa, i'm eight years old, and this might sound presumptuous, but -- i'm your favorite."
46250,Lisa,"oh, now come on..."
49434,Lisa,"dad, we've been trapped in the house for days. can't we play outside?"
47371,Lisa,"all right, i'll look."
51114,Lisa,"ooh, a cupcake!"
48923,Lisa,what did i miss? how did it end?
47127,Lisa,"well, i like it here, too. luke has shown me the gentle side of the old west. he's really sophisticated for a thirteen-year-old."
43796,Lisa,why me? yuk! i smell like a sandwich.
41679,Lisa,"mom, chloe just won the peabody award!"
50209,Lisa,thank god your son can't see the way you're behaving.
47559,Lisa,"quiet, grampa. hello... mom?!?!"
50619,Lisa,but he's out of his mind -- he can't run for president!
41895,Lisa,can we sleep with you?
42201,Lisa,nothing.
42273,Lisa,i think it's wonderful. mom and dad side by side at the power plant. you'll be just like marie and pierre curie.
43373,Lisa,it's been going downhill ever since the lake caught fire.
50624,Lisa,"well, it all started a couple of months ago..."
41657,Lisa,these girls are brilliant! i finally found kids i can relate to.
46532,Lisa,these are so easy. it's obviously tom hanks.
44539,Lisa,hardly. anyone could have written that.
49791,Lisa,"i won't give up. i have to know that somewhere in the muck and the mire and the pittsburgh poisoners, this family had a noble spark. and i will find it, even if i have to go back to adam and eve."
51562,Lisa,"dad, i believe we were on a date."
42449,Lisa,so did mine.
42424,Lisa,remarkable.
48291,Lisa,maybe there's another way to solve this. bart is clearly fulfilling an emotional need for toot-toot.
47858,Lisa,"i like eating here with you, dad. especially without ""don't have a cow, man."""
49880,Lisa,"no, the ants are the farmers."
42022,Lisa,"well, i would like to see what all the fuss is about."
48126,Lisa,"sure, why not."
51882,Lisa,"yes, you do!"
42252,Lisa,"dad, we did something very bad."
45509,Lisa,bart!
42624,Lisa,"no! self-improvement can be achieved, but not with a quick-fix. it's a long, arduous journey of personal and spiritual discovery."
50421,Lisa,that's the first thing everyone knows about kyle lobianco!
49207,Lisa,"oh, bart. don't say things you can't take back."
50356,Lisa,from the great raymondo.
50638,Lisa,"no, that is not true! i--"
43741,Lisa,bart! look at this!
43680,Lisa,"aw, thanks, dad."
51346,Lisa,"but what liberal really means, is someone who believes that those who have more than enough should share a little with those who don't."
48040,Lisa,everyone should be able to choose their faith -- just like i chose buddhism.
43494,Lisa,"but why, apu?"
44714,Lisa,all right! sounds good!
50711,Lisa,wait! maybe paula paul left a message.
51856,Lisa,id. triple word score.
50189,Lisa,i see what happened. there was no scholarship. they said i could attend if you did all their laundry. i can't live with that knowledge while trying to get more knowledge.
44114,Lisa,grim--
50383,Lisa,"i guess it's up to me to save you, cregg demon magic freek."
49675,Lisa,what else ya got?
45176,Lisa,"fine. we'll play ""hippo in the house."""
48240,Lisa,say it again!
48914,Lisa,maybe you whaaa--?
46063,Lisa,"yes, the island."
47095,Lisa,i wonder what mom came up with for this week's 'family wednesday.'
48978,Lisa,where is this music coming from?
49012,Lisa,"no, stop buying me leg warmers! i'm already wearing six pairs!"
52171,Lisa,the pennyloafer!
49876,Lisa,"dad, are you okay?"
50910,Lisa,what? you did?
42797,Lisa,how do you know? there weren't any witnesses.
49778,Lisa,just take 'em.
46759,Lisa,maybe we should look for clues.
46291,Lisa,what's happening? where am i?
46039,Lisa,he doesn't want your dirty money.
45986,Lisa,"oh, the earth is the best. that's why i'm a vegetarian."
51241,Lisa,"are you really, really sure?"
50979,Lisa,this is the most selfish thing you've ever done!
43873,Lisa,only kids are that incoherent!
52190,Lisa,become like an uncarved stone.
41893,Lisa,morning.
43053,Lisa,get out! get out!
48909,Lisa,ow!
44234,Lisa,"well, i guess i don't have a choice..."
46074,Lisa,is that a long island iced tea?
42124,Lisa,i could've been the flower girl. and i wouldn't keep falling down either.
41763,Lisa,"oh, thank you."
49226,Lisa,"fruit loops? that's the answer to thirty-eight down: ""toucan's delight!"""
45449,Lisa,now can we do something japanese?
47988,Lisa,dad... you're fired.
49241,Lisa,i win!
43690,Lisa,"i'd like 25 copies on goldenrod, 25 on canary, 25 on saffron, and 25 on paella."
46557,Lisa,"no, i belong here! pleeeaaase!"
42658,Lisa,"we are insured, aren't we, mom?"
43220,Lisa,i love these new planes.
43194,Lisa,"mr. gumbel, this is a girl scout meeting."
51452,Lisa,you already ate all the chocolate bars.
49611,Lisa,"just follow the ""dies,"" mom."
52199,Lisa,dad!
49474,Lisa,"look -- there's writing on the ""r!"""
48421,Lisa,"i just don't think religion should be taught in our schools, any more than you'd want scientists teaching at the church."
49513,Lisa,sideshow bob! drop that knife and give back our dad!
45478,Lisa,"dad, it's great that you volunteered to drive -- but how did you get out of work?"
48941,Lisa,"hey martin, what are you doing?"
49194,Lisa,"okay, listen, you. i don't know who you are or what you've done with the real bart. but... god help me, i want him back."
51244,Lisa,"i feel your pain, brother."
43473,Lisa,"ah, excuse me? isn't there anything here that doesn't have meat in it?"
43045,Lisa,"lay off, guys. he's with me."
51257,Lisa,i guess i'll be getting some extra credit for this.
44323,Lisa,it's the longest possible time before more church.
46439,Lisa,mr. smithers' father!
43147,Lisa,it's breaking up!
42831,Lisa,"ah, face it, bart. our salvation isn't just gonna roll by on the back of some stupid truck."
44583,Lisa,he's dreamy.
41682,Lisa,"diphthongs, cognates, latin roots / lisa clobbers all you fruits!"
46142,Lisa,i can't believe krusty's retiring. this is tragic!
50750,Lisa,"from egg to baby to grownup, we can see them living their entire penguin lives from up here!"
48300,Lisa,this is an abc sweatshirt.
49446,Lisa,can't get enough.
44466,Lisa,and so is the bible!
49461,Lisa,"hmm, what if i read every other word? ""one more time, you're hopeless. try again, numb skull."" that's not very nice -- i will try again, but not because the wall told me to. ""turn around. seek springfield's biggest man-made ring."""
43714,Lisa,"people of springfield, i, uh, i don't know quite how to say this..."
46297,Lisa,what do your friends call you?
48204,Lisa,"oh, bart, why'd you ask him a follow-up question?"
41708,Lisa,baboon!
46193,Lisa,"milhouse? she got you, too?"
45947,Lisa,"that says ""corn,"" bart."
45253,Lisa,"it guarantees all of the basic freedoms -- speech, religion, the right to a speedy trial..."
42860,Lisa,fine. i'll play outside.
42386,Lisa,"tickets to the krusty anniversary show! oh, he must want me to go with him."
50513,Lisa,this is the funnest game ever!
48094,Lisa,"bye, guys. you really helped me a lot."
42772,Lisa,"i'll bet it's because of that horrible ivory dealer, dad."
46672,Lisa,a lot of people think our dad's behavior has screwed us up. and it has!
45757,Lisa,what are you doing here?
51737,Lisa,"dad, i don't know about this. it's not on the park map."
49476,Lisa,great...
51032,Lisa,"hmm, you're right. it is the golden age of well-written, brilliantly-acted tv shows."
51044,Lisa,"please let it be someone smart, motivated, and who won't just teach us corporate-sponsored lessons."
47860,Lisa,"mom, i don't mean to be mean. but every time i think about forgiving him, i remember all the bad things he's done to me."
49718,Lisa,i wanna do that!
47656,Lisa,"bart, you're staying!"

48835,Lisa,ice cream! ice cream! / dad's the best!
47436,Lisa,mmm-hmm... i think i'll go to bed now.
51318,Lisa,you voted for reagan?!
44952,Lisa,"hm, don't give it a second thought. i didn't."
50183,Lisa,"well, i am so happy to be in your class."
45462,Lisa,"principal skinner, what would you say is the most important firefighting tool? would you say it's prevention?"
50876,Lisa,i guess.
42536,Lisa,"wow, look at all this be sharps merchandise! lunch boxes, coffee mugs, funny foam..."
44474,Lisa,that's right. a girl wants to play football. how about that?
44608,Lisa,and how. / heck yeah. / yes they are. / you betcha.
47538,Lisa,did you guys get home at two last night?
45535,Lisa,i'll weed the floor.
52156,Lisa,"oooo, a political discussion at our table. i feel like a kennedy."
50533,Lisa,food dad! food dad! food dad!
47686,Lisa,emanations!
46950,Lisa,"dad, it's so enlightened of you to take us to a wnba game."
52104,Lisa,"is there a reward? if she's convicted, we get t-shirts."
44064,Lisa,you've got to start backwards! / orange to orange! ignore the reds! / alternate corners! /
50709,Lisa,these'll go great with betel nut butter!
47046,Lisa,we've gotta do something to help him.
49961,Lisa,everyone was mean to sally. she was too well-rounded. she felt cornered. they wouldn't let her play four-square or invite her to the box social.
49573,Lisa,hi.
41681,Lisa,that's assault! that is assault.
52437,Lisa,"oh, you'll never go broke appealing to the lowest common denominator."
50879,Lisa,cursive writing. i'm learning cursive. all these sentences have every letter of the alphabet in them.
46186,Lisa,my name's lisa. what's yours?
43175,Lisa,"well, that's what happens when you introduce foreign species into an ecosystem that can't handle them."
49509,Lisa,that's the angry one.
51815,Lisa,rubik's cube!
43376,Lisa,"no, mom! bart and some kids ran off to wage war on shelbyville."
49996,Lisa,"why aren't i going to oslo? the nobel prizes are my freakin' thing! but no -- bart gets everything because he's the oldest and he's a boy. and maggie gets what's ever left over because she's the youngest and she's a baby. meanwhile, i'll just stand and wave to people going to better places."
49881,Lisa,"nothing! look, do you want to do it or not?"
50861,Lisa,"stop! this is a black hole, not a lawn and leaf bag! if one more thing gets in there it could reach critical mass!"
51070,Lisa,but why would my teacher be a bully?
46409,Lisa,i love chinatown... although i wish they'd stop picking on tibet town.
45048,Lisa,of course... the transplant! somehow snake's hair must be controlling--
46734,Lisa,well...
51091,Lisa,but could bart have gotten those eggs?
51739,Lisa,are we there yet? are we there yet?
47569,Lisa,busted!
45668,Lisa,he told us he'd been going to the gym.
43064,Lisa,"no,me!takeme!me!me!me!"
50091,Lisa,"look, if you want to play liability-insured baseball, i'm your only shot."
47574,Lisa,i know. my new thing is to ignore you.
43772,Lisa,okay... why don't you...
42596,Lisa,you must drive this stake right through his heart.
47186,Lisa,"because i know every time you say ""pick a number from one to ten,"" it's always seven."
45643,Lisa,you said that four days ago.
42634,Lisa,"dad, i'm not gonna fall for that."
48168,Lisa,thank you. i've been studying. i even made flash cards!
47579,Lisa,these giant vegetables are amazing.
46914,Lisa,"is that miles davis' ""birth of the cool?"""
48753,Lisa,i already read it.
43502,Lisa,"when will all those fools learn that you can be perfectly healthy simply eating vegetables, fruits, grains, and cheese?"
46284,Lisa,just come on.
46213,Lisa,"come on, people! move it! i want to see some sweat!"
41720,Lisa,half a gallon of chocolate brownie fudge.
43520,Lisa,"oh my god! bart, groundskeeper willie was in my nightmare, too! but he got me with hedge-clippers!"
49393,Lisa,vance connor...
48892,Lisa,he wanted to be captured at the restaurant!
47507,Lisa,both of us heard mysterious noises coming from this very spot.
46252,Lisa,i don't care. i hate them.
52393,Lisa,me too.
48822,Lisa,"click that one, mom. / no, go up! / keep going, up, up, up! / the blue ones are ads! / that's the toolbar! / now you've opened ""word!"" close it. / close it, don't save it! / stop clicking! / don't go there! / why are you buying a freezer?!"
50993,Lisa,another surfer?
43185,Lisa,this is horrible. people will start to avoid springfield.
45220,Lisa,"oh, how romantic!"
50590,Lisa,don't you want to be able to read the things people carve into your chest in prison?
44454,Lisa,"can we go, dad? / please dad? / please, please, please? / can we go, huh, huh please? /"
45056,Lisa,"we're done for, bart!"
47364,Lisa,you don't even know what the idea is.
42366,Lisa,i made it!
44682,Lisa,professor provolone's picto-puzzle.
47554,Lisa,"no it doesn't! this movie is drivel! she's wooden and unpleasant, and no matter what he does, he's still ryan o'neal."
43607,Lisa,hmm. that looks entertaining.
49884,Lisa,"hey, they're not eating."
44012,Lisa,"oh, you've got to see this, it's so cute what she does. be the baby, kitty. go on, be the baby."
51599,Lisa,"great! but from now on, we have to be totally honest with each other."
48901,Lisa,why would your family pay all that extra money for the comfort of a dead man?
51373,Lisa,"um, when a woman talks, she just wants to be heard."
42812,Lisa,tough kids...
48938,Lisa,you wrote a report on it last week!
43172,Lisa,what?!
46299,Lisa,"oh my god, it's 11:15!"
50864,Lisa,why is this happening to us?
48428,Lisa,i'm not afraid of you.
44370,Lisa,will you stop looking at your feet?!
41833,Lisa,"yeah, just keep laughing, it only makes him madder. come on, bart, start them off with the touch of death and go from there."
49021,Lisa,i can't -- i promised i wouldn't.
49078,Lisa,they sound great... i'd love to read them sometime.
50096,Lisa,we're brother and sister.
51611,Lisa,fourth of july fireworks were a different story. they meant more to my dad than my mom could ever know.
47220,Lisa,"oh, definitely. if you ask me, she's far less dangerous than bart."
47947,Lisa,i think he's having a heart attack!
46097,Lisa,i always dreamed you'd be my library buddy.
42360,Lisa,midnight?
43386,Lisa,everyone in springfield had a reason to shoot mr. burns. even us.
45747,Lisa,i don't know if i'll be able to accept moe as dr. tad winslow.
50453,Lisa,that's us. do you think you could reproduce the key in this photo?
43008,Lisa,"bart, does it strike you as odd that uter disappeared and suddenly they're serving us this mysterious food called uterbräten?"
42354,Lisa,can't talk. comin' down.
50610,Lisa,"dad, you out-talked the talking heads!"
41709,Lisa,no!
45429,Lisa,bart! the internet is more than a global pornography network. it's a...
52181,Lisa,our journey begins here at the library.
44748,Lisa,wowww!
47809,Lisa,are you sure mom and dad want us to enter a european balloon race?
52329,Lisa,is too.
42786,Lisa,"yeah, me too. that midget taught me a lot about his native estonia."
47717,Lisa,"now, i can't have toothpaste tonight."
47114,Lisa,"hava-nice christmas, hava-nice christmas, hava-nice christmas...non-christian friend..."
44966,Lisa,stop saying hello!
42963,Lisa,just keep taking pictures.
48649,Lisa,"well it's nice to see you again, krusty, but these kids have field trip journals to write!"
48839,Lisa,can i weld that?
52519,Lisa,butt out.
45194,Lisa,"um, dad..."
49643,Lisa,why would willie do that?
45707,Lisa,"i'm writing a letter to president clinton about that travesty of a band contest. as a fellow sax player, i'm sure he'll be outraged."
48604,Lisa,"but it didn't bring your parents back. tell me, big boy, was it really worth it?"
47874,Lisa,gimme that torch.
44549,Lisa,"when i had to learn about the magna carta, i made up a song. ""in 1215 at runnymede!/ doo dah, doo dah/ the nobles and the king agreed!/ oh, d-doo dah day..."""

43911,Lisa,what's up there? / is it a monster? / we have to know! / what's the secret?
48860,Lisa,i got dolphin.
51193,Lisa,point taken.
47393,Lisa,"i'm proud of you, mom. but just one thing: isn't your book a little hard on dad?"
50302,Lisa,"that doesn't seem fair -- they won't let him escape, then they kick him out. i wonder where he'll go."
43553,Lisa,"hey, my dad may have gained a little weight, but he's not some kind of food-crazed maniac."
46344,Lisa,excuse me...
45350,Lisa,yep!
45424,Lisa,even you?
49553,Lisa,confirm.
41914,Lisa,"wait, dad, i've got something for you."
47494,Lisa,"maggie, push the red button!"
43188,Lisa,ewww.
48825,Lisa,"they come to your home to help you raise independent, self-actualized children. the counselors can come day and night because they have no families themselves."
42987,Lisa,"look! prudence goodwyfe, died 1641. she voted for bob, too! so did buddy holly, richie valens, and the big bopper!"
43382,Lisa,"dad, how can you work for a man like mr. burns?"
50301,Lisa,"these flowers saved me from a terrible fate -- not getting an ""a"" on my next science project!"
42324,Lisa,"no, mom, it's very reassuring. and i've learned a great deal from this cow's heart i got at the butcher shop."
47912,Lisa,we're not overfeeding her. we've been giving her this low-fat cat food!
46775,Lisa,"sure. the point is, let's stop the madness and ban guns now!"
47915,Lisa,this is worse than when we thought mom was having an affair. it turned out she was just going to the library to cry.
46727,Lisa,"lisa simpson, master of the double life."
48853,Lisa,"oh, milhouse! you're very brave."
45480,Lisa,"wow, a bustling metropolitan newsroom, funnelling scoops from all over the globe."
41889,Lisa,i had a bad dream. could i sleep in your bed?
51870,Lisa,look what i found.
47076,Lisa,we've got to do something. i know --maybe we can get people to sign a petition.
48831,Lisa,just dance.
49599,Lisa,...and doc...tor hibbert.
43143,Lisa,it blew up the bridge!
52068,Lisa,"no, why?"
49946,Lisa,hey!
46181,Lisa,"but mom, the school's right here."
45208,Lisa,unplugged.
45497,Lisa,i'm reviewing the festival for our school paper.
50077,Lisa,there's a car in the parking lot with a yale sticker on it! it's gotta be you.
48781,Lisa,"you're going to the dentist too, dad."
42757,Lisa,we won't.
51186,Lisa,happy anniversary!
49662,Lisa,why did i do poetry club instead of girl scouts? why did i do poetry club instead of girl scouts?
45611,Lisa,"no, bart, he's right. i did oversimplify."
51941,Lisa,"oh, dad..."
44789,Lisa,that's kids news. good night.
43732,Lisa,so it's true. some cartoons do encourage violence.
48575,Lisa,ta-da!
48218,Lisa,so... what setting is that fan on?
45736,Lisa,ewwww.
46888,Lisa,dad! i figured it out! the murderer is...
43177,Lisa,"you're certainly in a good mood tonight, dad."
43067,Lisa,i'm coming!
42582,Lisa,"ah, there's something fishy about this whole setup."
51581,Lisa,"at the risk of sounding like a broken record, yes, yes, yes!"
46836,Lisa,hey!
50756,Lisa,"nelson, don't you want my lunch money?"
49813,Lisa,"well i am reading it, and when i'm finished, i'm going to use eliza's diary for my ""black history month"" presentation!"
41879,Lisa,"oh yeah, three bad nightmares."
44878,Lisa,dad!
43808,Lisa,"uh, grampa, maybe i should moisten your washcloth..."
43464,Lisa,what's the difference between this lamb and the one that kissed me?
45321,Lisa,"eh, slave labor. you get what you pay for."
51681,Lisa,a little lazy if you ask me.
49516,Lisa,we know it was you selma bouvier.
46481,Lisa,awww...
44456,Lisa,somebody's gotta stop them!
42181,Lisa,kowalski!
50318,Lisa,it happened to the scorpions too! the flower essence must have the side effect of lubricating the eye sockets to the point of popping.
45285,Lisa,i just wish you could keep an open mind about other cultures.
51246,Lisa,i won the science fair! i get to go to chicago!
47693,Lisa,"congratulations, mom. you seem to have a prescription for success."
48968,Lisa,i can't live with the guilt. i'm going to martin's house... to end it all!
49030,Lisa,"the money helps us serve the community! we plant trees, pick up litter, cut up milk bones for old dogs..."
43791,Lisa,"no! don't use your real name, or bart will know!"
46296,Lisa,as in monk?
46933,Lisa,i don't wanna eat from the trash.
42952,Lisa,cool! / neat-o!
52192,Lisa,"well, it's very frustrating."
44185,Lisa,"okay, chief. enjoy bob saget!"
47737,Lisa,"chloe, you've lived so many fascinating places."
42854,Lisa,"bart, i'm here for you but, i'm not gonna break into somebody's house."
50316,Lisa,"oh, i ain't mad, and i never will be again -- thanks to your wonderful, wonderful..."
51315,Lisa,"yes, why?"
43845,Lisa,no.
47813,Lisa,wait a second - i've read that you speak excellent english.
50556,Lisa,why is bach next to muddy waters? that's my problem -- i gotta get these cds organized!
51504,Lisa,you're a... forger?
47125,Lisa,"thanks for making me feel better about this place, luke."
47069,Lisa,"oh dad, look at this one!"
48439,Lisa,where did you get that?
41991,Lisa,"okay, dad."
45136,Lisa,i guess i don't have much choice.
41742,Lisa,"ah ha, now you look pathetic."
45540,Lisa,something's growing.
45185,Lisa,"hey, look what i found. grampa's old radio. oh, wouldn't it be grand to gather 'round and have a listen?"
45091,Lisa,what? nunchuks? those aren't even australian.
50902,Lisa,what? he didn't fold? but that's insane unless he has...
51363,Lisa,"good one, ding dong!"
51148,Lisa,"it's a hologram?! well, maybe if it's in good taste..."
50026,Lisa,how do you cope?
45289,Lisa,how am i supposed to hallucinate with all these swirling colors distracting me?
50085,Lisa,anything that's the something of the something isn't really the anything of anything!
52268,Lisa,i think this is all a charade to make bart look more injured than he really is.
43904,Lisa,this is the most thoughtful thing anybody ever --
42793,Lisa,"they're not ""imprisoning us,"" bart. they're..."
50036,Lisa,"what i don't get is, why all the lies?"
42371,Lisa,happy valentine's.
48772,Lisa,"dad, that's a bomb!"
43516,Lisa,"hey, springfield! are you suffering from the heartbreak of monsteritis? then take a tip from mr. paul anka..."
51344,Lisa,"what am i doing? untent! untent! oh bart, i want to win, but not like this. i'm sorry. you're fired!"
44610,Lisa,"bart, you're brushing your teeth with my twig."
46433,Lisa,"hey, there's mesmerino."
45639,Lisa,here you go.
43922,Lisa,ow!
45837,Lisa,what should i do?
42205,Lisa,no.
52201,Lisa,eighth hole.
45069,Lisa,"step on it, mom. dad's signaling that he wants to go higher."
49893,Lisa,you're not going anywhere near annie.
46649,Lisa,how to loot brazil?
51803,Lisa,should we hug?
52159,Lisa,"yes, sir. a very inane one. mr. burns, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. why are you so popular?"
42395,Lisa,eiw.
50908,Lisa,"well, back to square one is a major victory in this house, but why did you help me?"
43132,Lisa,"well, you've been in my room for about four hours now."
45652,Lisa,will you guys turn that thing down?
42700,Lisa,"i'm warning you, mom -- i may get a little crazy."
43707,Lisa,the missing piece of the puzzle... i've got it!
48896,Lisa,...so when bob collapsed in the courtroom...
46885,Lisa,sideshow bob!
44013,Lisa,c'mon!
46965,Lisa,bart sad.
42967,Lisa,"i don't like him either mom, but i'm doing a report on local politics for my school project."
41974,Lisa,"look, dad. i made a modest studio apartment for my malibu stacey doll. this is the kitchen, this is where she prints her weekly feminist newsletter..."
44135,Lisa,me! / i would! /
49525,Lisa,it just gets worse and worse.
50060,Lisa,he is. he's paying people eleven dollars an hour to work for him.
44573,Lisa,and after we spent all the townspeople's money.
48273,Lisa,let's see... it's like when you watch old home movies of you watching tv.
49870,Lisa,schnell! schnell!
46141,Lisa,"the answer is ""bonbon""!"
42866,Lisa,"no. i just like to smell my lunch... gee, i never met anyone who skipped a grade before."
50827,Lisa,"and the best thing is, even if they weren't waving, it would be okay."
42356,Lisa,i did.
45310,Lisa,"dad's got it on the speed dial under ""fire."""
41737,Lisa,too bad we didn't come dressed as popular cartoon characters.
50069,Lisa,i used grampa's money to try to help someone in need. but it didn't go the way i expected.
43501,Lisa,ewwww.
49556,Lisa,not if you use a dimmer switch.
52161,Lisa,"but mom, we've become the tools of evil."
49378,Lisa,isn't that a little clichéd?
45361,Lisa,"bart, are you crazy? you've got to get the old folks home to the old folks home."
44520,Lisa,wow... so lifelike.
43754,Lisa,maybe we can make your job more fun... what are those?
46366,Lisa,"bart, you're getting vomit on my prince. head zeppelin!"
49125,Lisa,"wow, dad was so cute as a baby."
47543,Lisa,why would bart escape if he's gonna be released in two weeks?
43559,Lisa,"me, too!"
48051,Lisa,no. i mean ketchup.
46167,Lisa,"okay, we have our choice of rectangle land, cube country or squaresville."
50305,Lisa,that's him!
46671,Lisa,"but seriously, we've had a lot of fun with our dad over the years."
42361,Lisa,uh - huh.
51393,Lisa,"no, about christmas. so i went out this morning and i got you this."
42956,Lisa,who are all these characters?
46661,Lisa,"mom, my potato is eating a carrot!"
46319,Lisa,i thought you didn't like her.
48259,Lisa,this chamber's not on the map! we could be stuck in here forever if we don't find a way out!
44736,Lisa,"beauty is all around us, and not just in pageants and parlors. you can find it in the swirl of galaxies or the swirl in the center of a sunflower..."
49104,Lisa,i can't believe what i've done -- maybe deep down i always knew how much this film would hurt them. maybe i'm the monster this movie exposed.
45413,Lisa,"well, there's no one more learned than us..."
52347,Lisa,the cat is named scratchy.
51701,Lisa,parking lot.
41913,Lisa,"father, you've made me the happiest girl who ever lived."
43010,Lisa,okay.
42530,Lisa,krusty! what have you done to yourself?
46207,Lisa,how did she know i was there?
51714,Lisa,"uh, well to truly master an instrument you'll need years of--"
52372,Lisa,"i've suffered as much as anyone at the paws of this dog. but when i look into his vacant brown eyes, i just can't bear to let him go. i'm sure mom agrees with me."
48867,Lisa,"mom, every workout appointment is booked up for months! we'll have to open a second shapes. we just need to find a vacant rental property. hmm..."
50228,Lisa,this is where we're ditching the dog?
50683,Lisa,"if we stop now, we'll never make it there by sunset."
47259,Lisa,okay.
49751,Lisa,maybe i should go out and get you guys a converter.
52124,Lisa,quit throwing your garbage into our dimension.
42843,Lisa,"uh, bart...?"
43738,Lisa,okay.
47075,Lisa,hey.
48651,Lisa,"dad, those kids aren't dumb. this show just perpetuates the stereotype that all yokels are hicks!"
47794,Lisa,"""the plywood pelican was larger than a football field. it weighs more than the state of new hampshire. it was only flown once, by its creator, mr. c. montgomery burns."""
48448,Lisa,yes...
51891,Lisa,good. commence shovelling.
42053,Lisa,is it terri?
43183,Lisa,that spikey-haired masked dancer is really something. i wonder who he is.
46165,Lisa,meh.
47120,Lisa,i'm sick of this horse slapping and cow taunting! i'm going to my room!
45917,Lisa,"it really says ""die""? that sounds unusually specific for a horoscope."
50448,Lisa,you're just pressing a mento.
50176,Lisa,"mom, dad! please, can i go here? i'll study so hard i'll make the old me look like bart."
49071,Lisa,i can start working on my school video project. the assignment is to film the beauty of the everyday. so let's see...
50382,Lisa,he's going to die!
48108,Lisa,"bart, that would be the stupidest thing you ever did."
46804,Lisa,networks love reality shows because they don't have to pay writers or actors.
47500,Lisa,"i don't care what they say, maggie. to me you're brilliant."
44376,Lisa,bees. bees.
52344,Lisa,pony ride! boat ride! pony ride! boat ride!
46019,Lisa,"dad, i'm not dead!"
42127,Lisa,i'se just jammin' with you.
52112,Lisa,okay.
41632,Lisa,poor predictable bart. always takes rock.
43668,Lisa,wow!
44903,Lisa,"thanks for making me take such a stupid risk, dad."
44671,Lisa,he said there's no shame in their forbidden love.
42318,Lisa,operation? what are you talking about?
48023,Lisa,"hey, i won four free movie tickets! and it starts in half an hour!"

49766,Lisa,thank you!
41790,Lisa,bart! there's no such thing as first bedsies. you just made that up.

42528,Lisa,"miss midler, i can't believe you do this all by yourself."
43537,Lisa,i must protest. you're abusing a program intended to help the unfortunate.
42209,Lisa,fathers have to say that stuff.
45217,Lisa,that's not a fairy tale. it's just something that happened to you at moe's.
49926,Lisa,"goodbye, bluella! send me a post card from tierra del fuego!"

42283,Lisa,"bart, are you taking a bath?"
47089,Lisa,"you can't have lights without power, and all the power comes from here."
43452,Lisa,"that's creepy, bart. i think you really did lose your soul."
44663,Lisa,"look, he's licking the slime off that rock! that's what he's been eating -- slime! and there's enough slime for all of us! we're saved!"
43783,Lisa,"but bart, that'll cost a fortune."

45779,Lisa,"goodnight, america."
41786,Lisa,hmm...
52196,Lisa,"but bart, how can a sound exist if there's no one there to hear it?"
52225,Lisa,"mom, i poured my heart into that centerpiece! things like that always happen in this family!"
43876,Lisa,"okay, okay, okay... not your fault, it's a bird thing. you don't control the birds -- you will someday, but not now."
46495,Lisa,"we've got star wars monopoly, rasta-mon-opoly, galip-olopoly... edna krabappoly..."
45042,Lisa,"whoaaa, daaad!"
45079,Lisa,and the soles of your feet are jet black.
47091,Lisa,"now we merely push this switch to ""overload."" yet once we do, we'll be breaking the law. can good truly come from civil disobedience? gandhi thought so..."
51496,Lisa,"hey, look... there's a signature that the frame covered up: ""johan oldenveldt."""
50292,Lisa,"many great directors, like wes anderson, frank tashlin, and tim burton started with short films."

50655,Lisa,"i know it's awful and insular, and caused thirty-five deaths, but i had friends! four digits of friends! i had a friend in common with malcolm gladwell!"
48761,Lisa,jimbo drew a couple of pictures of his house in second grade. but i can't vouch for their accuracy -- the teacher gave him a frowny-face.

43968,Lisa,he tried to kill our puppies.
42555,Lisa,"dad, don't let these application essays throw you. let's see... ""list your three favorite books and how they've influenced your life."""
43219,Lisa,when will the world learn?
51679,Lisa,probably just another piece of america's space junk falling out of orbit.
46530,Lisa,"ooh, a salute to brunch! wave to brunch, maggie!"
42063,Lisa,"wow, dad."
41982,Lisa,whoo-hoo!

49935,Lisa,"they must be bluella's children! hello, whale calves! your mother lives on through you!"
46332,Lisa,i've never seen the baby get tired of it before the adult.
45199,Lisa,"oh, those poor, helpless cows."
43429,Lisa,that was a baby tooth... it was loose...
42549,Lisa,hello moe?
45008,Lisa,okay. umm... automatic...
50466,Lisa,that's not a real arm -- it's plastic!

49789,Lisa,they're all horrible!
42878,Lisa,i won first chair?
47862,Lisa,"yes, but he thought that was a bad thing."
44652,Lisa,object-objection! he's not asking any questions!
48714,Lisa,"he died, bart. dad buried him in the back yard. but not in that order."
44019,Lisa,touché.
47512,Lisa,bones!
42605,Lisa,"have a blast, mom!"
43753,Lisa,why are there so many burnt-out ones?
43450,Lisa,i think we should do a test.
51776,Lisa,"or, maybe we can nurse him back to health and set him free in the wild."
48920,Lisa,we're in every kind of therapy!
52061,Lisa,"if cartoons were meant for adults, they'd put them on in prime time."
45981,Lisa,i'd like to visit a prisoner.
48865,Lisa,"i really identified with the girls in ""ghost world."" they made me feel like i wasn't so alone."
51963,Lisa,that was beautiful. what's it called?
51642,Lisa,what's wrong?
46973,Lisa,"oh, i'm gonna miss you."
50283,Lisa,"you can't listen to those women, mom. change threatens them. they didn't like it when the springfield shopper started printing in color."
49529,Lisa,"oh, go ahead -- numb me."
42270,Lisa,up-up-up. when i'm done.
42080,Lisa,what's so good about it....
48767,Lisa,"i am. you're on a bluetooth cell phone, the most vulnerable device known to man."
41946,Lisa,i made a new bar of soap by squeezing all our little soap slivers together.
46380,Lisa,"do you think it's fair that you're always getting into trouble, yet mom and dad are being punished?"
47493,Lisa,"maggie, i'm sorry i was jealous of your special gift. from now on i'm gonna nurture and cherish--"
44010,Lisa,i don't know why i like you. i just do. so... what do you think?
47077,Lisa,i'm collecting signatures to bring back the night sky.
47308,Lisa,i picked mom a bouquet of erigeron
43959,Lisa,"oh, little chipmunk friend. i'm allergic to everything!"
44461,Lisa,no...
46331,Lisa,and i've got a rally for take back the afternoon.
47059,Lisa,"hey, you can't blame principal skinner for wanting to feature his best student."
50413,Lisa,cool! / awesome!
50395,Lisa,a truffle is a fungus that grows in tree roots. it's one of the most prized gourmet foods in the world.
47205,Lisa,"sir, your son has brought you into the twenty-first century. it's a lot like the twentieth, except everybody's afraid and the stock market is much lower."
44591,Lisa,you turn it on. i turned it on yesterday.
48284,Lisa,i wanna go to the showbiz animal retirement home.
51557,Lisa,just the two of us?
51900,Lisa,i guess i'd have needed a partial scholarship.
48706,Lisa,"dad, i can't forgive you because there's nothing to forgive."
52102,Lisa,"okay, but you have to untie me first."
48868,Lisa,"dad, are you okay? i see food on your plate instead of blurring motions."
50949,Lisa,at the art walk we walked into a gallery and it was just a guy crying -- that was the art!
42208,Lisa,i'm an ugmo.
49126,Lisa,"grandma, i accept your gift."
49969,Lisa,you aren't being persuaded by the content of my argument -- you're being convinced by the color of my hair!
44460,Lisa,dad! the 2nd amendment is just a remnant from revolutionary days. it has no meaning today.
45948,Lisa,"here we are. ""in a pinch, badgers have even been known to eat woodpeckers."""
48305,Lisa,"and i'm required to say ""come to the cool ranch and rope in flavor. yee ha."""
46642,Lisa,"okay, here's some travel tips: only drink bottled water... don't get into an unlicensed taxi... and remember, they have winter during our summer."
52105,Lisa,"he doesn't care, mom."
47318,Lisa,"i don't care if they think you're a coward, dad. you did the right thing, hiding and crying."
43774,Lisa,da-ad!
48331,Lisa,and i will make thee a hat from construction paper!
43666,Lisa,"hi, i'm lisa simpson. i'm here to research a report on jebediah."

46677,Lisa,"groundskeeper willie, groundskeeper willie's enemy seamus..."
51184,Lisa,"happy anniversary, mom!"
41908,Lisa,no. i didn't.
48643,Lisa,hm... maybe the best way to begin your education is to get you some exposure to the wider world. so i'm gonna take you to downtown springfield!
52439,Lisa,"places where my intelligence will be an asset, not a liability?"
50164,Lisa,it's plenty good! it's great! it's just... not for me.
52508,Lisa,you finally reached emotional maturity. unlike bart.
52226,Lisa,i saw the best meals of my generation destroyed by the madness of my brother / my soul carved in slices by spikey-haired demons...
48673,Lisa,"it's so hard to choose just one item worthy of the safe. so i made this elaborate decision tree, which in itself is worthy of preservation."
43964,Lisa,what are you talking about?
45304,Lisa,"wow, dad and bart have been everywhere! they've eaten submarine sandwiches, grinders, and hoagies."
51712,Lisa,(impressed noise

48683,Lisa,no! should i attach it for you?
42804,Lisa,"well bart, because of you, a horrible, yet innocent person is going to jail."
48998,Lisa,well... she danced into her seventies.
43633,Lisa,"mom, do you want to know the fifteen reasons i like horses better than cars? one: a horse never--"
45021,Lisa,"hang in there, dad! just half a basket left!"
51944,Lisa,"i'm wailing out for the homeless family living out of its car. the iowa farmer whose land has been taken away by unfeeling bureaucrats. the west virginia coal miner, coughing up his..."
46895,Lisa,"ooh, the futuresphere. it's what people in nineteen sixty-five imagined what life would be like in nineteen eighty-seven."

41606,Lisa,lisa... lisa simpson...
46602,Lisa,"here's the book... ""classics for children?"""
42428,Lisa,hampster two... bart zero...
43309,Lisa,"well, my teacher's a nightmare. three kids got sick from inhaling his ointment fumes, he confiscated everything made of tin, and then he sent us home early because he got his beard caught in the pencil sharpener."
49032,Lisa,where's all the money?
43605,Lisa,"hey, i thought krusty was jewish..."
51413,Lisa,they're giant polluters but the c.e.o. is a woman. it's very vexing.
41905,Lisa,i'm done.
47221,Lisa,i object!
50794,Lisa,"i'm sorry, i don't really want to be here."
51313,Lisa,"i just can't believe someone like you would be a republican. i mean, isn't your last name gutiérrez?"
43366,Lisa,"mom, if someone shot at the mayor, would you have to throw yourself in front of him and take the bullet?"
50586,Lisa,genius.
46452,Lisa,don't you see what mr. burns has done to this church?
46136,Lisa,what's so funny? i'm better than you.
50941,Lisa,"dad, a mother giraffe is giving birth!"
47369,Lisa,"mom, i'm not sure i'm ready for a new cat."
47552,Lisa,baaaaaart!
49436,Lisa,"there's a lesson here: life is fickle. you should appreciate every... stop kicking, bart!"
41959,Lisa,"dad, can i have some money to buy bart a birthday present?"
49871,Lisa,mr. flanders invited us to israel. i think he wants to get dad into heaven.
45879,Lisa,"bart, quit it!"
43149,Lisa,i can't believe that extra thick layer of pollution that i've actually picketed against is what burned up the comet.
48821,Lisa,there must be a website that can help you deal with a clingy baby.
43400,Lisa,"mr. burns hurt all these people financially: nightclub owner moe szyslak. his bar was closed because of burns' negligence; liquor connoisseur barney gumble. when moe's closed, barney lost his only means of support -- sucking coins out of the love tester machine."
46378,Lisa,you are not.
52394,Lisa,of course.
43043,Lisa,"you really think i did okay out there, mom?"
47940,Lisa,that seems... feasible.
51724,Lisa,oops. so did mine.
52458,Lisa,here he is!
43009,Lisa,mom! mom! you've gotta help! they're cooking kids in the school cafeteria!

41649,Lisa,"beh! mag-gie! hey, hey, get your sticky hands off me. owww!"
44052,Lisa,don't worry. nelson and i don't like each other anymore.
43012,Lisa,chorus line of people / dancin' till they make us stop /
52069,Lisa,yeah man.
43905,Lisa,bart!
46316,Lisa,there's nothing here.
49120,Lisa,ceo!
50927,Lisa,um... i just assumed?
43641,Lisa,"so with tax, how much was it?"
48742,Lisa,a sports bra?
50831,Lisa,oh brother. let's dance.
50324,Lisa,is it really okay to just drop them into the pit where the blockbuster used to be?
44104,Lisa,we'll find a way. mom has made so many sacrifices for us -- it's time we gave up something for her. i'll stop buying malibu stacey clothing.
52365,Lisa,"eight. thanks, dad."
41740,Lisa,"how's it going, bart?"
52101,Lisa,"maggie, wanna watch ""the happy little elves"" again?"
45813,Lisa,"boy, you can see everything from mount springfield. the squidport, the old monorail..."
43663,Lisa,what about that great feeling you get from knowing you're better than regular people?
51201,Lisa,to the east! the middle east! mecca!
47026,Lisa,that's amazing. thank you.
52520,Lisa,this is it. i'm going into the ultranet to save my daughter.
48372,Lisa,"you just want somebody to say ""i love you"". i love you."
45406,Lisa,"oh dad, i just spent the day with the most wonderful people."
50761,Lisa,krusty! this once-vibrant young bully won't even live to pick on kids in junior high! because he's been eating nothing but your food!
50432,Lisa,what's this key with the plastic skull for?
42195,Lisa,mom!
47404,Lisa,i can't.
47227,Lisa,"grandma, you'll always be an inspiration to me."
46883,Lisa,no.
52527,Lisa,"okay honey, i made you pork chops just like you like 'em -- twenty."
45923,Lisa,everything in this forest is from a fairy tale! and this book can keep us one step ahead!
45507,Lisa,so you were going to kill us.
52100,Lisa,"maggie, maggie."
48779,Lisa,"bart's makin' faces, dad."
41984,Lisa,you mean you made a bet?
43581,Lisa,"mom! mom, you're stepping on my heels and knocking my shoes off!"
45037,Lisa,but isn't that a bit short-sighted? what happens when we're overrun by lizards?
46478,Lisa,"well, they do smell good..."
42760,Lisa,you ate it too fast.
46654,Lisa,123 papaya street -- this is ronaldo's orphanage.
47423,Lisa,"pictographs! bart, this is a native american burial mound."
46006,Lisa,now they're making popcorn...
45142,Lisa,"and the tumbleweeds tumble at 2, 4 and 6! plus a midnight tumbling on weekends."
48452,Lisa,'cause i've wanted to jam with jazz musicians all my life! how would bart like it if i just hopped on his skateboard and instantly became great?
48097,Lisa,"hi, bart. i baked you some cookies."
49308,Lisa,"dad, don't eat the bees!"
44384,Lisa,yay!
49912,Lisa,"she's such a beautiful shade of blue... i'm going to call you bluella the whale."""
51279,Lisa,"we're gonna push 'em back, push 'em back, push 'em way, way back! all the way to a new con-tract! 'cause union power is a fact! and we're..."
52157,Lisa,"""mr. burns, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. why are you so popular?"""
44162,Lisa,"if i didn't know better, i'd swear bob was building a dam."
48668,Lisa,"nelson, you came to our side in our hour of need."
41897,Lisa,"mom, what's wrong?"
42304,Lisa,my first word.
46825,Lisa,one last sunbeam... and we're done.
52143,Lisa,there were monsters on that ship. and truly we were them.
45461,Lisa,but my dad can...
43007,Lisa,are we taking the new lexus to aunt patty and selma's funeral today?
50951,Lisa,"please, please take me with you! i am one of you! i understood all your references!"
51000,Lisa,"mary, could i steal bart for a minute?"
47691,Lisa,and lose her soul.
47373,Lisa,"welcome to the family, snowball iii!"
51069,Lisa,can i ask you guys something? why does someone become a bully?
44636,Lisa,all we found were these oozing berries. and they look pretty poisonous.
47031,Lisa,"miss sloane, how are you handling the change from la-la land to blah-blah land?"

42672,Lisa,"and that's how i cured all disease, ended war, and reunited the entire cast of tv's ""facts of life"", including long time hold-out, tootie."

41853,Lisa,"no, dad, krusty is our guest. your pratfalls and punchinello antics aren't necessary here."
52305,Lisa,"dad, why is the world such a cesspool of corruption?"
52491,Lisa,what are you doing here?
42452,Lisa,"hey, we know you're tough, dad. remember that time you got lost in the forest?"
51888,Lisa,this is where you belong.

47929,Lisa,"bart, maybe you should listen to this."
44085,Lisa,"they're good pretzels, mom. but you've got to think big. find a major public event and set up shop there."
41898,Lisa,"whayda ya know, she's right."
45028,Lisa,"bart? uhh, he went to play with a friend."

44475,Lisa,you do?
50530,Lisa,people are loving our list of springfield's top ninety-nine afghan restaurants.
45953,Lisa,... it's stupid to divide the city over something as silly as an area code. it would be like you and mom splitting up every time you have a fight.
42435,Lisa,do you think you can get the dental plan back?
49711,Lisa,"no, i'm gonna convince you to turn yourselves in."
44087,Lisa,what's going on outside?
46946,Lisa,and all those feet going by the window are really creeping me out.
51154,Lisa,i was.
42140,Lisa,why didn't you go to dad?
46089,Lisa,and the exhaust pipe is leaking.
46130,Lisa,"dad, i think you're overreacting."
47536,Lisa,wow... mom and dad sure are having fun.
50496,Lisa,"""perhaps someday there will be a cure. although if it requires months of difficult physical therapy, i'll pass."""
42693,Lisa,that's over sixteen thousand kilometers.
50670,Lisa,ew. how 'bout i'll just look at you.
41839,Lisa,"bart, is your boss a crook?"
49995,Lisa,isn't this exciting?
51430,Lisa,"we do have them! they're my home screen! miss hoover! once again, the lesson plan i prepared would've covered this topic much better, but i can see..."
50933,Lisa,i'll be cool.

47104,Lisa,it's so weird not having dad here. i can't fall asleep if i haven't read him his bedtime story.
52054,Lisa,"look, mom. there he is."
46560,Lisa,nooo!
47374,Lisa,"well, i think it's only fair i get to name him. you got to name me."
51574,Lisa,after this we'll do makeovers!
49009,Lisa,i thought they were cancer sticks.
49348,Lisa,"equalia. where everyone is equal, but we're in charge. i mean, somebody has to be, right?"
45264,Lisa,shut up.

42993,Lisa,"because we all know you're a naive pawn, puppet, if you will, of the most diabolical political genius springfield has ever known -- birchibald t. barlow!"
45508,Lisa,i don't think the real radioactive man wears a plastic smock with a picture of himself on it.
46224,Lisa,but why do the brawny prey on the brainy? is it jealousy?
51748,Lisa,right hand red!
43589,Lisa,helium. sideshow bob is in the duff blimp!
52109,Lisa,"prayer, the last refuge of a scoundrel."

42339,Lisa,"goodbye, great aunt gladys. i wish i had made more of an effort to get to know you these last few years."
49782,Lisa,"i'm fine! fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine..."
47675,Lisa,science officer!
49438,Lisa,"okay, people, we've hit penumbra. brace yourself for umbra."
49660,Lisa,this is the best hiding place. they'll never find me.
45763,Lisa,"hey, that's my helicopter!"
43823,Lisa,that's it!
42568,Lisa,does either of you know what incontinent means?
49808,Lisa,"no, the ""underground railroad"" was a bunch of people who helped slaves escape to canada. there were no actual trains, and it wasn't under ground."
49540,Lisa,it's mac and cheese from the school cafeteria. the blandest food known to man.
51434,Lisa,ew.
43413,Lisa,the scene of the crime! there must be something here that can clear dad.
44261,Lisa,"yeah, krabappel. they were naked in the closet together."
43789,Lisa,"it's in tennessee, right next to the oak ridge nuclear facility, birthplace of the atomic bomb."
49606,Lisa,"well, i qualified for the national math bee--"
45689,Lisa,mom! bart's making faces at me. i think.
49246,Lisa,wish me luck.
50245,Lisa,oh no! this is where they took mom from me!
42245,Lisa,uh-huh.
45416,Lisa,"oh, well, we really mean it."
48545,Lisa,haw haw!
51224,Lisa,"you know, dad, just because your mission's complete, it doesn't mean you have to go back to pork eating, and beer-drinking..."
48778,Lisa,"yeah, bart."
47276,Lisa,they've taken away our crepe paper.
52040,Lisa,still kinda ticked off.
47564,Lisa,"something's fishy. they're not in dayton, they're somewhere fun."
51827,Lisa,--but she hasn't come home yet and we're worried she's in trouble!
42250,Lisa,it's not working.
50988,Lisa,it was so scary thinking something might happen to you guys.
46137,Lisa,how would you know? your backhand looks like a rusty gate.
41707,Lisa,"yes, you! baboon, baboon, baboon, baboon!"
45665,Lisa,"now guys, leprosy thrives in filthy conditions, so your only chance is to clean up the house. i'll get you a couple of mops."

50758,Lisa,"well, if you must... see if you can find out where my dolls are."
46685,Lisa,"well, it delivers what it promises."
47924,Lisa,"no, you do. you're gay for moleman!"
46129,Lisa,"i'm just saying you feel threatened by bart, but it's all in your head."
49719,Lisa,slimu looks kind of uncomfortable.
43583,Lisa,"thanks, mom."

47899,Lisa,"let's see, the rv dealership is across the freeway on the corner of... hey, this is a flintstones fun map."
41590,Lisa,"yeah, even though mcdonald's owns yale now, it's still a great school. and i could never afford to go there if i hadn't won the montgomery burns scholarship."
49901,Lisa,"no... i am suggesting you consider cheaper, alternate sources of energy."
45910,Lisa,swings!
48159,Lisa,vóglio affittáre úna bárca píccola.

44005,Lisa,"i like you, too, milhouse, but not in that way. you're more like a big sister."
51962,Lisa,i've got to find that sound.
41781,Lisa,not very well.
51659,Lisa,that was unmotivated.
43965,Lisa,no.
50608,Lisa,looks like we're back to traveling on tramp steamers and produce trucks.
45772,Lisa,i love it!
43731,Lisa,it's one of those campy 70's throwbacks that appeals to generation x'ers.

42214,Lisa,what are you talking about?
47621,Lisa,"i don't know whether it's the lack of sleep, the sodium pentathol, or that it's the only cartoon i've seen in two months. but this is what i believe in now."
50830,Lisa,we're not having a baby!
47581,Lisa,what's wrong with it?
48249,Lisa,hm... maybe there's room on my sports wall.
44036,Lisa,"see, you do have a tender side. you just needed someone to bring it out."
45440,Lisa,"look mom, the safety instructions are written in haiku. ""fasten seatbelts tight / your seat cushions float gently / headsets five dollars."""

49560,Lisa,"mom, that's brilliant! we could go to a school where special doesn't always mean bad! and where the teachers don't have to moonlight as telemarketers."
50217,Lisa,"looks like you're gonna have to take care of him, bart."
46735,Lisa,what are you guys doing?
43869,Lisa,"um, if it's okay with you, mom, i'd rather go find some kids."

46563,Lisa,"bart, this girl is in love with you. think about it."
49775,Lisa,i must have him!
47410,Lisa,"mom, that sounds a lot like the movie ""amadeus,"" which was historically inaccurate. mozart worked hard on his music... salieri was a respected composer..."

47399,Lisa,"dad's gonna catch flanders, just like the end of mom's book."
47198,Lisa,"dad, you've become the new grim reaper!"
47272,Lisa,"i hereby resign as your president. and for my last act, i call a general student strike, effective immediately!"
52332,Lisa,a long-lost half-brother. how dickensian!
46315,Lisa,"wow, look at all these flavors: blessed virgin berry... command-mint... biblegum..."
45130,Lisa,but we can't accept that money. it's tainted.
50366,Lisa,"students, teachers, detentionees...prepare to have everything you believe about milk cans challenged!"
49324,Lisa,"wow, this must be important, dad! i've never seen you walk up an incline before."
41777,Lisa,"where did you get the idea for this, mom?"
46010,Lisa,"don't worry, i'll be right back."
45874,Lisa,"i'm sorry, vicki. i just wanted to be a dancer so badly."
49682,Lisa,"zap! zap! zap! zap! zap! zap! i curse you, hell's kitten!"
41726,Lisa,isn't it obvious? we've degraded ourselves and set back the children's rights movement for decades to come.
47597,Lisa,"now up, the case of simpson v. simpson."
47755,Lisa,"i'm sure you did. but still, don't you ever wonder what might have happened if things had gone differently?"
45434,Lisa,"um, according to the mexican council of food, this expired two years ago."
44696,Lisa,darn it!!
48103,Lisa,"bart, i think you're behind this whole thing."
46467,Lisa,"mr. gere, i was hoping buddhism could bring me inner peace. or is that just a pipe dream?"
51606,Lisa,bart won a blue ribbon... but was it worth it?
45960,Lisa,you've ruined all my stuff.
43156,Lisa,yay! i won your stupid bathroom products race!
47192,Lisa,"well, it looks like maggie crawled through these bushes, spit up over here, and crashed her tricycle into the wall."
49176,Lisa,"dad, do laundry."
44287,Lisa,"but according to your most recent biography, you only have one hundred million dollars today."
48618,Lisa,"well, some of my report... um... wasn't thoroughly fact-checked."
48119,Lisa,they're tearing down the pier!
42271,Lisa,"mom, they expect you to lie a little."
47007,Lisa,"well, i haven't won yet--"
47013,Lisa,"no, i don't want to pay for college by throwing a spelling bee."
44874,Lisa,excuse me. can you tell me how to get to the museum?
46787,Lisa,but man's inquisitive nature is what separates us from the animals.
44667,Lisa,"mom, these are at least two sizes too big."
51216,Lisa,is that something your terrorist masters told you to tell me?
44050,Lisa,"well, i guess this is it..."
51623,Lisa,"dad, are you okay?"
51243,Lisa,"'cause in a head-to-head battle, the one with the most brains wins!"
49986,Lisa,"mr. szyslak, would you like to buy some band candy?"
48400,Lisa,"i'm so glad you picked the museum of natural history, mom."
45029,Lisa,"no, no. i'm pretty sure he's with milhouse."
44987,Lisa,"mom, you can't possibly believe that."
50741,Lisa,"well, well, mr. never-wrong was right again -- family vacations always suck. i called it. called. it."
48105,Lisa,"if you don't tell mom what you did, i will."
41768,Lisa,"bart, the entire town is howling for your blood, and before i join them i have one question: today is my birthday -- you promised to get me something, and... and i'm afraid to ask."
51634,Lisa,"bart picks one of the smoothies and drinks it -- maybe he had the broccoli, maybe he didn't. no one knows, so neither of you has given in, and this horrible impasse can come to an end."
46853,Lisa,"dad, what is that?"
51489,Lisa,i wish i could live in there.
45241,Lisa,"why do you assume that i won't pick something fun? let's see... oh, this looks very educatio--"
42581,Lisa,a vampire!
43060,Lisa,for the greater good.
45202,Lisa,"okay, now we just have to stick the feet on."
45580,Lisa,that's not funny... huh?
47722,Lisa,"thank you, nelson."
48688,Lisa,"dad, i'm going to play soccer."
52345,Lisa,what is it unky herb?
42418,Lisa,"mom, bart wrecked my project and the science fair's in three days!"
51295,Lisa,begone!
44396,Lisa,"actually, i think we're in chinatown now."
51250,Lisa,what i'm suggesting is we create an honor code.
46565,Lisa,"well bart, you really understand women."
49325,Lisa,my bees?
50286,Lisa,no. it's oddly dehumanizing.
42569,Lisa,i'd like to believe that this time. i really would.
51053,Lisa,"but i am playing! i'm hop-scotching from paragraph to paragraph, climbing the monkey bars of plot and theme."
49811,Lisa,but-but-but-but-but...
50994,Lisa,things that you're desperately missing from your life that you never knew you needed.
47230,Lisa,what?
50452,Lisa,"hi, my name is lisa simpson."
44556,Lisa,um-hmmm.
47978,Lisa,"i really appreciate your taking such an interest in me, dad."
49997,Lisa,"ew, no thanks."
42916,Lisa,"mom, romance is dead. it was acquired in a hostile takeover by hallmark and disney. homogenized, then sold off piece by piece."
43265,Lisa,"wow. what else did you do, dad?"
46430,Lisa,murder most foul?
45047,Lisa,whoaaa!
49483,Lisa,look who's here!
47784,Lisa,a robot?! last year the winner was a jar of owl pellets. i don't have a chance now.
48594,Lisa,no.
44294,Lisa,"my name is lisa, mr. burns. lisa simpson."
50616,Lisa,you're endorsing ted nugent for president?! he's a right-wing rock star who likes everything i hate!
45510,Lisa,"hold the funeral, poindexter."
46120,Lisa,"ooh, it says here that special effects whiz tom savini is gonna be appearing at the comic book store tonight!"
43107,Lisa,"ow! cut it out, bart."
47039,Lisa,"yeah, and entertainers are always winning elections. jesse the body ventura, sonny bono, gopher from love boat, mary bono..."
46847,Lisa,i'm sorry. they don't publish that any more.
50760,Lisa,that's nelson!
43706,Lisa,"oh, let me help you, george washington, i still want to help you."
50143,Lisa,"eight forever? whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! i can't spend eternity using kid scissors. they barely cut anything!"
50579,Lisa,"and the best part is, my face is still on the back flap."
46051,Lisa,"dad, you shouldn't drag that around."
47008,Lisa,what?!
48856,Lisa,"bart, bart, bart. you're worried you're losing milhouse. and love is a selfish thing."
51009,Lisa,wait a minute. didn't bart and i both watch this thing when we were little?
46228,Lisa,i'd like to thank her parents for helping with the caging.
48707,Lisa,"you were right to kick me out of that game. soccer was making me insane, just as it did the continents of europe and south america."
44943,Lisa,"now maybe a little joke, to break the ice."
50084,Lisa,"c'mon, maggie. i need to get good at fencing so i can put it on my resume and get into yale. don't be scared. i won't hurt my widdle sister."
49862,Lisa,an f. an f! i hope harvard never finds out about this.
47164,Lisa,look! there's duffman!
43925,Lisa,hmmm. looks about the same.
50635,Lisa,i'd have more friends if i knew what people liked. but i won't know what people like unless i'm their friend. it's a conundrum.
49539,Lisa,"dad, i've got the perfect thing."
45742,Lisa,i'm trying! can't i get on your shoulders?
51513,Lisa,everyone does that.
43196,Lisa,"goodbye, mr. sherman. if i ever play carnegie hall, i'll give you a call."
44223,Lisa,we have to get you to the emergency room!
46643,Lisa,that's right.
51445,Lisa,shut up!
42921,Lisa,"here you go, ralph."
43980,Lisa,you mean there's nothing left to clean?
42464,Lisa,this is a rather lifeless outing.
45112,Lisa,"we've got a test, and i didn't read the book. i'll get a zero for sure, bart! what do i do?"
45441,Lisa,it's breathtaking.
48503,Lisa,"mom, we've got to stop them from pacifying our town!"
45243,Lisa,"oh, this is perfect!"
46008,Lisa,and coloring easter eggs!
49905,Lisa,"dad, if we're really off the grid, then we won't get power when the air is still."
46732,Lisa,doogie howser went to college when he was my age.
52285,Lisa,shut your mouth!
44000,Lisa,"thanks, but i prefer the honest way."
44594,Lisa,"that's a good suggestion, mom."
48958,Lisa,"what do you mean ""what's up""? why would something be up?"
46921,Lisa,how'd you think of such perfect things for us to do? did mom help you?
44526,Lisa,but--
44278,Lisa,"oh, it's for my junior achievers club. we're trying to earn money by recycling."
46244,Lisa,"no, mom."
43154,Lisa,"if there has to be a bastardized version of krusty, i'm glad it's you."
48785,Lisa,kent brockman said a horrible swear!
50028,Lisa,emily dickinson.
44057,Lisa,"dad, wake up!"
48881,Lisa,that commercial was a trick -- specifically designed to lure our family here!
44257,Lisa,but 7 goes into 28 4 times.
43189,Lisa,"i like him. he's smart, he's sensitive, he's clearly not obsessed with his physical appearance..."
51832,Lisa,mom's counting cards at the casino!
48096,Lisa,i think i'm gonna be fine. let's get some breakfast.
49001,Lisa,"i'm sorry, i got confused."
48621,Lisa,not there. not even close.
51225,Lisa,"'twas halloween night, with the kids door-to-dooring, and all over town blood sugar was soaring."
49504,Lisa,"ooh, it must be bloomsday!"
43975,Lisa,"oh, no!"
50380,Lisa,i'll get him out!
51677,Lisa,what!?!?
47627,Lisa,"i miss america, too. the united states has its grandeur and its follies, but mostly it's the place where all our stuff is."
49542,Lisa,pecan blandies... cream of steam... you guess 'ems...
45554,Lisa,"ooh, i want to get the ""kr_nk""!"
48229,Lisa,"willie? i hope i'm not being too personal, but you seem resigned to a life of abject squalor."
48371,Lisa,"and because you're poor, so you don't feel like you're good enough."
48465,Lisa,i did? how?
45517,Lisa,oh.
50641,Lisa,"as the ceo of springface, i want you all to have fun as you write source code until you fall asleep at your consoles."
49616,Lisa,"hey bart, did you know that's a haiku?"
41936,Lisa,you should smell his room.
45975,Lisa,"no, you can't!"
50538,Lisa,"no fair! this isn't big, it's medium!"
46937,Lisa,"oh dad, you do remember something about me. perhaps you also remember this laser bart gave me earlier!"
44522,Lisa,quite preposterous. but no one will believe me until i can prove what it really is. can't you do a dna test or something?
51819,Lisa,"well, despite all that, today's gonna be fun, dad! will there be lots of other girls there?"
44179,Lisa,"but i'm smart and responsible, and my parents will be right next door!"
45624,Lisa,"hey, mom!"
47869,Lisa,i'm not sharpening it!
45354,Lisa,here you go. make sure you get into every crevice.
44752,Lisa,"but surely, i deserve some credit for..."
51879,Lisa,aha!
42461,Lisa,you were in that coma for seven weeks.
45198,Lisa,it's so rigid and uncreative.
51715,Lisa,"yeah, you really get that it's all about the music."
44118,Lisa,you know her?
48936,Lisa,dad?
52258,Lisa,there's peas everywhere.
50489,Lisa,"i'll recite the alphabet, and you tell me when to stop. a-b-c-d..."
45301,Lisa,not you.
43623,Lisa,"but it's marked down from $2,800!"
43566,Lisa,"mona simpson, mona stevens, martha stewart, penelope olsen, muddy mae suggins..."
44546,Lisa,"well, it was just so loud and... heh, heh, heh... thanks for sqeezing back."
47178,Lisa,"dad, maybe you could lead bart's tribe."
51180,Lisa,"aww, dad, i just got a little twinge in my heart."
50256,Lisa,"merry christmas, mom!"
43803,Lisa,"cut it off, but be careful."
43435,Lisa,"you know, maggie hasn't been a simpson as long as us. i think she's beginning to forget mom and dad."
49402,Lisa,"aha! so dad's life would actually have been worse, because he wouldn't have gotten together with mom, his one true love!"
48017,Lisa,"dad, if you'll recall, i never believed in you, not for one second."
46275,Lisa,"dad, no!"
46656,Lisa,we're never gonna find him.
48917,Lisa,"dad, i'm freezing."
42683,Lisa,"dad, you should blow the whistle on the kwik-e-mart."
51545,Lisa,what does that mean?
42976,Lisa,"this time, he's the lesser of two evils."
52089,Lisa,but i want to see what happens.
42117,Lisa,she's wonderful. i could feel her sweet country soul in every digitally-encoded bit.
47136,Lisa,"i'm sure she's just running late. or, she's not coming because she doesn't understand how special you are."
44984,Lisa,"thanks, mom. but i told you, i'm not going."
50461,Lisa,you know anything about... bus twenty-three?
51889,Lisa,hey!
45890,Lisa,"c'mon, becky. tell us your big news."
43374,Lisa,i don't even want any. i just bought a pity glass...
46026,Lisa,"sir, have you no shame?"
45164,Lisa,"heh, you're not really giving my father power of attorney, are you?"
47744,Lisa,that was such an exciting night. morley safer has the biggest head i've ever seen.
49827,Lisa,"computers, right? our story begins with a spunky little spitfire named eliza simpson."
50944,Lisa,amen.
47815,Lisa,really? didn't you just sign a ninety million dollar contract?
45059,Lisa,dad! push exit!
41664,Lisa,"okay, i'll do it. but whom should i beat up?"
52323,Lisa,"poor brandy. aunt selma, do you think you'll ever get married?"
48678,Lisa,duffman's on a date with booberella!
48794,Lisa,i guess there's just no place for truth and bravery in today's media.
49460,Lisa,a cryptic message! maybe this will lead me to the gem!
48285,Lisa,they take in animals from the movies and tv that aren't cute anymore.
50636,Lisa,hm...
49211,Lisa,"if it's your shortcut, i'll be high and dry."
45519,Lisa,it's got a computer chip in it. everything does.
51414,Lisa,how does this mean anything when everyone's forced to do it?
41865,Lisa,"oh yeah, it's all the kids talk about on monday at school."
51312,Lisa,that isn't a word.
48617,Lisa,"show's over, let's go!"
49944,Lisa,"thanks for not letting me give up, dad."
44692,Lisa,i'm finished. i've just got to...oh... there!
42676,Lisa,i've got a weekend job helping the poor. and i'm only eight.
51448,Lisa,tomato!
41989,Lisa,"boy, mom sure will be happy you won fifty dollars."
48340,Lisa,this hatchway is jammed!
46301,Lisa,will i ever see you again?
47839,Lisa,"well, that's the end of dad's wedding business."
52415,Lisa,two: the revolver wasn't invented until 1835.
49685,Lisa,don't dip those wiccans!
44284,Lisa,hmm. you've never heard of recycling? it means to reuse things to conserve our natural resources.
41598,Lisa,"it's so great that yale has finally forbidden men from taking science. now let's see, should i major in femistry or galgebra?"
44957,Lisa,"no, i didn't."
45812,Lisa,hey! no fair! we'll never get a good picture.
44214,Lisa,i thought i told you to go to bed!
50337,Lisa,"ooh, authentic american folk music, just like they play on n.p.r.!"
44364,Lisa,"bart, i got a cassette from mom and dad! i thought we could listen to it together."
47703,Lisa,what?
51521,Lisa,he worked two jobs to get me a pony... he started me playing the saxophone you all love...
48383,Lisa,sure!
44915,Lisa,it's a bottle cap.
46109,Lisa,da-ad!
52083,Lisa,"oh, come on, bart, not again."
44769,Lisa,me?
48886,Lisa,"actually, you made one. what shakespeare really said was ""'twere well it were done quickly."""
44378,Lisa,"well, at least they're talking to me..."
43926,Lisa,ah.
41594,Lisa,uh...
48451,Lisa,"oh, i can't believe..."
47014,Lisa,"mom, i'm having a crisis of conscience. can you and dad afford to send me to college?"
50903,Lisa,"four threes?! oh no! no-no-no-no-no, nooooo!"
42689,Lisa,i think what my father's saying is you're like a member of the family now.
41939,Lisa,you're telling who?
44579,Lisa,what?
45946,Lisa,"stoats are weasels, bart. they don't come in cans."
49933,Lisa,no. i'm not gonna be disappointed again.
45537,Lisa,"all right. almost done, my little friend. soon you'll be a nice, cool... rat?!"
50948,Lisa,i can finally compost!
45888,Lisa,isn't it wonderful to have a hip female influence in the house?
45887,Lisa,"we're jamming, mom. she's painting my music, and i'm playing to her painting."
48318,Lisa,"de nada, grampa."
44530,Lisa,"you? but... you're an intelligent person, mom."
50312,Lisa,"all right, bart. what are you up to now?"
46372,Lisa,"bart, you saved me."
46766,Lisa,hm. does dad seem a little... dumber than usual?
49227,Lisa,"cocoa! ""ice rink drink!"""
45073,Lisa,"don't blame us, dad. the celebrities are the ones who canned you."
47599,Lisa,granted.
42406,Lisa,"oh, george..."
42917,Lisa,happy valentine's.
49780,Lisa,nothing's going on. just sharing my music with the good people of vancouver.
52446,Lisa,"oh, mom, that's wonderful. can i find out his favorite dish and help you make it!"
46226,Lisa,"please, dr. koop. let me demonstrate."
49123,Lisa,"uh, mom? we've got a code four."
50776,Lisa,that's my brother! four years out of four.
44688,Lisa,"for your information, none of your business!"
46003,Lisa,"hot thai soup! ohhh, bart... ""dear lisa. you rock! mom is calling rescue agencies. dad is building a giant ladder, but it is of poor quality. we miss you, bart."" awww."
51120,Lisa,"milhouse, you'll probably think this is lame, but i was gonna go for a nature walk after school and i thought maybe you'd like to..."
51864,Lisa,here's a good job at the fireworks factory.
42529,Lisa,we were asking you to appear on krusty's come back special.
49772,Lisa,yay!
46915,Lisa,so you know one thing about me. big deal.
42141,Lisa,"well, according to ""eternity"" magazine, the feeling of guilt has been linked to the neutrotransmitter gammaphenamine. dow chemical is developing a minty gel, which will eliminate excess guilt, but unfortunately it won't be on the market for another six months. so i guess you're gonna have to bite the bullet and confess to milhouse."
45221,Lisa,"dad, you were supposed to pay for those snacks."
48690,Lisa,"you tell him, jesminder!"
42037,Lisa,"mom, bart's making faces at me."
45976,Lisa,are you all right?
41986,Lisa,uh-huh.
48769,Lisa,"bart, are you all right? bart?"
41955,Lisa,ariel.
50398,Lisa,how many truffles did you get?
49317,Lisa,apparently not feisty enough. future generations will judge us by how we cared for the tiniest creatures. i am not just asking you to save the bees. i am asking you to save your souls.
50436,Lisa,"well, maybe a little. but i'd never break the rules."
48114,Lisa,you're just possessed by the devil.
44336,Lisa,"that came from baboon county, u.s.a.!"
49041,Lisa,what lap?
50969,Lisa,you said you cut the wires to the alarm!
50125,Lisa,"stealing home. it's so impossible. it's against every sensible instinct... it's, it's..."
47515,Lisa,and it would be nice to have someone here i can beat up.
43994,Lisa,why do you have to be such a pain all the time? don't you realize you're getting a bad reputation?
43304,Lisa,"i've got some textbooks, but without state approved syllabi and standardized testing my education can only go so far."
48054,Lisa,i see mom!
48878,Lisa,we're going to a rest'rant grand op'niiiiiiiing... / but don't fill up on bread!
50428,Lisa,"milhouse, i... i..."
52444,Lisa,oh lord.
50397,Lisa,interested in these?
49776,Lisa,"um... can i have it on account? on account of i want it? you've heard that one, huh?"
51458,Lisa,so... how strong are you?
48681,Lisa,okay.
46603,Lisa,why don't you read to us now?
43068,Lisa,"dad, i don't understand. what is she saying you did?"
52461,Lisa,got a new dance and it goes like this / and the name of the dance is the peppermint twist! yeah!
44441,Lisa,"good one, dad."
48020,Lisa,"dad, we've been so worried about you!"
43483,Lisa,"wait dad! good news, everyone! you don't have to eat meat. i made enough gazpacho for all!"
45790,Lisa,"you know something, bart? you're right. my lack of coolness is really holding america back."
47830,Lisa,"dad, i don't understand. after all the corruption and deceit we've witnessed, how can everyone just party?"
45347,Lisa,b-3.
42370,Lisa,"here you go, ralph."
47555,Lisa,"it's called wicca, and it's empowering!"
46701,Lisa,president kennedy!
47720,Lisa,"okay, if i stop here, i still have some dignity."
51145,Lisa,whatever bart's doing it's got to be pretty bad for him to get me tickets to this amazing jam session!
46960,Lisa,"ladies and gentlemen. tonight, i'd like to harangue you about the plight of--"
41903,Lisa,"mom, where is he? if i don't get that reed i'll sound terrible."
49891,Lisa,"well, i will never forgive you, bart."
44513,Lisa,"well, maybe it's, uh, uh... a neanderthal, who got bitten by some angry fish."
46283,Lisa,sentence fragment is also a sentence fragment.
50225,Lisa,i'll tell you later.
42303,Lisa,when are we going to get to my first word?
42298,Lisa,"be-bop? ""be-bop""?"
48293,Lisa,he also happens to be toot-toot's son.
52298,Lisa,why you cagey ol' dog.
51875,Lisa,yeah!
49349,Lisa,gosh. this is all happening so fast. i don't know what to say.
48041,Lisa,"i'll ignore that. in fact, i'm gonna help you. i have a pretty good idea where they are."
44081,Lisa,wait!
43437,Lisa,they're ten feet away and we can't even talk to them. i wish i could tell them how much i miss them.
43135,Lisa,oh.
48104,Lisa,i can read you like a book.
47172,Lisa,"dad, mom's been driving everyone everywhere. why don't you take public transportation?"
50576,Lisa,so i pretended to betray you... then after he typed the password...
41900,Lisa,"dad, i'm calling about the school talent show."
42314,Lisa,did too.
48500,Lisa,"standardized tests, standardized tests, standardized tests..."
43888,Lisa,"don't be afraid, little friend. you'll be the most popular crab on the beach."
50604,Lisa,um... who says we're gonna have kids of our own?
43264,Lisa,wow!
50637,Lisa,it's easier to be friends with lots of people online than one person in person. what if i started an online meeting place where all are equal and i am the undisputed center?
51081,Lisa,wow -- he passed the maggie test. and remember how maggie solved cookiegate?
45820,Lisa,"well, at least we won the bike."
43459,Lisa,awwww.
45488,Lisa,497... 498 words. hmph.
47460,Lisa,"yes, thank you."
49150,Lisa,"so the centipede says: ""i'm goin'! i'm goin'! ...i'm just puttin' on my shoes!"""
46972,Lisa,do you even know what a loft is?
43388,Lisa,"yeah, i was just getting to me. because of mr. burns, they canceled my jazz program, and my friend tito puente got fired. but i could never shoot someone."
48227,Lisa,my saxophone!
49007,Lisa,fresh air.
50388,Lisa,"we used our last day of summer vacation standing in this line, and now it's time for our reward."
43301,Lisa,"luckily i've prepared for this, so i'm not too worried."
46906,Lisa,could it be some kind of book?
43527,Lisa,"good-bye, bart!"
47082,Lisa,"oh, stop."
51499,Lisa,this is so exciting! my first time establishing provenance!
48593,Lisa,"dad, wait, i've got a story about why revenge is wrong."
47370,Lisa,that book doesn't know how i feel.
48612,Lisa,"today the hitachees have dwindled to a handful, and our detailed genealogical records were cruelly destroyed by the white man. so, any attempts to research my tribe would be the ultimate insult."
48433,Lisa,it's delicious!
43914,Lisa,momdadwesawsomethingintheatticand --
42678,Lisa,but inside it's mostly about ross perot. and the last two chapters are excerpts from the oliver north trial.
45660,Lisa,let's see... crusty sores...
45328,Lisa,everyone's gone!
46282,Lisa,i knew that. just testing.
41662,Lisa,"okay, i can talk my way out of this."
47669,Lisa,the barney bugle?
43268,Lisa,"what's wrong, boy? getting tired?"
45714,Lisa,you read my letter?
43114,Lisa,"dad, i know you think you're happy now, but it's not gonna last forever."
42765,Lisa,i think they're trying to get some attention.
46998,Lisa,r-e-l-a-p-s-e.
52324,Lisa,"no. and, since i'm sure that you'd only resent the pity of an eight-year-old niece, i'll simply hope that you're one of the statistically insignificant forty-year-old single women who ever find their fair prince."
49287,Lisa,"or, check out this mytunes-exclusive episode of ""itchy and scratchy."""
41854,Lisa,why don't we let our guest do it?
51647,Lisa,one florence nightingale in a box and make it snappy!
47066,Lisa,maybe geology...
42738,Lisa,wait! don't be fooled! she's just a regular malibu stacy with a stupid cheap hat! she still embodies all the awful stereotypes she did before.
48154,Lisa,"nelson, those don't count as easter eggs!"
48038,Lisa,"no, plutarch. he chronicled the lives of the roman emperors."
49010,Lisa,"look, everyone knows that cigarettes are where flavor lives and a cool choice for a hot night. but they're for losers!"
44672,Lisa,"""take me here, under the disco ball."""
49147,Lisa,"i don't know, i guess he forgot, but people seemed to like me last week."
42794,Lisa,otto!
52031,Lisa,"sorry, bart. i'd love to help you but i'm mired in stage five, self-pity."
44565,Lisa,nothing could be as fun as that looks.
51833,Lisa,"but i really want a pony and i've been really, really good this year."
45223,Lisa,"but mom, i read that sport utility vehicles are more likely to be involved in fatal accidents."
42343,Lisa,there it is!
48071,Lisa,but i thought it was wrong to talk about people behind their backs.
51932,Lisa,"does, too."
46044,Lisa,"well, there's lots of needy kids out there..."
45455,Lisa,yes! got 'em!
45650,Lisa,so mom... you think you'll be getting out of there soon?
46211,Lisa,"hey willie, i think i'm onto something! check this out!"
45935,Lisa,"father, i knew you'd rescue us!"
45394,Lisa,"oh, absolutely! well, you know, anything by jane austen..."
42558,Lisa,no.
46992,Lisa,"really? it won't be the same without you, dad."
50184,Lisa,did you get that the pony was actually me?
52211,Lisa,"dad, this isn't about glue. it's about territoriality. he only wants the glue because i'm using it."
47154,Lisa,"here's a role model for you, boy: rin tin tin. he was brave on and off the screen. he was the first openly gay dog in hollywood."
51538,Lisa,at least we hope it's bottom.
41828,Lisa,"i'm sure you did nothing to discourage this, you scavenger of human misery."
44788,Lisa,"bart, i really think we should stick--"
43178,Lisa,"how's dad, today?"
48879,Lisa,"i see no grill, oven, or food of any kind."
52454,Lisa,can we do it this week?
43113,Lisa,beware the ides of march.
49193,Lisa,huh.
48583,Lisa,"oooh, an institute!"
48184,Lisa,maybe there's a mechanic in this tuscan village.
48528,Lisa,moe marginalized my contributions...
44377,Lisa,yes!
50062,Lisa,"oh, i don't know. i thought one of these super-successful people might tell you how important it is to stay in school. why look, it's mark zuckerberg, the founder of facebook!"
49900,Lisa,"dad, while i agree reducing consumption is great, it's hard to make permanent changes in your lifestyle."
45337,Lisa,"well, dad, if the museum didn't inspire you, maybe you should do something really radical, like christo."
50276,Lisa,i've been doing the family's books for years. i take what i need.
50190,Lisa,mom... i don't want to go to that school.
42829,Lisa,"good luck, dad."
51818,Lisa,"ooh, mom. someone wants you to give them a ride."
49729,Lisa,gotcha!
42851,Lisa,"shut up, brain! i got friends now. i don't need you anymore. duh, yeah, i'd love to go to your house."
51625,Lisa,oh no.
42210,Lisa,"i'd like to be alone, please."
46873,Lisa,but where will we live?
46429,Lisa,we're trying to uncover a hidden trauma in my dad's childhood.
52375,Lisa,"sewing a new quilt. you know, it's one thing to be a link in a chain. it's another to start one of your own."
49418,Lisa,"pride is to ""downfall"" as ""overconfidence"" is to..."
52062,Lisa,oh no!
43387,Lisa,"bart, he broke your dog's legs. grampa, he destroyed your home. and dad, well, you kind of went berserk when he couldn't remember your name."
44680,Lisa,i bought my lunch at the gas station.
51595,Lisa,please stop!
41693,Lisa,"mr. bergstrom! hey, mr. bergstrom!"
42002,Lisa,"yeah, me!"
50784,Lisa,dutch?
48149,Lisa,"look, as the safety salamander, you are beloved by all. and if you were the mayor, we could make sure that only good people, like me, tell you what to do."
43982,Lisa,"faster, mom, faster!"
42484,Lisa,they said their insurance won't cover you.
52430,Lisa,"mom, are we gonna talk, or are we gonna talk?"
51619,Lisa,"three feet, nine inches. that should do it."
45802,Lisa,it does?
49428,Lisa,this is so hard because i always thought mom was the strong one.
44858,Lisa,crackton? that doesn't sound right.
43577,Lisa,"i wanna meet the first female stealth bomber pilot. during the gulf war she destroyed seventy mosques and her name is lisa, too!"
46270,Lisa,these are just pictures of monkeys from famous movies.
44009,Lisa,nelson! um... that note milhouse gave you... it wasn't from him. it was from... me.
48022,Lisa,her films are so lyrical! the phone lines are gonna be jammed.
50973,Lisa,well i'm glad you're not upset. all my extra credit points are like frequent flyer miles on a bankrupt airline.
47624,Lisa,yes.
47343,Lisa,this is offensive to christians and prunes.
45209,Lisa,isn't mid-season just a dumping ground for second-rate shows that weren't good enough for the fall schedule?
46483,Lisa,my family tried to trick me into celebrating christmas!
52257,Lisa,we will.
42230,Lisa,"thanks, dad."
46445,Lisa,why does jesus have a lasso?
47411,Lisa,"well, at least they're not fighting."
46679,Lisa,ooh! here's a wonderful speaker! geoff jenkins!
51582,Lisa,"it's so much fun to finally have a friend who likes the npr show ""wait wait, don't tell me"" as much as i do."
45648,Lisa,"hey mom, how's the leg?..."
50541,Lisa,no fair!
43166,Lisa,"uh-oh. bart, you better talk to mom and dad about this."
47071,Lisa,"dad, that's a kaleidoscope."
47887,Lisa,compress his chest!
42934,Lisa,"now you listen to me -- i don't like you. i never liked you, and the only reason i gave you that stupid valentine is 'cause nobody else would!"
49354,Lisa,"mom, i'm meeting juliet after school!"
48816,Lisa,shout!
46497,Lisa,"hey, where'd they go?"
41884,Lisa,peace on earth.
46391,Lisa,why?
43700,Lisa,i was so sure...
42300,Lisa,"tell it, mom. tell, it mom."
47589,Lisa,"dad, this is the basement. here's the iced tea i left down here this afternoon."
43291,Lisa,i've got an idea!
44654,Lisa,"stop! leave milhouse alone! help me out here, bart."
51541,Lisa,what record? stupidest death?
50769,Lisa,it'll be fine. just learn your lines.
48286,Lisa,uh... sure.
49699,Lisa,"and now, making his debut on the catwalk... bartholomew!"
49359,Lisa,juliet? are you okay?
52417,Lisa,or italian?
51881,Lisa,"no, you do!"
41797,Lisa,"ah, me too!"
42229,Lisa,"my name is lisa simpson, and i want to be little miss springfield so i can make our town a better place!"
49168,Lisa,see ya!
50660,Lisa,yes i did. now i'm going to bed.
49698,Lisa,"go, go, go!"
42408,Lisa,"hi, ralph. you were great tonight."
42188,Lisa,"hey look, it's last year's winner, deborah jo smallwood!"
43715,Lisa,i did a lot of research on jebediah springfield and...
46953,Lisa,"dad, this ticket is for tomorrow's wnfl game!"
49922,Lisa,"you know, when i'm sad, i read something beautiful and true: poetry."
44497,Lisa,"but they might be paving over rare specimens. pull over so we can complain, dad. come on, who wants to complain with me?"
51192,Lisa,bart! why is the dad i always wished for creeping me out?
45907,Lisa,"right from the start, i had a bad feeling about that gig."
43111,Lisa,i still don't believe all the founding fathers were stonecutters.
51028,Lisa,"guys, look!"
43640,Lisa,with tax or without?
45330,Lisa,dad!
50499,Lisa,now prepare to take an incredible journey across the room!
52371,Lisa,and look!
52390,Lisa,"i don't deserve it, grampa. no one here does. the people who deserve it are on the streets and they're in the slums. they're little children who need more library books and families who can't make ends meet. of course, if you really wanted to, you could buy me a pony."
45043,Lisa,"uh, bart?"
50263,Lisa,happy new year!
45886,Lisa,"well, mom, you really brought out the mung in these beans."
43766,Lisa,woo hoo!
44480,Lisa,i don't want to make the team.
46745,Lisa,well i can't do it tomorrow. there's an assembly in his honor.
50140,Lisa,i know just how you feel!
44939,Lisa,"she's a little weird, but let's give her a chance."
47414,Lisa,fine. you can confirm the accuracy of the hose.
44798,Lisa,they also have memorial day.
51561,Lisa,is that mom?
50047,Lisa,"let's see, i could help someone in any impoverished area on earth. bangladesh... bolivia... east springfield?!"
45583,Lisa,"listen, when you see what's inside this..."
41684,Lisa,the rice wine has penetrated to the essence of your souls.
44329,Lisa,wow.
49677,Lisa,"well, it is an honor to be asked. but i never make a final decision in the middle of a forest at night."
46230,Lisa,"the bully has caught my scent, and she's at maximum rage. professor frink?"
52016,Lisa,"yeah, what'd you get?"
46336,Lisa,i guess dad just takes us for granted.
44074,Lisa,either that or batman has really let himself go.
45711,Lisa,"ew, you used my bracelet for a nose ring!"
52486,Lisa,i open this door and i go from being one kind of mother to another.
51978,Lisa,uh-huh.
51286,Lisa,"if they get her in their warrens, we'll never see her again!"
52493,Lisa,too much sodium.
49208,Lisa,oh great. now you woke the baby.
49449,Lisa,"no, i was just thinking you might have some in the back you haven't put out yet."
45324,Lisa,"all right, moses, lead your people."

44661,Lisa,"uh, that's right. the u.n. doesn't look too kindly on..."
43422,Lisa,"mom, you fuss over us way too much."
45831,Lisa,"hey, where is dad?"
45865,Lisa,"ohhhhhh. that's brilliant, professor! what will you think of next?"
48275,Lisa,"so, to contin-"

43564,Lisa,"all right, we don't need the dryer."
50247,Lisa,"yes, but then i learned that there's always hope. someday this war will be over. someday our mom will be back."
44516,Lisa,"ahh, here's dr. gould now. what were the results, professor?"
48687,Lisa,"bart, it's not saturday."
42183,Lisa,crandall!
47812,Lisa,"he's just being true to the bible, which is pretty violent."
48180,Lisa,"dad, don't you want to turn around and see the tower?"
46493,Lisa,"i'm serious, make with the pony."
46184,Lisa,"well, someone's gotta make her feel welcome."

44699,Lisa,what are you talkin' about?
48003,Lisa,"well, i think you're the sweetest dad in the whole world."

43034,Lisa,that's not fair... why is bart getting a present and i'm getting chewed out?
51560,Lisa,i'm fine.
49610,Lisa,i dunno -- chasing ducks? buried alive? he'll be missed. let's move. i've gotta collect pine cones.

41711,Lisa,yeah.
41883,Lisa,peace on earth.
48813,Lisa,"dad, i think someone's trying to kill you!"
46754,Lisa,"dad, it's a blackout."
49854,Lisa,"elementary, my dear simpson."
51638,Lisa,"hey mom, can you pack me a dozen sandwiches in my lunch tomorrow? meat, no meat, it's all good."
43099,Lisa,"uh, neat... anyway, mom, maybe you should go into therapy."
48456,Lisa,that is the most unfair...
51103,Lisa,--like someone faked being hit so they wouldn't be a suspect.
52144,Lisa,"for your information, i'm about to read you a classic tale of terror by edgar allan poe."
44754,Lisa,are you thinking of joining the naval reserve?
44425,Lisa,and my gifts are still going to waste.
44322,Lisa,"/ yahoo! / oh, man, am i glad to get outta there! / etc."
48736,Lisa,"dad, we're in the maze."
42219,Lisa,she's beautiful.
44647,Lisa,could anyone else have taken it?
44158,Lisa,"hey, you said we were going to dairy queen."
47062,Lisa,"dad, my life lacks direction!"
43627,Lisa,do i have to go? that country club is a hotbed of exclusionist snobs and status-seeking social-climbers.
44940,Lisa,"guys, this is alex."
49234,Lisa,isn't it beautiful?
42886,Lisa,"i appreciate the offer, but it goes against every moral fiber in my body."
52284,Lisa,shaft.
44807,Lisa,they gave you a chopper?!
41917,Lisa,"this next song is also about a girl and her pony. it's called ""wildfire."""
50623,Lisa,"i knew you were, dad. i always knew."
48872,Lisa,"the tivo is installed! now we can watch shows, and skip the commercials!"
46815,Lisa,m-m-minus?!
49385,Lisa,cu-ckoo!
42232,Lisa,one! two! three! four!
44817,Lisa,"come on, mom, the stores just invented this holiday to make money."
52163,Lisa,"i can't think of a better place to spend a balmy summer's night than the old ball yard. there's just the green grass of the outfield, the crushed brick of the infield, and the white chalk lines that divide the man from the little boy."
43740,Lisa,"you're right, mom. i'm sure if we put our minds to it we can solve this one too."
44291,Lisa,there's got to be more trash around here somewhere...
43023,Lisa,"yeah, well i eat fruit loops for breakfast."
52373,Lisa,"dad, this is our pet. we can question his integrity and disposition, but we can't question his heart. are you trying to teach us that the way to solve a problem with something you love is to throw it away?"
49519,Lisa,yes you do.
49992,Lisa,"mr. cowell, would you like some band candy?"
49225,Lisa,"bart, i've fallen in love with crosswords!"
51227,Lisa,then we heard a loud crash...we were tempted to scat...
51654,Lisa,bart! i found a portal back to earth.
42668,Lisa,"wow! how'd you track him down, grampa?"
46494,Lisa,"here, clip-clop. here pony, pony."
45096,Lisa,the wind in the willows.
50361,Lisa,ew.
52349,Lisa,hello there. do you miss the antarctic?
46982,Lisa,"i guess i won't be popular this year, either."
50111,Lisa,"c'mon, guys. i had to get rid of bart."
43094,Lisa,"mom, are you feeling any better?"
49755,Lisa,just think what that game could do for grampa and his friends!
52023,Lisa,"""lullaby and good night / go to bed and sleep tight / close your eyes, start to yawn / pleasant dreams until the dawn."""
41872,Lisa,this looks good bart. take it to him.
51578,Lisa,tumi? but you're from the other second grade. we only come together for tornado drills.
42045,Lisa,"ah, bart! that's a black-head gun!"
51605,Lisa,"bart faced a terrible choice: take a beating with his friend or slither off like a coward. and like he did with every multiple choice question he ever saw, bart chose ""b."""
41631,Lisa,but how?
49341,Lisa,"hi, juliet."
50147,Lisa,"someday when i'm a grownup, maybe i'll go back and look fondly at our house."
47949,Lisa,i'd better tell dad.
48329,Lisa,the year was sixteen twenty...
42780,Lisa,i propose to you that your heir need not be a boy. in this phallocentric society of ours...
44773,Lisa,mo-om...
45549,Lisa,"dad, this might be one of those things you should go to the hospital for."
50213,Lisa,the poor guy hurt his wing.
47948,Lisa,"bart, how can you laugh at that? you just had a heart attack!"
49485,Lisa,maggie?
44843,Lisa,it's lisa. i just called to tell you how much i love you and can i take the bus to the museum?
46571,Lisa,"dad, no. it says ""don't walk""!"
49845,Lisa,"well, sometimes people who agree on most things have one issue that they disagree strongly about. in politics it's called a ""wedge issue"" -- like illegal immigration or gay marriage."
45384,Lisa,"an open letter to the people of springfield: today our town lost what remained of its fragile civility, drowned in a sea of low-fat pudding."
41795,Lisa,mommm!
49851,Lisa,"life stinks, huh?"
51658,Lisa,"noble spirits, your time has passed."
49894,Lisa,"as in ""little orphan."""
46907,Lisa,huh?
51620,Lisa,"okay, enough theory."
47473,Lisa,"do it for an hour, hour and a half."
52042,Lisa,what do you know about france?
47795,Lisa,"this must be the ""nasty surprise"" he mentioned in the invitation."
48961,Lisa,what?!
47975,Lisa,"no, we did it, dad."
45395,Lisa,"""we read your letter with great interest. if you wish to learn more, go to 13 euclid street. tell no one! and bring a dessert."""
47336,Lisa,"krusty, you can still have your bar mitzvah as an adult."
44265,Lisa,"wow, ""trucker's choice."" that is so sweet."
45419,Lisa,"welcome, everyone. today we embark on a new era of intelligent governance."
49886,Lisa,"well, i'm so glad i'm not your mom."
43758,Lisa,it's not fair! i'm the best student in school. how come i never heard about this competition?
50720,Lisa,"everything has rules, bart."
52441,Lisa,mr. bergstrom!
50846,Lisa,"hey, don't ever stop, because tonight we made it in new york!"
49732,Lisa,what do you care? you don't even like him.
48173,Lisa,i had a wonderful time today. grázie. grázie míll-eh.
43928,Lisa,my god. i've created life!
49965,Lisa,dye! dye! dye!
45893,Lisa,shouldn't we be out there trying to find her?
52450,Lisa,can i paint my nails?
46248,Lisa,"wait, rhinos don't come from eggs."
44630,Lisa,we are watching fox.
45788,Lisa,"bart, we're having a meeting."
50427,Lisa,i am so sorry.
42709,Lisa,"i can't believe you're just gonna stand by as your daughters grow up in a world where this, this is their role model."
45615,Lisa,she cleaned out the attic!
44075,Lisa,all right! it's time for abc's tgif lineup!
43974,Lisa,"da-ad! v-chip, v-chip!"
51396,Lisa,get the twist?
47012,Lisa,throw the bee and go to college. throw the bee and go to college...
46944,Lisa,the air hockey table makes passing the carrots a breeze.
51976,Lisa,thanks.
48111,Lisa,"goodbye, implications..."
47061,Lisa,"hey, that's not gonna happen!"
44233,Lisa,wait! dr. hibbert!
47103,Lisa,"dad, where are you going?"
42512,Lisa,you're a latter-day clarence darrow.
48453,Lisa,mild-mild-mild-mild-mild!
43749,Lisa,i've signed numerous petitions to shut down that plant.
42546,Lisa,yeah!
49103,Lisa,"guys, guys! look, it's a documentary -- nobody outside of this festival is ever gonna hear about it."
46822,Lisa,"well, bart's being his usual jerky self... but mom, i'm really excited about this new flag design. oh, and the hotel gives you a free usa today outside your room... no, i'm sure it's free... okay, i won't touch it."
49127,Lisa,"it's not really avenging her, dad. just the fulfillment of her last wish."
50009,Lisa,i never knew artists were all so amazing!
45053,Lisa,hey... gim... ah... ah!
48710,Lisa,"mom, are you sure you don't wanna play?"
46512,Lisa,"now, bart!"
52312,Lisa,i see.
44543,Lisa,wait a second! you planted a phony skeleton for me to find! this was all a big hoax.
51030,Lisa,"well, before our dad signs any contracts, he has a surprise for you..."
49825,Lisa,"my black history month presentation is called ""the simpsons: the first family of freedom."""
48279,Lisa,i want a photo of the hero who risked his life to save me!
42194,Lisa,i think it's supposed to symbolize her descent into madness.
51631,Lisa,"i know, but they're not gonna waste a whole saturday inside."
44541,Lisa,"nothing is going to happen, mom. i hate to disappoint you, but the world is not coming to an end."
43440,Lisa,"uh, actually, the... we were never baptized."
50279,Lisa,"oh my god, me too!"
47921,Lisa,what is bart still doing in there?
42180,Lisa,he's really having trouble keeping his balance.
49952,Lisa,"currently. however, solar and wind are..."
48109,Lisa,"uh, mom? remember how you wished we would never grow up?"
42112,Lisa,"look dad, there's a spot."
44657,Lisa,look! we can hide in that cave!
42706,Lisa,don't you people see anything wrong with what malibu stacy says?
42955,Lisa,"awww, look at that cute little baby axe."
43142,Lisa,"daaad, they're firing the rocket!"
44891,Lisa,"dad, i'm kind of scared."
45589,Lisa,get down. security guard.
52148,Lisa,"while i pondered, weak and weary,"
46979,Lisa,"it's three hundred, mom."
51506,Lisa,what!?
48248,Lisa,i give you... groundskeeper willie!
43471,Lisa,why does it talk like a lamb?
44442,Lisa,"there's one thing i still don't understand. when bart went through the transporter, what happened to his head?"
43398,Lisa,mr. burns is the richest man in town. maybe it was about money.
48102,Lisa,where are you staying?
51290,Lisa,two can be as bad as one / it's the loneliest number since the number one...
46359,Lisa,ew!
50841,Lisa,"not so fast! we came for shakespeare, and we're gonna see shakespeare!"
50216,Lisa,"yes, he could fly home, except that he has a broken wing. perhaps you and your sarcasm could come to springfield and retrieve him."
47203,Lisa,well where is he now? maybe i can help you two patch up your differences.
45052,Lisa,"bart, quit it!"
43278,Lisa,they don't like being broken up.
45114,Lisa,oh my god! these are the answers to the test! i don't wanna cheat!
45329,Lisa,it's the rapture. and i never knew true love.
49250,Lisa,and there's something different about him.
48226,Lisa,"well maggie, i always knew it would some day boil down to just you and me. i'll look for work in the morning."
43059,Lisa,hi mom! over here! mom!
46451,Lisa,"no it's not, it's apt! apt!"
49269,Lisa,"dad, i know this is crazy, but did you plant a message to me in the new york times crossword puzzle?"
52126,Lisa,"sorry... sorry bart. sorry, mom... sorry maggie... sorry lisa."
51165,Lisa,it's ki-ya karate monsters.
46749,Lisa,"""screamapillar care tips."" wow, look at all this stuff. ""without constant reassurance, it will die. it's sexually attracted to fire..."""
46145,Lisa,that's not grampa. dad's just dehydrated.
50722,Lisa,we never do my thing!
49526,Lisa,"oh ralph, how i envy your optimism. there is no springfield fifty years in the future! with global warming trapping the co2 inside our poisonous atmosphere, our super-heated oceans will rise, drowning our lowlands, leaving what's left of humanity baking in deserts that once fed the world!"
41868,Lisa,"bart, we're gonna have to out smart him."
45844,Lisa,"she's not plain, she's beautiful!"
41607,Lisa,time for a smoke.
47184,Lisa,does anyone else want to know why that sign is so funny?
42807,Lisa,"maggie, can you point to the credenza?"
44664,Lisa,"ah, shut up. savages."
47578,Lisa,"well, it looks like everything worked out just fine for everybody."
49256,Lisa,"no, i'm not mad."
45174,Lisa,hippo in the house.
43431,Lisa,"well, when was the last time dad gave her that kind of attention?"
45121,Lisa,"uh, i am sick of everyone being so proud of me!"
52327,Lisa,is too.
44809,Lisa,"oh, no! what have i done?!"
50667,Lisa,"um, i should probably get back to my mom. by the way, my name is--"
43085,Lisa,dad!
42945,Lisa,we're going to itchy and scratchy land!
47821,Lisa,a shirt from that rap concert... bart must've gone to the show. but that means...
47806,Lisa,and they seem awfully chummy.
47535,Lisa,"""fox broadcasting, 10201 west pico, building 203..."""
44625,Lisa,the hell with him! / what leader? / he can take a flying leap as far as i'm concerned! / lea-who?
49581,Lisa,"alaska, we've never met, but everyone thinks i'm your best friend."
47002,Lisa,very well. l-i-t-t-l-e -m-i-s-s...
45307,Lisa,"come on, mom, let's take it for a test drive."
42609,Lisa,"don't worry, mr. hutz is still here to take care of us."
51665,Lisa,maybe a satellite picture will give us a clue.
48782,Lisa,"this film is against tooth decay, but it also kind of glamorizes it. mixed signals, hmm."
47968,Lisa,how did you write a song so quickly?
50542,Lisa,hey -- i know you...
44327,Lisa,it looks japanese.
51080,Lisa,"nice going, bart. you've ruined halloween, thanksgiving, christmas and easter. the legendary grand slam."
50775,Lisa,i'm just saying it won't get better unless you talk to an adult.
51576,Lisa,are you guys okay?
48080,Lisa,mom showed me how to make a retaining wall out of pillows. but i'm gonna conquer my fears... tonight.
51814,Lisa,"we couldn't write a song. we're one-hit wonders! but, is that such a crime? look at j.d. salinger."
42511,Lisa,yay!
44673,Lisa,"one's residential, the other is business."
48164,Lisa,"oh sure, i get it. bart told you i was taking lessons, so you thought you'd come over and--"
44919,Lisa,unbelievable.
45261,Lisa,but where am i supposed to live?!
51950,Lisa,"i'm just wondering, what's the point? would it make any difference at all if i never existed? how can we sleep at night when there's so much suffering in the world?"
46407,Lisa,"i did. you owe rem an apology for, eco-fraud."
46788,Lisa,"""dear dad, took money for the school book fair."""
46420,Lisa,i came home as quick as i could. what's going on?
50226,Lisa,it's amazing how i can feel sorry for you and hate you at the same time. i'm sure there's a german word for it.
52188,Lisa,i want you to shut off the logical part of your mind.
42745,Lisa,"come on, dad, you can make it."
50406,Lisa,"bart, you've done a truly kind thing."
47042,Lisa,congressman.
51942,Lisa,here.
43275,Lisa,"mom, why do i have to wear a flea collar?"
50764,Lisa,nothing.
43705,Lisa,no! not janey! she'll pack the supreme court with boys!
42094,Lisa,stupid hoover... thinks she's so smart.
50434,Lisa,i'll return this to the school.
44483,Lisa,"mom, please, we're eating!"
43237,Lisa,are you okay?
43990,Lisa,you mean like your poker shack out in the swamp?
48198,Lisa,"hey, krusty's in an opera, here in rome! he can save our lives! come on, let's go!"
49319,Lisa,nay.
44711,Lisa,dear log: my worst fears have been confirmed. i've hit my mental and creative peak at the tender age of eight. what will my life be like after i descend into mediocrity?
52407,Lisa,lincoln lincoln i been thinkin' what the hell have you been drinkin'? / is it water is it wine? / oh my god it's turpentine! / faster! faster!
44936,Lisa,"oh, don't worry, you'll pick it up fast. once you get to foursies, you're in the zone."
41764,Lisa,"well, all right -- if you listen to the poem i just wrote."
45803,Lisa,"well, it shouldn't be too hard to beat the old photo."
48597,Lisa,"milhouse, what's gotten into you?"
47472,Lisa,"okay. but first, you must apprentice by kissing the goddess ironica, uh... who lives in this rock."
46393,Lisa,o-kay then.
48479,Lisa,this place is looking a little run down.
50229,Lisa,not really.
46641,Lisa,except antarctica.
47505,Lisa,"dad, i don't like this movie. can we go home?"
46050,Lisa,"dad! but if you're here, who's that on the float?"
47001,Lisa,i'm a little tired.
49853,Lisa,you wanted to get caught.
49817,Lisa,to the reference desk!
48921,Lisa,"we're in the middle of our own story, thank you."
42084,Lisa,"janey, i'm about ready to chuck the whole stinking alphabet."
46030,Lisa,just a cotton-pickin' minute. i've been getting a's since gymboree.
47952,Lisa,maybe we could shop somewhere else. there's a farm stand next door.
44684,Lisa,"hey, some of us are still trying to solve it!"
42426,Lisa,experiment two: the food is connected to a mild electrical current.
46206,Lisa,"ooh, here's the tape i need."
48121,Lisa,you mean this?
52041,Lisa,dad!
50792,Lisa,it's not a frown. it is a straight line of resignation. looks just the same upside down.
46377,Lisa,"granted. but you gotta admit, constant supervision has been good for bart. he might even make the honor roll, if dad can control his night terrors."
49496,Lisa,"hm. there was a note on the fridge marked ""urgent."" funny word: ""urgent."" ""urrrgent."" urgent."
46922,Lisa,what report?
51451,Lisa,dad!
42279,Lisa,"dad, make bart wash his hand."
49583,Lisa,you have a show?
50416,Lisa,"oh. usually, milhouse does it."
50290,Lisa,"no dad, don't say ""pained noises,"" you make pained noises."
44351,Lisa,this school has everything i ever wanted.
52376,Lisa,this patch commemorates the destruction of the old quilt.
41864,Lisa,i didn't know that.
48586,Lisa,repent! repent! before it's too late! i always wanted to do that in a new england church.
50477,Lisa,"yeah, so he could shoot it himself. franklin roosevelt led this country through the depression and world war two!"
44049,Lisa,then why did you want to be with me?
44485,Lisa,just tell them about yourself.
41976,Lisa,why isn't dad ever interested in anything i do?
42825,Lisa,"dad, that's just a plant."
48497,Lisa,martians? you do know that radio broadcast was a hoax?
43416,Lisa,stop! don't shoot my dad! he's innocent. he wouldn't hurt a fly!
43545,Lisa,eww! mo-om!
52195,Lisa,"let's try another one: if a tree falls in the woods and no one's around, does it make a sound?"
46256,Lisa,the left! go to the left!
41723,Lisa,sprinkles and syrup.
48861,Lisa,asterix! tintin! i heard these only existed in high school french classes.
41791,Lisa,iiiiiii waaaaaannt... that one.
43515,Lisa,but people can't help looking at them. they're wrecking the town.
47419,Lisa,but i know so much about it.
45577,Lisa,"uh, just a few venn diagrams."
52379,Lisa,to the pony rides.
49310,Lisa,"go, live your lives, get off my face!"
46627,Lisa,"look, this story is more interesting than you think. it starts with hamlet's father getting murdered."
43325,Lisa,i sure am. look!
48310,Lisa,suicide?!
47197,Lisa,a world without death...
44486,Lisa,ohhhh. / hiiiii.
44905,Lisa,"dad, that's the old spice song."
49534,Lisa,"bart, in my concurrent adventure, i learned a really important lesson: you can't wallow in despair. face things as they really are."
48223,Lisa,my malibu stacy heads!
43026,Lisa,i am talking to the collection money thief. only you can come forward and end this injustice.
42031,Lisa,i suspected as much.
47740,Lisa,miasmas!
47081,Lisa,"look up at the stars, springfield! for eons, people have gazed at the skies and seen into their souls."
43646,Lisa,their tap water tasted better than ours!
48614,Lisa,the hitachees invented women's lacrosse... soft luggage...
44912,Lisa,what a weird looking vacuum cleaner.
46623,Lisa,"is that true, lord?"
50917,Lisa,really?
51355,Lisa,"congratulations, isabel. i truly hope you enjoy the friday morning council meetings and the, the free snickerdoodle cookies."
48551,Lisa,"hey bart, do you want some ice cream? i just hit a major marshmallow vein - ooo, i think it goes all the way to the bottom!"
41735,Lisa,he's no wittier than the next superhero.
49260,Lisa,lisa bouvier!
46662,Lisa,"whatcha doing, mom?"
45800,Lisa,"mr. gumbel, you're upsetting me."
43511,Lisa,"hey, what's that in his footprint?"
47212,Lisa,it must be tough to win the nobel prize and lose your father on the same day.
51182,Lisa,mom! bart's twisting facts in an orwellian fashion!
44432,Lisa,that's not gonna protect us from anything.
44121,Lisa,"yes, sing us a song!"
51615,Lisa,"so bart was revealed as a coward, and now it seemed like the whole world was against him."
43052,Lisa,that doesn't make sense.
45690,Lisa,but housesitting is a sacred...
48409,Lisa,"mom, you really have to choose here, between science and belief."
50319,Lisa,look!
43986,Lisa,you're a grand old flag / you're a high flying flag / etc...
51495,Lisa,pokey!
47509,Lisa,"must be the pipes. what do you think, bart?"
46855,Lisa,this is a band-aid wrapped in tin foil.
48355,Lisa,"mom, the girls' school is a joke and i'm not allowed to take the boys' math."
46543,Lisa,i thought you liked the new dad.
48099,Lisa,"i bet that bra was planted by sterling, to break them up."
52488,Lisa,what? no! it doesn't matter what i thought. i'm sorry i spied on you. but what i found is my daughter looks up to me!
43543,Lisa,i like school.
48572,Lisa,there he is!
47645,Lisa,chief is fine.
46216,Lisa,"mr. tatum, do you mind if i swab you with this damp rag?"
51270,Lisa,"bart, you're not annoyed that milhouse asked me to go to the american football game instead of you?"
43438,Lisa,yay!
50400,Lisa,"bart, i am putting this money safely in the bank where you will earn zero point zero zero one percent interest."
44117,Lisa,it's the american wayyy!
45558,Lisa,how can he rebel? he doesn't even know where he is.
47981,Lisa,"no, it's fine."
52138,Lisa,stop!
45918,Lisa,ow! son of a...
49823,Lisa,so they did the right thing -- my quest is fulfilled! our family has heroes!
49838,Lisa,that's why my jazz is so smooth!
49663,Lisa,you're gonna be so embarrassed. there are two other people at this party dressed just like you.
41992,Lisa,"goodnight, dad. i had a really nice time today."
41911,Lisa,"dad, no!"
49020,Lisa,is it bart?
48955,Lisa,that's-usually-true-but-in-this-case-it's-not.
41750,Lisa,ring.
48557,Lisa,is that really how it ends? what happened to the merlinical council?
42019,Lisa,"i, lisa simpson, am hereby giving away all my ill-gotten malibu stacey accessories!"
46984,Lisa,...u-g-n. impugn.
41846,Lisa,maybe you ate a clove.
43140,Lisa,"but, dad, don't you think..."
46976,Lisa,"oh, tomorrow's the day the judge said we can visit bart."
50116,Lisa,"well, you're not!"
42118,Lisa,i'm sorry?
42325,Lisa,oh dad.
50920,Lisa,but i promised paul mccartney i wouldn't eat meat.
52151,Lisa,"bart! stop it. he says ""nevermore"". that's all he'll ever say."
50859,Lisa,the black hole is looking a lot bigger. does anybody want to admit to throwing things in?
45070,Lisa,where'd you get that muffin?
41611,Lisa,quick! quick! everyone into my dream!
41978,Lisa,i think so.
45405,Lisa,see dos. see dos run. run dos run. only one person in a million would find that funny.
49196,Lisa,you're just digging yourself even deeper.
50943,Lisa,"dad, pay attention to your children!"
43089,Lisa,that's what i assumed.
52021,Lisa,"don't be scared, dad. it's not so hard taking care of us."
42272,Lisa,"well, you voted for him... twice!"
43802,Lisa,does the whole town have to hear about this?
49566,Lisa,"uh, who's alaska nebraska?"
46402,Lisa,you don't like me? i like you.
47609,Lisa,"oh, please let it be volvo."
52152,Lisa,"well, it was written in 1845. maybe people were easier to scare back then."
49649,Lisa,"yes, and-- oh, go ahead."
47454,Lisa,"okay, what's a good side dish?"
43811,Lisa,"that's specious reasoning, dad."
42533,Lisa,wow an original malibu stacey from 1958. oooh.
44538,Lisa,nothing. someone must have stolen it.
50780,Lisa,"um, can i be excused from holding up my end of the conversation?"
48216,Lisa,"grampa, stop."
49806,Lisa,yes!
47985,Lisa,but instead of singing carols / i was digging snowball's grave...
48205,Lisa,cyrus? you never mentioned him before.
44155,Lisa,"this is about as tolerant as dad gets, so you should be flattered."
48817,Lisa,shout!
48492,Lisa,speak.
44550,Lisa,"""on the closing day!/ the escrow agents pay!/ taxes, liens, and interest, too, thanks to fannie mae!"""
41733,Lisa,"hey, they do look alike!"
48554,Lisa,it would be the day my childhood ended.
44533,Lisa,kent.
49262,Lisa,well what did you think her name was before it was kennedy?
45934,Lisa,george cauldron? maybe he can fix me up with ed ladle.
45978,Lisa,"dad, change it back!"
47450,Lisa,"maggie, you're as smart as any one of those kids. c'mon."
48388,Lisa,i always thought that boys had it easier. but now i see their world is more cruel and sadistic than i ever imagined.
51852,Lisa,then one foggy christmas eve / santa came to say...
49984,Lisa,"mr. flanders, how did you make these amazing fish?"
52129,Lisa,it's an ancient indian burial ground.
43708,Lisa,that's because you stole it!
49122,Lisa,we fooled her... betsy.
47365,Lisa,"bart, why are we fighting?"
44199,Lisa,"oh, look, bart, now you got maggie all upset!"
46412,Lisa,"neither, thank you."
50399,Lisa,brown gold... tuscan tea...
47964,Lisa,"nicely done, wind-dancer. but seriously, cruelty to animals is no laughing matter. you can make a difference!"
48974,Lisa,aren't they beautiful?
45051,Lisa,what's wrong with the tv?
42486,Lisa,"january 8, 1815. two weeks after the war ended."
48144,Lisa,how did you do that?
43436,Lisa,or the way dad used to call the radio station with fake traffic tips?
41603,Lisa,well... okay. i guess this is my destiny.
44722,Lisa,i don't want to turn out that way!
50560,Lisa,"god, i love being a writer!"
52202,Lisa,twelfth hole.
50592,Lisa,no bart! you can read other books too!
46753,Lisa,"dad, no. we're trying to conserve energy."
49368,Lisa,juliet! what are you doing here?
46498,Lisa,these hotels are made of legos.
48087,Lisa,where am i?
51395,Lisa,i sold the gift you gave me.
45748,Lisa,how much farther to the campground?
47088,Lisa,"bart, i just realized -- we both want the same thing: darkness. and we can get it if we work together, with my brain and your... your... assistance."
49108,Lisa,nelson? he couldn't have made a movie by himself. who helped him?
50822,Lisa,"that's right, i'm lisa simpson, superstar!"
46686,Lisa,how's your company gonna make money? do you have a business model?
44971,Lisa,hello?
48078,Lisa,"mom, i think there's a danger this time they might lose the ponderosa!"
47789,Lisa,"dad, that could explode!"
44243,Lisa,"oh, bart, i'm so sorry. this is all like a bad dream..."
44935,Lisa,"oh, jacks. jacks are big. they went out for a while, but then they came roaring back."
52217,Lisa,"i couldn't tell you how many hours. it was a labor of love. it's my homage to some american heroes who may not have fought in any wars, but who nevertheless..."
51039,Lisa,scorrre!
49852,Lisa,mom said she was tipped off by a note from me. but you know something? i didn't write this note.
50815,Lisa,i'll do anything but sing!
50508,Lisa,"it wasn't a pie, it was science! and it's not fair -- my project was way better than bart's, and i didn't have help from a nerd! i'm my own nerd!"
49482,Lisa,it all adds up. i am the gem that will bring world peace! how brilliant of god to remove my skepticism by making me his chosen one!
50011,Lisa,i finally found the place i belong.
45956,Lisa,"dad, you're bleeding."
51935,Lisa,"bart, you can't go on like this."
42664,Lisa,world domination?
45722,Lisa,bite me.
52253,Lisa,"i'm sorry, bart. but if you got hurt or died, despite the extra attention i'd receive, i'd miss you."
49754,Lisa,i've never seen mr. burns this happy.
52012,Lisa,"well, i think she's gonna like my hand-made birthday card better."
46941,Lisa,"dad, it's just a bug."
51898,Lisa,why can't we have a meeting when you're watching tv?
42728,Lisa,"no you're not! uh, i'll come back tomorrow."
46086,Lisa,"no, bart. for all we know, hundreds of rescue workers are digging us out right now."
50139,Lisa,"edmund's almost here, so please nobody be themselves!"
51984,Lisa,this is better than our house!
50715,Lisa,looks like dad's not coming.
47300,Lisa,"dad, no! you turned into a roundabout!"
47977,Lisa,la la la la la la la laaaaaaa.
52252,Lisa,but captain murdock!
50789,Lisa,give that back!
50379,Lisa,raymondo! you forgive me!
50224,Lisa,really?
46721,Lisa,robert pinsky?! the former poet laureate?
48327,Lisa,"i know one, about the most important sea voyage in american history. the journey of the mayflower."
42902,Lisa,i'll do whatever it takes.
49469,Lisa,does your mother know you're using her minivan?
43972,Lisa,we've got to go down there and help dad!
41826,Lisa,"okay, okay."
42215,Lisa,how could you? i won't do it!
49861,Lisa,this isn't a dream. i really did fail.
42076,Lisa,but i'll practice every day!
42155,Lisa,peek-a-boo!
42686,Lisa,mmm corn. haven't had that in awhile.
43881,Lisa,"like, you know, whatever."
43625,Lisa,"c'mon, mom, you never treat yourself to anything."
44409,Lisa,"his name doesn't matter. ""a rose by any other name would smell as sweet."""
47658,Lisa,what the...?
45751,Lisa,"yes. yes you were. now, in conclusion, my administration will focus on the three r's: reading, 'riting and refilling the ocean. thank you very much."
41687,Lisa,where's mr. bergstrom?
44967,Lisa,"what's ""d.m.y.""?"
49172,Lisa,because you love the taste of my imaginary tea.
51753,Lisa,"now do you see why i'm a vegetarian, dad?"
48171,Lisa,one gelato for... the pretty girl.
50446,Lisa,"principal skinner, do you know anything about a bizarre hidden classroom underneath the school?"
45970,Lisa,"there you go, little fish."
50257,Lisa,it's beginning to look a lot like breakfast...
46728,Lisa,where is everybody?
50449,Lisa,"and now without further ado, i give you... this!!!"
51507,Lisa,"well... no, but now when i look at it all i'll see is a fraud."
43525,Lisa,"bart, you're in trouble! wake up!"
49608,Lisa,i thought you were studying the lincoln-douglas debates?
51528,Lisa,"dad, they're offering us an all-expenses paid trip to the greatest sporting event on earth!"
44641,Lisa,"no one, but if we're gonna survive, we need rules and order. let's not forget what we learned in the u.n. club."
43276,Lisa,nooooooo!
51089,Lisa,she sustained me!
46438,Lisa,yes.
48266,Lisa,and of course you'd never attack a fellow herbivore!
44571,Lisa,no burglar? / what? / what's he mean?
45987,Lisa,"well, um, i was thinking of going vegan!"
43075,Lisa,"dad, this clears you completely!"
48991,Lisa,no.
50547,Lisa,everything i believed about young adult literature is a lie!
49128,Lisa,"you know, spiritually speaking, grandma's ashes won't know where they've been thrown from... so, in a way... uh... i'm lying down now."
41815,Lisa,"""the city of washington was built on a stagnant swamp some 200 years ago, and very little has changed. it stank then, and it stinks now. only today, it is the fetid stench of corruption that hangs in the air."""
49197,Lisa,"mom, ""bart"" has something to tell you."
50199,Lisa,"people of springfield, as a nerd, i understand your desire for revenge, but this sweet, harmless man is not the same remorseless monster who tormented us all."
47639,Lisa,"all right, nelson. what kind of journalism skills do you have?"
47356,Lisa,bart! on't-day ell-tay om-may uffi-ray as-hay e-say e-days.
48559,Lisa,dad's ending is better.
50862,Lisa,noooo!
42947,Lisa,"you know, itchy and scratchy land isn't just for kids. they have a place called parents island."
47339,Lisa,"dad, you have to say something. something meaningful!"
46568,Lisa,"all right. look, maggie's not playing with this ball right now. but look what happens when i take it."
51745,Lisa,are there any side effects?
48139,Lisa,"oh, it had to be a boy, did it? you think a girl can't flip out? well, you're wrong!"
51236,Lisa,/
51420,Lisa,"no bart, no. do it and you'll always be known as the kid who ate the dead frog."
48107,Lisa,stupid movie schemes do not work in real life. mom and dad have a marriage on the rocks and they need to work through it in therapy to make sure it doesn't shatter.
52237,Lisa,"bart, the only reason to apologize is if you look deep down inside yourself and you find a spot, something you wish wasn't there, because you feel bad you hurt your sister's feelings."
48271,Lisa,i understand. i'll just read a magazine.
48733,Lisa,"mom, is dad stealing from people he's supposed to help?"
47846,Lisa,"how can you stand there eating snacks and being children, when the world's glaciers are vanishing?"
49739,Lisa,what about bart?
43677,Lisa,he was one of the evillest men of the 1780's. he even tried to kill george washington!
42594,Lisa,"the only way to get bart back is to kill the head vampire, mr. burns."
42704,Lisa,"come on, stacy. i've waited my whole life to hear you speak. don't you have anything relevant to say?"
42734,Lisa,"how about ""minerva,"" after the roman goddess of wisdom?"
51349,Lisa,what about obama? harry truman? bill clinton?
46854,Lisa,"dad, you're getting paint on your wedding ring."
46048,Lisa,pranksgiving? uh-oh...
41882,Lisa,peace on earth.
42190,Lisa,wow! my mother the actress. i feel like lucie arnaz-luckinbill.
51124,Lisa,"well i wasn't sure, so i got both. who knows her little milhouse?"
48253,Lisa,"so, how you doin', willie?"
42948,Lisa,"yeah. ""dancing, bowling, fashionable shops, over one hundred bars and saloons, and a world class chemical dependency center."""
47119,Lisa,you're not listening!
43612,Lisa,"mom, this fake snow is making me dizzy!"
49495,Lisa,i'll be less stressed! and i'm really freakin' stressed!
49858,Lisa,"an f?! okay, this is the time when i always wake up."
46455,Lisa,"lord, i'm not turning my back on you. i just need to find a temple that's free of corruption."
50936,Lisa,"finally, a place where you can spread your wings and hop."
50981,Lisa,"spinach farm, huh? that's right, you talk in your sleep."
51099,Lisa,and so i've learned that the only true batmen are christian bale and adam west. why are you washing bumblebee man's pants?
50057,Lisa,you're quitting school?!
43954,Lisa,"hello, mr. chipmunk! you're a northern reticulated chipmunk! yes, you are! you are so reticulated!"
50702,Lisa,"well, i did miss a few things about the grid... like everything!"
50232,Lisa,you mean your gingerbread mcmansion.
48957,Lisa,don't you weasel out on me!
43213,Lisa,why?
43687,Lisa,that's jebediah's secret confession. it proves he was a fraud.
45012,Lisa,you expect people to go to the bathroom in their living rooms?
42294,Lisa,i think you should do a new ad. one that's fresh and original.
45919,Lisa,but these fairy tales take me away from the harsh reality of peasant life.
46894,Lisa,universal studios?
45102,Lisa,but i-i might infect the other kids!
49076,Lisa,the man is an idiot!
43506,Lisa,"hi, dad. looking for me?"
44781,Lisa,"i don't need a co-anchor. i'm a straight ""a"" student."
51387,Lisa,nothing is easy to wrap. i have trouble with scissors!
45816,Lisa,"dad, help!"
44282,Lisa,dad! you're not supposed to have fun recycling. this is serious.
43907,Lisa,uh huh.
48089,Lisa,but i'm too smart to get scared.
46360,Lisa,we have to disable its central processor! c'mon!
46046,Lisa,i'm so proud! my dad will be the grand finale of the thanksgiving day parade.
45673,Lisa,"dad, bart, i played a horrible trick on you and i'm really sorry. you don't have leprosy. it's just oatmeal."
43359,Lisa,i don't want you to go!
47165,Lisa,"but he won't, because he's too cowardly."
44907,Lisa,playin' hot wheels.
43083,Lisa,"hey, hey, hey! stop it! stop it! why are you guys jumping to such ridiculous conclusions? haven't you heard of occam's razor? ""the simplest explanation is probably the correct one."""
45972,Lisa,you're ruining the earth.
51629,Lisa,i guess you're right.
44205,Lisa,why do you have to make this so hard?
50266,Lisa,bart?
46279,Lisa,this is why i can't have nice things.
49328,Lisa,"oh, they've found a home."
44473,Lisa,what position have you got for me?
44361,Lisa,"i am just calling home, i am not asking to come home."
49329,Lisa,you're older. why don't you do these fun activities?
47748,Lisa,"i've never disobeyed mom before. is this a step i'm really willing to take? i don't know. the more i think about it, the..."
45255,Lisa,"ugh, that antenna is an eyesore."
44707,Lisa,time is running out.
47143,Lisa,did clara... tell you anything else?
45464,Lisa,ewww. mom!
52182,Lisa,"hi, mrs. norton."
47215,Lisa,why can't i tinker with the fabric of existence?
47455,Lisa,rice? why not caviar?
50433,Lisa,so how come we have all these other keys?
52139,Lisa,don't you see what's happening here? they're fattening us up so they can eat us.
43401,Lisa,dedicated educator principal seymour skinner. his school lost millions when burns pirated its oil well; and grounds-tender groundskeeper willie. he lost his job and his dream of owning a fine crystal slop bucket.
47261,Lisa,"boy, this key opens everything."
48221,Lisa,our instruments are rusting!
50313,Lisa,"it's okay, grampa -- you don't have to act grumpy. i know you're taking the drug, and i don't mind -- because you're happy."
47011,Lisa,free college?
44611,Lisa,ugh! one of them's playing my saxophone!
51946,Lisa,i choose not to participate.
52247,Lisa,stop!
44201,Lisa,"mag-gie, if you come down, i'll give you some more cof-fee."
44018,Lisa,"""nuke the whales?"" you don't really believe that, do you?"
48100,Lisa,"dad, i thought mom kicked you out of the house."
49911,Lisa,"bart, can you believe that something so mighty has been rendered so powerless?"
50730,Lisa,with great difficulty!
45106,Lisa,"""mr. toad has a red blank."" okay, skip that one. ""mr. blank needs a blank in order to blank his blank."" i am in deep blank."
48603,Lisa,"the point, dad, is that when you take revenge, you become just as bad as the person you harm."
44419,Lisa,yeah. except you were supposed to be telling the story of how i got my saxophone!
49974,Lisa,"when there's cruelty involved, bart sure knows his history."
48470,Lisa,"okay, guys. no one knows you're here, so be quiet. and if you get hungry, there are rats living in the christmas decorations."
43039,Lisa,"cut it out, bart!"
51462,Lisa,"more for mom, but yes."
46926,Lisa,lady penelope ariel-ponyweather.
48406,Lisa,all i'm saying is--
52075,Lisa,"bart, i'm starting to think you're right. krusty was framed. did he have any enemies?"
43831,Lisa,"bart, no!"
44398,Lisa,"look at all those beautiful shoes! i know they're made from animals, but wow!"
51060,Lisa,this class doesn't give demerits.
44227,Lisa,what are you doing now?!
45118,Lisa,"actually, there are four plusses."
42159,Lisa,how could this have happened? i feel so dirty. uh.. uh...uh. the dirt's not coming off. okay. calm down. this must just be a little typo.
50304,Lisa,"dad, look! this essence of a wildflower makes these angry scorpions docile!"
46562,Lisa,greta called. it seems you told her you were sick.
46974,Lisa,ow! indian burn!
48532,Lisa,i'd like that. i'd like it a lot.
42655,Lisa,"wake up, dad! wake up! there was a burglar and he took my saxophone."
44730,Lisa,"uh, i am! i'm strongly opposed to... proposition, uh, 3-0-5..."
42811,Lisa,skinny kids...
42773,Lisa,a deer!
47122,Lisa,i'm sure she'd be happier without someone sitting on her back all day.
46133,Lisa,are you sure you want me to be your doubles partner?
52125,Lisa,i can feel an evil presence in this house.
45815,Lisa,ow!
51769,Lisa,not right now.
51415,Lisa,not to.
52137,Lisa,"hey, how come we never see you guys eat?"
42790,Lisa,that's guilt. you feel guilty because your stunt wound up costing a man his job.
45657,Lisa,you mean like when you hid inside the conga drum to scare ricky?
48026,Lisa,"dad, i don't think you realize what you've done. you've totally humiliated the best friend the simpsons ever had."
43282,Lisa,he's giving them a bath!
43280,Lisa,let's go find your babies!
45169,Lisa,"wow, you look really hungover, dad. what did you do last night?"
47871,Lisa,i've realized how much i missed you -- and i can see from this magnificent lisa statue that you felt the same way.
44989,Lisa,enjoy the dance.
49841,Lisa,now what are you up to?
43884,Lisa,"well, it beats doing stuff."
51540,Lisa,don't put more in there!
45216,Lisa,eww.
48438,Lisa,"fat tony, it's not important what other people think of you. what matters is how you feel, inside!"
44023,Lisa,hardly.
48814,Lisa,i don't see anything suspicious... except someone is loudly unwrapping their candy.
41821,Lisa,"dad, do you know what schadenfreude is?"
45254,Lisa,"dad, don't do that!"
50051,Lisa,"well, whoever your mysterious donor is, he, or she, really wants you to succeed."
50843,Lisa,i was thinking amateurs only.
43181,Lisa,i didn't turn it on. i thought you turned it on.
48549,Lisa,"oh dad, i'm tired. we'll read more tomorrow."
51668,Lisa,this whole building is just a façade for a drilling operation.
43652,Lisa,you gotta hand it to krusty.
44427,Lisa,you have thirteen pickled eggs in this jar! and one cockroach!
46681,Lisa,"bart, this is just dad!"
51907,Lisa,arrrgh!
47754,Lisa,i'm not a journalist.
44585,Lisa,"that was pretty bad, bart / but it could've been worse / you could have been carrying a sequined purse!"
48927,Lisa,a story suitable for children!
47878,Lisa,i don't know about that -- i'm considered pretty smart.
50024,Lisa,arts camp was lovely.
44570,Lisa,bail out!
42905,Lisa,perfect!
44255,Lisa,"mo-om!! prohibition may be unpopular, but it's the law and we still have to--"
43015,Lisa,"no, bart. i just think you and jessica are too different from each other to get along. she's a sweet, kind reverend's daughter and you're the devil's cabana boy."
50601,Lisa,"you're not licked, krusty. people love a comeback. look at robert downey junior... mickey rourke..."
48458,Lisa,"mom, i'm gonna lose it! bart's on the cover of both local jazz magazines: ""blowin'"" and ""the sugar sheet""."
51129,Lisa,i don't know... it's four days old... i just ate...
49934,Lisa,ew! ew! ew! ew! ew!
49334,Lisa,see ya!
51386,Lisa,"okay bart, open your present. it's the one i'm most excited about."
48751,Lisa,"good work, database."
41698,Lisa,but i need you too.
46684,Lisa,what up?
52022,Lisa,mm! delicioso!
52381,Lisa,that's gross.
52449,Lisa,can i dye my shoes pink?
46001,Lisa,"it's okay, mom! i have a safety line!"
51844,Lisa,"well i wish you wouldn't because aside from the fact that he has the same frailties as all human beings, he's the only father i have. therefore he is my model of manhood and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my adult relationships. so i hope you bear in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me. and i am far to young to defend myself against such onslaughts."
48950,Lisa,oh my god!
44761,Lisa,"i think you're a hero, dad."
44317,Lisa,"i don't want to talk to you, mr. burns."
47522,Lisa,where's your costume?
44340,Lisa,okay.
44103,Lisa,me too.
49962,Lisa,the end.
41963,Lisa,is it sherri?
50214,Lisa,"or, more likely, the phone number of the bird's owner."
52296,Lisa,okay. uh... how did dad propose to you?
49322,Lisa,i'm going home. give me the keys to my bike lock.
46268,Lisa,dr. bushwell!
44900,Lisa,you broke it!
44896,Lisa,ohmigosh! it's the mysterious orb of isis.
43599,Lisa,"do i understand you correctly, bartron? do you wish me to release you from the helmet of evil thoughts with my enchanted space wand?"
51553,Lisa,maybe you're not cut out for competitive eating.
51293,Lisa,a spitwad?
42598,Lisa,it's so nice having everything back to normal.
43682,Lisa,miss hoover thought i made the whole thing up. she called me a p.c. thug.
44880,Lisa,look out!
47548,Lisa,he's probably in costume -- he could be any of these people!
43989,Lisa,you've done a lot of crazy stuff over the years and she's stood by you. why would she leave you now?
46520,Lisa,francis of assisi .
44760,Lisa,i told him that photo would come back to haunt him.
46850,Lisa,we're building homes for the homeless.
48152,Lisa,"yeah, i warned you about that."
46100,Lisa,i make a lot of graphs.
47297,Lisa,yes.
49475,Lisa,from this angle they're words!
43308,Lisa,pointless.
46713,Lisa,"um... of course. where do you think i go, baby school?"
48491,Lisa,"hmm, well i think your golem doesn't like hurting people. and i'll prove it."
50860,Lisa,and i have to ask... has anyone seen the cat?
47284,Lisa,"well, what can i be?"
52262,Lisa,maybe there's something else to do on this planet.
48495,Lisa,"just write a scroll, asking him to stop."
49635,Lisa,"well, i didn't kill mrs. krabappel!"
50833,Lisa,"now you listen to me, bart. milhouse may not be the perfect date..."
46934,Lisa,they must have come from over there.
48964,Lisa,give me an indian burn!
49337,Lisa,"i need some candy for a first playdate, but i don't want to come on too strong."
44281,Lisa,i could still use more paper.
45720,Lisa,why do jerks think everyone wants to see their stupid name?
43158,Lisa,"yes, bart. why don't you try it and see?"
44481,Lisa,i got it.
43414,Lisa,"that's it! oh, mr. pigeon, i'd kiss you if you weren't swimming with disease."
46303,Lisa,my dad's not here? i need a ride to school.
45682,Lisa,do we have any food that wasn't brutally slaughtered?
48480,Lisa,now it's a collection of candle kiosks and persian cd stores.
46993,Lisa,"except when pronounced like ""a,"" as in ""neighbor"" and ""weigh."""
46073,Lisa,"i dunno, mom. i think they're up to something..."
42126,Lisa,see for yourself.
44848,Lisa,yes!
42172,Lisa,i meant soon.
47598,Lisa,how romantic. you and dad were drawn to each other as kids and you didn't even realize it.
49953,Lisa,blondie?
42122,Lisa,"what a beautiful story, sideshow bob. you're living proof that our revolving door prison system works."
45205,Lisa,"mom, this was made in 1967. they're probably out of business."
42548,Lisa,"no, someone who didn't deserve it."
49406,Lisa,"i was describing beautiful fish, bart!"
45104,Lisa,test?
46078,Lisa,"nice work, everybody!"
48852,Lisa,that's not the milhouse i know.
43134,Lisa,mom! make dad tell the story right.
46544,Lisa,she's not on drugs. she couldn't sleep because of dad's chronic snoring.
44472,Lisa,"hey, tubby. want another pop-tart, tubby?"
51648,Lisa,really bart?
45297,Lisa,"hi, dad. how was it?"
44895,Lisa,have you ever seen such exquisite ushabtis?
50704,Lisa,dad? dad?
44776,Lisa,"come on, this isn't a joke. all over town, kids are just waking up from their naps, cranky and hungry for the news."
50596,Lisa,why can't we visit a real museum? one that doesn't have the skeletons of the three stooges in the lobby?
42352,Lisa,"ahhh, i can see the music."
43955,Lisa,"hi, mrs. owl! you're out kind of early!"
51949,Lisa,"it's not that kind of sad. i'm sorry, dad, but you wouldn't understand."
46197,Lisa,"yeah, she's a real purist."
49978,Lisa,another springfield family moves to detroit to find a better life.
51127,Lisa,bart! milhouse!
43865,Lisa,"well, it's kind of funny... with all the craziness and confusion and mishegoss of packing... ha... i forgot to pack."
41784,Lisa,"okay, america. inspire me."
49175,Lisa,what are you two doing in the laundry room?
43587,Lisa,"high-toned voice. bart, that's it. i know where sideshow bob is hiding."
50991,Lisa,this is a pretty important decision.
44959,Lisa,"oh, then, at the risk of being unpopular, i think i'm gonna have to say..."
49959,Lisa,i ha--
41776,Lisa,daaad!
46833,Lisa,"oh, forget it. hey, how do we get back?"
51807,Lisa,"hashtag ""springfield pride"" has never ever trend-ed."
51043,Lisa,why are you so mean to me?
51857,Lisa,"not i.d., dad. id. it's a word."
47728,Lisa,that was you.
44248,Lisa,"hello, world's worst babysitter speaking."
44890,Lisa,see the isis exhibit. but the museum's closed.
51031,Lisa,kirk? don't you have something to tell her?
44993,Lisa,"all right, all right. d.m.y."
44934,Lisa,"well, you'll definitely want to get yourself a good doll. the new malibu stacy has an achievable chest."
42475,Lisa,"bart, they rejected our script."
52385,Lisa,do not feed animals. do not allow animals in the car. do not make eye contact with animals.
52256,Lisa,and i'm going over to janey's again. we're going to be... um... making the most of our childhood years.
46400,Lisa,do you really think the turkey's just gonna climb onto the plate?
47400,Lisa,didn't you read mom's book?
42758,Lisa,you all seem to be forgetting the most important thing. which is that it's wrong to imprison an animal.
42328,Lisa,"oh, what a boon it could be for our under-funded public schools."
50640,Lisa,"so, since i had no friends, i assembled a motley crew of the friendless to help me construct my social network. did we become friends? no."
48883,Lisa,sideshow bob!
47999,Lisa,"i'm in the final two / i should be happy / but all i want to do / is spend more time with my pappy... now that you're gone, dad, i miss you so much / and your threats against teamsters and techies and such / your management style is like attila the hun / you were vicious, malicious, but you got the job done..."
47085,Lisa,"mr. mayor, you can't flip-flop on this! we'll miss the meteor shower."
48349,Lisa,"but... isn't it? i mean, confidence building can't replace real learning!"
48665,Lisa,what if we're not here?
51336,Lisa,you got it.
43857,Lisa,grown-up nerds like gore vidal. and even he's kissed more boys than i ever will.
46655,Lisa,"excuse me, we're looking for this little boy."
44187,Lisa,thanks for the ride!
50916,Lisa,but i'm a vegetarian!
51276,Lisa,"lisa. guys, do you realize you're being exploited by this team?"
46144,Lisa,"you got all your equipment, dad?"
43995,Lisa,it does not!
46160,Lisa,how could you soil the good name of star blitzzz promotions?
44221,Lisa,"bart, are you okay?!"
48819,Lisa,hey-ey-ey-ey-ey!
49470,Lisa,that's tonight!
46171,Lisa,yaaayy!
48032,Lisa,"guards, take him to the tower!"
46698,Lisa,my bad.
50150,Lisa,principal skinner? quick question. is it true my mom was a great student?
45393,Lisa,doesn't anybody in this town read?
47490,Lisa,i miss them all so much.
47833,Lisa,"why don't we legalize same-sex marriage? we can attract a growing segment of the marriage market, and strike a blow for civil rights."
51472,Lisa,"i've never had a pet of my very own! my clock is ticking! i don't wanna be one of those girls who waits till she's sixteen to decide if she's ready, and then it's too late."
46932,Lisa,let's just get some sleep.
49097,Lisa,this is it! my premiere!
47668,Lisa,"this is so sweet, but i've learned one little paper can't make a difference in this world."
44479,Lisa,"dad, that was really mean."
51961,Lisa,"no, that's okay, dad. i'll just work on my fingering. unless my fingers clacking on the keys is too loud for you."
45109,Lisa,"well, actually, i do feel a little feverish."
50575,Lisa,you could never have printed your version of the book without the publisher's password...
52310,Lisa,"dad, i think that's pretty spurious."
46368,Lisa,alakazai dragon fly!
43129,Lisa,daaad!
41983,Lisa,fifty big ones?
47986,Lisa,"but dad, you don't need to help me by humiliating people."
43562,Lisa,"oh, you didn't dumb it down! you said ""rapport!"""
44154,Lisa,where are the dice?
41820,Lisa,the flanders are having a beef-a-thon! incredible ned-ibles! maude-acious vittles!.
51118,Lisa,chocolate or regular?
47664,Lisa,"well, at least there's nothing else burns can do to me."
44134,Lisa,why is that mirror sneezing?
52354,Lisa,get my homework from mrs. hoover.
47950,Lisa,um... maybe mom's the way to go.
43209,Lisa,no. it couldn't be...
49117,Lisa,doctor.
50735,Lisa,"hear, hear!"
48413,Lisa,"evolution and creationism cannot co-exist, people. it is time to go back to teaching one single truth!"
48269,Lisa,maybe mr. smithers will help us.
43211,Lisa,i read at a 78th grade level.
45576,Lisa,"oh, a name with ""fun""? um... fungus, funzo, attila the fun..."
46737,Lisa,two million.
45083,Lisa,much better.
52047,Lisa,i'm defending a country where people can think and act and worship any way they want.
49654,Lisa,"time has passed. children play in the streets. at night, there is music and laughter."
48789,Lisa,not true. you've got the guts -- and i've got a web cam! this time you can tell the truth...
42631,Lisa,"dad, why are you singing?"
49052,Lisa,come on.
47006,Lisa,"some of us still enjoy scripted comedy, sir."
45145,Lisa,"oh, come on."
42929,Lisa,tickets to the krusty anniversary show!
47724,Lisa,i'd like that.
50974,Lisa,you didn't?! is there no limit to your disrespect?
47659,Lisa,dad! mr. burns cut our power -- now i can't print my paper!
47139,Lisa,... so i sent luke's sister down the wrong trail and... hey! where'd all this water come from? there used to be a trail here! and there used to be a beaver dam there.
50287,Lisa,the most comfortable ergonomic chair there is.
48379,Lisa,"fine, i'll beat up ralph."
47448,Lisa,"it used to be the ""leaning tower of pizza."""
46700,Lisa,forget it. i'm going home.
49779,Lisa,i saw you grooving to the beat! you gotta pay for that!
46764,Lisa,we could come with you.
48642,Lisa,and that's how a presidential veto gets overridden. any questions?
48652,Lisa,"krusty, the spuckler kids missed their reading class today."
47742,Lisa,"oh, mom, don't feel bad. everybody appreciates your... uh-oh, i'm late for my dinner... with chloe!"
47684,Lisa,"""...but screw them, you're in! congratulations!"""
51498,Lisa,she is?
45791,Lisa,"you're too much, bart. that's why i'm appointing you ""secretary of keeping it real."""
45941,Lisa,killer dolphins?
45178,Lisa,meh.
46103,Lisa,"oh, no. he wouldn't!"
42065,Lisa,to the game.
44847,Lisa,"oh, all right."
52236,Lisa,just tell me you're sorry.
49650,Lisa,"oh my god. if bart could eat the burger and survive, then maybe he can yield the key to an anti-muncher vaccine!"
46146,Lisa,"wait, what was that?"
50347,Lisa,sounds like most of the house is still owned by the bank.
46558,Lisa,i will not be a gamecock!
52328,Lisa,is too.
48382,Lisa,forgive me for this.
45003,Lisa,there you are in outer space. that's pretty impressive.
50145,Lisa,"dad, i think maggie's just sad 'cause her set is missing ""baby must-have."""
52055,Lisa,he brought us gifts. his first unselfish act.
42240,Lisa,i'm tired of being a corporate shill.
52526,Lisa,i'd just throw in the towel and make it a state.
48995,Lisa,do you think mine...
50703,Lisa,"maureen dowd, we've got a lot of catching up to do."
48398,Lisa,"dad, we don't want you to leave!"
41774,Lisa,"bye, bye, leon / bye, roomie / bye, pardner / you're a credit to dementia!"
48037,Lisa,"that's latin, dad. the language of plutarch."
48444,Lisa,"hey bart, you wanna jam with me?"
45582,Lisa,"this broom closet is not what it seems. it's a secret surveillance room, guarded by a tiny, evil robot."
43054,Lisa,"okay. then i'm going to start kicking air like this. and if any part of you should fill that air, it's your own fault."
44670,Lisa,it's just a joke.
46877,Lisa,bread tastes like clothes.
52078,Lisa,with all our hearts!
46729,Lisa,"i just wanted to belong! for once, i felt i was with intellectual equals."
46177,Lisa,there's all kinds of ways to get the public on your side. bob dylan wrote songs. cesar chavez staged hunger strikes.
45368,Lisa,"hey, mom, look!"
51761,Lisa,"well, i guess we've learned that of all the countless planets in the universe, we have evolved into the most inedible species. like three bean salad at a barbecue, we will remain untouched."
47421,Lisa,"look, we can go inside!"
42377,Lisa,what do you say to a boy to let him know you're not interested?
42901,Lisa,oh who am i kidding? there's no way i'm ever gonna beat allison!
48657,Lisa,"check out this pinball machine! ""chevy chase in 'foul play'."""
50104,Lisa,"okay, everyone study two-out situations, count management, and i'll be back with some gluten-free crackers."
48341,Lisa,"okay, the engine room is just through this flooded area. somebody has to take the rope, swim through to the other side, and tie it off so we can use it as an underwater guide line."
52134,Lisa,"look, i know that to you we simpsons are a lower order of life. we face that prejudice every day of our lives, but we are happy on our little planet. we throw ourselves on your mercy. please return us to..."
49419,Lisa,they're all equally valid! but that can't be. in life everything only has one answer!
50365,Lisa,you are? why?
50098,Lisa,fine. i was hoping you and your friends could tell me something about baseball strategy.
47022,Lisa,"my one chance for everyone to like me, and i blew it."
49404,Lisa,so dad's life would have been the same! he would have married mom and worked for mr. burns. it would have been a push!
44247,Lisa,"eh, well, that's okay. i can always sell seeds. do you want some seeds?"
42509,Lisa,o.j.
51131,Lisa,"aw, that's sweet."
49189,Lisa,mom! bart's flicking boogers on me!
50995,Lisa,what's that stone around your neck?
42607,Lisa,"hey, dad, i think state and federal laws require us to have a baby-sitter."
50778,Lisa,um... thank you for noticing me?
49371,Lisa,how did you find this place?
42574,Lisa,wait! doesn't my father have the right to a fair trial?
46590,Lisa,this game makes no sense.
45985,Lisa,my name's lisa simpson. i think your protest was incredibly brave.
44886,Lisa,what?
46053,Lisa,"okay, you're ready to go. i've written down the basic commands so that anyone can understand them."
48489,Lisa,"dad, no! it could teach us the secret of interstellar travel!"
46064,Lisa,are you really gonna drink that?
42431,Lisa,"please, mother. it's purely in the interest of science."
45364,Lisa,how could you miss that huge boat coming right at us?
47168,Lisa,it's good to have you back with the simpsons.
42742,Lisa,"how doth the hero, strong and brave, a celestial path in the heavens pave!"
48200,Lisa,"dad, the phantom isn't in this."
49029,Lisa,"i'm delivering your scout gal cookies, mayor quimby! that'll be thirty dollars!"
45023,Lisa,so what prize did you end up getting?
48460,Lisa,that might work.
44310,Lisa,what's going on?
46719,Lisa,mm. mom's not gonna like that.
48699,Lisa,you can't give me a yellow card?! you're my father!
49427,Lisa,did you remember to disconnect it first?
44593,Lisa,ding ding ding ding ding...
44852,Lisa,that's one small step f-- whoa!
41659,Lisa,i'm in a coffee house listening to poetry! there's a cat on a table and no one seems to care! this is the single greatest day of my life.
45834,Lisa,"wow, look at all the stars you can see here."
43472,Lisa,ah... miss hoover? i don't think i can dissect an animal. i think it's wrong.
49740,Lisa,"so grampa, you really saved dad's life?"
48498,Lisa,"yeah. it was an orson welles radio play of ""war of the worlds."""
47309,Lisa,elatiors.
42889,Lisa,why would they come to our concert just to boo us?
47245,Lisa,to fight for kid-power / i must be heard not seen / i have to lead wisely / not just primp and preen!
47158,Lisa,why does a dog have human girlfriends?
50082,Lisa,but i'm only in second grade.
49919,Lisa,a little.
49840,Lisa,racists?
42342,Lisa,yayyy!
49146,Lisa,long john seltzer!
47772,Lisa,no!
47113,Lisa,...walking in a winter wonderland.
51067,Lisa,my bully is my teacher.
42690,Lisa,they made dad sicky-mart.
52050,Lisa,"well, okay."
44165,Lisa,then you must have had your eyes closed when you embezzled it.
42199,Lisa,"no, no, that's too much."
48701,Lisa,"but, but..."
42088,Lisa,shove it.
49137,Lisa,to make bart a krusketeer?
49059,Lisa,"wow, you did learn a lot at 4-h."
46024,Lisa,nooo!
51223,Lisa,you weren't shot!
51910,Lisa,it's not the money as much as the feeling that we earned it.
50485,Lisa,"ew, dad! wait a minute... can you pass gas at will? fart once for no, twice for yes."
41622,Lisa,let's eat maggie.
47285,Lisa,okay.
50376,Lisa,"raymondo, i am so sorry. i got rolled by a pro! do you know what it's like to be the kind of girl that boys never talk to and then suddenly a boy talks to you--"
43667,Lisa,"i was right about jebediah, and now i can prove it."
51588,Lisa,you don't want to be here.
45309,Lisa,"wait, people are coming. i think they're jehovah's witnesses."
42669,Lisa,"thank you. and thank you, dad. you got it back, just like you said you would."
51345,Lisa,"okay, i'm a liberal. and sometimes that's a dirty word."
50878,Lisa,because they can't let me have a secret. it drives them crazy.
51017,Lisa,"you know mom, i was thinking we could take maggie downtown. ""the jazz hole"" is featuring a dizzy gillespie tribute band. their trumpeter has the puffiest cheeks..."
49850,Lisa,"thanks, dad. but you're so loud it's hurting my ears."
45609,Lisa,your toy company is evil.
50599,Lisa,krusty?
44536,Lisa,"ugh, i wish i'd never found those stupid bones! it's time to put an end to this. bart, i'm borrowing your blue crowbar."
49156,Lisa,i don't recognize any of them.
47857,Lisa,"hey, this really works."
50585,Lisa,proceed to the page with the butterfly bookmark as i cuddle up with madame bunny.
50597,Lisa,"hm, they're selling off all the old tv relics."
49098,Lisa,i'm lisa simpson. and this is my family.
46621,Lisa,i want my mommy!
42696,Lisa,"i'm sorry, apu. but remember, who needs a kwik-e-mart--"
49424,Lisa,huh?
46931,Lisa,how could you?
42899,Lisa,"look, bart. it almost killed me, but i hand-crafted all seventy-five characters from oliver twist. and now the coup de grace - a bitter snowstorm."
51004,Lisa,"what i'm saying applies to you too, dad."
47328,Lisa,i tried the coat hanger again. i don't understand why we only try ideas once.
44043,Lisa,i think they're giving up.
41938,Lisa,the wax never lies.
47596,Lisa,"dad, i think you created a hero that even you couldn't live up to."
47892,Lisa,oh boy!
50782,Lisa,"y'know, it seems like more than a coincidence that milhouse brought it to our attention."
44138,Lisa,adding a new character is often a desperate attempt to boost low ratings.
47572,Lisa,"yeah, i can't sleep. maybe we should give mom and dad a break. you know, go spend the day in an amusement park so we're out of their hair."
45291,Lisa,"wow, i've been a cat, a tree, and cokie roberts! it's happening again! i wonder where i'm going this time."
42785,Lisa,"just trying to fill the void of random, meaningless destruction that bart's absence has left in our hearts."
43801,Lisa,ah! ah! ah! stop! stop!
50490,Lisa,"okay, first letter ""d."" next letter: a-b-c-d-e-"
50618,Lisa,no question about it.
46652,Lisa,"mom, these are slums. the government just painted them bright colors so the tourists wouldn't be offended."
45659,Lisa,we better check with a doctor.
46415,Lisa,"some people enjoy being alone, mom."
48801,Lisa,"i'm so proud of you, dad!"
49366,Lisa,i can't see juliet anymore?! i thought you wanted me to have a best friend.
49888,Lisa,if they're anybody's children they're mine!
51917,Lisa,"here, otto, i made an extra one for you."
51277,Lisa,they sell your posters...workout dvds...and all of your practices are broadcast on a webcam.
44998,Lisa,"oh, act your age."
45466,Lisa,"no way... ""the seven habits of highly effective pre-teens?"" is this all because of the...?"
42649,Lisa,does this mean you'll help me with my costume?
43910,Lisa,me.
47052,Lisa,me too. the walls are paper-thin.
45457,Lisa,"ah! dad, you're headed for the harbor!"
48680,Lisa,it's eleven at night and i can't get to sleep!
47898,Lisa,how do you know that's their blimp?
43117,Lisa,you're experiencing spiritual emptiness because your power has isolated you from other human beings.
45572,Lisa,"aw, the zoning disk is warped..."
41916,Lisa,"oh look. you haven't touched your salt lick. num num, good salt lick."
52038,Lisa,i wonder when dad's coming home?
43891,Lisa,"well, we could do something fun. um, how 'bout a beach party?"
41931,Lisa,everything.
42257,Lisa,what's wrong?
42789,Lisa,muffin.
47776,Lisa,"if you're feeling depressed, do what i do and write something. a novel, a play..."
52116,Lisa,is too.
52452,Lisa,can i have wine?
41675,Lisa,you'd better hope they say yes!
47260,Lisa,key release boilerplate? i find that very hard to believe.
48653,Lisa,"cletus, i think you're spending too much of the kids' earnings on yourself."
52229,Lisa,"yeah, beg me, bart. beg me!"
46083,Lisa,"look, the sea captain's all hunkered down."
44116,Lisa,do we have to?
42753,Lisa,"hi, mom."
50341,Lisa,where am i? this neighborhood is starting to look a little bit like... sesame street.
42072,Lisa,homemaker?!
49331,Lisa,"lower your expectations, lisa. public program, public program..."
47745,Lisa,it's gonna be a let-down going to school tomorrow. we have to make a pilgrim out of felt.
44723,Lisa,like you!!
51294,Lisa,"well, at least i'm getting some attention."
48946,Lisa,"grab onto this! c'mon, wake up!"
42524,Lisa,no they don't.
49191,Lisa,my family's here!
47080,Lisa,"hi, i'm trying to reduce light pollution."
50182,Lisa,count me in!
43103,Lisa,fine.
49219,Lisa,": fdr's middle name... ""delano."" ""oxidized surface""... well that's ""rusty."" ""bartenders serve them 'dirty'""..."
46631,Lisa,why must you fight with every utility?
45875,Lisa,you mean i danced all by myself?
46425,Lisa,"dad, what's wrong?"
45703,Lisa,"i hope you enjoy your plaque, cheater."
52130,Lisa,why are you trying to scare us? are you trying to keep us from getting close to you... maybe even loving you?
46546,Lisa,"mom, did you sleep well at your sisters'?"
50443,Lisa,"it's like five classrooms in one! a science room... student lounge... mathnasium... an experimental theater! all set for a production of samuel beckett's ""endgame""!"
43658,Lisa,"""rory b. bellows, slip eight!"" let's go!"
48880,Lisa,that voice!
48986,Lisa,"i based my costume on the books, not the movies."
42870,Lisa,i'm going for first chair this year.
50980,Lisa,"you're letting your friends go hang because you are lazy, and selfish, and-- hey, are you falling asleep just to spite me?!"
51306,Lisa,franklin roosevelt bravely instituted a series of reforms called the new deal...
48122,Lisa,i'm worried about mom. she's been sitting there just petting the dog for two hours.
45080,Lisa,"ah, this is my kind of aisle -- soy substitute... whizless cheese... oven-roasted cud!"
43238,Lisa,"uh, mom, we've got my wedding dress fitting this afternoon. maggie, if you're not doing anything, why don't you come with us?"
48194,Lisa,more like jailed at sing sing!
42897,Lisa,you're finished already? but the competition isn't for weeks.
41674,Lisa,those girls are snotty and shallow. tell them off!
44674,Lisa,me too...
49541,Lisa,tofu cubes... tidy joes... chili con cottage cheese...
44602,Lisa,this isn't very scary.
51189,Lisa,that's not right.
51194,Lisa,"dad, what's that on your lap?!"
49971,Lisa,we must rid ourselves of these outdated clichés. not all blondes are dumb! not all fat people are jolly.
45942,Lisa,plus all that sewage we keep dumping.
49612,Lisa,"someone's gotta stop her from going through with this fight. this goes against every feminist bone in my body, but dad, can't you control your woman?"
47150,Lisa,oh! someone is spying on us!
50912,Lisa,it's not the vegetarianism!
42909,Lisa,"after the way i've behaved, i don't deserve to win."
45353,Lisa,shhh. don't wake them.
45498,Lisa,we can find him faster by splitting up. you take fried foods. you take salty snacks. i'll take desserts. break!
50123,Lisa,"okay, okay, he's stolen third. but surely that's the limit of his cockiness..."
42792,Lisa,"i think you need skinner, bart. everybody needs a nemesis. sherlock holmes had his dr. moriarty. mountain dew has its mello-yello. even maggie has that baby with the one eyebrow."
41794,Lisa,what did you do to it?
50390,Lisa,"dad, aunt selma's treating a mob boss like an ordinary taxpayer."
46038,Lisa,"oh dad, you have to stop."
43892,Lisa,"don't have a cow, man!"
49105,Lisa,"oh... hi, mr. jarmusch."
45896,Lisa,"i had no business hosting the oscars. after the show, meryl streep spit on me."
41646,Lisa,"ohh, it's a ball of yarn. that's funny, i feel like batting it around."
47885,Lisa,"well, i think -- in these days of petro-terrorists and ozone depletion -- a sunday drive reeks of bio-hubris."
49768,Lisa,but he does look lonely all by himself...
48762,Lisa,"sir, we have to call off this bake sale, now!"
48582,Lisa,it's not over yet!
51839,Lisa,"can we go too, dad?"
47140,Lisa,how can we get across?!
47679,Lisa,"dad, would you like some of my snicker-bar cheesecake?"
45181,Lisa,"/ ohh, yeahhhh."
47132,Lisa,"i can't believe luke has another gal. ""my name is clara... i've known luke for more than five days..."""
51365,Lisa,"krusty, are you broke?"
49139,Lisa,so do a global change?
50378,Lisa,"oh, you think i'm pretty?"
43608,Lisa,i think i'm having chest pains.
42930,Lisa,"no, thanks."
43897,Lisa,my yearbook! no!
49582,Lisa,could you?
47834,Lisa,"well, what about people of the opposite sex who want to get married?"
47786,Lisa,dad?...
43184,Lisa,"bart, i am so proud of you. you showed a sensitive side of yourself that can never be erased. from this day forward we are kindred spirits."
42036,Lisa,no way.
51401,Lisa,it's almost like having dad here. only with less growling when i go near his food.
49939,Lisa,dad? where did you get that boat?
50870,Lisa,achem!
51407,Lisa,they've found us!
49558,Lisa,"oh, their school system's the best. their auditorium and their gym are two different rooms!"
49492,Lisa,you told me we were gonna pick up trash by the freeway!
48562,Lisa,really?
42119,Lisa,these talking dinosaurs are more real than most real families on tv.
52352,Lisa,"i'll make it, mom. just tape my lunch box to my hand."
46876,Lisa,what's so good about it?
50420,Lisa,shut up! i just want to know what she's up to with milhouse. a girl like her could get a fifth grader -- maybe even kyle lobianco!
45539,Lisa,"wait, dad, you don't have to kill yourself."
49347,Lisa,"now we need a name for our imaginary kingdom -- i mean, queendom."
46486,Lisa,i can really celebrate christmas?
47445,Lisa,i think i'm gonna use this card right now.
42767,Lisa,"it's perfect, dad."
46004,Lisa,"oh, seven o'clock. the family's just sitting down to dinner."
51471,Lisa,please.
45563,Lisa,"dad, they have those everywhere."
42207,Lisa,"dad, do you think i'm ugly?"
50896,Lisa,shoo!
42964,Lisa,"yeah, best ever."
44701,Lisa,grampa!
43930,Lisa,"hey, these aren't waffles -- these are just square pancakes!"
48337,Lisa,we're the band. and we're on!
44875,Lisa,"no, thanks!"
45835,Lisa,"too hot to bicker, i reckon."
48072,Lisa,i know. i'm sorry.
48689,Lisa,"i fell in love with the game when i saw ""bend it like beckham."""
42301,Lisa,i wish we lived in the kitty house.
48857,Lisa,"oh really? the more you deny it, the more i know it's true."
50955,Lisa,"dad, i just noticed something: you're not upset enough about this."
48183,Lisa,mozzarella! parmigiano! provolone! pecorino! gorgonzola! fontina! tallegio! bocconcini!
52343,Lisa,pony ride!
49576,Lisa,i didn't think i'd get a fresh start like this till junior high!
50121,Lisa,now get out there a kick a field goal! kidding!
46394,Lisa,"you keep digging like this, you're gonna go straight through to china."
43807,Lisa,no! old people deserve our respect! look at jacques cousteau and goldie hawn. you wouldn't shut them away like second-class citizens.
44553,Lisa,that's not true. you're thinking of airbags.
50160,Lisa,"are you a distraction, or a higher calling? all right, let's see. how many jazz musicians led long and happy lives? there's, um..."
47201,Lisa,just for that?
45688,Lisa,i'm princess margaret!
49561,Lisa,look at this place. it's everything i've ever dreamed of: on-campus stables!
47138,Lisa,need-help-now-come-with-me-done-something-terrible!
46524,Lisa,why don't you file a class-action suit?
51956,Lisa,is not.
42656,Lisa,you had a stamp collection?
42820,Lisa,"i think it's great you're a teacher, dad. so, will you be lecturing from a standardized text or using the more socratic method of interactive class participation?"
50288,Lisa,"'angry dad: the movie.' angry dad addresses the family from the top of the stairs."""
52413,Lisa,lisa simpson.
42212,Lisa,so you think i'm ugly?
42066,Lisa,you stink strawberry. we want home-run homer!
49904,Lisa,"dad, all it means is we're providing power to the electric company."
46916,Lisa,"well, maybe."
44552,Lisa,ah! dad! doesn't this car have seat belts?
42160,Lisa,"oh miss hoover, there appears to be a mistake on my report card. you gave me a b+ in conduct."
51370,Lisa,thank you.
47029,Lisa,what a sight! it happens every year like the swallows returning to capistrano.
51219,Lisa,i've told you that a million times!
45397,Lisa,i know that. it's also a constellation visible only from the southern hemisphere.
47437,Lisa,nothing.
49765,Lisa,excuse me? i think this fell off your hat.
47758,Lisa,"you're so smart, chloe!"
46269,Lisa,how could you exploit your beloved chimps like this?
46022,Lisa,"dear moe, if anything should ever happen to me, i want you to tear up my dad's tab, and pour cocktail onions... dad, i can't--"
52185,Lisa,"let's see, ""golf""... anecdotes, eisenhower and, fashion, humor, japanese obsession with... ah, here it is. putting."
50526,Lisa,goorsha!
42419,Lisa,"oh... i was just thinking of a joke i saw on ""herman's head."""
44181,Lisa,don't worry. a moth is no more harmful than a ladybug.
50392,Lisa,my lick.
41624,Lisa,"yeah, bart."
45562,Lisa,"""allen ginsburgers, un-american cheese sandwich, polio dogs..."""
49288,Lisa,it's a gift from mapple!
51693,Lisa,"dad, we have beer in our time!"
49757,Lisa,"please, at least try the tennis game."
46108,Lisa,i'm gonna wear my apron on the fourth of july.
44082,Lisa,you want an alien? this is your alien!
47368,Lisa,snowball!
50282,Lisa,huh. let's see what cousin jessica's up to.
48019,Lisa,why didn't we listen to dad?
46724,Lisa,this place is amazing! kiosks! outdoor study groups!
49102,Lisa,"oh, i was just trying to accurately portray my unique and quirky home life."
48608,Lisa,"""my great-great, great-great great grandmother was a native american. she was a member of the..."""
48245,Lisa,you're a smash g. k.!
46459,Lisa,yep.

45937,Lisa,"it's okay, they're gone now. you can..."
47932,Lisa,my hamster!
50137,Lisa,they're just dots in circles.
50788,Lisa,that's mine!
47828,Lisa,wait just a minute.
46205,Lisa,why does the school need to watch us all the time?
52204,Lisa,"mom, bart is on a strict diet of complex carbohydrates. steak will make him logy."
52433,Lisa,"yes! yes, mr. bergstrom?"
52020,Lisa,"oh, brother."
51836,Lisa,i do!
41643,Lisa,my first kiss! i always wondered what it would be like!
43465,Lisa,"no, i can't! i can't eat any of them!"
44171,Lisa,"bob, look!"
51782,Lisa,"no ideas? oh, that's sad."
52064,Lisa,"i'm watching sideshow bob. you know, he's a lot less patronizing than krusty used to be."
50922,Lisa,"you know, shrimp aren't all that removed from grasshoppers. they're both arthropods..."
47182,Lisa,i'm so proud of what you guys are doing. i even tipped off the local paper.
49314,Lisa,"ooh, another grobanite!"
43934,Lisa,"wow, it's almost like seeing into the future!"
44588,Lisa,"because he was singing, we overheard his plan / and could save those dogs from that mean old man."
47417,Lisa,we can't jump this ditch.
42474,Lisa,paper.
51570,Lisa,typical ralph nonsense.
51159,Lisa,"i guess bart must be a musical genius, because frauds are always found out. always."
45667,Lisa,"no, he isn't. i don't know where he is."
46670,Lisa,"that's true, bart. our father knows the best way to embarrass his kids."
42423,Lisa,"i propose to determine the answer to the question: ""is my brother dumber than a hamster?"""
46095,Lisa,i'd love to go to the library with you.
43915,Lisa,so i have two brothers?
46307,Lisa,can you take me to school? please?
51226,Lisa,but the simpson abode was deep down in the dumps. 'cause from little to bigger the kids had the mumps.
43033,Lisa,gym?!! that's the stupidest thing i ever heard.
49143,Lisa,krusty klovnen baby visker?
49538,Lisa,cinco.
47322,Lisa,zoot suit... astronaut outfit... southern belle... renaissance dandy... country-western octopus...

46106,Lisa,"""lisa: i'm taking the coward's way out. but before i do, i just want you to know: being smart made me appreciate how amazing you really are."""
47756,Lisa,help... help... so much sulfur dioxide!

46940,Lisa,"don't worry, mom. this first time we'll only take a few steps outside."
42150,Lisa,"and while on ventnor avenue you'll be staying at the fabulous hotel lisa. a valet will be around shortly to park your thimble. of course, there is the unpleasant matter of the bill."
48542,Lisa,"ah c'mon bart, the party will be fun. nelson's not bad -- all he needs is a little kindness."
52300,Lisa,cable? / us? / wow! / we have cable!
52400,Lisa,"forgive us, dad, but it takes time to properly sugarcoat a response."

48598,Lisa,"no, no! you've already got your revenge!"
52070,Lisa,"bart, look!"
42707,Lisa,"no, celeste, i mean the things she says are sexist."
45922,Lisa,no! that bridge has a troll under it!
43555,Lisa,"hi, everybody."
43245,Lisa,oh mom. thanks.
42261,Lisa,bart!
48631,Lisa,"at bedtime, he tucks me in tighter than anyone else could. and you know what? no monsters have gotten me yet."
43108,Lisa,"what do they do there, dad?"
51168,Lisa,pill attack!
42510,Lisa,o.j.
50688,Lisa,shut up and kiss me.
48671,Lisa,happy birthday dear homer / happy birthday to you!
51143,Lisa,"you never know, mom. i'm only eight. i might get married someday... even if it's only a green card marriage to keep a chinese dissident from being deported."
44901,Lisa,"it's a music box! dad, we uncovered the secret!"
43314,Lisa,bleeding gums murphy!
47181,Lisa,i see you braves received our smoke signal.
50430,Lisa,"dad, our lives!"
45523,Lisa,they're evacuating the earth! we're saved!
42131,Lisa,how?
45066,Lisa,"actually, keeping promises would make you a good father."
52108,Lisa,you're gonna have to fail that history test sooner or later.
50852,Lisa,"um, it's a lot worse than a stray dog."
42567,Lisa,"actually, mom, a tweaking of mr. burns' foibles if done with the greatest of care could earn dad a special place in the old man's heart."
49877,Lisa,"ah yes, ""jerusalem syndrome."" the name given to religious delusions or psychoses that occur when people visit jerusalem."
42427,Lisa,the hamster has learned a valuable lesson. beware the hand of man.
49210,Lisa,it's not a pedal boat. it's a pedal car that bart drove into the river. because he knows a shortcut that's not on the map.
46408,Lisa,"and we should all be thankful to michael, peter and mike for supplying this beautiful turkey, made entirely of tofu."
45602,Lisa,joy to the world / the lord is come. / let earth receive her king...
51359,Lisa,what are you getting at?
50950,Lisa,"check it out, the new york times travel section just named springfield ""america's coolest city."""
44927,Lisa,you have a pen glued to your cowlick.
43169,Lisa,it says you can't bring in outside plants or animals. any foreign creature you bring in could upset the environmental balance.

46075,Lisa,what did he look like?
51596,Lisa,"i'm fine. fine! it's funny, but... hurting your feelings made me feel better."
47204,Lisa,did a shark do that?
42914,Lisa,"not exactly. they pieced it together from old shows, and it seems new to the trusting eyes of impressionable youth."
42579,Lisa,"excuse me, bart's a little upset this morning, so could everyone please be extra-nice to him?"
51214,Lisa,girl scout cookies get you in anywhere.
51082,Lisa,"to prove my brother's innocence, i demand a youth court!"
42589,Lisa,oh my god!
46304,Lisa,"chief wiggum, can you drive me to school? it's an emergency."

51869,Lisa,we've been robbed!
51981,Lisa,"wow, mom."
51868,Lisa,i don't know what else to do.
46752,Lisa,"mom, dad, thank god you're okay."
47289,Lisa,"bart, your museum took in over three thousand dollars!"
51656,Lisa,"dad, the tv's screwed up. it only plays ""married... with children."""
44260,Lisa,"i was in the library at the time, but janey told me that principal skinner and bart's teacher, mrs.... what's her name?"
45899,Lisa,it was amazing how fast dad betrayed his vision of a realistic show.
52140,Lisa,"if you don't believe me, look at this book i found."
42674,Lisa,impaled on my nobel peace prize. how ironic.
44208,Lisa,what? i didn't order any giant sub!
48679,Lisa,"yes, but why does it have to be in my bedroom?"
44578,Lisa,i guess we better get used to being pariahs.
51486,Lisa,i could get two...?
51955,Lisa,is not.
45855,Lisa,it's me!
44079,Lisa,"santa's little helper, it's your birthday? we've got to get you a present! yes we do! yes we do!"

45784,Lisa,"whoa, whoa, whoa! why don't we just invite our creditor nations here, and gently remind them of america's past generosity?"
45940,Lisa,go on! swim to freedom! go!
47213,Lisa,what the...?!
43637,Lisa,you mean it's a new dress? where did you get it?
51372,Lisa,but i'm going to give gifts that aren't expensive and come from the heart.
49658,Lisa,possum?!
41961,Lisa,"quit it, dad!"
45528,Lisa,no it isn't. it's totally inaccurate--
46199,Lisa,um-um.
41890,Lisa,bart... bart...
51023,Lisa,they're not gonna write a check to a couple of kids.
49165,Lisa,toora loora loora
41788,Lisa,"when america was born on that hot july day in 1776, the trees in springfield forest were tiny saplings, trembling towards the sun. and as they were nourished by mother earth, so too did our fledgling nation find strength in the simple ideals of equality and justice. who would have thought such mighty oaks, or such a powerful nation, could grow out of something so fragile... so pure. thank you."
45032,Lisa,a horn?
49411,Lisa,"woo-hoo! test day at last! now i can show off at a federal level. hey bart, on the practice test yesterday, what did you pick as the best title for the paragraph about ""manifest destiny?"""

42044,Lisa,bart you really shouldn't be looking through other people's things. find anything good?
43610,Lisa,"i admit i haven't known mom as long as you have, but i know when she's really upset. her heart won't just wipe clean like this bathroom counter-top. it absorbs everything that touches it, like this bathroom rug."
42020,Lisa,"so you've come to buy my forgiveness. sorry, homer."
43588,Lisa,"when bob broadcast that message, his voice was higher than normal. and what makes your voice high?"
48012,Lisa,come on -- we'll hide in the theater!
43546,Lisa,this whole thing is really creepy. are you sure you won't talk to dad?
43825,Lisa,"da-ad! you're not pointing anywhere near springfield. it's over here, apu."
43150,Lisa,"yeah, dad was right."
52259,Lisa,there she is!
46830,Lisa,wait! wait!
44577,Lisa,"run, mom!"
42187,Lisa,yuh huh.
50959,Lisa,you never take him for walks or sleep with him in your arms. and i suspect you've been chewing on his treats.
45889,Lisa,it's my favorite!
43676,Lisa,he had a prosthetic tongue made out of silver.
44148,Lisa,hi-c! and fluffernutters!
42846,Lisa,"yuh huh. ""cast of characters: viceroy fizzlebottom, a hearty cherub of a man..."""
43217,Lisa,i'd love to. can we get vegetarian meals at your parents' house?
51931,Lisa,don't bart! he's a friend of nelson muntz.
44447,Lisa,"you just made a big mistake, fly boy."
52037,Lisa,"yeah. eat it, bart."
45349,Lisa,a banana!
49095,Lisa,i can't believe i'm a director with a movie at sundance.
48754,Lisa,"wait, milhouse -- hold your position. something doesn't add up."
46450,Lisa,like the whore of babylon?
52145,Lisa,"don't worry, bart. you won't learn anything."
48408,Lisa,but they're incompatible!
48393,Lisa,this is a total stranger who cleans houses for a living. who cares what she thinks?
42113,Lisa,"uh, we're getting a lot of sparks over here, dad."
43403,Lisa,"well, he did vow revenge. but i can't see him doing something illegal -- he's in show business! he's a celebrit--"
48647,Lisa,your minds are opening! take it home!
42382,Lisa,forget it. to get those tickets our parents would have to be part of springfield's cultural elite.
51079,Lisa,can you sign my yearbook?!
48323,Lisa,oh yeah? what's mom's birthday?
42858,Lisa,"bart, quit it!"
42911,Lisa,"i'm really sorry about what i did, allison. it's no shame being second to you."
43973,Lisa,who's playing that music?
52517,Lisa,well... someone calls someone.
45468,Lisa,"hey! i'm not a ""time burglar!"""
44037,Lisa,"listen, you thugs, stop making fun of him or you'll be sorry!"
46578,Lisa,"gee buck, your old films are as violent as today's!"
43689,Lisa,i'm not going to give up. i refuse to believe that everyone refuses to believe the truth.
45898,Lisa,"dad, that's too much deterge--"
49159,Lisa,"everyone, wait!"
42701,Lisa,"hey, horse-face! git yer ugly pie-hooks off that summer fun set!"
44038,Lisa,you'll be so sorry when you realize how you've hurt the feelings of a sweet young man!
42740,Lisa,"you know, if we get through to just that one little girl, it'll all be worth it."
44097,Lisa,look! what's that?!!
43171,Lisa,"mom, you said i could have one souvenir, right? well i want a didgeridoo."
51756,Lisa,that's correct.
52280,Lisa,"please, dad."
50342,Lisa,wonder who's in there. could it be oscar the...
49867,Lisa,"""don't stop achieving just yet, lisa. you are not alone -- flotus-one."" ""flotus-one?"" who could that be?"
47976,Lisa,"i really do like working with you, dad. will you keep helping me?"
46312,Lisa,look out!
45638,Lisa,"oop, the cheese isn't quite melted. let me just pop it back in the..."
41630,Lisa,"only one man was crazy enough to dance that dance, and he is dead!"
43835,Lisa,"wow, it's like woodstock. only with advertisements everywhere and tons of security guards."
45823,Lisa,why don't you be the quizmaster and ask other people the questions?
43513,Lisa,"if your advertising agency created all those giant characters, you must know how to stop them."
51723,Lisa,bart! you know you can't open a present till mom and dad wake up!
42198,Lisa,give it a little more gas.
42471,Lisa,finished. now all we have to do is put our names on it.
48362,Lisa,"yeah, i guess i do."
50668,Lisa,lisa. now this is the most important place in the world.
51248,Lisa,i have a solution!
49185,Lisa,"well, i could tell mom and dad the chip is in the bird and hope they take me to machu picchu another time, or..."
51217,Lisa,but i saw you praying to mecca!
50295,Lisa,i believe it's from lamps plus.
45955,Lisa,i'm so conflicted.
48685,Lisa,"i'm proud of you, mom. you're like christopher columbus -- you discovered something millions of people knew about before you."
46918,Lisa,they're making monkeys smoke cigarettes...
51626,Lisa,mom? dad?
52377,Lisa,"bart, he's not gonna learn it now. don't spend your last hours together tormenting the poor creature. have some fun, frolic with him. go get it, boy!"
42469,Lisa,great.
44131,Lisa,"sure, we love it! but how can we watch tv when it's so beautiful out?"
48777,Lisa,nothing.
43224,Lisa,"yes, i will."
43751,Lisa,"well, how about aunt patty and aunt selma at the d.m.v.?"
46553,Lisa,this school has everything.
48636,Lisa,you haven't heard the last of this!
45737,Lisa,"those balloons won't biodegrade for ten thousand years. and if bart gets a wowwipop, i want a wowwipop."
49373,Lisa,"juliet, i'm scared."
44951,Lisa,"but, dad..."
42009,Lisa,"the happiest day of my life was three sundays ago. i was sitting on my daddy's knee when the saints, who were four and a half point favorites, but only up by three, kicked a meaningless field goal at the last second, to cover the spread."
52423,Lisa,"no, really, i can't."
48215,Lisa,"well, this whole fatherhood issue could be resolved with a simple dna test."
48940,Lisa,now you two play nice!
51239,Lisa,"rainbow... oh, rainbow..."
45263,Lisa,dad!
48748,Lisa,ew! he is slimy!
47575,Lisa,when you grow up i'll be outside.
51482,Lisa,"maybe i should get that sick one. if i don't, no one else will. bart, list your top five, best to worst. no, no, no, no -- worst to best!"
41760,Lisa,"bart, my birthday is in two days. i'm gonna be eight years old. it's a big number -- almost double digits."
49049,Lisa,what you heard was your conscience telling you to stop eating meat.
46798,Lisa,"and you take me places you hate, like museums, plays, and the olive garden."
46219,Lisa,yes!
51667,Lisa,it's a terrific sport that--
41909,Lisa,"i love you, dad!"
49336,Lisa,kinda. let's do some groban.
47193,Lisa,and yet i'm still not satisfied.
47726,Lisa,i guess. but there's a long way to go.
47187,Lisa,the venus flytrap is a carnivorous plant which uses bait to lure unsuspecting prey into its digestive tract...
49506,Lisa,"pretty much, yeah."
41780,Lisa,"what would ben franklin say if he were alive today? he'd say... oh, think of a better opening."
47837,Lisa,i thought you said aunt patty was just waiting for the right man.
49215,Lisa,i guess.
42998,Lisa,"the spoon, bart."
49589,Lisa,mom! dad! i have to leave waverly hills and never come back!
46789,Lisa,"do you remember how you got home last night, dad?"
44167,Lisa,but everyone will know you did this!
49910,Lisa,a beached whale.
47044,Lisa,"dad, this is a kid's menu where you help yogi bear get to the washington monument."
49129,Lisa,we can ignite it with these crystal earrings grandma gave me.
46241,Lisa,africa looks like a beautiful jewel.
50298,Lisa,"scorpions!"""
48075,Lisa,what about bart's bedroom?
42999,Lisa,oh no! we left grampa back at the gas station.
49887,Lisa,ew! ew! ew! i'll never get that image out of my head!
51254,Lisa,"i know if i can get the toughest kid in class to sign it, the rest of you will sign it. milhouse?"
47453,Lisa,did you do that?
52271,Lisa,"friday night, pork chops. from cradle to grave... etched in stone in god's library somewhere..."
41950,Lisa,"is mom gonna have another baby, dad?"
52276,Lisa,"please, dad."
49267,Lisa,and a new record time! wait a second...
42411,Lisa,first prize... first prize...
50805,Lisa,"well, i denounce thee!"
49450,Lisa,"well, more of a curious george."
47179,Lisa,"ideally no, but..."
49917,Lisa,"hurry, dad, hurry!"
52228,Lisa,welcome back. bart! i'm sorry we had such a terrible fight.
42311,Lisa,homer.
48326,Lisa,what about this swordfish?
46961,Lisa,"mom, why did you wake me up? i dreamt i was at the kennedy center honors."
45000,Lisa,"come on, let's get you into your favorite shirt."
49045,Lisa,mom! we need a callaway titanium perimeter-weighted driver!
50892,Lisa,four queens! yes! yes!!!
50059,Lisa,"principal skinner, i need to convince nelson to come back to school."
41804,Lisa,"okay, but you don't know what you're missing."
41724,Lisa,it's no use kidding myself. i'm having an ethical crisis.
41765,Lisa,"meditations on turning eight, by lisa simpson. i had a cat named snowball -- she died, she died! mom said she was sleeping -- she lied, she lied! why oh why is my cat dead? couldn't that chrysler hit me, instead? i had a hamster named snuffy -- he died, --"
46592,Lisa,"see you later, i'm going to the library."
46722,Lisa,non-dairy?
43091,Lisa,hawaii!
51398,Lisa,"if bart's going, i'm going!"
48600,Lisa,"milhouse, don't you see... you're addicted to revenge."
43144,Lisa,it's a pony.
47851,Lisa,help! i'm sinking in the lake!
47956,Lisa,"stop it! you'll all feel better if you get a little sleep. now, close your eyes..."
42292,Lisa,uh-huh.
44272,Lisa,"hey! stop! you can take back the bassinet, but the baby is ours!"
49022,Lisa,"well, since you cared enough to apply peer pressure..."
44683,Lisa,i'll get it in a second. don't worry.
51356,Lisa,hey. i'm sorry i fired you.
44477,Lisa,"after all, what civilized person would play a game with the skin of an innocent pig?!"
43609,Lisa,i wanna look at the pets and write things on the typewriters and see if the new dictionaries are in!
48580,Lisa,maybe you killed them all.
51238,Lisa,"well, now i always have someone to eat lunch with."
41808,Lisa,"mr. lincoln, i..."
44420,Lisa,"mom, can you tell me the story of how i got my saxophone and not have it turn into a story about bart!"
51741,Lisa,"are we truly in space? and if so, why?"
44920,Lisa,i'm just a little girl.
46758,Lisa,"dad, that's bart."
52135,Lisa,fried shrimp.
44098,Lisa,"i'll see what else is on. hey, where's the remote?"
50414,Lisa,"okay. first of all, it's never wise to use the word ""spew"" in a love song."
44183,Lisa,once there was a robot named todd...
49707,Lisa,"two brothers? bart, who is this kid?"
43313,Lisa,"i'm glad you're okay, bart."
47124,Lisa,oh luke.
49773,Lisa,"sorry, but i was planning to stop by the olympic pin center to fill in a few small gaps in my collection. y'know, just to get me through the day."
52216,Lisa,"oh, thank you."
42362,Lisa,just like oscar the grouch.
51983,Lisa,i feel like smiling.
43385,Lisa,he robbed the school of music!
50905,Lisa,this is the worst thing that's ever happened to me! i was ivy! strong ivy!
49400,Lisa,"as a rational skeptic, i find that hard to believe. also, as a vegetarian, i hope there's not meat in that sauce."
48345,Lisa,"it's so beautiful. ooh, paintings by female artists! frida kahlo, georgia o'keefe..."
46462,Lisa,i'm going out for a walk.
45679,Lisa,what have you got so far?
42222,Lisa,"i meant because they both win all the time, mom."
46591,Lisa,give grampa a chance. statistics show that old people drive at least as well as sleep-deprived apes.
51529,Lisa,"i switched with her, dad."
44822,Lisa,yes.
42491,Lisa,but killing snakes is evil.
49258,Lisa,"no, i'm not mad."
51614,Lisa,"bart knew the worst thing to do was pile lie upon lie, and that's exactly what he did."
48420,Lisa,"i want you to know, i respect your beliefs and i can see how deeply you feel about them."
45410,Lisa,"no, we should fix things here. if we put our minds to it, there's no limit to what we can accomplish."
46824,Lisa,"he thinks he's really cool, but frankly the other kids are starting to wake up and smell the cooties."
50736,Lisa,i don't think shauna should choose any of you. shauna should choose shauna.
43725,Lisa,did he die?
41637,Lisa,"well, well, well. look who's come crawlin' back."
49255,Lisa,what's goin' on?
46668,Lisa,as if.
50101,Lisa,huh?
47530,Lisa,can we go? can we go? please! please! please! please! please!
51303,Lisa,"it's raw veggies, they're supposed to be cold!"
50073,Lisa,can i hold your hand... for balance?
49598,Lisa,...lenny!
49524,Lisa,oh my god!
51691,Lisa,i can't believe you're all giving up without a fight.
46879,Lisa,"why is the guy from ""laverne and shirley"" living in our house?"
46442,Lisa,"well, at least it's tasteful."
51959,Lisa,"all right maggie, just go to bart."
44557,Lisa,"well, i'm proud of you, mom. you refused to compromise your integrity."
50299,Lisa,they calm down when they're near the springfield silvertongues!
42434,Lisa,this is your chance to get a fair shake for the working man.
51084,Lisa,"good news, bad news. we're allowed to select the judge, but it's impossible to find one who doesn't hate you..."
42432,Lisa,but this project has no scientific merit.
43724,Lisa,"don't worry, dad. mr. smithers is a resilient man. i'm sure he can get a great job at any corporation he wants."
43069,Lisa,"sorry, dad. we do believe in you. we really do."
50502,Lisa,no.
48972,Lisa,you calm down!
49527,Lisa,"and in the new nineveh , darkness falls."
45224,Lisa,"eww, why is courtney love on the wheaties box?"
41920,Lisa,no.
49855,Lisa,"leave it to you to misspell a word you see first thing every morning. but don't worry. your secret's safe with me. as far as mom and dad know, you're just a soulless little psycho."
52214,Lisa,"it's a tribute to the trailblazing women who made our country great... see, there's georgia o'keefe... susan b. anthony... and this is marjorie stoneman douglas. i'm sure you haven't heard of her, but she worked her whole life to preserve the florida everglades."
46287,Lisa,"oh no! somebody took my bike?! mom, i need a ride to school."
48526,Lisa,you guys go ahead. i don't think i'd be very good company...
48997,Lisa,"mom, it's not too late to un-shatter your dream! martha graham danced well into her seventies."
45345,Lisa,the future is a...
50075,Lisa,sorry.
50314,Lisa,"thanks, sweetie."
52484,Lisa,bingo.
45516,Lisa,"wait a minute, xena can't fly."
46286,Lisa,"hey, stop! wait! oh, any day but science project day!"
44309,Lisa,"i'm so proud of you, mr. burns! you're getting your fortune back and you're doing it without endangering the planet or cozying up to the aspen crowd."
44094,Lisa,mr. smithers! mr. smithers! that moose is on fire!
49923,Lisa,"no, no, you'll like it. it's about the ocean."
44159,Lisa,"i know it's hard to accept, bart, but face it: sideshow bob has changed."
48309,Lisa,we're not dead... and neither are you.
43762,Lisa,security guards?
47196,Lisa,i guess so.
44649,Lisa,the defense has just one more question.
49799,Lisa,the diary of eliza simpson?
44484,Lisa,aren't there any good bachelors in this town?
44331,Lisa,it's a videotape!
48231,Lisa,and...?
45520,Lisa,"well, look at the wonders of the computer age now."
45645,Lisa,no it's not!
43402,Lisa,tito puente?
45997,Lisa,not so fast!
48391,Lisa,"dad, all you had to do was paint one number. now no one's gonna be able to find our house."
44328,Lisa,what's he saying?
49113,Lisa,are you guys still mad at me?
48360,Lisa,i'm... jake.
44254,Lisa,mo-om!
50650,Lisa,"friend, friend, awaiting reply, friend..."
44823,Lisa,"aren't you gonna buy it, dad?"
49596,Lisa,there's crabby...drunky...hungry!
45832,Lisa,"not really, no."
50394,Lisa,"bart, this is a truffle."
43539,Lisa,da-ad!
45531,Lisa,that has people living in it. you can see them through the windows.
51493,Lisa,i hear chewing!
51873,Lisa,"what, dad?"
41823,Lisa,sour grapes.
50206,Lisa,"actually, sir, the man who lived here didn't have many friends. but you're a better person than he ever was."
47319,Lisa,"you can strangle bart, but you can't strangle your humiliation."
50407,Lisa,"oh, so that's why they don't give pigs truffles."
48352,Lisa,"he forgot the volume of the carrot nose -- one-third base times height! oh math, i have missed you!"
51419,Lisa,"i don't need a new ralph, i like the old one. happy valentine's day!"
42848,Lisa,"look, it's the telescope i won at the optics festival."
43927,Lisa,tiny little people!
47566,Lisa,those horn-dogs -- they ditched us again! you know what this means?
48342,Lisa,i can't wait to see this re-imagining of itchy and scratchy... by avant-garde director juliana krellner!
41866,Lisa,i bet the rabbi misses krusty.
44266,Lisa,halogen lamps? kilim rugs? you can't afford this how can you afford this?
48496,Lisa,what is everyone doing?
52240,Lisa,"yes, but i'm afraid the forces of history have changed wrestling, perhaps forever."
51107,Lisa,aw... but i do hope you'll try to be good from now on.
50484,Lisa,"da-ad! anyway, continuing: ""for the present i will only say that this 'landowner' -- for so..."""
51432,Lisa,"bart, that's your sixth taco. you know, whitman says, ""if anything is sacred, the human body is sacred""."
44066,Lisa,"wait. listen, everybody!"
46432,Lisa,"stop saying that, dad."
44892,Lisa,okay... here goes.
41956,Lisa,ariel.
52191,Lisa,bart! you're just pretending to know what i'm talking about.
50504,Lisa,"fine. good luck with your project, which i'm sure you haven't started yet."
43788,Lisa,"no, no! then he'll know i told! dad, you said i could trust you."
48802,Lisa,and at least we can take the extra income you've earned in the last few months and set it aside for a rainy day.
47405,Lisa,why can't your heir be female? or-or why can't we elect our leaders?
43332,Lisa,but he was the only person who had the same love for music that i do.
46751,Lisa,but i like my old name.
48712,Lisa,hide the sports section!
48350,Lisa,"okay, boys' school -- i need a challenge!"
47733,Lisa,technically he was born in shelbyville.
50274,Lisa,you could deliver newspapers.
44791,Lisa,"you didn't feel for him either, you big fat phony."
50391,Lisa,my lick.
42085,Lisa,a doy.
48346,Lisa,cathy guisewite!
50548,Lisa,can i have my allowance early? i need to buy some carbon-offset credits so i can burn all my angelica button books.
44916,Lisa,but it's all trash.
43368,Lisa,as long as it's constitutional.
44404,Lisa,ralph and i could do the report together.
43302,Lisa,oh yeah.
41721,Lisa,"half a gallon of chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate chip."
49047,Lisa,bart... you do know what happens next.
47422,Lisa,"ooh, we're like howard carter discovering the temple of tutankhamen."
42618,Lisa,what!?
48564,Lisa,"oh, you poor man. fired on christmas eve!"
51686,Lisa,"wait, stop! why must you kill my dad? especially when cheeseburgers are doing the work for you?"
44275,Lisa,"hey, this park is great! how come we never take santa's little helper here?"
51160,Lisa,ki-ya karate monsters!
45100,Lisa,"ah, i don't know. i mean, i could risk it, but..."
44133,Lisa,wow! / alright! / cool!
47531,Lisa,"c'mon bart, here's our chance."
48798,Lisa,"yay, dad!"
44487,Lisa,can i ask you about your dot?
44870,Lisa,stupid bus that can't even go to the stupid place it's supposed to stupid go.
47492,Lisa,"mom, dad! i'm so sorry i got you into this!"
47279,Lisa,but... but i...
51558,Lisa,i'd love that. see you tonight!
45925,Lisa,we're in the three bears house!
44514,Lisa,it could be anything. it could be a mutant from the nuclear plant.
50707,Lisa,by who? lenny?
45389,Lisa,"dad, stop kidding around. look, they printed my letter."
42971,Lisa,"sideshow bob used to be krusty the clown's sidekick. but in 1990, he framed krusty for armed robbery and bart got him put in jail."
46697,Lisa,i liked all the roles filled by minority actors.
50960,Lisa,what just happened? who's bongo?
42729,Lisa,"i've got the solution -- you and i are gonna make our own talking doll. she'll have the wisdom of gertrude stein and the wit of cathy guisewite, the tenacity of nina totenberg and the common sense of elizabeth cady stanton. and to top it off, the down-to-earth good looks of eleanor roosevelt!"
47630,Lisa,thank you. geezer rock -- an appreciation in verse.
51580,Lisa,the vintage record store?
49868,Lisa,"flotus1 is ""first lady of the united states... one!"""
43697,Lisa,"there is one way: get the silver tongue. if jebediah's who i say he is, then it should still be in his grave."
49522,Lisa,what will springfield be like in fifty years? let's see what the computer says:
42041,Lisa,that's alright. i think i'll just hit the hay.
46865,Lisa,that's how i felt all along.
47727,Lisa,i'm afraid this is a very open-ended problem.
46647,Lisa,"look, it's the giant statue of christ on corcovado."
44717,Lisa,quit it... quit it... quit... you kids knock it off! mama's watchin' her stories!
48338,Lisa,i think we're heading for disaster / and most of you will not be saved...
51137,Lisa,"i'm sorry your dress is gone, mom."
42383,Lisa,"oh no, it's ralph! just make some excuse."
44604,Lisa,we just saw the most amazing camel!
51846,Lisa,so love at first sight is possible.
45232,Lisa,"but dad, lemurs are nocturnal."
52451,Lisa,can we have wine?
44236,Lisa,"hold on, bart. everything's going to be just fine. i'm going to get you to a doctor. he will fix you up, and by this time tomorrow we'll all be a happy family. happy, happy, happy family."
44488,Lisa,what's the deal with that dot?
48276,Lisa,"well, my best recollection of burns' paraphrasing of what he read in moe's letter is that krabappel told moe..."
47661,Lisa,you're not mad about principal skinrash?
49597,Lisa,...greedy!
42278,Lisa,aaah!
45450,Lisa,"oh, it's beautiful, dad."
51699,Lisa,"excuse me, but buzzard's roost is a converted parking lot."
41843,Lisa,...so how about a nice pair of bongos? ewww.
45729,Lisa,microatia? that's twelve thousand miles away.
46492,Lisa,"thanks, mom. hey, where's my pony?"
47974,Lisa,i'm talkin' springfield... where nobody sucks! except for flanders?
48581,Lisa,maybe you should be ashamed of yourself!
51144,Lisa,mom's deleting old tv shows off the dvr.
41801,Lisa,mom?
47067,Lisa,"formed by unimaginable heat and pressure deep inside the earth, minerals explode in a vast panoply of... eh."
42480,Lisa,... then we put your name on the script and sent it in.
52515,Lisa,"eh, why not?"
44741,Lisa,"that means you went to college, right?"
49925,Lisa,"girl, you're going home! you're going home!"
43409,Lisa,"they have simpson d.n.a. it could've come from any of us. except you, since you're a bouvier."
47729,Lisa,it's a media circus!
46781,Lisa,william bonney?!
45386,Lisa,"we are a town of low-brows, no-brows and ignorami. we have eight malls but no symphony, thirty-two bars but no alternative theater, thirteen stores that begin with ""le sex..."" i write this letter not to nag or whine, but to prod! we can better ourselves!"
48435,Lisa,you could make a great chef someday.
41812,Lisa,"uh, maybe i should be going. i caught you at a bad time."
51802,Lisa,we did it! we wrote an awesome song!
48888,Lisa,"look, that's sideshow bob's mother -- dame judith underdunk! she's the greatest classical actress of her generation."
51274,Lisa,"wow! that was great! can i have my regular clothes back, please?"
51779,Lisa,"that's so sad. maybe we're the same, two lost ships in the intellectual sea, each of whom could inspire the other to..."
51439,Lisa,um... that video seemed a little... unscientific.
44320,Lisa,"i'm sorry, dad."
52431,Lisa,fine.
46157,Lisa,is that a navy tattoo?
49849,Lisa,congratulations. you're officially a sociopath.
42863,Lisa,i never made miss hoover yow-wee.
49921,Lisa,i'll catch up with you guys in a little bit.
50210,Lisa,you said it was boston.
44271,Lisa,"a credit card? oh, i knew you were up to no good."
46013,Lisa,aww.
49857,Lisa,"dad, a meter is three inches longer than a yard, which is thirty-six inches, so fifty divided by thirty-nine times thirty-six, equals--"
47086,Lisa,nooo!
50472,Lisa,"i'm sorry, but the team all got food poisoning at the pre-rally egg salad sandwich party. luckily, as equipment manager, i... was not... invited! woo-hoo!"
44368,Lisa,why'd you say that?
46340,Lisa,back to normal.
51951,Lisa,"sorry, dad. i know you mean well."
47747,Lisa,hmmm. so... is it okay if i go to the women's conference with chloe?
42376,Lisa,ralph thinks i like him. but i only gave him a valentine 'cause i felt sorry for him.
48811,Lisa,"no, no. it's a good thing."
45250,Lisa,"look, they have lincoln's hat!"
47971,Lisa,there's tires / on fire / a guy named apu
44863,Lisa,i should've got off in crackton.
44703,Lisa,this is crazy! just because you and dad and bart went downhill doesn't mean it's gonna happen to me... does it?
45015,Lisa,"they're on hinges. that's really ingenious, dad."
45701,Lisa,"""stars and stripes forever""? oh, man. they're toast!"
45271,Lisa,i am trying to do my homework.
48191,Lisa,whoopsie. i'll just get it out with more wine.
45877,Lisa,you think so?
42169,Lisa,are you sure that's safe?
52001,Lisa,"what about my cat, snowball?"
51690,Lisa,what a surprise -- it's bart.
47649,Lisa,"she's very pretty, but the answer is still no."
42497,Lisa,yeah.
52353,Lisa,"if bart stays home, i'm going to school."
43645,Lisa,it's okay. those snobs never would've made us members anyway.
47941,Lisa,oh my god! look at these ingredients!
44189,Lisa,"there's a lot more to it than that, bart. i don't just babysit; i sell peace of mind for a dollar an hour -- two dollars after nine o'clock."
47735,Lisa,"chloe, i really admire how you got out of springfield and became such a success."
51594,Lisa,"mom, stop! stop! stop! i'm sorry!"
44503,Lisa,this is so exciting! i can't wait to see what we find!
46598,Lisa,"mom, there's no gambling in branson. it was designed as a family destination."
42796,Lisa,now you're the good cop.
44292,Lisa,"thanks, dad!"
46085,Lisa,this couldn't have less to do with christmas! and i think that's a stagehand.
44110,Lisa,"if maggie's fussy, don't avoid her."
49452,Lisa,a jewel! why would nuns want a jewel?
42694,Lisa,"dad, dad!"
43284,Lisa,he's gonna make a tuxedo out of our puppies!!!
46720,Lisa,"uh, that's what we call the gay guy who lives with us."
50966,Lisa,"when grownups say that, it means there is something to worry about."
44286,Lisa,no! i don't agree!
43656,Lisa,"no. we're looking for this man, krusty the clown."
42576,Lisa,"nope. it says right there, school bus."
48632,Lisa,what kind of lunch is this? a drawing of a sandwich?
45756,Lisa,"let him up, please."
50138,Lisa,"you're a vampire! i should be scared, but i'm not."
50165,Lisa,what kind of kiss did you get?
52044,Lisa,"you know, in albania the unit of currency is called the lek."
43119,Lisa,"dad, that doesn't help people."
46361,Lisa,"dad, that's the water softener!"
47327,Lisa,"hey! wait a minute, if we're all out here, who's in there?"
41745,Lisa,zee-boo. zee-boo.
47903,Lisa,we're going downhill... and i can't reach the brakes!
48675,Lisa,"dad, that's ridiculous."
43579,Lisa,yay!
50046,Lisa,got it!
51912,Lisa,it's mrs. hoover's birthday!
43932,Lisa,"so, how are my little stone age tub dwellers? oh my gosh!"
42077,Lisa,"you're wrong, you're wrong! you don't need long fingers to play the blues. the blues come from in here!"
45842,Lisa,"oh, he'll never dance with her. she'll have to settle for some mexican milhouse."
45846,Lisa,"well, i think world war ii helped a little, mom."
46198,Lisa,wow. there's so much i don't understand about bullying.
47079,Lisa,yes.
44244,Lisa,"oh, what's happening? where am i?"
44048,Lisa,i was foolish to think i'd actually changed you. maybe i was seeing things in you that weren't really there.
46302,Lisa,hmmm... it's noon -- that's about when dad gets the brew-shakes.
45930,Lisa,you know she's only fattening you up so she can eat you.
46320,Lisa,"we're the neighbors, and we don't think."
43745,Lisa,"hi. i remember you from such film strips as ""locker room towel fight: the blinding of larry driscoll."""
43326,Lisa,i stopped brushing my teeth so i can play just like you!
52011,Lisa,i hope she likes the presents we got her.
51901,Lisa,"no, dad! please don't pawn the tv!"
45203,Lisa,"but it clearly says ""feet included."" they have to be here."
49290,Lisa,"oh, it's my first mybill. twelve hundred dollars?! but i only downloaded... twelve hundred and twelve songs!"
50155,Lisa,"dad, can i talk to you for a second?"
45483,Lisa,i'll help you write a new review if you just let me use the bathroom!
50551,Lisa,"every book on the ""young adult"" charts is written by five idiots who just want to take advantage of kids!"
46616,Lisa,i would gladly kneel -- were you the real king!
50777,Lisa,"what?! ""least popular?"" i gotta go."
45734,Lisa,trophies! trophies! attendance!
43417,Lisa,then with your last ounce of strength you pointed to w and s.
45400,Lisa,wow! i'm so honored you wanted me.
41597,Lisa,"look, my point is, show jenda you want to be successful and she might take you back. it's never too late for love."
48416,Lisa,there are so many worse crimes. why are you persecuting me?
50719,Lisa,"listen, everyone! we should fall asleep in this dream! one minute at this level equals two hours one dream level below!"
51460,Lisa,"well, i thought it was because it was tote bag day."
48806,Lisa,look at the crowd around that table.
42387,Lisa,i'm not sure i should go. i don't even like him.
49315,Lisa,"mr. burns, you can't do this!"
44813,Lisa,"well, not literally. but in a way, isn't he everyone's son? for you see, that little ""hell-raiser"" is the spawn of every shrieking commercial, every brain-rotting soda pop, every teacher who cares less about young minds than about cashing their big, fat paychecks. no, bart's not to blame. you can't create a monster and then whine when he stomps on a few buildings. i'm lisa simpson."
45630,Lisa,"okay, now we're gonna draw jobs from the chore hat."
47677,Lisa,"to get maggie in time, we'll have to catch a ride on a nerve impulse -- the body's information super-highway!"
44122,Lisa,"more kippers, mum?"
41877,Lisa,i didn't select this costume for mobility. i wore it to salute the noble native american of the pacific northwests...
42590,Lisa,"please, bart, i've seen your stupid shemp."
45123,Lisa,i don't want your dirty denominators.
45854,Lisa,but i just... need more practice. see ya!
45963,Lisa,"ms. tan, i loved ""the joy luck club"". it really showed me how the mother-daughter bond can triumph over adversity."
43086,Lisa,"no, dad. i want to get down. this tire is filthy, and the steel belts are poking me."

44391,Lisa,"dad, our baby pictures were in there!"
50889,Lisa,get outta here!
47206,Lisa,it almost sounded like he plans to tear organs out of living people!
47440,Lisa,what? really?
52421,Lisa,"no, but i'm starting to wish i had."
42026,Lisa,however...
50555,Lisa,"this is how real writers do it. i'll just bang out two thousand words and then i'll stop, even if i'm on fire. i gotta pace myself. ""chapter one."" wait, i can't start without music to inspire me."
51198,Lisa,intelligence?
49416,Lisa,"several?! that's more than ""a few"" and almost ""a bunch!"""
48875,Lisa,no! no! prop eighty-seven lets big polluters off the hook!
45016,Lisa,"me, too!"
43618,Lisa,"actually this is one of the nine states where mr. bush claims residency, dad. i wouldn't have voted for him, but it's nice to have a celebrity in the neighborhood."
47731,Lisa,"abc, cbs... uh-oh, the christian science monitor has a flat tire!"
42502,Lisa,"mr. white, can we borrow you for a minute?"
49204,Lisa,why can't you just admit we're lost?
41824,Lisa,"hey, quit it, bart. quit it! hey, quit it, quit it, quit it! m-o-o-o-m!"
44991,Lisa,"ah, it's gonna be a long night."
50609,Lisa,it's too early to call shotgun!
47401,Lisa,"fine, i'll tell you how it ends. the brutish captain mordecai has cornered his rival, cyrus..."
43497,Lisa,"oh, apu! it's beautiful!"
48434,Lisa,"no, it's great! except for the bee!"
49602,Lisa,"because a woman shouldn't have to depend on a man. snow white was brought back to life, by a lady doctor."
46842,Lisa,i'm sorry i got us lost out here.
52502,Lisa,like my marriage.
42632,Lisa,are you hiding something from me?
49763,Lisa,"well, you still should have let them have their fun!"
49821,Lisa,they made it back to the house?! how?!
42888,Lisa,"hey, i am above average! so what if allison's ahead of me? there's no shame in being second."
46657,Lisa,you know i'm a vegetarian.
42627,Lisa,really? not even this?
50909,Lisa,"c'mon, tell me!"
51977,Lisa,not me.
51840,Lisa,"way to go, dad."
45897,Lisa,sheriff lowbrow...

49381,Lisa,danced the minuet of equality on a gossamer dewdrop.
47610,Lisa,"this is ridiculous. only babies and ex-junkies are afraid of needles. stick me, chuckles!"
51768,Lisa,i'm done.
50578,Lisa,i got the idea from every movie ever made.
51559,Lisa,"so, mr. burns never realized it was maggie who saved the plant?"
51862,Lisa,"hey, lookin' good, bart."
43729,Lisa,"hey, the comic book store's still open!"
42965,Lisa,"but mom, it's exactly what you wanted in a vacation. it brought us together as a family, we got a lot of good exercise outdoors, and we have so many memories."
45017,Lisa,"dad, those should be your millions."
43800,Lisa,that sounds okay...
48854,Lisa,"milhouse, that was the bravest thing i've ever seen."
43943,Lisa,"bart, noooo!"
44476,Lisa,well... football's not really my thing.
49574,Lisa,really?
49316,Lisa,"there's only one place in town where the bees can survive. and mr. burns wants to tear it down. please, people. you didn't listen to me about the snail darter, you didn't listen to me about the osprey, and you didn't listen to me about the javelina."
45147,Lisa,"uh, should we help him?"
47533,Lisa,better technology doesn't mean better storytelling.
45120,Lisa,"mom, where did you get that?"
46841,Lisa,"thanks, bart."
46912,Lisa,i don't think so.
47265,Lisa,i would have gone with you.
46245,Lisa,when do we get to see the animals?
49847,Lisa,"fractions aren't that hard, you just have to find a common denominator. for example: one half plus one third equals..."
43038,Lisa,"wow bart, i'm so impressed you were able to give milhouse a concussion."
44467,Lisa,"yes i am! come on, spotty!"
50122,Lisa,"no! no, don't steal!"
52313,Lisa,"maybe. i don't watch him every minute. but what i am sure of is, we're getting cable for free."
44276,Lisa,"bart, that is a new low."
44264,Lisa,ich esse; er isst; wir essen.
49448,Lisa,"mother superior, are those all the babies in our orphanage?"
43029,Lisa,that doesn't mean you don't have to do your book report. what if the weatherman is wrong?
43087,Lisa,no! no! no! no!!!
48140,Lisa,don't make me affix it to your file.
51333,Lisa,i'll see you later.
52039,Lisa,"hi, daddy."
52167,Lisa,i can't leave springfield. i was born here and i thought i would die here.
43859,Lisa,"we are best friends, mom. but i'm a kid. i need friends my own age, too."
48110,Lisa,having a robot brother troubles me. the ethical implications are really tensing me up.
45359,Lisa,"oh no, bart has stolen the elderly!"
41925,Lisa,"dad, you don't have to do this."
48282,Lisa,ready!

45564,Lisa,answer to what?
47927,Lisa,don't you mean astronomy?
49545,Lisa,"baked potato, side salad and a--"
41661,Lisa,"oh my god, i was wrong! and by being corrected, i learned! and no one cared about my feelings!"
49124,Lisa,i hear noises coming from the kitchen!
47886,Lisa,out of the way! i learned cpr while waiting for other kids to finish their math tests.
49374,Lisa,equalia is not real!
41837,Lisa,i'm gonna eat eight pieces of chocolate.

42218,Lisa,i'll do it.
49807,Lisa,she wasn't a slave owner! our family was on the underground railroad!
44151,Lisa,"but, dad, it's barbaric! how does killing a deer make you more of a man?"
45137,Lisa,"thank you. i know this giant check is very important to everyone here. but, what's even more important is the truth."
49517,Lisa,we don't want your cookies.
51374,Lisa,"mr. flanders, where's your store?"
42633,Lisa,"judging from your song, you're infatuated with a woman named mindy... or a man named andy."
51563,Lisa,lucas! you're not competitive eating anymore?
49895,Lisa,"bart, she's only carrying thirty times her weight. our girl is slowing down."
42720,Lisa,"no, it couldn't be..."
42883,Lisa,"you're thinking of bears, mom."
44830,Lisa,"so we transplant the town. we're just gonna trash the new springfield, too."
49023,Lisa,"all right, that's enough!"
43462,Lisa,"oh, you are so cute! yes you are! you are! i just love you."
48238,Lisa,"alright, let's just try one more lesson. repeat after me: ""what flows from the nose does not go on the clothes."""
48797,Lisa,"hi, dad."
49420,Lisa,this test penalizes guessing.
48774,Lisa,"oh, that's convenient."

50571,Lisa,my name is finally on a book!
42213,Lisa,to shut myself off from the world and never be seen by human eyes again.

52293,Lisa,no!
51310,Lisa,first president bush?

41975,Lisa,daaaaad! you're not listening to me.
48729,Lisa,i've read that people do strange things in their sleep when they've taken ambien -- i mean nappien.

51404,Lisa,"wait, i know one place in springfield that doesn't care about internet piracy laws."
46461,Lisa,"no! look, i'm not just gonna pick a religion that seems cool. i'm gonna pick one that's right for me."

42297,Lisa,"dad, was that your commercial?"
49254,Lisa,and your car antenna has been straightened and re-balled.
43071,Lisa,"the media's making a monster out of you because they don't care about the truth. all they care about is entertainment. well you need a forum where they don't even know the meaning of the word ""entertainment"" -- public access television."
42134,Lisa,according to eternity magazine you can lose weight through subliminal learning. that's where an idea is subtly implanted in your head without you even knowing it.

44169,Lisa,no!
44198,Lisa,even babies know how to open and close their mouths. you need a bib.
45417,Lisa,"okay, next item of business is our weekly progress report. principal skinner? how's your transportation project coming?"
47166,Lisa,"i know who'll save him, the bravest dog in the world -- suds mcduff!"
52478,Lisa,mom... you're the best!
51425,Lisa,"you know, bart, just because diggs is a little different doesn't mean he's not a good person."
48356,Lisa,that's right. i'm toilet.
47375,Lisa,"coltrane, would you like to hear some music written by your namesake?"
50102,Lisa,"thanks, guys."
45620,Lisa,"don't worry, little friends. i won't hurt you."
47993,Lisa,"dad, i don't want things to be awful between us. i made you some cookies."
49726,Lisa,"larry, what sub-genre of jazz do you like? fusion? neo-bop?"
43443,Lisa,oh boy! really?
43312,Lisa,"how're you feelin', big brother?"
44540,Lisa,"will you leave me alone? it's bad enough you're making me go to your stupid ""judgment day""."
42518,Lisa,"i don't think they're giving you enough information, dad."
51722,Lisa,i'm afraid we've awoken a needy giant.
51212,Lisa,what other side?
46437,Lisa,and who sent it down that pipe?
43563,Lisa,there. now no one should be able to hear us.
47382,Lisa,"look, you don't want to get involved with a girl like me. my cats have a nasty habit of waking up dead. now go, cough me out of your life like a bad fur ball."
44624,Lisa,oh yeah! / absolutely! / at least twice as much!
43554,Lisa,"i think it's ironic that dad saved the day, while a slimmer man would have fallen to his death."
48297,Lisa,"dad? please come home, we miss you. is that a high-def tv?!"
45320,Lisa,i know we built a secret passage in here somewhere.
42766,Lisa,"yeah well, you'd be grumpy too if you were taken out of your natural habitat and gawked at by a bunch of slack-jawed yokels."
45617,Lisa,see mom? you conquered your fears and now you're ready to sk--
46112,Lisa,"so, how was it in the slammer?"
44055,Lisa,"hmm, pressure dropping, humidity rising over eighty percent, increasing wind..."
45745,Lisa,excuse me. we just came to get our balloon.
46428,Lisa,try to remember back when you were twelve. something frightening must have happened.
50901,Lisa,"full house! aces over threes! take that, rich-texan-oh-oh-one, and sideshow-bob-at-springfield- penitentiary. ha! i'm going all in!"
44511,Lisa,"well, obviously that's impossible--"
41689,Lisa,mr. bergstrom! mr. bergstrom!
46473,Lisa,i'm a buddhist.
52049,Lisa,"can, too."
50729,Lisa,"dad, they can only go three miles an hour!"
46352,Lisa,mini toothpaste.
49435,Lisa,"right, 'cause i wouldn't want to be gay like my heroes billie jean king, susan sontag, sappho of lesbos, and, i suspect, peppermint patty..."
46356,Lisa,"no, pierce brosnan. a voice like his would give our house a much-needed touch of class."
43585,Lisa,"ow! c'mon, mom and dad are waiting!"
43844,Lisa,no.
51502,Lisa,yes we do. it's a johan oldenveldt.
42643,Lisa,do you get the feeling this family is disintegrating? i mean we haven't had a meal with mom all week. and she hasn't even started my costume for the geography pageant.
42675,Lisa,why? i'm so much happier here.
47665,Lisa,nooo!
45357,Lisa,"now we're pulling into port. and who's waiting for us at the dock? why, it's all your childhood dogs! i see petey and blackie and schnoodle and..."
50801,Lisa,can i please be alone?
44622,Lisa,we love the leader!
41678,Lisa,"wow, i made mom cry. what unimaginable power! i can use this to get anything i want. but right now, all i want is for mom to stop crying."
48640,Lisa,the hillbilly tykes will become my tutees!
50785,Lisa,forgive a fool her tears.
49709,Lisa,"hello, bart."
42042,Lisa,i'm aware of the time.
51008,Lisa,bart? you wanted to show me something?
48635,Lisa,am i to understand you're purposely denying education to these children?
48172,Lisa,"but luigi, surely you speak italian."
50423,Lisa,you like my boots?
52239,Lisa,apology accepted.
44029,Lisa,i wonder if i could change nelson...
46769,Lisa,"dad, is there something you'd like to tell us about this horde?"
47482,Lisa,i used to be the smart one.
46900,Lisa,i love happy endings.
46499,Lisa,"bart, you're cheating!"
45149,Lisa,can i fluff your pillow?
46105,Lisa,"hey, what's this?"
44990,Lisa,it slipped.
43458,Lisa,"we're going to storytown village, grampa. it's an amusement park for babies."
42517,Lisa,we've gotta clean this up before mom gets back.
49367,Lisa,"well, you can't keep juliet and me apart! i'll... i'll disobey!"
44567,Lisa,"bart, this is patches, and what was your name?"
44751,Lisa,ralph? but the rocket was my idea.
48763,Lisa,"we have to find those bullies before the bake sale starts. martin, run a top-down search on the school security grid."
46349,Lisa,don't forget apple sauce.
48644,Lisa,and guess what -- ben and ken the street magic men are only the beginning! the city is a treasure trove of culture and multi-culture!
47216,Lisa,what happens if i press this button?
50753,Lisa,the penguin's life isn't all bad. those ones are having a blast!
45872,Lisa,stop clapping!
52053,Lisa,goodbye adil. have a nice trip.
45236,Lisa,"well, this could be quite enlighten--"
51381,Lisa,"i know this christmas has been a little rocky even for the simpsons. but i think these gifts born of thought and love will restore the balance of prajna and samsara, i mean holly and jolly."
49274,Lisa,"oh, dad."
52388,Lisa,challenge accepted!
43425,Lisa,ow! mah tug!
51826,Lisa,what percentage of prayers really come true?
46776,Lisa,"...twenty eight, twenty nine... there's one missing."
51403,Lisa,dad! dad! you're back! you're back!
47060,Lisa,"well, i am young, gifted and yellow. my interests include music, science, justice, animals, shapes, feelings..."
43489,Lisa,that's it. i can't live in a house with this prehistoric carnivore. i am out of here.
48739,Lisa,finally! i knew we could solve that maze using tremaux's algorithm.
45340,Lisa,"to make the world a more magical place, i guess. although they did blow over and kill some people."
48863,Lisa,look at all these alternative comic book creators...
43444,Lisa,nooooo! it's dripping funny-smelling water all over me!
48820,Lisa,a little bit louder now!
52356,Lisa,arithmetic.
47520,Lisa,"oh dad, i missed you so much."
52494,Lisa,the old milhouse would have been helpless with an asthma attack.
47293,Lisa,prime minister tony blair!?
46980,Lisa,shhh.
51764,Lisa,"you know, dad, studies show being hypnotized makes you more efficient."
48385,Lisa,thank you. or should i say thank you!
47105,Lisa,hello... hold on.
50804,Lisa,"you! it's about hello, hello, springfield. it's me, gaga! why is everyone looking at my purple hair full of bluebirds?"
42868,Lisa,"uh! hey, sara! well, i gotta go. i have to practice for band auditions."
46579,Lisa,why are you driving a car?
51612,Lisa,it was the one night of every year that he never heard his parents argue. he figured it was because they loved the fireworks just as much as he did.
46318,Lisa,that was great. i can't believe she found a rhyme for hezekiah.
44394,Lisa,"here's a better idea -- you give me your address, and i'll write to you."
51838,Lisa,daddy! we're so glad to see you!
43081,Lisa,"oh, that's just a paranoid fantasy."
50628,Lisa,"trust me, i've left a lot out, and cleaned up the swears. anyway, i ran into some schoolmates and thought they might be friendly. that's what kids do, right? hang out at the mall together. but when i went over..."
51342,Lisa,what are you so happy about?
47430,Lisa,who?
48377,Lisa,i'm gonna be sick.
44803,Lisa,"hey, here's another letter for bart's people."
44770,Lisa,...and i'll be able to tackle all the hard-hitting children's news the grown-up controlled media won't touch. plus i get to be on tv!
43230,Lisa,"mom, picture phone."
47352,Lisa,"actually, most people now feel christmas has gotten too materialistic. in fact, as a buddhist, i believe people would be a lot happier without presents."
52006,Lisa,it's so awful.
51470,Lisa,"o-kay. well, can you please be nicer to our grampa? for me? i love grampa. you may not realize it, but he's a treasure."
42554,Lisa,"oh, no! dad's been drugged!"
50653,Lisa,i'm trying to set a mood here.
41706,Lisa,"i'm glad i'm not crying because i would hate for you to think that what i'm about to say is based on emotion. but you, sir, are a baboon!"
45325,Lisa,"yeah, yeah. hurry, everyone! we don't have much time!"
42225,Lisa,it's hopeless.
46413,Lisa,no!
48494,Lisa,he sure is neurotic for a monster.
47488,Lisa,air conditioning... water fountains... dioramas... and i'll never run into my family here! it's the perfect place to start a new life.
49457,Lisa,"quaerite deum in corde et anima. that's latin... ""deum"" is god... and of course ""quaerite"" means ""seek""... ""seek god with heart and soul."""
46917,Lisa,because this lab is cruelly testing consumer products on animals. take a look for yourself.
48750,Lisa,the sixth-grade security camera shows three empty desks!
43273,Lisa,how many more can there be?
52462,Lisa,ba-art!
51508,Lisa,"but, you still, i mean... i suppose you're right."
45754,Lisa,what about my pledge to build the world's largest bookmobile? isn't there any money left for that?
42108,Lisa,here santa's little helper!
45014,Lisa,homer! / dad! / look out!
46023,Lisa,... pour cocktail onions down your pants.
51703,Lisa,"excuse me, you ruined my report."
43249,Lisa,oh dad...
47063,Lisa,i gotta pick a career! gotta pick a career!
42015,Lisa,give me some chips for it.
47778,Lisa,i bet you could find a distributor at the springfield novelty expo.
41944,Lisa,one of the economic powers of the world--
42177,Lisa,but i am far more pessimistic.
51877,Lisa,"go, dad!"
43651,Lisa,"it is a tragedy for all us kids. but, bart, you can't beat yourself up."
50514,Lisa,she means the most authentic.
49453,Lisa,the jewel will lead me to my baby sister? why are you telling me this?
48303,Lisa,forget it.
46927,Lisa,"dad, we are there."
45022,Lisa,yes! a maggie-oop!
46191,Lisa,"and you like the same one i like -- with the grad-student glamour pack... just like the one in my... ...locker. that's mine, isn't it?"
50918,Lisa,this is such a big step!
41650,Lisa,"oh, yuck! that sandwich is full of meat. there's bacon, canadian bacon, mexican bacon..."
49489,Lisa,maggie -- it's true! you are the gem child!
46711,Lisa,campus?
45006,Lisa,it's true. i read it on a place mat at a restaurant.
46155,Lisa,you're being brainwashed.
50142,Lisa,"sir, i'm not trying to take your son away from you. i plan to be a part of your rich culture, and organize media-friendly events to help combat all the unfair vampire stereotypes."
45683,Lisa,they'll have tabouleh.
50345,Lisa,no one sent me. i just knocked on the door and it opened!
42102,Lisa,he is alive. he's wagging his tail.
48672,Lisa,"dad, you're out of shape even for an american."
43675,Lisa,jebediah was really a vicious pirate named hans sprüngfeld. his tongue was bitten off by a turk in a grog house fight!
42254,Lisa,uh huh.
44324,Lisa,me! me!
51350,Lisa,"so, do you know how i can win?"
47992,Lisa,dad looks so happy.
44635,Lisa,what about the rest of us?
47175,Lisa,amble!
51423,Lisa,i saw him heading across the field after school with a kid a little bit older and undoubtedly wiser.
42732,Lisa,"""...when i get married, i'm keeping my own name."" you know, that should probably be if i choose to get married."
43323,Lisa,your sax! thank you so much!
42907,Lisa,"it's the beating of that hideous heart! i mean, i think i hear something."
50672,Lisa,"mom, i'm sorry i'm late! no excuse, i just forgot all about you. huh? i'm not sure that patch really represents who i am right now."
42237,Lisa,i'm going to be riding on a pack of cigarettes?
44867,Lisa,how could i confuse bus 22 with bus 22a?
44174,Lisa,"i love everything about the world of babysitting: the responsibility, the obligation, the pressure..."
43860,Lisa,be myself? i've been myself for eight years and it hasn't worked. look at all these dorky clothes... a bathing cap... nose plugs...
49340,Lisa,"finally, a real suggestion!"
43790,Lisa,...and bart could be the courier!
44883,Lisa,no!
50528,Lisa,what kind of american man doesn't want to explore global food culture?
48547,Lisa,"angelica button and the dragon king's trundle bed. it's the ninth book in the ""angelica button"" series."
42384,Lisa,now ralph is in this play with me. i just know he's going to embarrass me in front of the whole school.
46000,Lisa,he said i was hard core.
49759,Lisa,why is the tv back on? what happened to the videogame?
43540,Lisa,obesity is really unhealthy. any doctor will tell you that.
44646,Lisa,"milhouse, did you steal the food?"
48437,Lisa,"oh michael, one bite of this soufflé and your father will realize your gift deserves to flower."
42244,Lisa,"possibly. but the point is, you wanted me to feel better about myself. and i do."
44691,Lisa,the project! i forgot all about it!
45134,Lisa,you can't keep this scoreboard -- because there's not gonna be any grant money! because i cheated!
52290,Lisa,why are we using the good china?
45571,Lisa,"well, we could play clam traffic jam... or the game of county seats!"
44436,Lisa,all the layers of lead paint in this house made it the perfect bomb shelter.
51698,Lisa,we're sorry.
50221,Lisa,"mom, it's just maggie."
47028,Lisa,"well, i'm all set. i'm gonna be following the latest designs from modern sandcastle magazine."
48424,Lisa,"shake it off, buck!"
42135,Lisa,"they'll send you tapes you listen to while you sleep. as you hear new-age music, a powerful message goes to your brain, telling you to eat less."
50480,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing?"
51590,Lisa,"mom, how could you pay someone to be my friend?!"
46123,Lisa,"tough break, toots. i need a man who answers to no one. a full manager."
45256,Lisa,"yeah, well, i hope it doesn't hum too loud, 'cause i have a ton of homework to do, and if i don't finish it by..."
49924,Lisa,"""the world below the brine / forests at the bottom of the sea / the branches and leaves... / sea-lettuce, vast lichens..."
48419,Lisa,"mr. flanders, wait!"
48826,Lisa,dad? where are you?
43014,Lisa,"don't be so hard on yourself, bart. it's not your fault jessica doesn't like you."
50770,Lisa,he's in every scene.
52033,Lisa,"ewww, gross."
51934,Lisa,"bart, here's that cupcake you wanted. i can't help but think if i had just given it to you in the first place, this whole horrible tragedy could have been avoided. i know you can't eat it now, so i'll just place it lovingly on your forehead. ."
44642,Lisa,"not now, martin."
46259,Lisa,"hello, little fella."
46223,Lisa,"for as long as there have been smart people, there have been bullies to prey on them. from galileo...to sir isaac newton...and even in the animal kingdom..."
42007,Lisa,"dad, i'm making the chiefs my five-star silver bullet special. and with your blessing, i'd like to tie it to the cowboys plus five at chicago."
49048,Lisa,"bart, are you all right?"
49163,Lisa,it always comes down to trans-substantiation versus con-substantiation.
49614,Lisa,there must be a better way.
49333,Lisa,"yes, i would. class, everyone please stop and admire juliet's painting..."
52480,Lisa,"and i'm going to take a page out of your playbook, and let it slide!"
52077,Lisa,"come on, bart. go with the flow."
49956,Lisa,excuse me! is this what the framers of the constitution would want?
45026,Lisa,but mom said not to!
45077,Lisa,"dad, do you mind? your feet are really close to my potato."
43778,Lisa,nobody does! he's very quiet and enjoys puzzles. but that still doesn't mean you can tell anyone!
47516,Lisa,yay!
42228,Lisa,oh bart.
42057,Lisa,"dad, this is not a commentary on your skills, but we bought you a new doghouse."
50574,Lisa,"no need to thank me, boys."
51308,Lisa,a lincoln republican?
50724,Lisa,we'll take your word for it.
44463,Lisa,"can you help me get my ball down from the roof, dad?"
44021,Lisa,would you... play a song for me?
42079,Lisa,"dear log... this will be my last entry. for you were a journal of my hopes and dreams, and now i have none."
50117,Lisa,"look, dad! ""players and coaches' entrance!"""
51456,Lisa,"well... there is something i should have told you. you see, it occurred to me that if i can genetically modify fruits and vegetables, why can't i modify... me!"
46959,Lisa,"thank you, mr. cronkite."
49201,Lisa,they're worse than wal-king!
45597,Lisa,"exactly. come on, bart, we've got to warn everyone."
41746,Lisa,i'm trying to teach maggie that nature doesn't end with the barnyard. i want her to have all the advantages that i didn't have.
48771,Lisa,but you and willie will drown!
49659,Lisa,"so, i'll hide and you guys count to a hundred."
46188,Lisa,"they're not dolls, they're aspiration figures. but it might work."
43006,Lisa,okay.
42390,Lisa,what if he...
46374,Lisa,"hey, karie."
51125,Lisa,"milhouse, i'm not sure why you left me in the forest, so i made cookies. but i didn't know what kind you liked, so i made you seven kinds. i've become my mother! well, common sense never goes out of style that was too easy!"
47118,Lisa,this whole ranch is appalling. it's built on a legacy of cruelty to animals and oppression of indigenous people.
46887,Lisa,dad's heading straight for the museum of swordfish!
46726,Lisa,gotta finish. gotta finish. am i using too much glue?
44144,Lisa,"aw, mom, are you sure you want to sell a family heirloom to pay the gas bill? i mean, what would your grandma say?"
48980,Lisa,his foot is caught in my button hole.
46630,Lisa,"i need to call janey, but i can't get a dial tone."
50177,Lisa,"mom, please don't."
52435,Lisa,not mine.
44719,Lisa,"wesley, get mama's pryin' bar."
49607,Lisa,although there were a few holes in the story.
45390,Lisa,"well, i'm sure someone had the time to read it."
49837,Lisa,yes! i'm thrilled! we've regained our family honor and we're one-sixty-fourth black!
47990,Lisa,no one asked you to yell and slash!
49087,Lisa,"no, us!"
52019,Lisa,then how comes she's not putting on any of your perfume?
43354,Lisa,bart! i can't believe it... but why?
42323,Lisa,"mom, this is fascinating. did you know that they'll stop dad's heart for six whole minutes?"
47239,Lisa,i rest my case.
48607,Lisa,"bart, stop that. native americans are a proud people with a noble heritage... a noble heritage that anyone can claim!"
48230,Lisa,don't you ever hope for anything better?
46690,Lisa,no. the last step is quitting.
51702,Lisa,hello? hello? is everything okay?
51388,Lisa,what? n.c. wyeth! these are book illustrations!
47439,Lisa,bart will make your bed for a week.
46633,Lisa,uh-oh.
52416,Lisa,three: you seem to be of the jewish faith.
46516,Lisa,we had a good run.
43787,Lisa,"bart rented a car with a phony driver's license and drove milhouse, nelson, and martin to a wig outlet in knoxville and the car got crushed and they're out of money and they can't get home and bart's working as a courier and just came back from hong kong."
50731,Lisa,"wow, the tv's hooked up to the internet! you can stream whole seasons of old tv shows."
51485,Lisa,"okay, this is the guinea pig that will make me happy."
47396,Lisa,"if dad ever reads that book, he's gonna be so humiliated."
50989,Lisa,where are we going?
46066,Lisa,"wow, mom got a laugh."
43785,Lisa,"there's something troubling me, dad...but i don't think i can tell you because it's a secret."
43318,Lisa,my brother just had his appendix out.
47357,Lisa,"e'll-shay uy-bay em-thay, upid-stay."
42392,Lisa,"well, actually, it's not as bad as stealing, but my conscience is bothering me."
43180,Lisa,"dad, that's a gag paper we got at the carnival."
43013,Lisa,"remember bart, i mean, ""dances in underwear,"" we take the white man alive."
48832,Lisa,"mom, i think there's something you're trying to avoid. or someone."
42838,Lisa,canwehaveapooldad? canwehaveapooldad? canwehaveapooldad? canwehaveapooldad? canwehaveapooldad? canwe... etc.
42391,Lisa,"dad, is it right to take things from people you don't like?"
44937,Lisa,"uh, they were... all wiped out in the big trophy fire."
41831,Lisa,"hey, stop that."
52465,Lisa,that's the answer! maggie's a real witch now! she can reverse the spell!
45656,Lisa,will this do?
46098,Lisa,"no, really. i think books have an amazing power to bring people together. look, even cletus is checking one out."
51418,Lisa,"hi, ralph... um, i just wanted to tell you there was a tooth in the valentine you gave me."
50403,Lisa,that baby's head.
51167,Lisa,happy birthday dad! / happy birthday grampa!
52405,Lisa,"my mother would like to enroll in ""painting from life, 2-b""."
47648,Lisa,"i'm sorry mr. burns, but my paper's not for sale."
48981,Lisa,"i almost flicked an innocent butterfly. bart, we're turning into monsters!"
43488,Lisa,"why don't you just eat him, dad."
46920,Lisa,"dad, today was so great. the animal rights protest, a visit to the museum of sadness and oppression..."
45179,Lisa,"hey, there is one thing we could do."
51416,Lisa,dad! bart's on my side of the seat!
51339,Lisa,by discussing the school's budget crisis?
49680,Lisa,"hey, every witch needs a familiar..."
50589,Lisa,"well, you're getting my help."
44519,Lisa,just let me take it to the museum for one day. they can do scientific tests and prove it's not an angel.
48625,Lisa,the people of my tribe lived in harmony with the land.
51455,Lisa,thank you. answer the question.
48197,Lisa,"dad, you're driving on an ancient roman aqueduct!"
44500,Lisa,"oh, but what if they missed something? you have to allow an archeological survey!"
45170,Lisa,kids?
47519,Lisa,"look maggie, it's a pop up! ""daddy's made a shiv. can you help him ice johnny shakes, the jailhouse stoolie?"""
50874,Lisa,what do you do tuesdays and thursdays after school?
44811,Lisa,"willie, stop!"
47307,Lisa,"yes, bart. an elephant's butt."
43760,Lisa,i'm learning about owls.
51639,Lisa,"no, whenever anything bothers me i harmlessly vent it to maggie."
47485,Lisa,two cents...
46388,Lisa,where's bart? his mountain dew's getting flat.
45950,Lisa,how did the badger do that without ripping your shirt?
49615,Lisa,"dad, i keep telling you, that won't work."
48392,Lisa,"mom, what are you doing?"
43552,Lisa,shouldn't you be working?
45829,Lisa,"you can't drive, dad. he's got your license."
51825,Lisa,you never let me tell!
45672,Lisa,you mean hawaii?
43259,Lisa,that's a horrible thing to say.
44820,Lisa,"dad, is this another one of those situations that could be solved by a simple apology?"
46517,Lisa,"i'm so sorry, grampa."
52098,Lisa,he isn't.
43703,Lisa,general washington?!
41910,Lisa,snowball ii... santa's little helper... this is princess. please don't exclude her because she's different.
46637,Lisa,"when i sent my first donation, the charity mailed me this video."
41636,Lisa,"they're only using you for your pool, you know."
48829,Lisa,"to be fair, the millennium just started, so it's not that big a deal... but they're giving it to me!"
42321,Lisa,"dad, are you trying to tell us you're getting a coronary-artery bypass graft?"
42942,Lisa,can we?
48999,Lisa,this is how i always stand when i tell adults what they should be doing.
45590,Lisa,the phone's not even plugged in!
47716,Lisa,i know this obsession with thinness is unhealthy and anti-feminist... but that's what a fat girl would say!
42893,Lisa,you're a wonderful person.
50781,Lisa,"let's see... ""uncensored jump-rope chants""... oh, there's a whole thread labeled ""lisa simpson!"""
43822,Lisa,"all right! now you've got all the simpsons behind you, apu!"
43777,Lisa,langdon alger.
48515,Lisa,philistines.
51847,Lisa,what's his name?
42056,Lisa,how's the dog supposed to get in?
48759,Lisa,"principal skinner, you know we have only one agent who stands a chance with those bullies. my brother."
49834,Lisa,there's no noble simpson.
48024,Lisa,"it's albanian. but the producers added subtitles to make it ""commercial."""
42011,Lisa,"you know, dad, we've been watching a lot of tv lately. maybe, the sunday after the super bowl, we could hike up to the top of mount springfield. the fires in the tire yard really make for some beautiful sunsets."
42145,Lisa,"dad, you know you won."
49180,Lisa,mom and dad are spying on you. there's a tracking chip in your cell phone!
43058,Lisa,you want a piece of me?
44382,Lisa,"a medal? thank you, sir!"
51742,Lisa,why does the last thing you say sound so ominous?
44746,Lisa,i got it! woo hoo! i mean... splendid.
51093,Lisa,why are you here?
51543,Lisa,"actually, i think it--"
51298,Lisa,that's a reference to the brontë sisters!
51863,Lisa,"i think bart's stupid again, mom."
41967,Lisa,bart!
49941,Lisa,"they're right. if the only way to save the whales is to kill another innocent creature, i can't let you do it."
46747,Lisa,what was that?
50385,Lisa,but why?
46977,Lisa,"wow, this place is great. that couch looks really pricey."
51610,Lisa,"while bart was being outwitted by a baby, something was coming to a boil in our pop's brainpan."
48187,Lisa,how did you wind up here?
50043,Lisa,"are you sure about that, grampa?"
49096,Lisa,these badges will get us into any of the independent movies playing at sundance.
41811,Lisa,"sorry, sir. it's just that..."
42799,Lisa,"you're a witness? bart, you have to tell the police."
51915,Lisa,"dad, i get good grades 'cause i'm smart and i pay attention and i study hard."
47560,Lisa,where are you?! are you okay?
44837,Lisa,"oh, i can't wait! in just twenty minutes, we'll be in a three hour line to see the orb of isis."
51203,Lisa,mom! i have to tell you something about dad! something big!
46782,Lisa,break into the bank and snatch that dough...
43782,Lisa,"hmm... you could travel for free if you were a stewardess. well, how badly do you want to get home? all right, all right, how about a courier? they travel for free, too. no, that's a terrier. they're dogs."
48288,Lisa,she looks like she's crying.
51704,Lisa,oh! yippee! fourth-grade a!
48803,Lisa,"dad, all you circled were the ""i's"" and ""a's""."
46143,Lisa,"well, dad, i think running's good exercise -- it adds years to your life."
47189,Lisa,"dad, the traffic's moving."
44268,Lisa,"in a truth-telling contest. right, bart?"
41977,Lisa,"no.... well, we used to have burping contests, but i outgrew it."
44061,Lisa,"okay, start with diagonal colors."
45244,Lisa,no! the smithsonian traveling exhibit.
47176,Lisa,amble!
44095,Lisa,what about our dad?!
49182,Lisa,something about this just doesn't seem right.
46832,Lisa,because you've already done it once.
48902,Lisa,but won't that just shift the burden to your children?
47330,Lisa,"wait, santa's little helper had puppies before."
44416,Lisa,"dad, you don't understand. this saxophone is like my oldest friend. i've had it for as long as i can remember."
42459,Lisa,"bart, you can't go on like this."
42276,Lisa,bart! the winfields didn't have a son.
43838,Lisa,wearing a jamaican hat makes a bold statement about your connection to reggae music.
44128,Lisa,i'm getting used to never getting noticed.
51075,Lisa,i've got to know before you leave! why don't you like me?
44745,Lisa,dearest log: i am me again! and i feel like there's nothing i can't do...except this stupid brain teas...
45465,Lisa,bart! bart! krusty just fired his associate producer!
46548,Lisa,"hey, a helicopter's landing on our lawn!"
43557,Lisa,"this is so weird. it's like something out of dickens or ""melrose place."""
47676,Lisa,"dad, you should listen to him. he's a man of science and you can barely read!"
42251,Lisa,bart! you cast the wrong spell! zombies!
45654,Lisa,lucy?
43001,Lisa,"hello. ""we're here."" ""hi."" etc."
49186,Lisa,mom! dad! bart's on the move!
48567,Lisa,"it's your foot doctor, gil! yes... yes... oh dear... i can't tell him that."
51676,Lisa,judge-judge-judge--
42912,Lisa,only if we're the best.
51843,Lisa,"what, aunt patty?"
52320,Lisa,"dad, we may have saved your soul."
48029,Lisa,the ones made from potatoes?
49092,Lisa,"okay, one more take."
47331,Lisa,and then we got him neutered.
50227,Lisa,you're gonna put him down?
42396,Lisa,"no, thanks."
49321,Lisa,"mr. burns took away their sanctuary, and now they aren't strong enough to survive on their own."
51820,Lisa,is it called the cooling tower because there's--
48370,Lisa,"nelson, you're not really angry at me. you're full of rage 'cause your father abandoned you."
44988,Lisa,i'll go.
52311,Lisa,"so, even if a man takes bread to feed his starving family, that would be stealing?"
52315,Lisa,"thank you, reverend lovejoy."
46350,Lisa,that's not a tall tale. it's a book by mark twain.
43947,Lisa,"i'm sorry, dad. i just find that very cute."
45161,Lisa,i'm surprised they bothered to move it when they moved the town.
52409,Lisa,"way to go, dad."
51520,Lisa,he's my dad.
46200,Lisa,i just don't understand francine's motivation.
47654,Lisa,everyone chickened out. except ralph. he got poached by the chicago tribune.
47861,Lisa,name three.
46114,Lisa,it's so passionate. it almost leaps off the wall.
49109,Lisa,it's just a cat.
49661,Lisa,i'm here! come find me! olly-olly-oxen-free! olly-olly-oxen-free!
52005,Lisa,it's a symbol of what we can all do if we put our minds to it.
44443,Lisa,bart! is that you?!
42033,Lisa,isn't it though?
44542,Lisa,"well, there you go. i hope you all learned a val--"
48601,Lisa,i see. while it would be an honor to be your queen...
48153,Lisa,you don't have a tail anymore.
48455,Lisa,i always wanted a jazz nickname!
43849,Lisa,"you know something, beezee? i think you're right."
51517,Lisa,my hero isn't famous...
43478,Lisa,"dad, can't you have some other kind of party? one where you don't serve meat?"
46629,Lisa,and that's the greatest thing ever written.
44311,Lisa,"oh, dear god!"
46939,Lisa,"mom, you didn't get the milk."
42563,Lisa,plug it in! plug it in!
50925,Lisa,"get along, little buggies!"
45612,Lisa,let's just agree that the commercialization of christmas is at best a mixed blessing.
45515,Lisa,"bart, just let me drop and save yourself!"
42039,Lisa,bart's making faces.
49725,Lisa,"larry, please don't judge our whole family by bart. he's the black sheep. not that black sheep are in any way inferior to white sheep. i do not judge wool by its color -- only by how itchy it is. ooh, look! jazz!"
44173,Lisa,"no, chief, bob's innocent! it's the truth!"
49665,Lisa,"uh-huh, what's an esbat?"
42739,Lisa,"well, i guess you can't beat big business. there's just no room for the little guy."
43529,Lisa,"i don't know, bart. something tells me willie's still out there, and that he could come back any time in any form and kill us in ways we can't even imagine."
49914,Lisa,whales are mammals like us! they're sensitive and deeply intelligent!
45740,Lisa,the door!
45302,Lisa,"i'm going over to protest this disgusting new restaurant called ""the slaughterhouse."" it's decorated with hanging steer carcasses and a fountain of blood."
47850,Lisa,baaart!
43598,Lisa,"...and you'll be bartron, the evil robot from mars, gone berserk."
49954,Lisa,"first of all, my father no longer has any functioning credit cards. secondly, how dare you refer--"
47672,Lisa,"mr. flanders, why are you moving?"
45229,Lisa,mom! bart took what i said and turned it into an insult!
48457,Lisa,"bart, does that even mean anything?"
47620,Lisa,"well, we're not the only ones to be unjustly imprisoned. check out all the left-wing celebrities."
48514,Lisa,"how 'bout this for a title: ""howling at a concrete moon."""
48021,Lisa,oh boy! this is what sunny sunday afternoons are for!
48395,Lisa,"well, talk to me in a week."
42593,Lisa,no! no!
52183,Lisa,"hi, ralph."
46651,Lisa,"while you're singing and dancing, somewhere out there ronaldo is waiting to be found."
46328,Lisa,"no, dad! i think there's a leak in the line."
47167,Lisa,"now's your chance, duffman! you can save my dad and look like a hero!"
50972,Lisa,"guys, can't you see that even an imperfect society is better than the savagery of creating a new one? i for one am glad we're stuck with civilization and i think we will be for a long, long time."
46029,Lisa,not yet.
44204,Lisa,"okay, bart, now it's really time for you to go to bed!"
51440,Lisa,oh my god! it's worse than i thought. everybody wait here while i do some actual research. nobody form any opinions while i'm gone.
48363,Lisa,my name isn't toilet -- it's jake!
50682,Lisa,ow!
48378,Lisa,what have i become?
47247,Lisa,this grown-up makeover / has made me a super-tween / for they are my people / and i am their queen!
47994,Lisa,"hi! this lighting's a little bright. and um, could i get a red wash in the background?"
48561,Lisa,"what? no! i mean, that's a given. but also, the malibu stacy pony beach party set with sparkle sand. it's sold out everywhere."
51657,Lisa,this house is haunted!
44763,Lisa,that was last year's taxes! you have to pay again this year!
51024,Lisa,"thanks, but lowering your voice and standing on paint cans doesn't make you man enough to be my dad."
42344,Lisa,the beeramid contains so much aluminum it would take five men to lift it. twenty-two immigrant laborers died during its construction...
50063,Lisa,"mr. zuckerberg, i'm lisa, and this is nelson."
43322,Lisa,when was the last time you worked?
49567,Lisa,"i should warn you: by using the term ""lame,"" you're violating the americans with disabilities act."
51092,Lisa,no further questions.
44240,Lisa,hi. how are you?
46457,Lisa,i can't believe you're eavesdropping on my prayers!
46911,Lisa,"dad! that information is all wrong! maggie's a baby, not my best friend! you don't know anything about me!"
44426,Lisa,i'm lisa!
50687,Lisa,"you know, you were a lot more adventurous at the dessert table."
44938,Lisa,alex! over here! okay if the new girl sits with us?
51957,Lisa,"no, maggie! come here, girl. come to me."
48555,Lisa,"come on, read, read!"
44816,Lisa,i can't believe they cancelled us for this stupid...
44249,Lisa,aren't you afraid i might take drugs and injure your children?
42805,Lisa,chicks on the bench...
46555,Lisa,"you know, we could get equipment like this through a bond issue."
45719,Lisa,the bird sanctuary -- they ruined it!
46355,Lisa,isn't that the voice that caused all those suicides?
49932,Lisa,bluella?
43112,Lisa,"remember, dad. all glory is fleeting."
51789,Lisa,"mr. musk, before you go, is there anything you could do to give a little girl hope that the world of the future won't be as grim as all our current movies forecast?"
44044,Lisa,i thought you weren't there.
50271,Lisa,"come on, pretend he meant something to you."
49898,Lisa,"you're just a tiny ant, but you were strong enough to pull my brother and me together. now go and be free."
50033,Lisa,sure is cold in here.
52119,Lisa,"oh, brother."
44304,Lisa,"oh, i'm not doing this for the money. i'm just happy knowing that future generations will enjoy unspoiled median strips and pristine highway embankments."
46624,Lisa,"don't worry, beloved parents. god won't let anything happen to me."
51417,Lisa,so the rumors are true: moms can want things.
42542,Lisa,the fox network has sunk to a new low.
42456,Lisa,"hi, dad. want me to cut out this infernal racket?"
44560,Lisa,mom! make him stop!
48709,Lisa,do you want to play a little?
51909,Lisa,arrrgh!
47412,Lisa,"oh bart, i'm sure it's hard to lose your best friend."
51147,Lisa,no! that's impossible! he's dead! i lay a saxophone reed at his grave every year.
51467,Lisa,mom! dad! the retirement home lost its license and grampa has nowhere to live!
48873,Lisa,oh no we won't!
44849,Lisa,"ah, the old number 22. clean, reliable public transportation. the chariot of the people. the ride of choice for the poor and very poor alike. sure, some folks prefer--"
47537,Lisa,uh-oh.
46561,Lisa,"bratwurst, sauerbraten, donderblitzen... mom, isn't there anything vegetarian?"
51640,Lisa,kids love 'em. we trade them at school.
43024,Lisa,"i know most of you have already judged my brother guilty without any proof. but doesn't the bible teach us ""judge not lest ye be judged,"" reverend?"
42284,Lisa,"this wouldn't have anything to do with laura coming over, would it?"
44157,Lisa,and vice versa.
48304,Lisa,fox flew me out here to bring you back. they flew me on frito lay's air force yum!
45760,Lisa,"hey, where's maggie?"
45606,Lisa,ho-ly night...
48663,Lisa,"fort. that's build a ""fort."""
47290,Lisa,"bart, i don't care what mom said. i think you should use this money to take her on a nice vacation."
50986,Lisa,twister!
42719,Lisa,thanks.
44293,Lisa,"what do you mean you don't have anything to recycle? you must have some magazines, or newspapers."
46985,Lisa,wow. i'd better make the most of this.
46604,Lisa,no dad. it's an epic tale from ancient greece.
51664,Lisa,"sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, sad, cute! this one..."
42285,Lisa,i don't care. ask hef over there.
43475,Lisa,do you remember when you lost your passion for this work?
50187,Lisa,mom?
43717,Lisa,"because the myth of jebediah has value, too. it's brought out the best in everyone in this town. regardless of who said it, ""a noble spirit embiggens the smallest man."""
47563,Lisa,"hey, do i hear a back rub?"
47984,Lisa,daddy told me to be brave
51762,Lisa,i thought we weren't allowed to do homework at the table.
46572,Lisa,you know that new baby brother ralph's been bragging about? it's just a pinecone.
45346,Lisa,got me? what are you talking about? i've been volunteering here for a year.
45362,Lisa,"gee, bart, maybe you were right."
46069,Lisa,ya-huh!
45487,Lisa,"uh, i don't think so."
45251,Lisa,america's greatest citizen summed up in one piece of clothing.
42842,Lisa,"dad... you have to put chlorine in the water every day, to keep it clean."
44551,Lisa,yay!/ way to go!
42095,Lisa,she wouldn't be so smart without her teacher's edition.
47527,Lisa,"""dear cosmic wars fan, i'm glad you loved my film?! here's a photo of your favorite new character, jim-jam bonks. may the power be on your side, randall curtis."" he ignored our criticisms!"
46663,Lisa,it smells like the art teacher's office.
48815,Lisa,no.
44615,Lisa,"no we don't, mother!"
46626,Lisa,"what happened, dad? they didn't really burn her, did they?"
44537,Lisa,it's gone...
48373,Lisa,eep.
43819,Lisa,"but immigration is what america's all about. even the simpson family immigrated to america. right, grampa?"
51010,Lisa,"well, the obvious question is... why did i turn out so... academically superior... while bart--"
43864,Lisa,it must be exciting to make a different set of beds.
49785,Lisa,"it's not that easy, bart. i... traded away my pearls! without them, i'm just a big maggie!"
52000,Lisa,"ready for inspection, mom."
52292,Lisa,"dad, do something!"
45869,Lisa,yes?!
51164,Lisa,blob-jitsu kick!
50779,Lisa,you said they'd take it easy on me!
47635,Lisa,"publish it myself? why not? i could put out a whole newspaper dedicated to the rock. i'd be a publisher, just like katherine graham!"
45259,Lisa,you gave away my room!
48540,Lisa,county fair music?
49072,Lisa,there's drama and inspiration everywhere i look.
50491,Lisa,"""d, e""... amazing! oh, but before we continue..."
52176,Lisa,"read the bosom part again, dad."
43664,Lisa,yay!
42040,Lisa,wish i'd thought of that.
51680,Lisa,"you know, they look a little similar."
49536,Lisa,"dad, no!"
50246,Lisa,it's a sign. mom's okay! thank you.
45995,Lisa,"well, this looks like a good place to set up camp."
42269,Lisa,uh... i think it needs a little padding.
51283,Lisa,"okay guys, i got your ice creams."
42628,Lisa,"the few, the proud, the geeky."
46693,Lisa,"bart, stick to the script. don't be a jerk."
48910,Lisa,and ralph is only eight years old! it says in the constitution you have to be thirty-five.
49878,Lisa,"hmm... dad said he was going to ""unite all faiths."" and only one site is sacred to muslims, christians and jews -- the dome of the rock!"
51478,Lisa,"i'm sorry, mom."
45076,Lisa,you might as well. you already made up a phony film credit.
52136,Lisa,there's something not quite right about this.
41855,Lisa,"no, dad, that's hebrew. krusty must be jewish."
45207,Lisa,these super bowl commercials are weird.
48613,Lisa,oh... great! i'd... love to.
50054,Lisa,"hi, nelson."
52495,Lisa,i love how you're dropping all your definite articles.
51858,Lisa,"yeah, bart. you're supposed to be developing verbal abilities for your big aptitude test tomorrow."
49198,Lisa,"boy, aspen sure is ritzy. even the winos look better."
50135,Lisa,i love your pallor.
43750,Lisa,bart can take my place at the plant!
44498,Lisa,fine. i'll come back later. who wants to come back with me? fine.
51688,Lisa,that's it! all we have to do is dig up the time capsule!
48650,Lisa,"mr. spuckler, wait! is this really good for your kids?"
47121,Lisa,i'm lisa simpson and you're the first person i've met here who cares about our animal equals.
44846,Lisa,"hmm. i guess i could take the bus, if you think that's a better idea."
52367,Lisa,bad dog! don't worry snowball. you're safe with me.
44933,Lisa,is that perfume?
50261,Lisa,"come on, bart. afraid of a little apple juice?"
44694,Lisa,"and a spring for his curly tail! huh-huh. oink, oink, oink...huh-huh!"
44125,Lisa,shh. tv.
46076,Lisa,anything else?
52026,Lisa,"bart, i read about what happens to kids whose parents no longer love and cherish each other. they go through eight separate stages. right now, i'm in stage three, fear. you're in stage two, denial."
51047,Lisa,and it's got no pluto! how cutting edge!
52030,Lisa,"frightened, bart? welcome to stage three: fear."
51530,Lisa,how'd you eat the meat without the vegetables?
47480,Lisa,no. that's wrong.
48576,Lisa,ugh. this is the most disgusting place we've ever gone.
41880,Lisa,"dad, that's monaco."
52218,Lisa,"it's the centerpiece, bart!"
47562,Lisa,so... how's the weather in dayton?
44161,Lisa,what were you thinking?
48058,Lisa,thanks for making me feel better.
47582,Lisa,did i do anything right?
50368,Lisa,"i believe the expression is ""ta-da!"""
45830,Lisa,"dad, what do we do?!"
41731,Lisa,"hurry, mom! if we don't get to the convention soon, all the good comics will be gone."
48975,Lisa,it's a tape. martin must've set it to go off when the chrysalises hatched.
45841,Lisa,it got rave reviews from both the entertainment radio network and the radio entertainment network. let's go!
51974,Lisa,but i don't feel like smiling.
48016,Lisa,"dad, please don't go through with this. all through history, self-anointed seers have predicted the end of the world, and they've always been wrong."
46748,Lisa,that caterpillar is screaming.
50787,Lisa,"so, when's the party?"
46189,Lisa,"uh, francine? i think we got off to a bad start so... hey!"
42487,Lisa,oh no. no!
46014,Lisa,i'll just rest here for a minute.
50094,Lisa,i'm gonna do a little research.
51116,Lisa,"i'm sorry i was inconsiderate, milhouse. and furthermore, i respect you more for saying ""no."""
52133,Lisa,heh... heh... heh.
48711,Lisa,all this fuss for a baseball game? why don't thousands come to watch a teacher inspire a child?
46645,Lisa,"no dad, it's just the weather."
46246,Lisa,"hey, you didn't see a warthog!"
43504,Lisa,"i guess i have been pretty hard on a lot of people. especially my dad. thanks, you guys."
43978,Lisa,yes i do! sure i do! look!
46337,Lisa,it's my room!
51427,Lisa,"oh, bart... diggs' problems don't have easy fixes."
43160,Lisa,haven't you ever looked at your globe?
42281,Lisa,"oh, i get it. bart, the baby-sitter's here. let me tuck you in."
45806,Lisa,"bart, we need that to win the contest."
51766,Lisa,"mom, dad's been hypnotized to think he was ten!"
51477,Lisa,"oh, but that orange guy looks like a pumpkin! but this fella is so fuzzy!"
50832,Lisa,hey bart? at least i've got a date!
44225,Lisa,bart! you need first aid! let me in!
43080,Lisa,"yeah, i hope it's as exciting as his other book ""rational thinking: reasonable future!"""
44521,Lisa,it's a bone scraping from that skeleton i found.
51138,Lisa,well then you shouldn't feel bad because i can't imagine myself ever getting married.
49265,Lisa,a couple of hours...
41673,Lisa,but then... you wound up like you.
47955,Lisa,"it's 'cause your bodies are so used to processed food it's a shock when you eat vegetables full of vitamins, minerals and trace amounts of bug feces."
49603,Lisa,"well, she couldn't indulge in strenuous activities like handball, but otherwise she was fine."
42662,Lisa,"dad, don't you see you're abusing your power like all vigilantes? i mean, if you're the police, who will police the police?"
44318,Lisa,congratulations...
44039,Lisa,he's not like you anymore! he's changed! and he doesn't want to hang around with a buncha crumb-bums!
50961,Lisa,wait. how could you know what herman said? you were driving away.
41601,Lisa,really?
42616,Lisa,are you mad?
51095,Lisa,"i move that you dismiss this case, and release this sweet, lovable boy."
48361,Lisa,uh... boy... man... boyman. jake boyman.
50572,Lisa,and they're letting me write the sequel! a hard deadline is just the kick in the pants i need to focus and get some serious writing done!
50907,Lisa,oh my god! you won the pot? you must have nearly a million dollars! i can go to college and live like a kennedy.
51579,Lisa,"yeah, it kind of was. but i won't push it, i promise. see ya!"
45084,Lisa,i'm afraid i can't allow that.
52470,Lisa,"hi zia, how did you do on your math test?"
42875,Lisa,"well, did you ever talk to anyone at the school? make a few calls on my behalf? maybe you could've been ""nicer"" to principal skinner, if you know what i mean."
48473,Lisa,"no, buttercup! no!"
45851,Lisa,"yeah, well, no offense, but maybe i need a little more instruction than just tap-a-tap-a-tap-a."
50119,Lisa,what am i gonna do? i need a pinch-runner with speed!
49741,Lisa,me! me! me! me! me!
51322,Lisa,what?! my mom says you're going through a conservative phase!
45871,Lisa,"oh, please stop!"
44914,Lisa,"what are we looking for, anyway?"
45391,Lisa,"hi, mr. flanders, i see you're reading the newspaper."
50041,Lisa,i never knew artists were all so amazing!
42282,Lisa,homer.
42467,Lisa,"write a cartoon ourselves? bart, are you thinking what i'm thinking?"
48364,Lisa,what are you drawing?
47797,Lisa,drugs aren't so expensive in other countries.
44631,Lisa,"yeah, mom, c'mon. you let us stay up to watch troy mcclure in such other bible epics as ""david vs. super goliath"" and ""suddenly, last supper."""
50353,Lisa,i'm not exactly flattered by that.
45153,Lisa,he's waking up!
43345,Lisa,no! it was bleeding gums murphy.
49706,Lisa,"you can have mine, but he's kind of an idiot."
41875,Lisa,bart! i am not gonna learn ancient hebrew.
45856,Lisa,the cat dances better than i do.
44305,Lisa,you guys shouldn't laugh at him. mr. burns has changed. he's different now.
48476,Lisa,i guess that's it. these animals are all gonna die.
50698,Lisa,why would you want to banish us from springfield?
41655,Lisa,"i'm sorry, honey."
41980,Lisa,he said denver just fumbled.
46012,Lisa,"hey, everybody! i..."
52215,Lisa,"as one of the simpson women, would you like to contribute something to it?"
44482,Lisa,"well, i know you don't want to disappoint dad, but how do you feel about lying to him?"
46588,Lisa,grampa!
45684,Lisa,"uh, dad has the worst luck when he's drinking."
47209,Lisa,"no -- your son! on the biggest day of his life, when he accepts the nobel prize, you're not gonna be there."
51209,Lisa,nothing really.
46236,Lisa,my teacher said i need cupcakes. cupcakes to learn.
49110,Lisa,"thank you, mr. jarmusch -- you've taught me a valuable lesson that other people have bigger family problems than i do."
51532,Lisa,i'm sorry you weren't my first choice. in fact... i had my doubts about using you at all.
49552,Lisa,"i've never been called ""fierce"" before. ""strident..."" ""hectoring"" has been tossed around..."
44177,Lisa,but... but i'm very mature for my age. people often mistake me for nine.
46059,Lisa,"well, you can't post news if you don't have any."
43924,Lisa,oh boy! mold! that's science-fair paydirt!
43711,Lisa,you did. until i realized that jebediah's confession was saying more than he meant it to.
48330,Lisa,"mother, we must protect him. look, he's praying."
48353,Lisa,principal skinner?
49547,Lisa,"dad, if i join a clique, i'll be the kind of person i hate."
49412,Lisa,"dad, bart's throwing away his future!"
49636,Lisa,"yeah, ding-dong-ditch!"
45783,Lisa,we don't own the shores of tripoli.
47595,Lisa,"no, pie man! don't do it!"
46744,Lisa,really? that's wonderful. but how?
52009,Lisa,this is gonna be the best birthday breakfast mom ever had.
42532,Lisa,we're getting 50% of the t-shirt sales.
44312,Lisa,i think i'm going to be sick...
50835,Lisa,at least i'm with someone who tries a little too hard because he really likes me.
45274,Lisa,da-ad!
49907,Lisa,"bart, please! i'm trying to hear dr. house's third incorrect diagnosis before his final correct diagnosis!"
41652,Lisa,"oh, no. now i'm dad."
41695,Lisa,"oh, i mean, were you just going to leave, just like that?"
42111,Lisa,you already petted him for ten minutes.
44341,Lisa,hi.
48481,Lisa,i never wanna go back to that mall. there were eels in the photo booth!
43620,Lisa,"no, let's go to the nature company. they've got a tv assembled by hopi indians!"
45916,Lisa,i wanna see wilmington!
49639,Lisa,i think i'm gonna be sick.
43522,Lisa,"bart, don't you realize what this means? the next time we fall asleep we could die!"
50696,Lisa,i could see a planetarium show without the secondhand marijuana!
48106,Lisa,enough with the tricks!
42170,Lisa,you're serving us gruel?
52314,Lisa,should i have my father arrested?
46542,Lisa,she could get hurt!
46880,Lisa,i guess the network made our show more exciting by dumping the house in a river.
52032,Lisa,"female carrier, bart."
45242,Lisa,the book fair?
48713,Lisa,"bart, come with me. i'll take you to someone who will make you feel better."
42944,Lisa,yayyy!
44363,Lisa,"uh-huh. so, anything else you want to talk about?"
46460,Lisa,no.
43351,Lisa,"gee, your station has a lot of problems."
41803,Lisa,an early crusader for women's rights. she led the floormop rebellion of 1910. later she appeared on the highly unpopular 75 cent piece.
45204,Lisa,now what do we do?
41691,Lisa,"the train, how like him... traditional, yet environmentally sound."
52235,Lisa,"was it because you hate me, or because you're bad?"
52243,Lisa,"i'll be playing my first solo. if you miss it on saturday, i'd advise you to start looking for a child therapist on sunday."
51175,Lisa,we're pretty broken.
42275,Lisa,i don't think we should be down here.
50131,Lisa,"well, my latin's a little rusty, but i think to get everything back in its box, you have to finish the game."
51296,Lisa,"well, you're never alone surrounded by ""the autobiography of charles manson."""
42259,Lisa,what if one of us has been good and one of us has been bad?
48842,Lisa,"ha, you missed them! bart and our alien friend are hundreds of miles away by now."
50656,Lisa,fine. i'll shut down the site.
47699,Lisa,hey look! the new ovenfresh flour bag!
52456,Lisa,as am i.
51805,Lisa,"but to be frank, there's not a lot to recommend it..."
50000,Lisa,"oh i get it. they go to oslo, we get some ice cream."
48587,Lisa,this is not what i wanted at all!
45369,Lisa,why can't we see it now?
48509,Lisa,you have a worldview both bleak and beautiful! i wanna write a report about you!
51752,Lisa,here you go.
48520,Lisa,i'm not here.
50022,Lisa,"well, the combination of me leaving arts camp and you driving on and off the shoulder has made me a little ill."
42580,Lisa,"no, no, they're wrong! the creature they seek is the walking undead. nosferatu! das wampyre!"
52424,Lisa,please don't make me do it.
42855,Lisa,"i'm goin', i'm goin!"
48804,Lisa,"i just want a simple salad with pine nuts, haricots verts, seasonal heirloom tomatoes..."
44457,Lisa,dad! it's three a.m.! can't you mutter in your room?
49036,Lisa,"i've gone through the town's financial records, and it turns out there are millions in uncollected city taxes."
42839,Lisa,"yes, dad."
43221,Lisa,"beautiful dinnerware, mrs. parkfield."
51893,Lisa,the sad truth is all families are like us.
46612,Lisa,"yes, sir."
49950,Lisa,...and that is why hybrid car buyers should be given rebates paid for by taxes on hamburgers.
46951,Lisa,"that's fung pang-li, the seven-foot sensation from szechwan!"
45294,Lisa,how can you embarrass me like this? you won't sit through anything that doesn't have car crashes!
48809,Lisa,it is! tenor andrea bocelli recorded an entire song on his back.
46844,Lisa,yes.
42227,Lisa,but those other girls are prettier than me.
45431,Lisa,"dad, that's fox!"
42200,Lisa,know what i think would help?
52281,Lisa,"please, dad...please"
42654,Lisa,"i'm not a state, i'm a monster!"
44862,Lisa,but i'm lost and i need to know where --
42498,Lisa,let me see that.
51261,Lisa,is bart cheating?
46353,Lisa,maybe you need to take the leprechaun and sic it on the gypsy.
47361,Lisa,"bart, we're gonna lose. we have to do something."
51368,Lisa,"what i'm saying is, you could produce foreign versions of your tv show with actors from other countries..."
51526,Lisa,"hey, dad."
41755,Lisa,"it's to open the crate, stupid."
42265,Lisa,it wasn't that great.
43720,Lisa,"bart, leave simpson alone."
47765,Lisa,get me number nine / and if you disconnect me / i'll chop off your be...
47346,Lisa,"dad, i don't like the looks of this neighborhood."
46577,Lisa,i met one of my heroes today. she started the f--
52443,Lisa,ewww. gross.
45798,Lisa,really? anything good?
49171,Lisa,this is evidence.
43484,Lisa,it's bad enough they're all eating meat. they don't have to rub it in my face.
44716,Lisa,but those candy bars are all squished and melted.
45152,Lisa,dad!
46242,Lisa,"hey, how ya doin' there? / hi! / hello. / yo, kitenge! what's going on?"
46966,Lisa,"if i ever needed proof of the existence of god, here it is."
43397,Lisa,nancy drew says that all you need to solve a mystery is an inquisitive temperament and two good friends. and i've got an inquisitive temperament! maybe i could help solve this!
50156,Lisa,"well, um, i was looking through mom's old schoolwork, and i noticed her grades went down when she started going out with you."
50211,Lisa,like those chairs in the music room?
43095,Lisa,"mom, are you sure you don't want to discuss it?"
49844,Lisa,how did you--
45293,Lisa,your snoring is disturbing the dancers.
43764,Lisa,why do you need me?
45095,Lisa,"no, pause, pause!"
43182,Lisa,it is off.
49937,Lisa,"run! i mean, swim! i mean ."
42578,Lisa,and...?
41756,Lisa,"no, maggie. not az-tec. ol-mec. ol-mec."
43206,Lisa,that man is instantly the most annoying person i've ever met. a soy-based snack will calm me down.
43461,Lisa,awwww.
50389,Lisa,"sold, to the lowest bidder!"
52288,Lisa,"hi, dad. want me to cut out this infernal racket?"
48131,Lisa,"what do you think? huh? huh? pretty heartfelt, huh? huh?"
42903,Lisa,relatively?
43510,Lisa,"i still stand by my beliefs, but i can't defend what i did. i'm sorry i messed up your barbecue."
51848,Lisa,rudolph the red nosed reindeer / had a very shiny nose / and if you ever saw it / you would even say it glowed
45708,Lisa,"really -- hey, what are you doing?"
49690,Lisa,"no, thank you. i've been rational but nerdy my whole life. but these past few weeks, you girls made me feel cool. cool! me! lisa simpson!"
48915,Lisa,maybe you wouldn't be such a bad president.
52370,Lisa,"on the left is mr. largo, my music teacher at school. he taught me that even the noblest concerto can be drained of its beauty and soul. and on the right is bleeding gums murphy. he taught me that music is like a fire in your belly that comes out of your mouth, so you better stick an instrument in front of it."
46731,Lisa,sixteen.
44685,Lisa,maybe i can't concentrate because of all your cooties.
45674,Lisa,"dad, you only took one course."
46667,Lisa,"it's time for your surprise, dad."
43367,Lisa,"whatever you do, mom, we'll be proud of you."
43870,Lisa,i wonder where all the kids are.
42723,Lisa,i want you to hear what malibu stacy is telling a generation of little girls.
43350,Lisa,what if i could find it?
48258,Lisa,oh no!
42468,Lisa,"according to this book, the first thing we need is a setting."
49633,Lisa,you killed her?
46587,Lisa,i'm really gonna miss him.
47823,Lisa,why did you burn up your shirt?
50042,Lisa,do you think that i could be an artist in the city?
49024,Lisa,i want to talk about a horrible practice afflicting millions of americans. for years we've known how dangerous it is. it stunts your growth. and it's marketed to children. i'm talking about ballet.
41940,Lisa,"come here, maggie."
51429,Lisa,"pass the peas, please."
47047,Lisa,"oh, that's easy. first it's introduced, then it goes to committee, then..."
50790,Lisa,"what is the point? i think this is the end of me. all i had was my integrity. and now that's gone. i'm sorry, i'm so sorry. i try not to cry till you're asleep."
46444,Lisa,i feel like i want to throw up.
52331,Lisa,we didn't say anything.
47607,Lisa,make mine calico!
41896,Lisa,"hey, here's a good job, dad. oh wait, you have to know how to operate a ultrasonic lithotryptor."
48055,Lisa,we've gotta tell dad! where is he?
45128,Lisa,she doesn't know. you're the only one i've told.
51123,Lisa,it came with fries or salad.
42460,Lisa,we're a family again!
52474,Lisa,"i am trying to deal with my disrespectful daughter, but you are too clueless to understand what that's like."
44704,Lisa,dear log: can it be true? do all simpsons go through a process of dumbening?
44759,Lisa,"be careful, dad."
45860,Lisa,curtain puller?!
47953,Lisa,"well, i think this family should try more vegetarian meals. we'd feel better and live longer."
41680,Lisa,"i'll tell you what's wrong: you getting a c on this project and winding up at a third-rate college. lisa, the world needs you to go to wellesley!"
51058,Lisa,more than i want unicorns to be real!
45396,Lisa,i think so.
44381,Lisa,"i can't, they're stuck."
50410,Lisa,you're gonna regret the day you were born!
47477,Lisa,people who accuse others of being gay are often covering up their own latent homosexuality.
46110,Lisa,"they are coming back for us, aren't they?"
44980,Lisa,so un-ask her.
47271,Lisa,"i see. principal skinner, may i make an announcement to the school?"
47558,Lisa,i'm an orphan!
43648,Lisa,mom?
50924,Lisa,not sure what your motivation for that is.
52170,Lisa,"i can't help but feel that if we had gotten to know each other better, my leaving would actually have meant something."
43584,Lisa,bart! bart! what are you doing?! we've got to get out of here!
50516,Lisa,yay! / x-games! x-games! / alright!
52395,Lisa,will you take us to mt. splashmore?
51338,Lisa,i'll make both.
51501,Lisa,hmm... this quaint artist community has gotten a little touristy.
44357,Lisa,apparently tim was someone who was with the general moments before he was shot right in the head.
45566,Lisa,"dad, i'm tired of bathing in the yard. plus, i think rod and todd are watching."
51986,Lisa,no.
51549,Lisa,maybe this isn't the sport for you.
46334,Lisa,what about us?
50825,Lisa,lisa simpson / lisa simpson...
48060,Lisa,stop scaring me!
42263,Lisa,we got beets!
48928,Lisa,i did not!
47844,Lisa,"ah, pre-modern man. if these wise warriors could speak, what would they tell us?"
41997,Lisa,i'd bet my entire college fund on it.
51169,Lisa,ki-ya--
48746,Lisa,"what if santa's little helper stops being a police dog? then he can get a non-violent job, like barking songs on novelty christmas records. you can do it, boy!"
46037,Lisa,"so, this is your mysterious new job for mr. burns?"
45055,Lisa,to protect and sever?
50320,Lisa,so i guess the lesson here is...
46169,Lisa,ow! ow!
44659,Lisa,"oh, figs."
50963,Lisa,"grampa, why is the saddest story you ever told the only one that's ever made sense?"
49998,Lisa,"i'm just gonna chill out with a little ""this american life."""
43340,Lisa,it's only maggie.
46625,Lisa,huh. getting kind of hot around here.
44130,Lisa,do you think we'll ever see her again?
52071,Lisa,"come on, bart. the tape showed that the robber heated up a burrito."
47389,Lisa,not if i pump your heart full of morphine first!
45512,Lisa,i don't think so!
44417,Lisa,nuh-uh.
51063,Lisa,"""ann, mark, bill and sally are on the ferris wheel. ann is behind sally. mark is in front of bill."
48737,Lisa,"dad, why don't you throw me in the air, and i can see which way is out."
51775,Lisa,no! let's take the eagle to shelbyville animal rescue. where you took that injured hummingbird you found on the front lawn.
44715,Lisa,"if she started dinner three minutes earlier, we wouldn't be in this mess!"
44755,Lisa,"eh, sort of."
44827,Lisa,drugs.
52529,Lisa,are you sure?
49478,Lisa,"no, that's not it! a secret message this awkwardly-worded is always an anagram."
49498,Lisa,dunkilderry is so quaint! it looks like the puzzle at the pediatrician's office.
52434,Lisa,no. homework's not my father's specialty.
45129,Lisa,but what i did was wrong.
47185,Lisa,"c'mon, we're gonna be late to the blooming of the sumatran century flower."
49902,Lisa,dad! i found what you're looking for!
44504,Lisa,"okay, everyone! back to work! you never know when we might uncover a tyrannosaurus."
44634,Lisa,"hey, martin seconded the motion. it's entirely his fault."
43933,Lisa,they're evolving so quickly! they've already reached the renaissance... wait! one of them is nailing something to the door of the cathedral! i've created lutherans!
45567,Lisa,and why aren't i at school?
50456,Lisa,how did this bookshelf get here so fast? i bet it's shoddy.
48386,Lisa,"that's right, everyone. the best math student in the whole school is a girl!"
49622,Lisa,stupid miss hoover.
51717,Lisa,"wow, he's right."
44948,Lisa,they left without me.
49873,Lisa,"krusty, i've been meaning to ask, what are you doing on this tour?"
47652,Lisa,i think it distracts people from more important social issues.
43486,Lisa,"i'm never ever apologizing because i was standing up for a just cause and you were wrong, wrong, wrong! now if you'll excuse me, i'm going to my room."
43833,Lisa,what are you talking about?
45489,Lisa,bon appetit.
41840,Lisa,"dad, i think this paper is a flimsy hodgepodge of pie graphs, factoids and larry king."
48463,Lisa,"ooh, but this one is precious!"
44621,Lisa,grades?
45822,Lisa,"dad, those are just the names of the quizzes. you're supposed to open the magazine."
44237,Lisa,mag-gie!
49620,Lisa,"congratulations, hubert. or should i congratulate your tutor: amelia, at the homework factory! your victory is tainted! asterisk! asterisk!"
45044,Lisa,gee!
50742,Lisa,kidzone... let me guess: a broken foosball table and a game of clue missing its candlestick.
50152,Lisa,"maggie, something happened to mom and i'm gonna find out what and when."
44810,Lisa,"nelson, cover for me."
48009,Lisa,"bart, you look worse than aunt patty in the morning. and there ain't nothin' looks worse than aunt patty in the morning."
46580,Lisa,i'm annie oakley!
46987,Lisa,"this is just a kickball with ""mars"" written on it."
41979,Lisa,wouldn't it be fun if we watched the game together?
50132,Lisa,you're gonna have to deal with more nonsense like that.
47818,Lisa,just what we need. another lame suburban kid who loves rap.
41802,Lisa,i'm too excited to sleep. anyone up for the winifred beecher howe memorial?
52219,Lisa,"hey, bart, stop it!"
48490,Lisa,"bart, did your mystical jewish monster beat up those bullies?"
46491,Lisa,uh huh.
50519,Lisa,"don't worry about it, mom. dad will take us on a great outing next weekend."
51666,Lisa,this is clearly a fracking site. how are they keeping people away?
50219,Lisa,"oh... okay, maybe he's not so bad."
50930,Lisa,"oh, thank god! just a dream!"
48700,Lisa,this is what i think of your yellow card!
45438,Lisa,never mind. looks like the flanders' are gonna get those seats anyway.
49793,Lisa,thank you.
42202,Lisa,"dad, can i ask you a question?"
43255,Lisa,but you promised my dad you would.
47238,Lisa,"... and we deserve a french teacher who actually speaks french. j'accuse, monsieur kupferberg!"
48507,Lisa,"what a deep, tormented soul..."
45581,Lisa,they're spying on us. why would they do that?
45437,Lisa,"no, no, we're going to paris. i can feel it."
46342,Lisa,yeah. / pretty much.
51953,Lisa,so typical of bart. all he thinks about is himself.
51902,Lisa,there go my young-girl dreams of vassar.
47764,Lisa,... hell-o operator...
48195,Lisa,i feel so sick.
47444,Lisa,"oh bart, that's really sweet."
43998,Lisa,"oh, how does bart do this every week?"
43496,Lisa,"wow, a secret staircase? but what do you do if somebody wants a non-alcoholic beer?"
48374,Lisa,"not yet. if i do, she'll never let me go to the boys' math class again."
49493,Lisa,well that sucked! / there's a day we'll never get back! / i was so bored.
50798,Lisa,"please, take your time."
43519,Lisa,"don't make us poke your eyes out, dad."
42611,Lisa,"quit it, bart. quit it. quit it. quit it. mom, bart's making faces."
45049,Lisa,hey!
48626,Lisa,"eating mock buffalo steaks made from peaceful turnip roots, uh, they... environment... umm, dignity... corn god... i'm sorry, i can't do this!"
43653,Lisa,oh my god! krusty's shoes!
42703,Lisa,a hush falls over the general assembly as stacy approaches the podium to deliver what will no doubt be a stirring and memorable address.
49174,Lisa,"and i'm never gonna go to machu picchu. in this family, you get used to disappointments."
45909,Lisa,swings!
43654,Lisa,"bart, you're seeing krusty everywhere because you want to tell him you're sorry for causing his death. would it help if i told you you're not responsible for krusty's death?"
42223,Lisa,are we done?
48810,Lisa,and you contributed to our culture!
44678,Lisa,"you look a little nervous, dad."
46092,Lisa,"well maybe if mom didn't make such dry waffles. there, i said it!"
52272,Lisa,"anywhere but hamburgers, pizza or fried chicken."
47036,Lisa,"there's the 10:50 from newark... the 10:52 from phoenix, connecting from dallas... the 10:55 from portland is running late. again. there it is."
46908,Lisa,well... this could be fun. let's watch it.
48182,Lisa,that's a dvd of a fellini movie!
52420,Lisa,"yes, but i didn't do it."
48723,Lisa,then i guess you wouldn't mind eating one.
52029,Lisa,i stand corrected.
48224,Lisa,"oh no, bart blamed this on the dog! i didn't pet him for weeks! oh, i'm sorry i doubted you, boy."
47752,Lisa,wha--?!
45912,Lisa,"oh, that's it!"
47631,Lisa,"""postcard image, thing to see--"""
48903,Lisa,that means that springfield's presidential primary will be first in the nation! even earlier than new hampshire!
44510,Lisa,it looks like a human skeleton... but these other bones look almost like wings.
41634,Lisa,oh my god! my brother's my best friend.
48044,Lisa,"i get it. every week they send out two pamphlets, half picking one team and half picking the other. eventually, there's a small group of people who only receive the correct predictions -- and think professor pigskin is always right! that's when they ask for your money."
42340,Lisa,"aunt selma, this may be presumptuous, but have you ever considered artificial insemination?"
43558,Lisa,"oh, i just keep them out to bug bart."
46919,Lisa,and look at the way they've slathered those pigs with cosmetics!
44850,Lisa,yes.
45883,Lisa,"dad, the bride and groom are supposed to cut the wedding cake!"
47822,Lisa,dad!? why did you do that?
46018,Lisa,"lightning?! well, at least it wasn't my fault."
41668,Lisa,"you can do it, lisa. there's nothing in the room but you and the test."
49062,Lisa,what's going on?
45999,Lisa,it's lisa!
51282,Lisa,"ooh, good... nice... ""beat dallas."" can never argue with that."
46838,Lisa,thanks. where'd you get?...
50120,Lisa,bart!
50231,Lisa,"marking a crime scene. to celebrate a ancient pagan ritual, this tree was cut down and tarted up like a dime-a-dance floozy."
45383,Lisa,"people, stop! stop! we're not animals!"
52234,Lisa,"bart, why did you burn my centerpiece?"
52003,Lisa,valhalla is where vikings go when they die.
49491,Lisa,"mom, wait! maggie is the gem child! she's brought peace to our town! and reports of less road rage in shelbyville! she has to stay here!"
42355,Lisa,"dad, hide your shame!"
46295,Lisa,you know about i.m. pei? i.m. impressed.
48505,Lisa,"my report on a ""fascinating springfielder"" is due monday, and everybody i've tried to interview is so boring."
42267,Lisa,sorry bart.
46535,Lisa,you wanna know what happened?
41819,Lisa,bart!
46060,Lisa,at least take off your pulitzer prize when you say that.
52189,Lisa,embrace nothingness.
50631,Lisa,they-they don't?
51232,Lisa,we thought we'd escaped from our psychotic guide...
43412,Lisa,and we don't even know whose gun that was. maybe somebody planted it there to frame dad.
45143,Lisa,"mom, don't."
45401,Lisa,oh. what do you produce?
43176,Lisa,how could you forget? they had signs posted all over the library.
42852,Lisa,"hello? hey, i'm stuck in here. i gotta think of a way to get out."
47024,Lisa,you mean you're all still proud of me?
46955,Lisa,"dad, i think this might be the work of satan."
52015,Lisa,no!
44923,Lisa,"uh, i was just trying to find dave barry's column."
47792,Lisa,mr. burns acting nice? that's odd. he must be up to something.
49705,Lisa,more...
51358,Lisa,they find me a pointy-haired know-it-all.
41702,Lisa,nothing.
50911,Lisa,sure. i have the ending for my memoir!
49079,Lisa,orlando or hollywood?
49550,Lisa,i'm a big girl! i'm a big girl!
45992,Lisa,"mom, dad, there's something i have to do. you're not gonna like it, but i really believe it's the right thing."
46620,Lisa,you can't stop me! i was sent by god!
47925,Lisa,where are we?
51337,Lisa,you're just taking advantage of the situation.
42874,Lisa,why am i still rotting away in the second grade instead of being skipped ahead?
46440,Lisa,that's just a dog in a space suit.
51033,Lisa,it looks like you're not the only predatory opportunist in town.
51970,Lisa,"yeah, but i don't feel any better."
47056,Lisa,"i got a gold star at school today, for my exposé on toxins in gold-star adhesive."
43341,Lisa,that's only the cat.
46397,Lisa,but you're not even using them.
49555,Lisa,"no, there's a middle ground."
43535,Lisa,sorry.
43076,Lisa,see?
44713,Lisa,"yeah... huh, huh, huh, maybe people got hurt!"
43813,Lisa,it doesn't work.
45197,Lisa,"yeah, i'm bored too."
47385,Lisa,"i guess you're right, principal tamzarian."
50883,Lisa,more importantly it's a college fund...
51510,Lisa,"okay, calm down. maybe he's talking about margaret mead."
49327,Lisa,to that new stadium that looks exactly like a hive!
47534,Lisa,"your early movies are timeless classics. please, mr. curtis. go back to what made your first films so great."
48430,Lisa,there's a triple a battery in my macaroni and cheese!
45218,Lisa,"ohhh, it sounds so real!"
43352,Lisa,two hundred and fifty dollars! but i need that album to honor the memory of bleeding gums murphy.
44851,Lisa,"look! it's the bus! the bus! come on, you're gonna miss the bus!"
51487,Lisa,i've tried to give pokey a perfect replica of his natural habitat:
50093,Lisa,i mean the point guard.
51347,Lisa,and those principles have consistently been in place during this country's most prosperous times. so if that's a liberal then i am a liberal... and hang me.
46874,Lisa,why don't we stay at a youth hostel?
47613,Lisa,we've become pariahs! in the last two hours i've gotten one thousand hate spams.
45728,Lisa,agreed.
46952,Lisa,look! that's lisa leslie! she showed little girls everywhere that they can grow up to be six foot five!
52147,Lisa,"once upon a midnight dreary,"
51550,Lisa,can i join you for lunch?
51376,Lisa,"if i have to give presents, i'll give presents with a purpose. one for maggie... check."
50083,Lisa,thrust! parry! dodge! poke!
43718,Lisa,"you know, dad, assisting mr. burns could give your career a real shot in the arm."
45057,Lisa,look!
42439,Lisa,come gather 'round children / it's high-time ye learns / 'bout a hero named homer / and a devil named burns / we'll march till we drop / the girls and the fellas / will fight till the death or else fold like umbrellas
42495,Lisa,"then, what should i do?"
44626,Lisa,hoverbikes!!
42513,Lisa,"you're still my hero, mom."
48795,Lisa,"of course. gosh, dad, your hands are shaking!"
51823,Lisa,eight.
43660,Lisa,but we saw your plane crash...
49788,Lisa,"no, this can't be right."
45991,Lisa,"you're welcome to come, too."
48891,Lisa,bob planned this from the beginning --
44731,Lisa,"uhh, you bet i am!"
43921,Lisa,ow! what's that supposed to prove?
48462,Lisa,"well, i kind of like this guy..."
45097,Lisa,"no, you live in a different house."
42345,Lisa,look! it's the seven duffs!
44172,Lisa,bart!
44283,Lisa,"yes. um, does your plant have a recycling program?"
48068,Lisa,groundskeeper willie?
42642,Lisa,"dad, what do you think?"
45653,Lisa,"stupid, inconsiderate bunch of jerks... i can't believe, after i..."
45485,Lisa,the food is delicious.
46418,Lisa,"well, the important thing is, they're both safe."
52490,Lisa,"actually, terrence, this is a synthetic substance. devised for zombie vegans, or ""zegans."""
48622,Lisa,we were south... west of... north dakota-lahoma.
50614,Lisa,"um, none."
45322,Lisa,we'll never be able to swim that far.
49716,Lisa,"oh, gross, gross, gross, gross."
50674,Lisa,somehow i missed that phase.
42425,Lisa,hamster one... bart... zero.
44113,Lisa,"hurry nanny, things are"
51331,Lisa,what are ya doing? s'imaginary.
45398,Lisa,"you want me to join mensa? oh, that's wonderful. but don't i have to take some sort of i.q. test?"
49988,Lisa,i can see that down deep is a decent man.
43380,Lisa,"it is unfeasible to resurrect the dead, bart. and even if the three stooges were alive, i doubt they'd want to hang around with you."
41616,Lisa,in i.q. only!
51924,Lisa,"i'm not a little egg sucker, am i?"
48274,Lisa,treasure?!
52499,Lisa,that is so typical of you.
44778,Lisa,"and now, sports."
51586,Lisa,"oh god, i'm gonna be sick!"
50052,Lisa,"ooh, your first customer. be nice!"
45704,Lisa,i can't believe those idiot judges were impressed by glowing plastic tubes.
49879,Lisa,krav maga!
44505,Lisa,don't give up! i'm sure we'll find something!
47791,Lisa,it doesn't seem fair to the regular visitors.
46551,Lisa,but west springfield's three times the size of texas. we'll never find him there.
51735,Lisa,they revamped this ride because of massive complaints from two people.
46327,Lisa,he's speaking in tongues!
42096,Lisa,that's right. it was i.
48142,Lisa,janey's father just takes her to the zoo once a month. couldn't you be that kind of dad?
50027,Lisa,it's just... dinner conversation at arts camp was a bit more stimulating. one night we spoke only in lines from famous poems.
43573,Lisa,"gramma, have you ever thought about moving back to springfield?"
49657,Lisa,"well, there's only one game we can play in the car over and over and over again. ""bonk it."""
51220,Lisa,no one can use it but no one gets hurt!
48610,Lisa,"you're right. i'll just need to find ""traditional garb""..."
44273,Lisa,where's santa's little helper?
51025,Lisa,"now remember, i can't sit backwards or i get sick."
51811,Lisa,"well, it would've helped if you hadn't crumpled up all the paper before we wrote anything on it."
46203,Lisa,"willie, i need to see the school security tapes."
43262,Lisa,i thought you said you'd tell me about my true love?
41730,Lisa,"way to go, grampa."
43377,Lisa,i'd like to start a jazz program for the music department. we've got a really great instructor lined up...
43027,Lisa,"oh, what the heck, it was jessica lovejoy."
46261,Lisa,"no, dr. bushwell is a woman."
49744,Lisa,don't forget the unicorn!
47605,Lisa,"uh, i think we'll go to bed now."
41589,Lisa,stop telling me that.
45267,Lisa,squeaking that chair!
48129,Lisa,"hello. i'm looking for something in a pipe cleaner. extra bendy, with medium fuzz."
51231,Lisa,"a gumbamel's a camel but faster and humbler. it doesn't take tips and it's never a grumbler. so if you must leave in a kind of a scramble, then jump on the hump of a humble gumbamel."
52186,Lisa,"and, finally, the most important book of all, the tao te ching by lao tzu."
50746,Lisa,sweet? sweet?! the passengers on this ship could be the last people on earth!
52090,Lisa,"oh, no!"
49429,Lisa,"for he's a fabulous flanders, which nobody can deny!"
51822,Lisa,"wow, dad! thank you!"
47314,Lisa,"wow, look at all this stuff."
46411,Lisa,then i'll have the sweet 'n' sour rice.
50957,Lisa,how did santa's little helper get in there?
46164,Lisa,"an aircraft carrier? oh, that's subtle."
47452,Lisa,ice?
43958,Lisa,"oh, my eyes are burning!"
43733,Lisa,and soon.
49205,Lisa,just ask those guys for directions.
51046,Lisa,she's brought her own orrery!
45641,Lisa,"so, how was your day?"
42986,Lisa,"no, bart, don't you see? dead people can't vote!"
52425,Lisa,"when i fall asleep, mr. bergstrom is the last thing i think of, and he's my first thought when i wake up."
45859,Lisa,why isn't my name in the program?
42779,Lisa,ow! my hair!
48423,Lisa,"but, grampa, in nineteen forty-two, they only played women's baseball here."
45436,Lisa,i don't think there's enough here for a vacation.
43028,Lisa,"if you search her room, i am certain you will find the money."
46600,Lisa,"mom, you're hurting me."
50306,Lisa,"dad, is there anything unusual in grampa's coffee?"
52472,Lisa,sometimes i wish strangling your kid was still legal.
45132,Lisa,intendent--
51660,Lisa,shut up!
48756,Lisa,big chief rotten cheeks chewing tobacco...a take-a-penny tray with a quarter in it!
45286,Lisa,da-ad.
46210,Lisa,of course! the nose clip!
41902,Lisa,"i called her. she's not home. i also tried mr. flanders, aunt patty, aunt selma, dr. hibbert, reverend lovejoy and that nice man who caught the snake in our basement."
41686,Lisa,"dad, bart's feet are on my half of the shell!"
48088,Lisa,not scared... not scared...
50061,Lisa,isn't that a christmas tie?
45211,Lisa,"that's not really you, dad. he's just a fictional character who happens to have the same name."
45311,Lisa,"oh, that's it. i'm putting an end to this."
47240,Lisa,"i'm not that cool, i don't wear jeans / i've polished an apple or two / but every grade that i grubbed, i grubbed it for you... / so call me bookworm / but i'll never squirm, when there's work to be done / yes i'll take my lunch at my desk / while you're all outside having fun..."
48263,Lisa,...when suddenly i heard...
41953,Lisa,"it's not our fault our generation has short attention spans, dad. we watch an appalling amount of tv."
48165,Lisa,you really speak italian?!
46088,Lisa,it sounded like a silo tipping over!
51397,Lisa,"thanks, bart. this'll make a lot of arctic loons very happy."
44448,Lisa,hey! it worked!
51488,Lisa,"peruvian feather grass, an incan sleeping mat, and a portrait of marisol espinoza, the vice president of peru."
50351,Lisa,would you... be interested in teaching me?
41800,Lisa,only two. i checked.
52358,Lisa,wow. neat. it smells historic.
47065,Lisa,"hmm, maybe i could be an expert on dinosaurs."
51816,Lisa,charles m. schulz.
45471,Lisa,you'll see...
44535,Lisa,"look, you can either accept science and face reality, or you can believe in angels and live in a childish dream world."
43481,Lisa,they can't seriously expect us to swallow that tripe!
44016,Lisa,"please don't ruin this for me, bart. i think he's starting to like me!"
43615,Lisa,we are not wieners!
41688,Lisa,that life is worth living.
51284,Lisa,"dad! we're missing ""the giant capybaras of uruguay!"""
50215,Lisa,"yes, i believe i have your pigeon, ""raymond bird,"" and i need to know how to return him to you."
47868,Lisa,i'm relinquishing the poke-pole.
48042,Lisa,who's professor pigskin?
47109,Lisa,dad!
50684,Lisa,but grampa...
51278,Lisa,"and some of the angles are loooooow. but don't worry, collective bargaining will enable us to secure concessions."
50550,Lisa,can you believe publishers would lie to their readers just to make an easy million bucks?
43346,Lisa,saxophone! he was a jazz musician.
48162,Lisa,that's my italian tutor!
43694,Lisa,"jebediah springfield was nothing more than an evil, blood-thirsty pirate who hated this town!"
47801,Lisa,"we just wanted to thank you. because of the xanax, i'm not over-anxious about being a simpson anymore. i am a little anxious about being on xanax, but the zoloft covers that nicely."
42055,Lisa,"sure it is. hey bart, let's do some homework."
51267,Lisa,i know the answer. i'm gonna force you to turn yourself in.
50692,Lisa,"i know it's futile, but i must again point out there is no dragon."
44354,Lisa,sorry. sorry. i know we'll be friends. talk about getting off on the wrong foot... heh heh.
51930,Lisa,hey! give those back!
48199,Lisa,sideshow bob has sworn a vendetta against us.
49094,Lisa,my movie got in! i'm going to the sundance film festival!
50558,Lisa,"spot, stop, sop, top-tops, pot-pots, opt-opts, post!"
49285,Lisa,it was my brother bart!
47313,Lisa,grampa! you have a job?
44397,Lisa,"mom, are those rabbits dead?"
45315,Lisa,"we can't keep living like this. moses, ask pharaoh to let your people go."
48422,Lisa,it's amazing they've gotten five hundred and twelve shows out of this premise.
42927,Lisa,"oh, no. it's a package from ralph."
44839,Lisa,wait! you promised to take me to the museum!
50185,Lisa,self-published?
45246,Lisa,"sorry, dad. my mind is made up."
49963,Lisa,that's a rather unambitious book.
52099,Lisa,"quiet, bart. let's make the best of this."
48143,Lisa,"oh, yeah."
52205,Lisa,oatmeal.
46996,Lisa,s-c-a-b-i-e-s.
48522,Lisa,but we were a team!
49769,Lisa,"one labatty, please."
48731,Lisa,that's just someone barbecuing.
47549,Lisa,they're going into multi-purpose room b!
41612,Lisa,"howdy pardners, my name is sheriff..."
51933,Lisa,"hey, everybody. here comes my brother, bart the bully­ killer!"
45560,Lisa,ew! these records used to be real accomplishments. now they're just gross.
46107,Lisa,"oh, dad."
45885,Lisa,"moe, can i give you some shrimp for the road?"
45458,Lisa,"bart, don't..."
51635,Lisa,"mom, it's trash talk. you know how guys say mean things to their friends, the way women say nice things to their enemies."
44024,Lisa,how am i supposed to get home?
51799,Lisa,"bart, i need your help to write a new anthem for springfield. will you team up with me?"
44710,Lisa,"isn't there any way i can change my dna, like sitting on the microwave?"
44833,Lisa,uh... mom?
47225,Lisa,she was acquitted. then they put her back in jail on a technicality.
52516,Lisa,should i have married nelson? 'cause we still talk on the phone.
49609,Lisa,no one even plays four-square anymore -- they just gossip.
45412,Lisa,done!
46464,Lisa,you guys are buddhists?
42660,Lisa,"what, this jug?"
43969,Lisa,"he's not a drifter, mom. that's mr. burns's son, larry."
50264,Lisa,why are you hung over? i didn't see you drink last night.
48755,Lisa,look what the bullies could have stolen...
42403,Lisa,"dear, dear george washington. can this liberty you dream of be worth all this bloodshed?"
44844,Lisa,"ahm... i wasn't a hundred per cent clear on that. she said something, but she was kind of in a rush to get bart to the emergency room."
45700,Lisa,anybody got a building permit? 'cause we nailed it!
49177,Lisa,tracking software? you're spying on bart!
47863,Lisa,he did try to cheer me up when my hamster died.
47879,Lisa,how dare you make light of that brutal--
46322,Lisa,"bye, mr. flanders."
50202,Lisa,"a little tired of revenge, are we?"
46971,Lisa,"bart, where are you gonna live?"
42062,Lisa,"""and any time i hear the wind blow, it will whisper the name... edna!"""
47274,Lisa,meh.
50772,Lisa,they have itchy and scratchy weddings?
41867,Lisa,"excuse us, rabbi krustofsky?"
41719,Lisa,half a gallon of chocolate.
52141,Lisa,wait a minute!
45839,Lisa,"north dakota, here we come!"
48252,Lisa,"i think this is the perfect job for the new you, willie. it requires sophistication, tact, and you get to meet the highest class of people."
46209,Lisa,hmm...
41825,Lisa,you change it.
42714,Lisa,it's awful being a kid. no one listens to you.
49187,Lisa,you guys look exhausted. maybe you oughta rest for a while.
45636,Lisa,those boys of mine.
43036,Lisa,"mom, this is really scary. i'm gonna get my first 'f' ever."
42724,Lisa,change what she says. it's your company.
45808,Lisa,"now, when the mama bird returns to feed her babies, we'll have a prize-winning picture."
48324,Lisa,what secrets?
41960,Lisa,"dad, this is a hundred and ten dollars."
42553,Lisa,three little maids from school are we / pert as a schoolgirl well can be / filled to the brim with girlish glee / three little maids from school...
42247,Lisa,no.
52432,Lisa,"yesterday, he read us ""charlotte's web"", and cried at the end, never trying to hide his tears."
51088,Lisa,objection! prejudicial!
47237,Lisa,"no, i'm gonna stick to my platform of incremental policy amelioration: fluoridated water fountains, vegan lunch options..."
49401,Lisa,"no, that's it."
44149,Lisa,"mom, john likes ""itchy and scratchy"" as much as we do -- maybe more!"
41876,Lisa,"there, there, rabbi. it's not too late."
48160,Lisa,huh?
49936,Lisa,huh?
44124,Lisa,been there. done it.
52308,Lisa,no.
46733,Lisa,but the atmosphere there was so stimulating. it was a bustling marketplace of ideas.
47387,Lisa,i'm gonna go up to the fourth floor where the books are.
49040,Lisa,southern-fried succubus?
48307,Lisa,"yeah, the only thing we're known for is leading the country in heart attacks."
46619,Lisa,let us kill the english! their concept of individual rights could undermine the power of our beloved tyrants!
46488,Lisa,now i really should be getting back to my family.
51747,Lisa,why are you sharing all of this with us?
45484,Lisa,"well, we went to paté labelle last week. how 'bout that?"
42025,Lisa,i think dallas is a mortal lock.
47760,Lisa,"mom, your hair."
42663,Lisa,and i still don't have my saxophone.
44077,Lisa,"dad, according to ""junior skeptic magazine"" the chances are a hundred seventy-five million-to-one of another form of life actually coming in contact with ours."
51469,Lisa,your grampa's alive?
44046,Lisa,"there, you did it again!"
50471,Lisa,"well, there's one thing you didn't count on: my dad getting a giant wedding cake and my sister locking herself in the car."
45547,Lisa,just burn that plant right now and end this madness.
43874,Lisa,"like, you know, whatever. like, you know, whatever."
42957,Lisa,oh yeah. they weren't very funny.
43146,Lisa,"i'd get out, but i don't know where i am."
42310,Lisa,bart. bart bart bart bart bart.
52306,Lisa,"well, at sunday school we learned that stealing is a sin."
47222,Lisa,ow!
47251,Lisa,"well, i have some ideas for ways we can improve the classroom experience."
42715,Lisa,"well, i'm not gonna accomplish anything just sitting here--"
42316,Lisa,"bart, that's gross!"
50537,Lisa,gift shop!
45840,Lisa,"dad, i've got maggie."
44996,Lisa,kids?
41943,Lisa,"well, it's a country in europe --"
42234,Lisa,"as little miss springfield, it's my pleasure to welcome you to america, the land of opportunity."
48488,Lisa,"dad, put aside your selfish male ego and tell the truth!"
44389,Lisa,"dad, you can't judge a place you've never been to."
51708,Lisa,so many musical choices!
49220,Lisa,"no, ""martinis""."
50858,Lisa,"dad, that's creepy."
50124,Lisa,no! the computer says it's statistically impossible!
45514,Lisa,stretch dude! help!
52341,Lisa,"i want to go on a pony ride, unky herb."
48524,Lisa,but how can you--
43920,Lisa,"science has already proven the dangers of smoking, alcohol and chinese food. but i can still ruin soft drinks for everyone."
45524,Lisa,they must be starting a new civilization on mars with our best and brightest.
47667,Lisa,"oh, dad..."
42880,Lisa,i won first chair?
50844,Lisa,"fine, you're in."
45781,Lisa,at camp david? sure. they couldn't keep pants on kissinger.
46150,Lisa,"no, something else..."
48069,Lisa,i thought those people were your friends.
50887,Lisa,get your hands off my future!
42404,Lisa,"well, can it?"
42733,Lisa,all right! now all we need is a name.
52184,Lisa,"hey, gang. okay, bart, this is the card catalog."
49472,Lisa,"oh my god. i know what the biggest ""ring"" in ""springfield"" is. it's been right in front of us the whole time."
47638,Lisa,tomorrow's? i hadn't thought about publishing more.
46609,Lisa,victory.
41891,Lisa,i'll give you a candy necklace.
46309,Lisa,"mom, i have to get to school. it's ten to three!"
49842,Lisa,hi. now what are you up to?
46736,Lisa,can i come with you?
52035,Lisa,yay! fried shrimp!
45379,Lisa,a pie.
47083,Lisa,"the best part is, next week we'll get to see the deadly meteor shower."
47606,Lisa,great!
45905,Lisa,"we were earning millions, but we were always strapped for cash."
44911,Lisa,someone left the freezer door open and the motor burned out. we can get a new one.
48235,Lisa,"i think you'll find that deep down, anyone can be civilized. goodnight, willie."
46449,Lisa,"they should take a good look at themselves, and what their church has become!"
51919,Lisa,forget it.
41727,Lisa,"it's called remorse, you vile burlesque of irrepressible youth."
43138,Lisa,what!?
52475,Lisa,"my daughter thinks i'm a ruthless tyrant, like hitler or prince harry."
42494,Lisa,"dad, everyone likes whacking day, but i hate it. is there something wrong with me?"
47771,Lisa,oh!
42415,Lisa,the very same. i think this tomato could wipe out world hunger.
47049,Lisa,now we just need a distraction.
50222,Lisa,"mom, why am i so repulsed by pigeons? it doesn't make any sense."
42936,Lisa,that didn't seem like a happy ending.
47353,Lisa,people would be a lot happier without presents.
50884,Lisa,"dad, please!"
49903,Lisa,"dad, you are leading the way in clean energy."
43049,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing in my room?"
43127,Lisa,fine.
47040,Lisa,"krusty, i don't usually give advice to republicans, but it would be nice to be on the winning side for once. you have to start making an honest connection with the voters. talk about how you could help regular families -- like ours."
52095,Lisa,"come on, come on."
45864,Lisa,"most entertaining, but how does that help me?"
43102,Lisa,"okay, i will."
42939,Lisa,"soon, corey, soon."
51068,Lisa,we don't have the metric system.
50105,Lisa,"bart, this guy's walked the last two batters, and if he walks you, we win the game. don't swing at anything!"
44414,Lisa,i said no!
51651,Lisa,docetism?
42681,Lisa,"and now you can go back to just being you, instead of a one-dimensional character with a silly catchphrase."
45676,Lisa,no.
42157,Lisa,"no, dad. you promised if bart and i got c averages we could go to kamp krusty. and with no false modesty, you're looking at one happy camper."
48049,Lisa,"mom, i got a rash where the reindeer licked me."
47619,Lisa,"it's not a jail, it's a ""reeducation center."""
44796,Lisa,"hmm, thank you, bart, for yet another touching ""bart's people."" now, turning to--"
49332,Lisa,"um, excuse me, but i think her painting is very imaginative."
45034,Lisa,"one, they don't have beaks, two, they don't have feathers, and three, they're lizards."
45068,Lisa,ready.
43201,Lisa,the death card.
42226,Lisa,do you really think i can win?
51446,Lisa,this is the pinnacle of conversation around here.
45352,Lisa,"we tried giving them eggnog at christmas, but it led to widespread de-shawling."
45761,Lisa,appointed a supreme court justice.
50845,Lisa,"oh, for the love of god."
42092,Lisa,i don't know. you?
50894,Lisa,please? thank you.
43451,Lisa,well?
49202,Lisa,i'll take ten bucks no-ow.
45687,Lisa,"wow, he's got every nancy drew! even the controversial ""clue in the clock."" so many swears."
45698,Lisa,"no, something fresh and bold."
42133,Lisa,"dad, what if i told you, you could lose weight without dieting or lifting a finger?"
49736,Lisa,what will that do?
49624,Lisa,i do.
42900,Lisa,is it okay?!
48317,Lisa,grampa must've set them free!
47428,Lisa,"um... some other time, maybe. today i'm just hanging out at home."
45451,Lisa,yipee! time for the company loyalty song!
47183,Lisa,who'd want candy filled with laxatives?
49771,Lisa,oh my god! dad threw too hard!
50289,Lisa,angry dad slips and crashes down the stairs.
48246,Lisa,"that's where you're wrong, principal skinner. i did enter a project... and it's been in plain sight the entire evening!"
43642,Lisa,"you look nice, is all."
47200,Lisa,i'll tell professor frink he's won. tack för att ni förärat vår stad.
50197,Lisa,"you know, it takes a lot for an eight-year-old to stand up in front of the whole town."
52117,Lisa,is too.
47267,Lisa,what have i done?
46243,Lisa,isn't that cute? a bush-baby.
50759,Lisa,i just want closure.
50829,Lisa,meaningless friend thing.
44979,Lisa,"milhouse! i've been lookin' all over for you! listen, you've always had a crush on me, right? well, this is your lucky day, 'cause you're gonna take me to the dance. pretty great, huh? see ya."
51215,Lisa,"please, don't do this, dad! i don't know what horrors you saw in boise, but it's not worth blowing up everyone you love."
47757,Lisa,"be careful, mom! there's hot lava under the ground!"
43445,Lisa,where'd you get five bucks? i want five bucks.
42640,Lisa,"mom, we're having a geography pageant at school, and i don't know which state to go as."
42242,Lisa,"before i sing the national anthem, i'd like to say that college football diverts funds badly needed for education and the arts."
44300,Lisa,"oh... if i did agree to help you, you could only earn money by doing good, socially responsible things. nothing evil."
47310,Lisa,daisies.
47808,Lisa,"well, if hollywood movies have taught us anything, it's that troubled relationships can be completely patched up by a mad dash to the airport."
43198,Lisa,here bunny bunny! here bunny!
46126,Lisa,i don't know what this has to do with the civil war.
50108,Lisa,don't swing.
45943,Lisa,"oh, no. you poor thing. here..."
48744,Lisa,um... i don't think he's ever thought about anything.
51042,Lisa,i got one for just watching the game.
47749,Lisa,bart! thanks for helping me make up my mind.
43233,Lisa,just a couple more blocks to my house.
42451,Lisa,arrrgh!
51817,Lisa,"well you're the only ""gangsta"" i know with a nine o'clock bedtime!"
44314,Lisa,stop! don't recycle! it's murder! you're helping mr. burns!
41958,Lisa,that is so sad.
47663,Lisa,"dad, how could you say these things?"
44676,Lisa,"ow! bart, that has nuts in it!"
51709,Lisa,"a brass band... barbershop quintet?... the human kazoo... ooh, a drum circle!"
43797,Lisa,gaaah!
44347,Lisa,when do you expect the ringing will stop?!
51940,Lisa,"but, mr. largo, that's what my country's all about."
48889,Lisa,feet? killing?! we gotta save bart!
48905,Lisa,"look, we all care about quintile disparity, but the democrats can't win with another prissy brainiac."
42692,Lisa,dad... that's over ten thousand miles away.
45358,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing?"
49035,Lisa,"panic not, fellow springfielders!"
50522,Lisa,"exotic... vegetarian... i can mention it in a college essay... mom, this is amazing!"
50607,Lisa,we're not with him.
47715,Lisa,that doesn't make any sense!
43820,Lisa,"mom, you're the greatest. can i have this licorice?"
46237,Lisa,we need these because we have... to...
42178,Lisa,i am not sure if this letter will reach you as our lines of communication have been cut.
47115,Lisa,just hear those sleigh bells jingling / ring-ting-tingling too...
49828,Lisa,"the year was 1860, and the underground railroad was..."
43423,Lisa,"hey, c'mon! those are prescription shoes! i need them!"
42932,Lisa,oh no. please don't show me with ralph.
43763,Lisa,sure!
45625,Lisa,have you been in here all day?
42940,Lisa,"ah, your first kiss."
46539,Lisa,"thanks for listening, dad."
51029,Lisa,"free breakfast if we sit through a sales pitch. just remember, milhouse, do not buy the condo."
45741,Lisa,i hope they're hover-bikes.
51324,Lisa,"just can't resist those words ""signup sheet."" oh, looks like i'll be running against isabel. and ralph?!"
50854,Lisa,"are you sure your next guess wasn't ""three stray dogs?"""
51853,Lisa,then all the reindeer loved him / as they shouted out with glee / rudolph the red nosed reindeer / you'll go down in history...
48800,Lisa,you're our hero!
51636,Lisa,she's under a lot of stress. her husband's at sea.
45113,Lisa,"hey, i can't go in there!"
48616,Lisa,"uh, thank you and goodnight."
48588,Lisa,"chill thunder! ""chill thunder""!"
50435,Lisa,returning this lost key to principal skinner.
52295,Lisa,it's so hard to picture you two then. hand in hand at the crossroads of life. there are so many questions.
48634,Lisa,"lisa simpson, with the school paper."
45809,Lisa,is that rainier wolfcastle?
49471,Lisa,because i cleverly deduced the answer to springfield's biggest ring. voila!
52330,Lisa,da-ad!...
52200,Lisa,dad!
42559,Lisa,"dad, nerds are nothing to fear. in fact they've done some pretty memorable things. some nerds of note include; popcorn magnate, orville redenbacher, rock star, david byrne and supreme court justice david souter."
42152,Lisa,"well, i think we should invest in a set of the great books of western civilization. look at this ad from ""new republic for kids."" each month a new classic will be delivered to our door: ""paradise regained,"" ""martin chuzzlewit,"" or herman melville's twin classics ""omoo"" and ""typee""."
42350,Lisa,they're all around me. no way out. no way out i tell you!
51108,Lisa,today you were truly a hero. thank you.
49283,Lisa,sorry.
46465,Lisa,"well, i'm looking for a new faith. one that isn't so materialistic."
42585,Lisa,whoops. bart and i have to go wash up.
49981,Lisa,he's got koi!
44765,Lisa,"no, it makes you look like a tool of government oppression."
46276,Lisa,this is why i can't have nice things.
52074,Lisa,"no! don't you get it, bart? how could krusty have been reading a magazine if he can't read?"
43030,Lisa,snowball fight!
43594,Lisa,here we go again!
52489,Lisa,but surely you didn't give up on love after just one setback. love is our only defense against the abyss in this meaningless universe.
42185,Lisa,"oh yeah? who played your daughter in the short-lived sitcom, ""president clown""?"
41744,Lisa,lee-mur. lee-mur.
42389,Lisa,what if he wants a kiss?
50694,Lisa,i pick up books like you pick up beers!
49548,Lisa,"hmm, well, they are good ones."
45167,Lisa,"is he, mom? you can tell me."
52150,Lisa,what?
41863,Lisa,"no, no. we're not converting, we just want to find a rabbi krustofsky."
48884,Lisa,you never ask what we've been up to. we went to the strawberry patch and i picked the most strawberries!
50594,Lisa,hurry! we're heading for the falls!
51573,Lisa,i'm okay with no friends. it's easier to focus and it'll give me great material for whatever art form i choose. right now i'm thinking long novella. goodnight!
42644,Lisa,there's nothing to eat for breakfast.
51149,Lisa,"aw, c'mon."
43603,Lisa,thanks.
44947,Lisa,"hey, wait up!"
47037,Lisa,why don't we go to our congressman?
51624,Lisa,"dad, you're eating too much! i'm worried about your health! i don't wanna lose you!"
49794,Lisa,family records for a school project on genealogical--
49376,Lisa,"so the armies of the gnomes and the elves faced off on either side of the hollow, broad axes poised."
50030,Lisa,"maggie, your big sister is leaving for a more artistic life. i'll send for you when i'm famous. we'll take the town by storm like the brontë sisters."
49947,Lisa,"that's not true! first of all, milhouse fell because you tripped him. secondly, ""spaz"" is short for ""spastic diplegic,"" someone who suffers from a serious medical condition. thirdly, your ""haw haw,"" through overuse, has lost its power."
45746,Lisa,"thank you. ""a gay president in 2084""?"
49099,Lisa,"happy birthday, mom."
45332,Lisa,"dad, chew with your mouth closed. you're losing your mystique."
51117,Lisa,i just have one thing to say...
48359,Lisa,what're you playing?
50975,Lisa,"wait a minute... if you take the test now, your score could raise the average and save the school!"
45794,Lisa,"bart, you're supposed to be at camp david."
44067,Lisa,the hurricane's over.
42637,Lisa,gimme those.
43735,Lisa,you'll get more royalties.
45845,Lisa,"oh, mom. i want to be a dancer!"
47241,Lisa,"don't vote for me, kids of springfield / unless you want an effective leader / i'll talk to teachers / i'll handle skinner / a vote for lisa / makes you the winner..."
45490,Lisa,"wow, my first published article. although someone else's name is on it."
45795,Lisa,"thanks bart, you bought us some time. what can i do to thank you?"
42688,Lisa,and he taught me how to play the shenai.
42544,Lisa,"bart, what's wrong with you?"
47163,Lisa,"mom, we need him for our plan."
51738,Lisa,we've left earth's atmosphere!
45191,Lisa,"i did, until we came here last year."
42430,Lisa,got it.
44089,Lisa,really? let me see!
48544,Lisa,"so, how was nelson's party?"
50554,Lisa,i'll show you! i'll write a book myself! a personal story my readers will connect with!
43649,Lisa,i got their new thrifty saver savings account. 2.3% annual interest instead of the normal 2.25. so a year from now i'll have an extra nickel.
52085,Lisa,"hey, mom."
44253,Lisa,no one's pinching his legs.
47147,Lisa,today balthazar will tell us about global warming in the land beyond the rainbow.
48278,Lisa,how did you find this?
51174,Lisa,there... carl was adopted... by a couple who lives outside reykjavik.
48639,Lisa,me... a tutor?
44222,Lisa,"ew, your arm! it's got extra corners!"
46131,Lisa,this session's over.
46820,Lisa,he started it! he did punch buggy first!
47970,Lisa,i'm talkin' springfield / you can buy chimichangas / talkin' springfield / the chicks have big gazongas
43549,Lisa,umm... mom just baked a cake.
47342,Lisa,"no, dad. i mean you should use your time on the air to say things that really mean something. change the world for the better!"
51097,Lisa,just remember this: a simpson never gives up.
47905,Lisa,runaway truck lane! we're saved!
52403,Lisa,and what was ringo's response?
50479,Lisa,"that's a lot of anger, grampa."
42221,Lisa,there's no way i can beat this girl. she's the jack nicklaus of the pageant circuit.
45776,Lisa,"my fellow americans, and voting illegal aliens: i will not mince words. your country needs you. that's why today i am proposing a temporary refund adjustment."
50015,Lisa,friday morning andrew lloyd weber and elaine stritch helped us make wallets.
45186,Lisa,"our top secret tonight: gay divorcée luann van houten has been cheating on her boyfriend pyro -- with his best friend, gyro."
44224,Lisa,stop it! stand still! maybe i can pop it back in.
44599,Lisa,the carnival!
46055,Lisa,mom wants you to come to bed.
49928,Lisa,bluella?
48013,Lisa,it's the title of the movie.
46346,Lisa,i'm just sayin'...
44865,Lisa,"aha! it's springtime, so the geese must be flying back north."
52322,Lisa,go for it dad!
42859,Lisa,"mom, i'm auditioning for first chair in the school band and i've got to practice!"
44492,Lisa,it's the tradition in india.
44028,Lisa,"oh, i know."
47162,Lisa,"look, to get our dog back, we need a plan."
45038,Lisa,but aren't the snakes even worse?
50739,Lisa,"i sold a couple of my rare jazz records. after a while they all start to sound the same. still love the genre, of course. not even close to getting sick of it."
42761,Lisa,"you can't do that, dad. it's cruel."
50997,Lisa,i'm exactly the kind of kid he's pretending to be.
43455,Lisa,with the change in my piggy bank.
46101,Lisa,"oh, many things: tai chi, chai tea... but i find, when i can't keep the unhappy thoughts from swirling in my brain, the best thing is usually a nice long walk."
43755,Lisa,"well, what if we used our imaginations...?"
42685,Lisa,i can see through time.
52051,Lisa,your paper-thin commitment to your children sends shivers down my spine. may i be excused?
43730,Lisa,"mom, there's a weird smell and a lot of cursing coming from the basement. and dad's upstairs."
50097,Lisa,"hey, dad."
45356,Lisa,"picture yourself on a beautiful sailboat. ahhh, can't you just feel the sea breeze in your hair?... or scalps?"
48214,Lisa,"""my dearest mona. you've just left my arms to return to your husband, abe, and already i ache for you."""
41767,Lisa,"happy birthday to me / happy birthday to me / happy birthday, overlooked middle child -- happy birthday to me."
49929,Lisa,oh no.
44200,Lisa,"bart, that's coffee ice cream! it has caffeine in it!"
48925,Lisa,"bart, no, it's valentine's day."
48339,Lisa,unless the captain is attentive / we'll all be crushed by a huge wave...
42988,Lisa,even the pet cemetery voted for bob! look! mr. and mrs. bananas! humphrey boa-gart!
42348,Lisa,i'm not sure that is water.
44835,Lisa,where in the world did you find a sled on top of the--
50450,Lisa,i swear there was a room here!
47544,Lisa,and thanks for showing my brother that girls can be cool.
51736,Lisa,we have been here six hours and the coolest thing we've done is stand in the cool zone.
48321,Lisa,"calm down, dad. what happened?"
47662,Lisa,what's that?
45231,Lisa,"bart, they're not here to entertain us."
46326,Lisa,how about asking the community for donations?
45365,Lisa,jack lalanne!
49745,Lisa,princess penelope! sign mine! sign mine!
42550,Lisa,we know you're the one behind this. so knock it off or we're going to the cops.
43454,Lisa,"i would like to say grace. lord, have mercy on my soul, and mom's soul, and dad's soul, and maggie's soul, and let every soul in christendom..."
48630,Lisa,"oh fah-ther, my pony buttercup can jump ever so high-- hoo-boy, it's mr. burns."
51786,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing?"
43727,Lisa,"bye, mom. bye, dad."
45713,Lisa,"mom, i think you might be developing a gambling problem."
44084,Lisa,"wow, mom, look at all those customers!"
49016,Lisa,i need firsthand smoke!
49704,Lisa,more... more...
45979,Lisa,no i don't!
43628,Lisa,the rich are different from you and me.
41869,Lisa,"bart, we've been going about this all wrong. what's the one thing rabbis prize above everything else?"
47943,Lisa,"ooh, dalai lamanade!"
45587,Lisa,"bart, they lied to us. instead of giving us an education, they tricked us into designing a toy. aren't you outraged?"
42001,Lisa,let's see... football... football: homo-eroticism in... oddball canadian rules... phyllis george and...
49142,Lisa,mitzi gaynor?
50280,Lisa,i can't take it. i'm just going to draw a hairline on.
51335,Lisa,i'm fine with rough.
50595,Lisa,"mo-om, what are you doing?"
48645,Lisa,mistos and lattes and grandes and ventis / browsing at bookstores with fat cognoscentis!
47320,Lisa,"dad, you can't get revenge on an animal. that's the whole point of moby dick."
45553,Lisa,"sure! you can help me find three words where ""y"" is the vowel."
51461,Lisa,you're going to take dna from these historical figures and add it to your own?
49240,Lisa,"no, none."
47882,Lisa,"yeah, dad. if you don't look perfect, you'll never be able to sneak in and steal ling back."
42622,Lisa,"ever since that self-help guy came to town, you've lost your identity. you've fallen through the cracks of our quick-fix, one-hour-photo, instant-oatmeal society."
45594,Lisa,"i admit it's kind of cute, but it'll never take the place of malibu stacy."
48357,Lisa,"well, what can i do? they won't let me in the boys' school."
45884,Lisa,thank you.
44524,Lisa,excuse me. i took a piece of the skeleton for scientific analysis. soon we will have all the facts.
52359,Lisa,"oh, but i don't know how to sew."
52264,Lisa,okay. may we please be excused?
43709,Lisa,"but when you found the truth, you couldn't take it! you couldn't stand that you'd devoted your life to a fraud! so you covered it up! didn't you? didn't you?!"
47446,Lisa,what's going on?
41645,Lisa,"this is kind of relaxing. but it's so hard to turn off my brain. i have to stop thinking... starting now. hey, it worked. oh no, that's thinking!"
47234,Lisa,i'm doomed.
47299,Lisa,"mom, you said macbeth!"
46153,Lisa,they're recruiting people with subliminal messages!
47637,Lisa,"""elegy for geezer rock:"" / ""postcard image, thing to see, / to think of springfield is to think of thee. / what thoughts be-pass a'hind thy mien? / why sky art blue, why trees art green? and what, pray tell, did thine eyes see? / perchance, old friend, they gazed at me. / brought low by nature's oafish hand, / thou crush-ed our reviewing stand / and twixt thy stones glimpsed i the truth: / all things must pass -- thy face, my youth."""
47311,Lisa,flowers.
42116,Lisa,i guess that executive stress ball we got him for christmas isn't working.
43647,Lisa,i'm going to contribute my money to the corporation for public broadcasting.
48056,Lisa,saving!
42587,Lisa,satisfied?
45133,Lisa,chalmers.
50340,Lisa,roger.
47340,Lisa,"well, dad, what do you want to talk about tonight?"
50942,Lisa,"dad, the baby giraffe is taking its first steps!"
44220,Lisa,oh my god!
48734,Lisa,he is stealing!
45994,Lisa,"oh, i'll show you."
51465,Lisa,what? no!
42969,Lisa,that sounds like sideshow bob!
49065,Lisa,"wait! if you stop the wedding, bart's cow will die! and he really cares about that cow... and bart doesn't usually care about stuff, so... help."
49920,Lisa,it's hard to believe anyone in that contest can be considered smart.
45586,Lisa,funzo? i said that name in class.
48954,Lisa,we-were-never-outside-we-were-here-all-day.
46576,Lisa,"so bart, when does the killing start?"
45852,Lisa,sorry. i'm just frustrated.
49727,Lisa,afro-cuban?
46683,Lisa,can she have a pony? and the last line in the scene?
44775,Lisa,"bart, get out of my anchor chair."
50546,Lisa,of course you're real! everybody knows you got the idea for this series after an explosion at a crumpet factory knocked you off a double-decker bus. how could that be made up?!
47502,Lisa,it's a movie version of a cartoon family you can see for free on tv.
46027,Lisa,"aw, jesse. they locked you up again."
44995,Lisa,what happened?
46379,Lisa,"oh, poor mom and dad."
45749,Lisa,"ah, something troubles me about indian gaming. on the one hand, the revenue helps the tribes..."
43871,Lisa,"hey, a library! no, i can't. that's the old nerdy lisa."
47338,Lisa,i have a jewish imaginary friend. her name is rachel cohen and she just got into brandeis.
43090,Lisa,"look on the bright side, dad. did you know that the chinese use the same word for crisis as they do for opportunity?"
44928,Lisa,no!
41919,Lisa,what's wrong with dad?
44489,Lisa,fully. we have to go now.
47005,Lisa,"i guess i'll have to. then i'll be queen of the world! of spelling. that's right, queen of the world! of spelling."
48207,Lisa,santa must have left it.
50665,Lisa,"mom, i'm gonna look at the desserts!"
46121,Lisa,"milhouse, i'm impressed."
42651,Lisa,"dad, mom said she'd be home to help me with my costume, and she's not and the geography pageant is tonight."
43288,Lisa,no bart! what're you doing?
49734,Lisa,where'd you get this rope?
43684,Lisa,we could?
45726,Lisa,"hey, isn't that the bass player from ""satanica""?"
50904,Lisa,"can't breathe... i've lost, i've lost everything."
48134,Lisa,i'm not a baby! a baby is zero to two.
50375,Lisa,"from inside, you just push up. easy peasy. and there's no way anyone can figure out how it's done."
51054,Lisa,"please keep them together! if not for me, for the mother!"
50335,Lisa,that was kind of the same as the first time.
48468,Lisa,i'll take him too!
41851,Lisa,"he's just a little nervous. he has to give a speech tomorrow on ""how to keep cool in a crisis."""
44603,Lisa,that was just confusing.
52232,Lisa,"bart, what are you doing up here? everybody's worried."
43650,Lisa,thank you.
43299,Lisa,oh no. strike?
44764,Lisa,the government has no right to use you this way.
45870,Lisa,i can't help it! it's the shoes!
51790,Lisa,i guess humanity wants its change one birdhouse at a time.
49031,Lisa,and i used rhetoric in my answer!
51519,Lisa,...and isn't in any history books...
52220,Lisa,mom!
47785,Lisa,"well, we're supposed to do this without parental help."
48661,Lisa,"hey, mr. flanders, what'd you get?"
46469,Lisa,"""nirvana is achieved through right views and right speech... positive actions lead to happiness and negative actions lead to unhappiness... no creator gods, just the pursuit of enlightenment..."""
49670,Lisa,i have one minute to avoid my first late assignment ever. the pipe cleaner fur is coming off on my hands!
45680,Lisa,"that's nice, but maybe your homecoming float should have something to do with college."
46290,Lisa,huh? this isn't miss hoover's class.
45168,Lisa,"with a little middle relief, they might even make the playoffs."
51850,Lisa,like shine-ola!
49286,Lisa,"i've already downloaded so much incredible music! check out ""moon dreams"" from miles davis' ""birth of the cool."""
48061,Lisa,"bart, don't you have homework to do?"
47632,Lisa,"gotta go, sweetie!"
44256,Lisa,now you're making your own alcohol? that's even more illegal than what you were doing before!
48128,Lisa,"you know, this mass-produced junk doesn't express how i feel about dad. i am making him a present that comes from the heart."
42034,Lisa,"don't even bother with the raisins. i'm not gonna eat 'em... double bologna! double bologna!... i don't ask for much, just no pimento. don't forget to make it double bologna 'cause i can hardly..."
41620,Lisa,got any joyce carol oates?
43223,Lisa,"this place is so enchanting, hugh. i love it here."
43379,Lisa,"let's go now, mr. puente."
46995,Lisa,yeah. i've got some work to do.
42246,Lisa,it's a deal.
48994,Lisa,really? how?
49760,Lisa,why would you put it in the dishwasher?
52429,Lisa,"no, mom. this is different. i mean, this man makes you feel like there's nobody better."
48691,Lisa,you already promised you would.
50850,Lisa,a mini black hole!
50296,Lisa,"good luck, mr. park. there'd be no shame in losing to you."
46802,Lisa,"no, sorry."
49222,Lisa,"""singer of yentl"", thirteen letters... um..."
48484,Lisa,"bart, skinner's gonna be really mad at you."
49038,Lisa,double ew!
51013,Lisa,he's right here.
42712,Lisa,i have one.
43508,Lisa,...too.
43096,Lisa,"but if we don't encourage her to vent her feelings, they can come out in other ways."
43263,Lisa,"hi, dad."
44690,Lisa,ugh! now i can't remember my combination!
47843,Lisa,no it isn't -- it's a lump of slush! look at it!
46628,Lisa,"oh great, now hamlet's acting crazy. well, nobody out-crazies ophelia! hey, nonny, nonny, with a hoo and a haw and a nonny, nonny, hey..."
42182,Lisa,wiggum!
47160,Lisa,well i'm afraid the law is clear and dad did renounce all claim to ownership.
49733,Lisa,um... what if someone were to lose larry?
51524,Lisa,"in the history of soccer, he's the only parent to ever take sides against his own kid, and he was right. he made me a better person, because that's what heroes do."
52174,Lisa,"mom, what's he doing wrong?"
47907,Lisa,oh! the famous shelbyville theater district! can we see a play?
43292,Lisa,"quick, let's get..."
42132,Lisa,i gotta help him.
46646,Lisa,yes.
42454,Lisa,eww.
44665,Lisa,oh rats! talk about bad luck! i forgot to wear socks today. guess i can't try those on.
51391,Lisa,how could you burn the present i gave you?
48415,Lisa,chapter one: when we compare the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals...
44963,Lisa,"aren't we a little young for makeup and... what do you mean, five pounds?"
44877,Lisa,"excuse me, ma'am? uh, hello? somebody? anybody?"
43428,Lisa,you don't understand. mom and dad take good care of us.
46480,Lisa,"well, santa can take it back because i'm not ruled by material desi-- is that a pony?"
50362,Lisa,no!
42904,Lisa,"bart, her being wet won't help me win the competition."
46999,Lisa,thank you! i've never felt more accepted. perhaps one day people who spell correctly will replace athletes at the top of our national pantheon.
48766,Lisa,we have a fire alarm in the ventilation room!
48571,Lisa,"mom, i understand your psychological need, but i'm not sure what you can do."
42302,Lisa,mommy.
51371,Lisa,that sermon really inspired me. this whole christmas has been about money...
42463,Lisa,lois sanborn.
41605,Lisa,"so nelson, who did you end up bringing tonight? sherri or terri?"
42313,Lisa,"ha, ha. mom yelled at you."
49399,Lisa,"dad, just because you won a high school election doesn't mean your whole life would have been better."
42606,Lisa,sure dad.
52326,Lisa,eating is worse than opening eyes.
42680,Lisa,"forget it, dad. if i ever become famous, i want it to be for something worthwhile, not because of some obnoxious fad."
42813,Lisa,doesn't this family know any songs that aren't commercials?
50218,Lisa,"no, no... listen, don't tell anyone, but... i can't stand pigeons! they're like rats with wings!"
45105,Lisa,okay. all right. you can bluff your way through one test.
45949,Lisa,"no, dad! we don't want to kill him! let's call animal control."
50270,Lisa,"sorry you broke up with your friends, mom."
47688,Lisa,"hurry, mom!"
46851,Lisa,"yes, but now that it's hip, all the ex-presidents are doing it."
48001,Lisa,"dad, you know the best part about this whole thing has been the time we've spent together. i don't care if i win, just as long as you're in my corner again."
50929,Lisa,nooo!
49046,Lisa,banana bread!
50154,Lisa,what could've happened?
42604,Lisa,"lu, lu, lu / lu lu lu lu lu / lu lu lu lu lu lu lu"
49737,Lisa,"chief, my brother fell in the storm drain!"
48135,Lisa,i'd rather not go than lie.
47218,Lisa,don't go inside -- it's a trap!
49523,Lisa,that's horrible. what else?
43798,Lisa,"no, i've got gum in my hair!"
50331,Lisa,"wow! i know i lay down in front of bulldozers to stop this stadium from being built, but i have to admit, it's pretty sweet."
43561,Lisa,"me, too."
42337,Lisa,five... six... seven... eight...
46757,Lisa,are you gonna call the police?
47474,Lisa,"oh, none of these feel right. oh wait, did i try ""soccer player?"""
42821,Lisa,i find this demeaning and embarrassing beyond my worst nightmares.
51459,Lisa,but... but we sang gershwin together!
41685,Lisa,you're the tail!
44422,Lisa,i am three and three eighths!
43152,Lisa,mom?
51692,Lisa,"let me take care of that. if there's one thing i know how to do, it's manipulate barts."
51994,Lisa,"look, maggie! birdies!"
50716,Lisa,you're an undercover cop?
47890,Lisa,"neat! when i sleep at dad's, i call this bed."
42289,Lisa,"dad, have you considered buying commercial time on channel ninety-two? check it out."
45868,Lisa,"but, but you don't understand..."
46134,Lisa,and you're not doing it out of spite?
44092,Lisa,"hi, mom!"
49818,Lisa,that's eliza's mother!
49426,Lisa,"fine, but i wish you'd picked an easier theme than ""super-jet dinosaur fun-monkeys."" what does that even mean?"
42895,Lisa,jeremy's iron.
49407,Lisa,"i don't know, but he's algaefying."
44335,Lisa,ned! ned! mr. flanders!
45522,Lisa,"mom, make him stop."
48298,Lisa,"wow, there's a rainbow outside."
51059,Lisa,i remind you of you?
42803,Lisa,only because mayor quimby's buying his nephew's freedom.
49151,Lisa,"thank you, folks -- you've been a great audience."
47475,Lisa,i'm a mess. i can't believe i'm jealous of a baby.
48882,Lisa,"and ""wes doobner's world famous family style rib huts"" is actually an anagram!"
49512,Lisa,he ruined the wedding -- getting his revenge on us at last!
46220,Lisa,"i know, and the crowd is so distinguished. the inventor of the walkie-talkie is out there."
52103,Lisa,we caught her! we caught the babysitter bandit! she's tied up at our house right now!
52503,Lisa,"wait, mom. does that mean you're gonna take dad back?"
42503,Lisa,in here!
52233,Lisa,yes.
49090,Lisa,and... let's roll.
41915,Lisa,you're so beautiful.
45336,Lisa,i'm sick of him already.
49282,Lisa,i'm a mapple person!
51454,Lisa,bob! you saved me! but how did you get the strength? calder's work in this period was marked by heavy use of sheet metal painted to look deceptively airy.
42363,Lisa,must you be forever dialing that phone?!!!
50074,Lisa,sorry.
42492,Lisa,excuse me.
43474,Lisa,well i believe you're required to provide a vegetarian alternative.
41965,Lisa,how does that make him a hero?
44439,Lisa,ow! someone just punched me in the face!
43074,Lisa,yay!
42612,Lisa,what is it?
50935,Lisa,"okay, mom. i think that's far enough."
46147,Lisa,"mommm, can't bart get his massage somewhere else?"
51361,Lisa,i didn't say anything.
50058,Lisa,but don't you know that people who don't go to college make three percent less than people who do?
42881,Lisa,"i need help, mom. there's another girl at school who's smarter, younger, and a better sax player than me. oh i feel so average."
42958,Lisa,i wonder if this kind of violence really does desensitize us?
49815,Lisa,run!
42148,Lisa,"why didn't you write, unky herb?"
49027,Lisa,dad... dad? wake up!
41658,Lisa,"wow, i'm actually passing as a college student! and they don't have a blue's clue. whoops, gotta age it up."
41871,Lisa,we're gonna hit him where it hurts. right in the judaica.
51052,Lisa,fur?!
50330,Lisa,"i never thought i'd say this, but dad is the only one who can help us."
45433,Lisa,"eww, we're gonna do our grocery shopping at a 99-cent store?"
44737,Lisa,"so, please, i beg you, don't take your brain for granted. it's the best friend you'll ever have..."
48343,Lisa,i love the use of streamers as blood. it robs the violence of its power.
44961,Lisa,"okay, girls, we're gonna need balloons, crepe paper, party hats..."
51661,Lisa,"well, i guess you and i are in charge now, bart. but if we split the chores, i'm sure we can... what are you doing?!"
44828,Lisa,that's awful! i almost wish it were drugs.
44478,Lisa,i've gotta go.
41704,Lisa,he's gone. forever.
43991,Lisa,she knows.
50465,Lisa,"dad, stop!"
49949,Lisa,i didn't know we had a debate team.
42458,Lisa,"i wrote this for you, dad."
46065,Lisa,"mom, you're missing a great show."
48039,Lisa,"strange as it sounds, dad, i agree with you."
48208,Lisa,"i don't know, dad. this time of year everybody does it, 'cause you don't have to pay for the music rights."
52153,Lisa,"not yet, sir."
45546,Lisa,you're about to launch a terrible evil on the world. you've gotta destroy this plant.
42534,Lisa,oh my.
50701,Lisa,"it's not perfect here, but it is close to nature and if you have an axe to grind, wikileaks is right over there."
44544,Lisa,"you exploited people's deepest beliefs just to hawk your cheesy wares?! well, we are outraged! aren't we?!"
46981,Lisa,woo hoo!
48344,Lisa,"yeah, one for boys and one for girls."
51649,Lisa,"hm, looks like ancient aramaic. fortunately, i have an app for that."
45335,Lisa,who?
45131,Lisa,"well, if you're gonna cover this up, i'll just have to go over your head to super--"
49190,Lisa,that was an odd thing for bart to say.
43218,Lisa,that is good because eating animals is wrong.
50252,Lisa,this is the last time i bring these two to bed at the same time.
46247,Lisa,mom! bart implied i was a warthog!
48407,Lisa,"they're making us learn creation theory in school. today we had a test, and every answer was ""god did it."""
44985,Lisa,you don't understand. i don't belong there. the other girls are already into fashion and make-up and dating. they make me feel like a little baby.
43759,Lisa,"that's not latin. mom, bart's faking it."
50851,Lisa,"oh no, i've got to take it away before more clueless kids fall into it!"
49883,Lisa,such an intricate formicarium! i'm the proudest myrmecologist on the block.
42186,Lisa,"it is the real krusty. look at that pacemaker scar, the cattle skull birthmark, and his famous superfluous nipple."
49132,Lisa,but she'll live on forever in what you did today.
47611,Lisa,can i have a lollipop?
49621,Lisa,asterisk! asterisk! asterisk!
42560,Lisa,"oh, those baby ducks were so cute. i can't believe they let us walk right up and feed them."
50437,Lisa,banned books?!
52128,Lisa,mom! dad! look!
43909,Lisa,no. she's sleeping with
51533,Lisa,you put it on the fridge!
45273,Lisa,i just want to study.
44405,Lisa,"...so in 1966, a brave young man named seymour skinner enlisted and shipped out to vietnam, where he rose to become platoon sergeant. ralph?"
42204,Lisa,truly this was an act of god.
49679,Lisa,i'm thinking of joining.
49999,Lisa,"mom, this isn't the way home."
43121,Lisa,or an inlet.
47191,Lisa,this party's boring. everything here is for babies.
43343,Lisa,how come it won't stop hurting?
48014,Lisa,"no, ma'am."
51343,Lisa,excellent.
49549,Lisa,"dad, i don't want to hurt people's feelings."
51390,Lisa,fahrenheit 451 by ray bradbury?
48730,Lisa,"see? ""may cause dry mouth, mood swings, and nighttime kookiness."""
45618,Lisa,"so hard, but so rewarding... downhill skiers missing fun... oh, who am i kidding?"
50277,Lisa,"something wrong, bart?"
42368,Lisa,isn't that just pointless busywork?
42235,Lisa,i'd say the greater danger is her scepter acting as a lightning rod. unless it's made out of plastic.
49100,Lisa,i didn't mean it like that! a lot of things got changed in the editing room.
51447,Lisa,i say engineered po-tay-to / you say engineered po-tah-to... potato!
50127,Lisa,"no. but you did do something. you made me love baseball. not as a collection of numbers, but as an unpredictable, passionate game beaten in excitement only by every other sport."
44879,Lisa,"hang on, dad!"
42718,Lisa,i thought you might be able to help me get in touch with the inventor of malibu stacy.
52066,Lisa,"oh, bart."
41769,Lisa,"i thought so. oh, bart, you..."
47489,Lisa,lousy maggie... thinks she's so great... thinks she knows...
43032,Lisa,grades are all i have. what could i be failing? i'm smart and a teacher's pet.
48786,Lisa,i'm not sure brockman's out of the woods yet. there are a lot of religious watch-dog groups out there... keeping the world safe from the horror of free expression.
50622,Lisa,"maybe because deep down, you know you don't believe in what you're doing."
50495,Lisa,i miss holding you in my arms more than my butt can say.
44790,Lisa,that wasn't news. that was sappy manipulative drivel.
42837,Lisa,"dad, as you know, we've been swimming. and we've developed a taste for it. we both agree that getting our own pool is the only way to go. now before you respond, you must understand that your refusal would result in months and months of..."
50915,Lisa,mmm! tasty! love the texture. what is it?
49731,Lisa,he's in here. safe and sound. let me just staple that bag for you.
50088,Lisa,"hey, there have been plenty of female managers in baseball! connie mack, sandy alomar, terry francona, pinky higgins--"
43290,Lisa,"bart, look! a laundry chute!"
44706,Lisa,oh... i've got to find out more...
43193,Lisa,that is what i'd truly like to be/ 'cause if i were an oscar meyer weiner...
41789,Lisa,okay.
45473,Lisa,"oh, bart, what's happened to you?"
42695,Lisa,what'd ya bring? what'd ya bring?
47429,Lisa,you did not.
47881,Lisa,"uh, let's talk about this outside."
43961,Lisa,that's an electric nostril groomer.
45086,Lisa,"no, but i enjoy the smell."
45550,Lisa,not lenny!
47248,Lisa,"well, it's a little over the top, but there's no reason i can't look good and take back the playground from the gypsies."
49809,Lisa,i never thought of that before.
42003,Lisa,"c'mon, dad. it doesn't take a genius to realize that houston's failed to cover their last ten outings on away turf, the week after scoring more than three touchdowns in a conference game."
51329,Lisa,well then you could use your free speech to denounce this intrusion of big money into our election.
42483,Lisa,"wow, it must be expensive to produce all these cartoons."
51014,Lisa,"dad, why are you kowtowing to mr. van houten?"
48294,Lisa,"nelson, funny town doesn't exist."
46084,Lisa,yay!
49892,Lisa,that only angers me more.
46343,Lisa,i wanna see wilmington!
50173,Lisa,dad was right -- i might as well give up.
47836,Lisa,why are we dressed as sunday best simpsons for dinner with aunt patty?
41670,Lisa,maybe i should just move on to question two.
50529,Lisa,"we should start our own food blog... ""the three mouthketeers!"""
44068,Lisa,"mr. flanders, with all due respect, bart didn't do anything."
48472,Lisa,bart! what are you doing here?
51007,Lisa,"no, you're watching baby poindexter, the most educational dvd available at the checkout aisle at the grocery store!"
43832,Lisa,"dad, you forgot to pick up milhouse!"
48268,Lisa,c'mon!
46936,Lisa,"dad, are you in here?"
51781,Lisa,he is. and may i save that paper?
42334,Lisa,yayyy!
48933,Lisa,do you do it with relish?
49375,Lisa,yeah.
45287,Lisa,bleagghhh!
50710,Lisa,"but at the kwik-e-mart, the only fresh fruit is the one banana by the register."
46852,Lisa,"there's clinton, bush senior, and the nice guy who finished last, jimmy himself."
42264,Lisa,"dad, i agree that bart should be punished, but the itchy and scratchy movie is the defining event of our generation. how would you have liked it if someone told you that you couldn't watch the moon landing?"
44666,Lisa,ewww!
50409,Lisa,you just ruined six months' work!
46596,Lisa,"oh, that was lucky."
45892,Lisa,poor maggie. how many insanity hearings have you been to in your short little life?
50445,Lisa,nothing? and this ruler is unmarked and... the tabs on this pop-up book have no effect...and this tooth has no dentin! everything is fake! what is going on?!
43698,Lisa,yes.
45705,Lisa,you mean state un-fair.
44206,Lisa,uch! the idea that you would compare yourself to mahatma gandhi...
45725,Lisa,i'm taking my name off this thing.
49160,Lisa,"um, there's someone i forgot to thank, and he's here tonight. krusty, will you come up on stage, please?"
47211,Lisa,he's right! it all checks out!
52368,Lisa,"mom, what will we do if santa's little helper doesn't learn anything in obedience school?"
49488,Lisa,"it's really maggie, sherlock. you know, i have to point out that this anagram only works if i get the wrong answer first."
46882,Lisa,what about books?
51300,Lisa,oh.
48864,Lisa,"alan moore, art spiegelman... oh, dan clowes!"
47904,Lisa,look!
43056,Lisa,"you'll have to do better than that tonight, chump."
46170,Lisa,"it's okay, but it's missing a piece."
46447,Lisa,i am not gonna be taken in by all of this.
42919,Lisa,it started appropriately enough with an innocent boy being embarrassed on valentine's day...
50899,Lisa,"and money is college, which should lead to more money some day, but who knows anymore?"
50254,Lisa,i'll go outside and make snow angels.
46531,Lisa,why is this movie pg-13?
45993,Lisa,"oh, i didn't think it would be so high... maybe i could just circulate a petition..."
43534,Lisa,"well, where's my dad?"
49251,Lisa,he bought new shoelaces. with fancy metal tips!
49026,Lisa,and i'm happy to be smoke-free -- thanks to these children's nicotine patches.
47130,Lisa,"look, cookie! there's a dance tonight!"
49060,Lisa,"well, your friend mary from 4-h lives on a farm -- lou can stay with her!"
50136,Lisa,how'd you do that?
48461,Lisa,"aww, they're all so cute."
47161,Lisa,i'm not a coward.
43866,Lisa,exactly.
51897,Lisa,you're sending us to a doctor who advertises on pro wrestling?
49018,Lisa,that's easy for you to say. you've never had to be thin and focused.
46846,Lisa,"listen, we're really sorry. we got lost on a field trip from springfield elementary!"
44797,Lisa,"that's what veterans day is for, bart."
44930,Lisa,"don't worry, i'll help her out. i remember how hard it was to be an outsider. always trying to fit in... never quite feeling like..."
45627,Lisa,"oh, mom. i've seen what you do around the house, and i can handle it. maybe i can even make things more efficient."
47774,Lisa,"eww, gross! i bet you can't twist it."
49050,Lisa,"all right, so i put that there to get you to stop eating meat. but your body is going to miss the protein. so you'll have to take these pills."
49966,Lisa,"dressing in uniforms is a good thing -- if everyone looks the same, it levels the playing field."
50352,Lisa,what if you just taught me one trick?
44279,Lisa,"mom, mom, you're mixing polyethylene with polyurethane!"
45282,Lisa,"they're not all crazy, dad."
42748,Lisa,"dad and ned flanders friends? what's next... ""a's"" on bart's report card?"
44777,Lisa,"thank you. our top story today: in a move that could affect children townwide, the library book-purchase committee slashed its budget by three percent. first on the chopping block, periodicals."
41647,Lisa,i have a paw!
44909,Lisa,"happy anniversary, mom and dad!"
48043,Lisa,how is that possible?
42100,Lisa,give it to the poor.
44096,Lisa,"mom, dad and mr. burns could be trapped in there!"
43882,Lisa,didn't. it's lisa.
42771,Lisa,mom! dad! bart and stampy are gone!
45404,Lisa,"my family never talks about library standards. and every time i try to steer the conversation that way, they make me feel like a nerd."
51725,Lisa,i got a chemistry set!
49481,Lisa,does kissing milhouse count?
46358,Lisa,/ wow.
51034,Lisa,i've got perfume spritzers.
47462,Lisa,"no mom, it's just that i used to be ""the smart one"" -- now i don't know who i am."
50457,Lisa,"what do you think of that, nancy drew?"
48845,Lisa,"i'm concerned we might be heading down a slippery slope. what do you think, nelson?"
49070,Lisa,"well, i guess i could cut loose and do a little homework."
43942,Lisa,"listen, i can take care of everything. all you have to do is unshrink me."
49414,Lisa,how did i do?
49955,Lisa,i... i...
51126,Lisa,no. nobody did.
44548,Lisa,"oh, don't listen to my husband. he's just an idiot. now, i'm a veterinarian and i need to keep lots of sick animals in my house. is that permitted?"
43333,Lisa,"thank you. oh dad, why did he have to die?"
46496,Lisa,pennsylvania avenue. i wanna buy a house.
49403,Lisa,aha!
48808,Lisa,we should get out of here. come on.
51202,Lisa,he's targeting the nuclear plant?!
42849,Lisa,but...
42166,Lisa,i'll write you every day.
45593,Lisa,"oh, brother."
52426,Lisa,"no, no. you don't understand. when mr. bergstrom smiles, you only see these teeth --"
47333,Lisa,"krusty, what's wrong?"
50244,Lisa,... ... ...
45570,Lisa,are you okay?
48530,Lisa,"dad, no! i'm not mad at moe anymore!"
46828,Lisa,"bart, i am so mad at you!"
48595,Lisa,"i call it...""revenge of the geeks."""
51800,Lisa,"uh, i'll make brownies later."
47938,Lisa,"and here's the clincher... ray magini is an anagram for ""imaginary."""
47258,Lisa,excuse me? i was wondering if i should read what i just signed.
43356,Lisa,i got the album!
47219,Lisa,"dad, the word's ""desert."" and those farmers are suffering!"
42125,Lisa,"yeah, well if they want to go for cutesiness instead of competence, fine."
44027,Lisa,mom...
42231,Lisa,"some people say that to love your country is old fashioned, uncool, real melvin... well to them i say oh beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain..."
51936,Lisa,why don't you go see grampa?
44321,Lisa,"um, dad... ten percent of 120 million dollars isn't twelve thousand. it's..."
43168,Lisa,"it's 6:45 a.m. next wednesday. you may also be interested to know that it's summer here, not winter."
52351,Lisa,his life was an unbridled success until he found out he was a simpson.
50035,Lisa,are you saying arts camp was a lie?
51292,Lisa,"'cause one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do / one is the loneliest number, worse than two... and one-- you know, i really think i've made the point."
45212,Lisa,"the first episode was just a pilot, dad. producers fiddle with shows all the time. they change characters, drop others, and push some into the background."
45598,Lisa,boycott funzo. he's a toy-killing machine!
49454,Lisa,you mean an increasingly difficult series of challenges to my intellect? that's so cool.
44908,Lisa,yayyy!
44650,Lisa,did any one of you actually see milhouse eat the food?
48656,Lisa,'tweren't nothin'.
46988,Lisa,it was so exciting -- i actually got applause for being smart!
47235,Lisa,i can't beat nelson.
48934,Lisa,the radio lets me contribute directly to npr.
46963,Lisa,"molochai desiratum maledictu... nosferatu ascendum corporalis...,molochai desiratum maledictu nosferatu ascendum corporalis,6
87171,302,14,lisa simpson: (reading) diabolicus abominabolis...,147000,true,9,5,lisa simpson,simpson home,diabolicus abominabolis...,diabolicus abominabolis,2
87172,302,15,lisa simpson: ooh"
45901,Lisa,"suddenly, i was invited to every birthday party. sometimes i'd have to read the cake just to know who i was singing to."
48062,Lisa,"i believe in science and reality, not ghosts and monsters!"
47324,Lisa,"i just wanted to see what it was like. howdy, y'all. if you don't like mah song, i'll spray ya with ink!"
45974,Lisa,"no, i think they're protesters."
49951,Lisa,"initially yes, but--"
41619,Lisa,"eh, forget it."
44767,Lisa,"oh, my gosh! today's top story: ""little girl on cloud nine as dream comes true."""
52303,Lisa,"well, don't you remember the eighth commandment?"
46458,Lisa,"i still believe in god. i just think there's another path to him, or her."
46849,Lisa,"i win, dad. that means i get to choose today's father-daughter activity!"
50129,Lisa,can you put a number on it?
50418,Lisa,"well, i'm gonna find out why, because this..."
50200,Lisa,what did you do with him?
42608,Lisa,"mr. hutz, why are you burning all your personal papers?"
42074,Lisa,"well, i'm gonna be a famous jazz musician. i've got it all figured out. i'll be unappreciated in my own country, but my gutsy blues stylings will electrify the french. i'll avoid the horrors of drug abuse, but i do plan to have several torrid love affairs. and i may or may not die young, i haven't decided."
43674,Lisa,what would you say if i told you jebediah springfield wasn't as great as he's cracked up to be? look.
49307,Lisa,please let me keep them for just a little longer.
44712,Lisa,"well, ralph seems happy enough... maybe i should just give up now and settle into a mindless, happy stupor..."
50103,Lisa,everyone shift towards right!
43890,Lisa,"no. no, i heard it on ""baywatch."""
50913,Lisa,lisa.
42243,Lisa,"dad, do you remember why you entered me in that pageant?"
49822,Lisa,wait. all that was in the recipe?
51196,Lisa,something happened to dad on that trip. this is worse than when he went to new orleans and came back with the southern accent.
42490,Lisa,whacking day is coming.
49131,Lisa,what? bart got a swiss army knife.
49510,Lisa,"i don't understand. dad would never miss an open bar with chicken wings. plus he loves mom, and us, yada, yada, yada."
43020,Lisa,"bart, be strong. you don't need that little hell cat."
45463,Lisa,you've really done it this time.
51706,Lisa,a world of anarchic free expression!
44894,Lisa,now i know how sir dudley winthrop felt when he first fell through the ceiling and discovered the temple of isis.
49149,Lisa,"okay, i'll do the monologue."
43480,Lisa,it's tomato soup served ice cold!
46192,Lisa,how about jazz? do you like jazz?
45456,Lisa,"i'm proud of you, dad. buying an electric car will help clean the air up and protect the earth's supply... you're faking this to get the gift, aren't you?"
44495,Lisa,why would a motorboat have a mast?
49440,Lisa,"we have totality, people!"
45804,Lisa,hmmm.
44076,Lisa,maybe you just dreamed it.
43992,Lisa,you're very lucky to have mom.
49300,Lisa,"but dad, bees pollinate flowers."
42834,Lisa,dad...
45421,Lisa,what are you doing here?
51777,Lisa,dad no! elon musk is possibly the greatest living inventor!
50806,Lisa,i denounce thee for giving people ambitions they cannot fulfill! and i denounce thee for positing a world where social acceptance and walking on heels are easy!
42527,Lisa,"hey bart, if we get all of these big stars to appear on a special with krusty, it might get his career going again."
47466,Lisa,time to show them the new me. no one's happier and more well-adjusted than a standup comedian.
51670,Lisa,the first female speaker of the state assembly...
42989,Lisa,"oh, my poor dead kitty! please, not you too!"
46125,Lisa,especially bonnets.
44576,Lisa,"but we don't have $15,000."
41817,Lisa,"i'm sorry, dad. i couldn't think of a nice way to say america stinks."
45031,Lisa,i see an eye!
42636,Lisa,"dad, you shouldn't wear glasses that weren't prescribed for you."
42926,Lisa,"well, here's my house."
46281,Lisa,"quiet, please! some of us are trying to weld! almost done. just lay still."
51564,Lisa,"well, that's a relief."
46536,Lisa,really?
44592,Lisa,sure we do. ding ding ding ding ding.
46232,Lisa,"the pungent vinegar and tangy roquefort block the smell receptors, rendering the bully harmless."
51905,Lisa,arrrgh!
45924,Lisa,"hmm... bowls of porridge... oh, this seems somehow familiar... let's see..."
46567,Lisa,"oh, bart, it's human nature. you only want her because someone else has her."
44873,Lisa,i didn't know springfield had a russian district.
42364,Lisa,excuse me.
44620,Lisa,he's wrong! you're wrong! the whole damn system is wrong!
47107,Lisa,dad took us antiquing!
46770,Lisa,that's it! i know exactly what we should do.
42381,Lisa,good.
45827,Lisa,look at the size of that gator!
41796,Lisa,have either of you ever run into any problems because of your superior ability?
45045,Lisa,who'd do such a thing?
43635,Lisa,mom! mom! mom! mom! mom!
44333,Lisa,"hey, it was all a coincidence!"
48589,Lisa,"papa, may we have petit fours?"
51672,Lisa,maxine lombard.
50581,Lisa,krappy the klunk.
42621,Lisa,"it's simple, bart. you've defined yourself as a rebel. and in the absence of a repressive milieu, your societal niche has been co-opted."
44459,Lisa,that would have made a lot more sense.
46868,Lisa,it's a hockey game!
41814,Lisa,"i would like to read a different essay, if i may."
44288,Lisa,but we didn't do that badly. we collected enough paper to save one whole tree.
45966,Lisa,dad! dad!
45881,Lisa,"oh, mom, you're not supposed to throw rice anymore. birds eat it, their stomachs swell and they explode."
47730,Lisa,a media circus.
48234,Lisa,i bet i could turn him into a proper gentleman! and i will do it in time for the school science fair!
44146,Lisa,ech! think of how awful it would be for the poor midget inside...
47739,Lisa,did you know back in high school that she'd be such a star?
52208,Lisa,why do i get the feeling that someday i'll be describing this to a psychiatrist?
48952,Lisa,"uh... let's think about this. martin's gone, but it was an accident. ruining our lives won't bring him back."
45541,Lisa,maybe the tomato seeds crossbred with the tobacco seeds.
44269,Lisa,"what've you got for me, boy? hey, this says we should feed him lots of eggs and olive oil to ensure a glossy coat."
45445,Lisa,me too. let's go to an authentic japanese noodle house!
42906,Lisa,enough with the hose!
49708,Lisa,"bart, you have to take him back!"
47864,Lisa,"okay, that's two... ...and that's it. if i think of another one, i'll let him back in."
47465,Lisa,"right, right."
49203,Lisa,"we won, he's asleep!"
49297,Lisa,all the bees are dead!
47070,Lisa,"dad, that's a moth."
45481,Lisa,and what per cent is that?
43457,Lisa,"happy to do it. but you know, bart, some philosophers believe that nobody is born with a soul -- that you have to earn one through suffering and thought and prayer, like you did last night."
44209,Lisa,excuse me?
48664,Lisa,what's the password?
44464,Lisa,"no offense, mom, but that was pretty cool."
46431,Lisa,"you know, if dad never told anyone, that body must still be out there."
51317,Lisa,what is so funny? they're destroying the world!
45225,Lisa,"hey, give me some of that."
48306,Lisa,i know who donald trump is.
47626,Lisa,"maman, please pass ze baguette."
43456,Lisa,not in any of the ones you know about.
51027,Lisa,it's just enough to get home. i'm hungry now.
43110,Lisa,"you're a member of the stonecutters, grampa?"
52389,Lisa,"grampa, that's the noblest thought that's ever been expressed at this table."
45491,Lisa,"and there's the cane from ""citizen kane."" wait a minute. there was no cane in ""citizen kane."""
45247,Lisa,deal.
47242,Lisa,you wanted to see me?
48450,Lisa,yes!
42713,Lisa,"is the remarkably sexist drivel spouted by malibu stacy intentional, or is it just a horrible mistake?"
43044,Lisa,"that's very nice, dad, but it's wrong for you to reward violent, competitive behavior. however, i will sit up front with you if it's a fatherly gesture of love."
48007,Lisa,"yeah, the templates had a great run. but we'd like our hair to look like um... people hair."
41962,Lisa,"i dreamed i was married to corey, and we lived on a pony farm...and corey was always walking around with his shirt off."
46942,Lisa,i'm a magazine rack.
45814,Lisa,"ow! bart, that's hot!"
42645,Lisa,maybe mom just doesn't realize we miss her. we could go down to the casino and let her know.
47660,Lisa,"stupid burns, cuts off my power, lowers my credit rating..."
43999,Lisa,it's your fault! i accidentally laughed at your immature prank.
42326,Lisa,hey! the incision in the coronary artery must be made below the blockage. below!
46784,Lisa,"...poor william bonney might have become a doctor, or a senator..."
41660,Lisa,"oh my god, my social studies project is due tomorrow morning!"
46225,Lisa,no. the reason is chemical.
45555,Lisa,"mom, no! everyone at school picks on the ""pöpli"" kids. even i do. i just hate them so much."
46990,Lisa,could you use it in a sentence?
42915,Lisa,ren and stimpy do it all the time.
45154,Lisa,"i know you're a little peeved at grampa, dad, but you've done a wonderful thing."
43757,Lisa,i'm going after him!
47692,Lisa,yes.
48375,Lisa,you'd do that for me? that is so sweet.
44342,Lisa,can i go downstairs and see what dad's doing?
44555,Lisa,"ah, so you don't have that killer instinct. big deal."
52194,Lisa,"no, bart. it's a three-thousand-year-old riddle with no answer. it's supposed to clear your mind of conscious thought."
47397,Lisa,what if they make it into a movie?
44532,Lisa,"don't feel sorry for me, mom. i feel sorry for you."
47711,Lisa,what?! i'm not fat enough already? how could you say that to me?
46081,Lisa,"as french canadians, they don't believe in refunds, or exploiting animals for entertainment."
43277,Lisa,"is that what we do in this family? when someone becomes an inconvenience, we just get rid of them?!"
50937,Lisa,the dog's got the mumps.
45454,Lisa,"well, maggie weighs a lot less than... oh, i'll just go."
49118,Lisa,professor.
46653,Lisa,here we are!
45903,Lisa,wow...
51568,Lisa,hooray.
49313,Lisa,always.
42741,Lisa,what?
47194,Lisa,"mom, it's ""wind."""
51076,Lisa,that is so unsatisfying.
46575,Lisa,"dad, it's a documentary on the homeless."
46102,Lisa,"ah, now for a little powder blue."
49069,Lisa,"i'm sorry, but as a filmmaker i have to face the truth."
42525,Lisa,dad...
49501,Lisa,"don't you mean ""pint""?"
46762,Lisa,"oh yeah, that's the pride."
43212,Lisa,finished this page?
50714,Lisa,da-ad!
51171,Lisa,the geyser's one of the most famous natural wonders in... iceland. i guess that's where carl's from.
46271,Lisa,buzz off.
45238,Lisa,fine. how about--
45773,Lisa,fiscal solvency.
46893,Lisa,"hey bart, you could nominate mrs. krabappel for an actual award, the teacher of the year. then she'll feel appreciated."
42933,Lisa,noooo!!
44030,Lisa,very sharp!
50706,Lisa,wha--? mom is gonna love that!
47064,Lisa,i can find a good career at this museum. or at lease see if they fixed that mislabeled raccoon i complained about.
47570,Lisa,you probably do this all the time! this whole family is built on a tissue of lies and romance!
43804,Lisa,i love it! i finally look like a real person! thanks!
42962,Lisa,"dad, the flash must have scrambled their circuits."
42818,Lisa,where's grampa? wasn't he invited?
51622,Lisa,"if you don't let us watch, we'll just go to a house where some more permissive parents will."
43430,Lisa,"yeah. it seems like our house, but everything's got a creepy pat boone-ish quality to it."
49979,Lisa,what's that delicious smell?
46266,Lisa,"well, if you really cared about chimps, you'd know that dr. bushwell is their best friend."
49584,Lisa,"look, can you please, please, help a poor little girl who was just trying to fit in? it's what half your songs are about."
49848,Lisa,you'll need to know fractions to make that explosion!
49777,Lisa,"my pearls? these were a gift from my mom, when i could first read at a twelfth grade level."
47098,Lisa,ages eight to eighty.
46025,Lisa,i'm not dead! and neither is my sense of moral outrage.
48536,Lisa,mom! mom!
44112,Lisa,the nanny we want is kindly and sage.
44575,Lisa,"um, miss hoover! miss hoover!"
41928,Lisa,"i mean you, you dummy."
42175,Lisa,"our arts and crafts center is, in actuality, a dickensian workhouse."
50998,Lisa,"portia, you're the woman i dream of becoming, but mom is my mom."
42535,Lisa,"bart, look! it's dad!"
51119,Lisa,why am i doing this?
47814,Lisa,"dig in, everybody!"
48265,Lisa,"i've read about you. you're shy, and you rarely approach humans!"
51048,Lisa,please-be-her! please-be-her!
51878,Lisa,yeah!
44395,Lisa,"hey, where's bart?"
47618,Lisa,that's from the first amendment to the constitution. thank you.
51319,Lisa,so... you were going through a phase?
45533,Lisa,"where are we going, dad?"
44669,Lisa,"dad, the zebra didn't do it. it's just a word at the end of the dictionary."
49044,Lisa,awww.
52277,Lisa,"please, dad."
49444,Lisa,"dad, leave -- so i can get into character."
41753,Lisa,"that's okay, bart. nobody really believed it. we were just trying to scare you."
51996,Lisa,"remember, dad. the handle of the big dipper points to the north star."
48834,Lisa,it sounded like you were.
50291,Lisa,"you know, your movie's not all bad. if you cut out the stuff that didn't work, it would make a great short film."
46194,Lisa,knock-knock...
45647,Lisa,"dad, i gave you a list!"
50517,Lisa,are there at least games here?
52118,Lisa,fine. then you tell one scarier.
41692,Lisa,"i see he touched you, too."
51334,Lisa,"bart, i need you to help me win the election."
47010,Lisa,i'm not throwing a spelling bee! i'll die before i misspell.
45878,Lisa,"oh, i love you guys."
44687,Lisa,"i don't need a hint, ralph!"
49896,Lisa,"it's the natural order of things. i'm afraid she's got another two, maybe three days, tops."
51367,Lisa,i mean you could sell foreign rights to your show. even spongebob did it.
48983,Lisa,"i'm just glad it was you who brought us in, nelson. remember when we used to date? if you let me go, we can get back together. i never let you cherry bomb my malibu stacey -- i'll let you do it now."
44561,Lisa,"you didn't invent that, bart. the indians used to drink water to wake up early for their attacks."
41841,Lisa,"bart, that's so sweet. may i see the card?"
51535,Lisa,"no penalty! he dove, dad!"
43072,Lisa,now it's time for the innocence report with homer simpson.
47045,Lisa,that's jelly.
41666,Lisa,why did i have to lie about my heritage? by speaking with forked tongue i am in heap big trouble. and now i'm thinking in stereotypes? that's even worse!
43399,Lisa,"hey! i said that. my name is lisa simpson, and i made a chart of all the suspects in the burns case. look."
49604,Lisa,looks like maggie wants a story too.
41949,Lisa,what?
46009,Lisa,"oh, i can't take it! would it be so bad if i just went home for an hour?"
52261,Lisa,itchy and scratchy seem to have lost their edge.
46071,Lisa,it looks like a sturgeon.
44506,Lisa,"c'mon, c'mon! a bottle cap, a shoe, a bar of gold, anything! she suddenly uncovers a white patch."
49355,Lisa,"we're at the end of chapter four. but we need a grabber, a whammy, a snap-a-roo, some eye mustard... i've got it! how 'bout this? what if queen helvetica found a rare two-horned unicorn!"
43939,Lisa,you think i'm god?
44727,Lisa,great set!
48212,Lisa,"well, what choice do you have?"
45569,Lisa,korean love brides?!
46257,Lisa,"oh, no! we're headed for victoria falls!"
43847,Lisa,the reward for a year's worth of toil and sacrifice: retrospecticus.
45001,Lisa,surprise!
45237,Lisa,"nbc has lots of great shows, and their news and sports coverage can't be beat!"
43234,Lisa,and if they are?
47586,Lisa,"no, i think the expression is ""peg."""
46746,Lisa,ew! bart!
41617,Lisa,"wait a minute, who killed maggie?"
45474,Lisa,aagghh!
51362,Lisa,yes.
50552,Lisa,and they just cash their checks and get away with it every time! it's the perfect crime -- as long as you don't mind betraying the trust of vulnerable young minds.
44586,Lisa,oooooo.
46867,Lisa,"this is a joke. you'll find me down with the real fans, standing ankle-deep in beer and blood."
48569,Lisa,back to scottsdale.
50865,Lisa,but--
46011,Lisa,"ew, someone's been marking their territory."
47636,Lisa,"thanks for helping me deliver the first edition of the red dress press, dad."
52052,Lisa,"hi, sideshow bob."
51003,Lisa,"ew! on every level! ew! bart, you have to treat girls like they matter -- not like they're a bunch of milhice. what? it's the plural of milhouse. look it up."
50503,Lisa,"my science fair project proves that an asteroid will strike the earth on july 15, 9789."
50882,Lisa,well... at least i have a college fund!
48531,Lisa,"well moe, i guess we're friends again."
41694,Lisa,"hey, lisa, indeed."
42023,Lisa,put me down.
47431,Lisa,bart! i cracked the code of the pictograph. it says there's a curse on the mound. of course i don't believe in...
47034,Lisa,"dad, why don't you go to the airport authority and complain?"
48161,Lisa,"arrivedérci, ignorance!"
47058,Lisa,and what's that?
52187,Lisa,"bart, we're just gonna borrow them."
50573,Lisa,i'm sorry.
51392,Lisa,"bart, you were right."
50602,Lisa,"you need an agent? we met a ten percenter today. she'll get you meetings with the eye, the peacock, the alphabet web. you'll have a skein on the sked before you can say ""krusty's wardrobe furnished by ha-has of beverly hills""."
48228,Lisa,you're a jerk! i'm telling mom!
48655,Lisa,"cletus, i had to stop you exploiting the children, so i sent her an e-mail."
52530,Lisa,"you know, i was thinking of taking a poetry class at the community college."
41922,Lisa,all the years i've lobbied to be treated like an adult has blown up in my face.
44509,Lisa,"oh, my goodness."
43389,Lisa,could not!
51383,Lisa,"even better! they're bags of seeds, so that you can plant a garden and watch it grow."
48390,Lisa,"well, whatever the answer is, i'm glad i'm a girl and i'm glad i'm good at math. now enjoy your stupid flautist."
45958,Lisa,what's going on here?
43355,Lisa,oh thank you. but five hundred dollars! you'll never see that much money again!
47556,Lisa,"that's kaballah, jerk!"
41743,Lisa,"maggie, look. what's that?"
49795,Lisa,...dad's idea pad...
50194,Lisa,now they're dancing on his grave!
47710,Lisa,noooooo!
49551,Lisa,one of you said something bad about the other.
42322,Lisa,my dad is very sick. what's gonna happen if he dies?
45257,Lisa,my room!
47875,Lisa,"what about your pet iguana, jub-jub?"
44380,Lisa,yes! you thought i couldn't but i could i did! and i could do it again let's do it again!
49335,Lisa,"so, how come i've never seen you around the janet l. muñoz-robbins rec center before?"
45873,Lisa,"oh, thanks, dad."
51536,Lisa,"i don't know, but she's my new hero."
50168,Lisa,the seven of clubs.
47642,Lisa,it's not fair!
48241,Lisa,i think he's got it! oh yes he's got it!
45880,Lisa,bart sleeps with raggedy andy.
49909,Lisa,oh my god...
43739,Lisa,"yes, well, technically everything worked out all right. but..."
51077,Lisa,you think i'm pretty?
45343,Lisa,you papier mache'd my cat?!
51763,Lisa,i knew he wasn't gonna like the stack parking.
46956,Lisa,and there are so many places to cloister myself!
47914,Lisa,"one thing at a time, bart."
42570,Lisa,i knew it.
51990,Lisa,"mom, i'm scared."
48441,Lisa,"why didn't you tell him it was an accident? it was an accident, right? michael?"
50611,Lisa,"dad, i'm glad your show is successful, but i have to ask you: what's with the crying?"
49209,Lisa,"my god, bart, what happened to us?"
47838,Lisa,"aunt patty, where did you two meet? alternative book store? ethiopian restaurant?"
49970,Lisa,"well guess what, i am not a brunette! i'm a blonde!"
43281,Lisa,who knows what horrible things he's doing to those innocent little puppies?
46540,Lisa,we gotta coordinate on this thing.
48758,Lisa,i've lost milhouse.
45640,Lisa,slivered almonds for the green beans! i'll be right back.
51394,Lisa,"it's a tablet with books on it, but also apps, like ""worms with friends."""
46288,Lisa,"can you take me to school, krusty?"
48764,Lisa,"martin, anything?"
47867,Lisa,"bart, don't worry."
45670,Lisa,i tricked them into thinking they had leprosy.
50260,Lisa,"aw, poor baby."
47358,Lisa,ap-cray.
51026,Lisa,your intellect-deadening dvds turned my brother's brain to jelly.
52207,Lisa,"bart, having never received any words of encouragement myself, i'm not sure how they're supposed to sound. but here goes. i believe in you."
45585,Lisa,that's the doll that attacked me!
41614,Lisa,why it's my best friend...
45010,Lisa,lazy father...
48535,Lisa,grampa's been watching us.
44025,Lisa,"i feel so stupid, mom. nelson's not right for me at all. and i don't think he ever will be."
44814,Lisa,"boy, that phony schmaltz of yours sure is powerful stuff."
44697,Lisa,"mom, i think something's wrong with me. i can't do anything right lately."
42788,Lisa,"no, that's a trilobite... that's petrified wood... bart, that's a bran"
44958,Lisa,"um, i don't know. the ponies might be startled by the loud music."
42220,Lisa,i thought those were illegal.
47123,Lisa,"mom, why are you talking like that?"
42847,Lisa,"oh, well, y'know, it ain't so great. bart, it's the best thing that ever happened to me in my whole life! well, anyway, i brought you a present."
50671,Lisa,it's... nice.
45931,Lisa,"well, at least stop basting yourself!"
44191,Lisa,it'll be dark.
48963,Lisa,exactly.
50369,Lisa,my friends call me lisa.
50322,Lisa,these are comedy albums?
50023,Lisa,"okay, maybe it won't be that bad."
43225,Lisa,hi mom.
47734,Lisa,"you're successful too, mom. you made a chore wheel that's both fair and wise."
48548,Lisa,no.
41732,Lisa,"i think it's sad that you equate friendliness from wimpiness, and i hope it will keep you from ever achieving true popularity."
49352,Lisa,"we're still cool though, right?"
42049,Lisa,"wow, thanks sparkle. wait, this isn't you."
49055,Lisa,"yeah, it's my code name. this is compost. and this is solarpanel."
45603,Lisa,let ev-ry...
46597,Lisa,"well, how do we get to branson?"
42061,Lisa,"""okay, okay... i cannot see you for the next five years, for i will be farming the ocean floor."""
47409,Lisa,"oh, i can't stand it."
46280,Lisa,"hang on, linguo. you'll be up and conjugating in no time."
49195,Lisa,the real bart would've thrown me out the window.
46357,Lisa,soyghetti-o's!
52002,Lisa,the answers to deep theological questions..
47280,Lisa,don't cry for me kids of springfield / you can still reach me through e-mail / at smart girl six three / underscore back slash / at yahoo dot com / at yahoo dot com...
44186,Lisa,now put your left leg into the left side of the pants -- and you're done.
44490,Lisa,why is that woman still living here?
46534,Lisa,maybe we should try to calm dad down.
49119,Lisa,chef!
47539,Lisa,and why is krusty on the couch?
45818,Lisa,what?
47810,Lisa,"i used to love springfield park, but it's gotten so run down."
50148,Lisa,"wow, mom -- you got first place in the science fair!"
43542,Lisa,"mom, were you ever planning to step in and put a stop to this?"
51687,Lisa,"professor farnsworth, i'm dying to know how you got here. was it a time machine?"
41699,Lisa,"i, i understand. mr. bergstrom, i'm going to miss you."
42787,Lisa,just take one of my geodes. the rocks on my desk.
42982,Lisa,hey!
49629,Lisa,"bart, have you established your alibi?"
48137,Lisa,"sure, that's all you men do is, take and take and take, without regard to feelings or unicorns...here, take my lunch, too!"
51600,Lisa,"our lord, buddha, says the secret of existence is to pass beyond fear."
45189,Lisa,"adults! / you're such a drooling snoring, boozing boring bunch / surly, meanie, three-martini lunch-ers."
45428,Lisa,"hey look, there's a cyber-cafe opening right here in springfield! will you take me, dad? please? i'll show you how to order pizza over the internet..."
48314,Lisa,"grampa, i think you should give up the bullfighting."
48127,Lisa,i'm afraid the best thing i could find is this.
44196,Lisa,"uh, maybe you should eat the ones you have."
41850,Lisa,"uh, excuse me, i have the chocolate milk."
47872,Lisa,"bart, you were gonna burn the third nice thing you've ever done for me?"
41966,Lisa,awww.
43285,Lisa,bart!
50992,Lisa,someone's smitten.
41861,Lisa,a man who envies our family is a man who needs help.
44093,Lisa,mr. smithers! mr. smithers! i found another hurt shrew! i think this one has a twisted ankle!
44899,Lisa,dad!
45420,Lisa,i don't remember discussing that.
46035,Lisa,dad?? the panda was you?
48956,Lisa,"bart, keep it together. people are looking!"
51151,Lisa,you're siding with record companies?
50664,Lisa,you have a way with words.
43571,Lisa,"dad, do you even know what ""rhetorical"" means?"
50163,Lisa,"mom, i admire everything you do--"
52317,Lisa,"sorry, i'd rather go to heaven."
46446,Lisa,that could not be more blasphemous.
47443,Lisa,bart will give back the malibu stacy head you thought was lost.
48859,Lisa,"aw, it's okay."
46991,Lisa,a-m-e-l-i-o-r-a-t-e. ameliorate.
48050,Lisa,all we've got is ketchup.
45913,Lisa,"to prolong the run of the series, i was secretly given anti-growth hormones."
50393,Lisa,brother germs!
44834,Lisa,"family to dad. family to dad. come in, dad!"
43334,Lisa,uh huh.
46090,Lisa,"wait, i'm confused. why was a wolf shooting a web?"
46870,Lisa,but the game's not even over!
43840,Lisa,"dad, are you okay?"
43850,Lisa,"in the beginning of the school year, each of you received a colored ticket. i hope everyone still has theirs."
49154,Lisa,"oh no, the northern irish are also having a parade!"
47484,Lisa,"goodbye, maggie. i'm smart enough to know you're better off without me."
51829,Lisa,cook all the tater tots! / there were too many tots! / and the teachers took them home in manila envelopes! / i hate you!
43055,Lisa,bart started it.
44026,Lisa,what?
52046,Lisa,and the main export is furious political thought.
43118,Lisa,well maybe you could reach out to the community and help other people.
46905,Lisa,i wonder what this could be?
50343,Lisa,help! i'm trapped in an alternate dimension! an existential netherspace!
44632,Lisa,"aw, those poor badgers are soaked."
49294,Lisa,think differently... think differently... think differently... think differently...
45151,Lisa,"doctor hibbert, i thought you'd located another kidney for grampa."
46835,Lisa,you die now!
48527,Lisa,"moe, you're a heartless jerk!"
45459,Lisa,"but, dad, i thought you hated..."
44226,Lisa,"bart, if you come out, i'll let you eat raw cookie dough. i'll let you... ride the lawn mower through the house. come on, open the door!"
50657,Lisa,you really want me?
42979,Lisa,i don't think bob won that election legally. i can't believe a convicted felon would get so many votes and another convicted felon would get so few.
47831,Lisa,i hope this bad publicity doesn't affect tourism.
43250,Lisa,"dad, you're babbling."
51663,Lisa,flaming tap water. i saw something about that in a documentary...
52304,Lisa,thou shalt not steal!
48633,Lisa,excuse me.
51325,Lisa,"isabel! i want this campaign to be about the issues: same-sex fieldtrip buddies, providing class pets with a path to citizenship..."
44913,Lisa,"hey, public display."
42506,Lisa,"mom, can you bring me more o.j.?"
48316,Lisa,"i was always cheering for you, grampa. till now."
51266,Lisa,"but after some thought, all my worries went away."
42372,Lisa,"sure, i guess."
44749,Lisa,i wanna read the giant book!
52448,Lisa,can i get my ears pierced?
41862,Lisa,let's move.
46403,Lisa,dad's gonna slaughter that poor turkey!
50856,Lisa,"guys, stop throwing things in the hole -- the more you throw in, the bigger and more dangerous it becomes!"
49064,Lisa,mom! dad! bart's marrying one of cletus' daughters!
48615,Lisa,and that thing where you're walking and someone's walking towards you and you each try to step aside but you both go the same way and you do it again and again until one of you just scoots around? they had seven names for that.
48031,Lisa,cooper! thy staves are not flush!
45770,Lisa,"if i'm gonna bail the country out... i'll have to raise taxes. but in my speech, i'd like to avoid calling it a ""painful emergency tax."""
48242,Lisa,where is that ghastly flow?
48987,Lisa,"angelica's first kiss, da, da, da... subplot about her cat, who cares?... professor skizzletwitch is a were-bear... and, uh, no, no he's not... maluicious krubb is actually kraluicious mubb!"
50072,Lisa,"this is really fun. but we're still just friends, right?"
45731,Lisa,i just want to tell you how proud i am that you're showing an interest in your fellow man.
45915,Lisa,so this whole thing was just a trick to get us back together.
43582,Lisa,"bart, no!"
47687,Lisa,you feed us on twelve dollars a week?
48403,Lisa,how can you teach the book of genesis as a scientific theory?
48599,Lisa,"there are no small parts, just small actors."
49700,Lisa,"belt is by twizzler, vest courtesy of nelson, tights are by hello kitty..."
45331,Lisa,"dad, i really need to rest my back."
42028,Lisa,i don't know.
42086,Lisa,nothin'.
48334,Lisa,we haven't gotten our food yet!
50681,Lisa,mulberry island. we'll kiss there at sunset.
47780,Lisa,done and done. i'm going to the organic market!
48376,Lisa,"ow, that hurt."
45479,Lisa,"dad, that's an ambulance."
48158,Lisa,of course i do. why would i say it if i didn't?
44662,Lisa,"hey... if a boar can survive here, there must be a source of food."
42994,Lisa,"you don't have the intelligence to rig an election by yourself, do you?"
50809,Lisa,are you crying... glitter?
48765,Lisa,so true.
51516,Lisa,no!
50505,Lisa,that's pathetic.
49592,Lisa,please don't say a man.
49302,Lisa,bees.
43901,Lisa,"okay, you found out i'm an over-achieving bookworm. so whatever mean prank you're pulling, just finish it up and send me a polaroid. i'm going to sleep."
43795,Lisa,"no, it's somebody's gross gum! get it out! ow! ow! it's pulling out my hairs!"
51760,Lisa,right. conquering.
44429,Lisa,"well, i really liked that story. but it still doesn't fix this."
45382,Lisa,"okay, i'm leaving."
47305,Lisa,put out the fire first.
47800,Lisa,a-lo-ha!
48125,Lisa,"fine, there's a daddy claus."
49625,Lisa,"interesting. with no obvious motive, no one would suspect us."
51178,Lisa,wait... you named me after a train?
47951,Lisa,i know how we can raise money!
42098,Lisa,"bart, why'd you take the blame?"
42050,Lisa,is it that girl with the lazy eye patch?
48780,Lisa,"oh bart, you fall for that every six months."
46790,Lisa,there's no light rail in springfield.
42163,Lisa,"a+! oh, bart, why didn't you at least forge plausible grades?"
48596,Lisa,"milhouse, thanks to you, the nerds can breathe easy. except the ones with asthma. which is all of them. but still, it's great."
48908,Lisa,"c'mon lis, hop on the wiggum wagon. ralph said he'd let me be secretary of indian burns. here's my first official act:"
42128,Lisa,we don't have seatbelts.
47541,Lisa,but i'm eight years old!
49184,Lisa,"ooh, you're a scarlet tanager. you've been flying south, because you're migrating to... machu picchu, peru!"
51188,Lisa,"oooh, there's new marshmallows in the belfast charms!"
42191,Lisa,"hey, mom, would it help if ah talked lahk this, too?"
49409,Lisa,"yep. in the future, people will look at this and they'll say ""whoever he was, he must've mattered."""
42291,Lisa,old man winter!
45233,Lisa,no!
51539,Lisa,are you okay?
52223,Lisa,you don't even care! you don't even care!
41892,Lisa,"thanks, bart."
51876,Lisa,yeah!
50179,Lisa,i'm so exci--
51859,Lisa,"""id. along with the ego and the superego, one of three components of the psyche."""
52334,Lisa,heehaw!
50863,Lisa,you tossed your car keys in my bean plant!
41595,Lisa,"look, if you want jenda to take you back you should show some initiative. get a job."
50947,Lisa,i didn't know that was an option.
47354,Lisa,not any more.
42635,Lisa,huh?
48827,Lisa,working? where?
43232,Lisa,"hey, i remember you. mayor quimby, right?"
48059,Lisa,there's no such thing as zombies!
50001,Lisa,oh my god! mom! thank you! i just need my...
50029,Lisa,"if you need me, i'll be upstairs saying goodbye to my dreams."
49958,Lisa,again with the blonde! why in the world would the color of the hair on someone's head have anything to do with the intelligence within?
51242,Lisa,"well then, i guess i have no choice."
48966,Lisa,"bart, i have a plan: we go to the morgue and come back with a hand. put its fingerprints all over the railing..."
48726,Lisa,i can't -- i won't!
48907,Lisa,oh dear god.
50946,Lisa,"look at these obscure card games! hey, do you have ""uno?"""
44011,Lisa,well... would you like to come over to my house after school?
44290,Lisa,"dad, if you just drink one more, i'll have a full bag."
41810,Lisa,"mr. jefferson, my name is lisa simpson, and i have a problem."
49938,Lisa,"those baby whales are doomed, just like their mom. i guess it's just nature's way."
51971,Lisa,"but mom, can't i... stay a little longer?"
50906,Lisa,what are you talking about?
49101,Lisa,proudly edited by lisa simpson!

43097,Lisa,"mom, you've been cooking all night?"
51402,Lisa,i don't know. it wasn't like dad was stealing for himself. he created this wonderful experience for the whole town. i just can't imagine anyone turning him in.
49004,Lisa,"cigarettes?! they could kill you. they did a whole episode about it on ""the suite life of zach and cody""! zach tried to impress a girl by smoking. but she went for cody instead! zach's life wasn't so sweet then."
49270,Lisa,new york times crossword editor will shortz!
42416,Lisa,"oh bart, i forgot my math book. would you hold this for me, please?"
44408,Lisa,i admit sgt. skinner seems okay... but mr. tamzarian pulled himself up from the streets and earned our respect and admiration.
41587,Lisa,"if you have to guess, guess ""b."""
49169,Lisa,what'd you get for me?
49344,Lisa,that's today!
44512,Lisa,but it can't be an angel!
44805,Lisa,"it is, isn't it?"
49326,Lisa,they sound awfully mad. are they dangerous?
41588,Lisa,not every question!
45423,Lisa,"da-ad! oh, dr. hawking. we had such a beautiful dream. what went wrong?"
47944,Lisa,"""hydrogenated petroleum oil, monosodium poisonate, partially de-weaponized plutonium?!"""
43784,Lisa,whee.
48336,Lisa,...and you've got the elderly jewish couple making their first trip to israel.
42985,Lisa,this is hopeless. they're gonna demolish our house for sure. we're gonna have to move into a motel 6.
46218,Lisa,shh. it's working. look.
41818,Lisa,i can't believe it! the system works.
41878,Lisa,yahhh!
49587,Lisa,"because if you feel you have to put what you are on your shirt, then i feel sorry for you. do you feel sorry for me? guess not."
45323,Lisa,"hey, cut that out! i have an idea."
44897,Lisa,"archaeologists have been studying it for decades, and still have no clue what it means."
49342,Lisa,i don't know -- it's been so long since i've had a playdate. not that i couldn't get one if i wanted...
47415,Lisa,"ha, ha, ha, you wet your pants."
45793,Lisa,"please, calm down. we can work something out."
45007,Lisa,"you've started smoking, dad?"
48702,Lisa,"great. the one time you actually do something right, you ruin my life."
42358,Lisa,"all right, mom. i promise you will never be billed for another call. bobby sherman..."
50866,Lisa,"mom, what's going on?"
42410,Lisa,i thought you'd like it.
49749,Lisa,you guys will be the hit of cousin valerie's wedding reception!
50766,Lisa,"first of all, congratulations on getting the lead."
41859,Lisa,"krusty, please continue."
51311,Lisa,"oh, dear god."
45666,Lisa,"lazy, no-good lepers... making me clean everything myself..."
46410,Lisa,how is the feast of twelve delights with triple happiness sauce?
46648,Lisa,hey! hey!
49253,Lisa,you got highlights in your hair!
52361,Lisa,ow!
45862,Lisa,"all right, i'll be the stupid curtain puller."
48828,Lisa,you sound weird.
47853,Lisa,"bart, you are the meanest, nastiest little boy that ever lived."
49831,Lisa,no! you lie! eliza simpson can't be a coward! she's the only decent ancestor i have.
45146,Lisa,because they discovered gold right over there--
45279,Lisa,sounds great.
42613,Lisa,"dad, this one gesture almost makes up for years of shaky fathering."
48890,Lisa,now!
50544,Lisa,you're t.r. francis! you wrote the angelica button books! they're my favorite fantasy novels!
46345,Lisa,"paul bunyan never fought rodan. and his size seems to be really inconsistent. i mean, one minute he's ten feet tall, the next his feet are as big as a lake..."
49585,Lisa,that's amazing.
44531,Lisa,it's not that i don't have a spiritual side. i just find it hard to believe there's a dead angel hanging in our garage.
51320,Lisa,what are you trying to say?
52212,Lisa,here.
49425,Lisa,hooray! i'm a brainy outcast again!
42331,Lisa,really?
43893,Lisa,aye carumba!
46799,Lisa,come... on... dad...
43518,Lisa,it worked! they're all dead!
46390,Lisa,what are you doing?
51130,Lisa,okay!
42711,Lisa,mom! we could go on the factory tour and i could complain in person!
49758,Lisa,you use the wand like a tennis racket to hit an invisible ball.
42727,Lisa,"but if you can learn from malibu stacy's mistakes, so can everyone. i'm sure we can think of something together. c'mon!"
45967,Lisa,daaaad!
51262,Lisa,bart! i'm gonna tell!
44517,Lisa,"dad, it's not fair to claim this thing is an angel. there's no proof of that."
42862,Lisa,ooh! ooh!
48328,Lisa,"not prostitutes, protestants."
49181,Lisa,i know! it's a complete violation of your rights. not to mention--
43636,Lisa,"yeah, you look great! you can do anything with that sewing machine."
51969,Lisa,"""i got a bratty brother / he bugs me every day / and this mornin' my own mother, she gave my last cupcake away! / my dad acts like he belongs... he belongs in the zoo / i'm the sa...dest kid in grade number two."""
43877,Lisa,hi.
47602,Lisa,"that's horrible. how could you, dad?"
44529,Lisa,but they are morons. what grown person could believe in angels?
47195,Lisa,"dad, do you realize what you've done? you've created a world without death."
43688,Lisa,but it explains why there's no record of jebediah before 1795! he was hans sprüngfeld until then!
47224,Lisa,"dad, i'm just as sad as you are. what happened to grandma is an outrage."
49721,Lisa,bart!
50958,Lisa,"well, it's time we showed this dog some love!"
46821,Lisa,big fish! big fish!
43187,Lisa,whatcha doin' ma?
42737,Lisa,"dad, did you hear something?"
51172,Lisa,"he said he went home, and his passport is gone. what country is he from?"
45702,Lisa,glow sticks? but visual aids are against the rules!
44640,Lisa,"we may have to live on this food for a long time, so no more till tomorrow."
46660,Lisa,american corporations should stop playing god with nature.
48115,Lisa,"please don't accept this invitation, dad. hunting is cruel."
52366,Lisa,"gee, is it always this good?"
51608,Lisa,fine.
43155,Lisa,"come on, shampoo! you can do it!"
43467,Lisa,no!
49430,Lisa,"okay, everyone squeeze in."
42873,Lisa,mom.
43050,Lisa,"bart, that was your cherished childhood toy."
47743,Lisa,"there's ""dan rather"" and ""tom brokaw"", hanging out with kent brockman!"
51302,Lisa,and don't you hate being the middle child?
42412,Lisa,first prize... first prize...
45249,Lisa,"yeah, but corporate sponsorship cheapens our nation's treasures."
51464,Lisa,"to quote whitman: ""this is what you shall do: love the earth and sun and animals, despise riches, stand up for the stupid and crazy..."""
42597,Lisa,"uh, dad, that's his crotch."
50357,Lisa,you never even opened it.
44412,Lisa,"look, bart. i have to practice my saxophone and you can't stop me."
43170,Lisa,"bart, i'm sorry i'm gonna miss your public humiliation, but the woolumbaloo dirt monument is just too exciting to pass up."
44004,Lisa,"but i bet underneath, he's a sweet, sensitive person -- like you. i guess you could say i want to bring out the milhouse in nelson."
42671,Lisa,"you're right, bart. school is for losers."
50442,Lisa,"i've discovered a mystery, wrapped in a riddle in the basement of a lousy school!"
47226,Lisa,"well, they're transferring grandma to a federal prison tomorrow. i say we hit 'em where they live... with a candlelight vigil!"
49810,Lisa,what are you doing? i wanna know what happens next.
52350,Lisa,"bye, unky herb."
52084,Lisa,"wow, a quarter past six. what's keeping dad?"
42802,Lisa,i knew it was a bad idea to watch him open the mail.
51927,Lisa,well... hm...
44629,Lisa,it's wonderful to think for ourselves again.
45493,Lisa,"dad, that's so mean."
44787,Lisa,"we'll bring you more on this chalk shortage as it continues. and now, bart's been looking into that alleged ham salad from yesterday's school lunch."
50467,Lisa,"no, i mean they're mannequins!"
46618,Lisa,"uh, god says we should just be friends."
46761,Lisa,wow. look at dad. people really respect him.
45046,Lisa,i told you capital punishment isn't a deterrent.
46527,Lisa,is it really worth risking your lives just for some sugar?
47381,Lisa,"wait, you don't want me to have this cat!"
41937,Lisa,that looks like an olympic torch to me. your husband could be an olympic athlete who will go on to have a great acting career.
50577,Lisa,i secretly switched the flash drives.
49590,Lisa,"please, i just want to go back to a place where i'm ostracized for being me, not for who i pretend to be."
42248,Lisa,you said he went bowling!
49161,Lisa,really? so what else is in the news?
42910,Lisa,what?
50500,Lisa,"halloween is over, which means america, it's time to start your christmas shopping. infuse our stagnant economy with dollars you don't really have."
52391,Lisa,i'll name her princess and i'll ride her every day.
46904,Lisa,"a laser pointer! thanks, bart."
43821,Lisa,there was an amnesty declared for people who've been here as long as you! that means you can take the citizenship test!
43747,Lisa,santa?
49166,Lisa,toora loora lie
48749,Lisa,i've got something!
45127,Lisa,i cheated!
48611,Lisa,"...and so my proud people were nearly destroyed by the warfare, disease, and greed of the invading europeans."
50333,Lisa,really? can i see it?
47777,Lisa,why don't you go legit and sell your shirts in stores?
45427,Lisa,"this is ""wired."" it's about computers and technology."
50953,Lisa,the back yard?! but what if he got out through your half-completed tunnel to flanders's fridge?
52337,Lisa,marco!
51808,Lisa,but when you think of the things we lack...
47962,Lisa,i hope we didn't camp out here for nothing. it's like every kid in springfield showed up.
47021,Lisa,"oh my god, you're right. i spelled it wrong. i tried my best -- and i failed!"
51652,Lisa,making fun of someone's clothes. how original.
46638,Lisa,awww.
45157,Lisa,"oh, my god. someone has to go back in for maggie!"
51240,Lisa,why bart? i thought we were friends!
52231,Lisa,bart...?! where are you?
43297,Lisa,"oh, yeah. i didn't think this was for me."
43222,Lisa,"and i love that painting. judging by the clothes, i'd say seventeenth century."
51632,Lisa,i've got an idea... but i'll need that broccoli.
49075,Lisa,"three it is! you're the teacher, and i accept your decision."
43229,Lisa,oh.
46599,Lisa,"look mom, it's your car. grampa and bart must be in that theater!"
51630,Lisa,that's all i wanted: a tiny bit of control.
45951,Lisa,"it's a movie, dad."
46475,Lisa,"i'm planting my own bodhi tree. if i meditate under it, perhaps i can find inner peace."
45502,Lisa,what bad things? why?
43695,Lisa,that's a myth that got mixed up with the truth.
47604,Lisa,that's not what dogs do.
47277,Lisa,"chief wiggum, we're just like you policemen. don't you ever feel like the mayor doesn't care about you?"
49983,Lisa,"oh, bart. i am so glad everything's okay."
46742,Lisa,that's not a sunset. that's a bird on fire!
44496,Lisa,"hey, they can't just build a parking lot on saber tooth meadow. that's where they discovered all those fossils!"
43528,Lisa,"you saved us, maggie!"
47706,Lisa,maybe a different outfit would make me look thinner.
45409,Lisa,someone should stand up to them.
45982,Lisa,aren't you coming with me?
46515,Lisa,i'm eight years old.
45119,Lisa,daddd...
47101,Lisa,"he's right, dad. we're missing that singer's head!"
46387,Lisa,we promise.
45721,Lisa,"that's very sweet, but we have a full day of hiking planned."
48335,Lisa,i'm starting to think the sea captain isn't coming back.
47673,Lisa,"well, you can't fight fate, but if you must shoot our father, please remember our family motto: ""not in the face."""
46552,Lisa,"""springfield preparatory school?!"" dad, you told me there were no private schools in springfield!"
42142,Lisa,we leapt off just in time to see it collapse.
51792,Lisa,"what's wrong, dad?"
42545,Lisa,"that's good, dad."
51554,Lisa,"no, i'm just, i... maybe you just haven't found the right food. huh? how 'bout ice cream?"
48027,Lisa,that's what we've been trying to tell you!
43752,Lisa,"no, thanks. do you have any fruit?"
47054,Lisa,"dad, please. you're the head of a major corporation."
46538,Lisa,aww... maybe a hug will cork her cry-hole.
49248,Lisa,"hey, there are no lenses in these glasses..."
47000,Lisa,"uh, i was just k-i-d-d-i-n-g."
42954,Lisa,"mom, that's veal."
45601,Lisa,"dad, dad, you're driving on the sidewalk."
47900,Lisa,"look, dad wrote something: ""dino -- short for dinosaur? remember to ask jeeves."""
42149,Lisa,i see your point.
46715,Lisa,"go, go, go!"
46526,Lisa,"we have to sign up plaintiffs, and take depositions from the townspeople."
49533,Lisa,"if you don't stop smiling, you're gonna get a kiss!"
44215,Lisa,"i said go to ""bed."""
51494,Lisa,i've lost my guinea pig!
48006,Lisa,"mom, bart and i have been talking..."
42702,Lisa,"thanks for buying us these toys, grampa."
42564,Lisa,the tv! the tv!
47306,Lisa,"oh, my god! we've made a terrible mistake. this tunnel comes out in the worst possible place."
43116,Lisa,"dad, you're not with the stonecutters now. there are no lackeys around to carry out your every..."
46826,Lisa,to fraternal love.
45717,Lisa,"ah, we're so lucky to have this untouched piece of paradise so close to springfield."
49360,Lisa,see who?
46574,Lisa,"i said ""let's go""."
49764,Lisa,yeah. or is it just a cover story for a grownup thing we're not allowed to know about?
44804,Lisa,oh-how-terrible-read-on.
47961,Lisa,ow!
43286,Lisa,ssh.
42024,Lisa,"look dad, i'll tell you who's gonna win the super bowl if you want me to. but it'll just validate my theory that you cared more about winning money than you did about me."
46968,Lisa,you're baby stink-breath! you're baby stink-breath! en francais! vous etes l'enfant stink-breath!
46227,Lisa,"this is my test subject, francine."
47807,Lisa,i'm not inferring anything. you infer. i imply.
51132,Lisa,our poor couch...
46674,Lisa,"it worked, mom! maggie's memories have shown them humanity's inner goodness."
51750,Lisa,thanks.
47038,Lisa,i've been saying it for three weeks! but every time i open my mouth...
48959,Lisa,idiot!
50644,Lisa,hit refresh.
52203,Lisa,nirvana.
50067,Lisa,didn't anybody here stay in school?
45284,Lisa,"dad, you don't have to go to a new age store just for me. i know you think this stuff is stupid."
47910,Lisa,"okay, she's fat."
50855,Lisa,"yes, it's the preferred term. and most scientists believe that what enters a black hole never comes out. but some think they may be a gateway to other universes."
50768,Lisa,"dad, the story of the passion is the cornerstone of the christian faith. and although i personally follow the enlightened teachings of lord buddha, messing with jesus really gets people mad -- it's like wearing a florida state jersey to a florida game."
50819,Lisa,on a one-way train to be milhouse's bride...
50900,Lisa,"okay, education paid for. with a gap year, to find myself. every nerve in my body is screaming ""cash out now,"" and yet... i've got a pair of aces!"
50828,Lisa,a peloton?
44356,Lisa,"hey, look, it's the school motto."
51291,Lisa,"no is the saddest experience you'll ever know / yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know..."
46277,Lisa,"i'll get us out of this. say dad, want to go see my project for the school science fair?"
50970,Lisa,"dad, there are lights following us!"
50985,Lisa,they're miserable.
46665,Lisa,"i want my old dad back. the one who was yelling all the time and... you know, i'm not really sure what i want."
52387,Lisa,"yeah, bart, get out and push."
49511,Lisa,sideshow bob!
50540,Lisa,he gets four and i only get two?! no fair!
45338,Lisa,"no, christo is a conceptual artist who does huge outdoor projects. he once wrapped the reichstag in plastic."
41710,Lisa,"look, if you just want me to forgive you --"
47753,Lisa,we're trapped!
43530,Lisa,"sorry, dad. this is our spot."
41907,Lisa,i forgive you.
47557,Lisa,that's where mom and dad are!
49323,Lisa,give me the keys!
49272,Lisa,"well i must admit, i'm kind of touched. ""dumb dad sorry for his bet."" nice."
45610,Lisa,are you saying the end justifies the means?
45472,Lisa,"who are ""they,"" exactly?"
43319,Lisa,he'll be fine.
45182,Lisa,nelson.
44178,Lisa,i'll do it! i'll babysit!
49015,Lisa,what am i doing? i don't need secondhand smoke to do ballet.
42167,Lisa,"if the pets die, don't replace them. i'll know!"
46087,Lisa,"""lisa is an outstanding student, with a slight tendency toward know-it-all-ism."" that's not even a word!"
48112,Lisa,i hate going to the zoo. i feel so sorry for the animals.
45426,Lisa,"dad, it's not..."
41827,Lisa,but bart --
42808,Lisa,we didn't invite the other babies. maggie doesn't seem to get along with the other babies.
42770,Lisa,are you an ivory dealer?
52440,Lisa,"i believe everything you say, with your words, your body language and your semitic good looks."
44876,Lisa,"oh, that's it. i give up."
49627,Lisa,"listen, you're a persistent fellow, but i--"
43300,Lisa,"horrible news, mom!"
41608,Lisa,losers? you mean losers like...
48045,Lisa,"dad, it's a scam!"
43728,Lisa,we've got to get seats for the itchy and scratchy parade.
46743,Lisa,"oh, i wish i had someplace to call my own. no one wants me around any more."
45425,Lisa,"wow, mom. that's very profound."
49155,Lisa,"well, i do owe you everything... make it quick."
44355,Lisa,is there any answer i can give that won't result in more push-ups?
51609,Lisa,"as the pin on the back of the blue ribbon made its way through bart's shirt and into its housing, the seeds of his comeuppance flew out of the woods."
43371,Lisa,"mom, i know your intentions are good, but aren't the police a protective force that maintains the status quo for the wealthy elites? don't you think we ought to attack the roots of social problems instead of jamming people into overcrowded prisons?"
49431,Lisa,"hey, dad."
41640,Lisa,"i'm dizzy! i'm nauseous! oh, but i'm popular!"
51633,Lisa,"these two fruit smoothies look and taste exactly the same. one of them, however, has the broccoli blended in."
51221,Lisa,i can complete my dad's mission just like george w. bush.
48511,Lisa,"moe, these fragments are fascinating. ""i was in the christmas pageant once. mom showed up with a new boyfriend. he called me steve."""
45959,Lisa,"oh, yeah? you didn't blow up maggie's room."
46138,Lisa,all we can do is play our very best.
43203,Lisa,that's bad?
47612,Lisa,"dad, he's deaf."
51100,Lisa,that's odd.
45150,Lisa,i can't imagine dad running away like this. leaving his father to die.
51795,Lisa,"how about ""patty and selma""?"
47690,Lisa,"oh, she'll win the contest, but she'll lose her soul."
50166,Lisa,ice cold.
51851,Lisa,they never let poor rudolph / join in any reindeer games...
43944,Lisa,"principal skinner, wait! i created the universe! give me the gift certificate!"
51332,Lisa,fine. i gotta go.
50873,Lisa,bart! what are you doing in my room?!
42005,Lisa,"mom, can't a man do something nice for his loved ones?"
42573,Lisa,is it my imagination or is tv getting worse?
41701,Lisa,"so, i guess this is it? it you don't mind i'll just run alongside the train as it speeds you from my life?"
51567,Lisa,wha--?!
52410,Lisa,i was just practicing.
51992,Lisa,aaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!
52319,Lisa,"thanks, mom. it doesn't seem to be going very well."
46601,Lisa,this has been a gracie films pray-sentation!
44955,Lisa,absolutely.
50159,Lisa,"okay, i've gotten rid of all of my distractions, diversions, hobbies and... oh my god!"
51038,Lisa,"""gorilla joe,"" ""gorilla sam,"" ""gorilla pete,"" ""ook and eek, the gorilla twins""... where did mr. burns dig up all these old wrestlers?"
48858,Lisa,"god, that was lame! where did you get that?!"
51020,Lisa,really? who?
49738,Lisa,fine. what's their number?
49968,Lisa,"oh, i can't go on! this rebuttal is a sham!"
48000,Lisa,"i'm sorry i hurt you, but please don't be sad / you're no longer my coach, but you're always my dad..."
46180,Lisa,that ad campaign may have crossed a line.
49386,Lisa,...we have received your manuscript 'the chronicles of equalia'...
47966,Lisa,i can't believe i used to date him.
51012,Lisa,"oh great, another invasive skype from mil-- huh?"
43349,Lisa,"hi, i have a request. i would like you to do a tribute to bleeding gums murphy, please."
49667,Lisa,"well i'm glad you're not ""witches."" wouldn't want you to ""cast a spell"" on me."
47957,Lisa,"hush, little baby, don't say a word / mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird / and if that mockingbird don't sing..."
52274,Lisa,"please, dad. this argument humiliates us both."
47100,Lisa,he's working on a jigsaw puzzle.
42577,Lisa,"bart, what's wrong?"
48606,Lisa,i've got to give a presentation about our family's heritage. but ours is so boring!
42216,Lisa,nope.
49812,Lisa,i must know!
45850,Lisa,"what am i doing wrong, little vicki?"
49135,Lisa,"hey krusty, you're making a huge mistake not hiring my brother. why don't you hire them both? it won't cost you anything -- you could call bart an intern."
48132,Lisa,"you didn't like it, did you?"
51890,Lisa,"happy, dad?"
43917,Lisa,i'll start with radio shack.
50309,Lisa,...and that's why you're acting so sweet and kind. because dad drugged you!
52014,Lisa,here's your birthday breakfast!
47469,Lisa,"uh, well i..."
45632,Lisa,will you at least do the dishes?
44407,Lisa,"and he survived to make it back to springfield, where he became the fine educator we salute tonight."
49826,Lisa,"no, no, no, not now! quit! quit! no, don't quit the program, just the update, ya stupid--"
49148,Lisa,"oh, well, it's one thing to fill in for a monkey. but a comedy legend? i wouldn't dream of it."
50195,Lisa,"hm, apparently mr. burns is in a state of shock from the trauma he underwent."
44750,Lisa,let's just pray this hits the prison.
45843,Lisa,"that's my name with bella on the end of it. ask her, oh god, please ask her to dance."
45004,Lisa,"it was thomas edison, dad."
43880,Lisa,i think i know a place you can skate that's virtually deserted.
47526,Lisa,i'll write the letter.
45268,Lisa,ohhh! quit it! quit it! quit it! quit it!
49653,Lisa,"dad, are you becoming a muncher?"
48519,Lisa,"the wordloaf festival?! you'll meet all the great american writers, moe! you have to go!"
46593,Lisa,"hey, i've earned their trust."
43568,Lisa,"all right, then we'll call your husband: grampa."
47826,Lisa,"mr. alcatraaaz, my name is lisa simpson, and this is principal skinner."
47408,Lisa,okay.
48065,Lisa,"dad, you fought tooth and nail to get it away from our house."
46706,Lisa,"oh, thank you!"
47852,Lisa,whatever!
41906,Lisa,"i'm sorry dad, i don't feel much like eating."
45011,Lisa,"dad, women won't like being shot in the face."
50669,Lisa,"this place is great! if i cover my peripheral vision, i feel like i'm in france!"
50272,Lisa,i'm busy.
45545,Lisa,"no, i..."
44902,Lisa,"it's so beautiful. and just think, we're the first people to hear its song in more than four thousand years."
51896,Lisa,where's he going?
49521,Lisa,"math, done. pine cone, collected. permission slip, signed. now time for a break -- a little social studies."
48133,Lisa,"oh dad, how could you?"
42047,Lisa,uh-um.
44111,Lisa,teach us songs and magic tricks.
51718,Lisa,"mom, where's dad?"
47441,Lisa,but it's not my turn.
49358,Lisa,i'll go get her!
51228,Lisa,the fat in the hat!
43271,Lisa,"can we keep santa's girlfriend, mom?"
42139,Lisa,"hey bart, according to this magazine, in another million years, man will have an extra finger."
51195,Lisa,don't you think it's weird that dad stopped eating pork and drinking beer?
42561,Lisa,we stopped five minutes ago.
52245,Lisa,dad?
47035,Lisa,this is not a delta hub!
43448,Lisa,"bart, your soul is the only part of you that lasts forever. for five dollars, milhouse could own you for a zillion years."
42781,Lisa,"dad, mr. burns hasn't passed away yet."
45432,Lisa,"dad, do we have any money left?"
49008,Lisa,i've gotten better since this morning. how could that have happened?
50161,Lisa,"mom, could you keep it down a little? i'm trying to study."
51271,Lisa,american football.
44596,Lisa,bring it in here.
52496,Lisa,"uh, what are you cooking?"
45107,Lisa,"no, not brown!"
48442,Lisa,michael?
41921,Lisa,you're gonna make me give up princess?
44785,Lisa,"look, i love bart... but he's never even read a newspaper."
41807,Lisa,honest abe. he'll show me the way.
42841,Lisa,coming!
46528,Lisa,godspeed.
52384,Lisa,discount lion safari!
44086,Lisa,"oh, mom, no!"
51255,Lisa,"now, the smartest kid. milhouse?"
52168,Lisa,"but, dad. we're simple people with simple values. capital city is too big and too complex. everyone in springfield knows us and has forgiven us."
43128,Lisa,"so dad, were you excited that mom was pregnant?"
50492,Lisa,okay: a--
44774,Lisa,"come on, quit foolin' around, you guys."
44040,Lisa,"you got rid of them! and you did it like a gentleman, without any violence."
52411,Lisa,"my god, she's been dumped again."
45504,Lisa,i still can't believe we escaped from those horrible vampires.
52468,Lisa,shopping: it's the most fun you can have standing up.
44944,Lisa,or a big joke.
51880,Lisa,we were fighting over which one of us loves you more.
43404,Lisa,chief wig-gum... don't eat... the clues.
47135,Lisa,"i look forward to it. ha ha ha ha, i hate you."
47965,Lisa,"and remember, save the violence for cartoons!"
51410,Lisa,"well, both groups claim their intentions are noble, but at the end of the day, they're both trying to steal as much money as they can."
43125,Lisa,"good aim, dad."
41860,Lisa,that is so sad.
48287,Lisa,this is much sadder than i expected.
42004,Lisa,"you know, dad, sunday is fast becoming my favorite day of the week."
47521,Lisa,"i have to admit, i'll miss having him around."
50964,Lisa,what's hopeless?
46614,Lisa,"with modern ideas -- like putting bigger, harder people in the catapults. or how 'bout rocks?"
46079,Lisa,"i know it seems farfetched, even insulting to your intelligence. but, there's a simple and highly satisfying explanation. you see..."
50180,Lisa,an academy! i'm attending an academy!
51669,Lisa,"stopping mr. burns may be beyond the power of an eight-year-old girl with a book report due on ""beezus and ramona."" but i know someone who can help..."
45166,Lisa,even you?
47426,Lisa,"""the mound builders worshiped turtles, as well as badgers, snakes, and other animals."""
42935,Lisa,"mom, doesn't any love story have a happy ending?"
48077,Lisa,"okay, i'll watch tv."
43655,Lisa,well i can't. you'll just have to learn to live with your mental problem.
45295,Lisa,"boy, i can really be a pain in the butt."
43538,Lisa,have you told mom about this?
41932,Lisa,uh... take us to the video store.
42373,Lisa,glad you liked it.
42121,Lisa,sideshow bob!
44983,Lisa,you don't have to worry about finding dates or dancing.
49641,Lisa,"sorry bart, i couldn't do it! there's got to be another way."
50325,Lisa,"easter grass, cable ace awards, aquariums full of broken pinball game parts, popped but uneaten jiffy pop still in the silver bubble, sample-sized shampoos, detergents and whiskeys..."
44176,Lisa,why hasn't anyone called?
44428,Lisa,that one!
49309,Lisa,"oh mom, it's perfect!"
44616,Lisa,"watch yourself, dad. you're the highly suggestible type."
48322,Lisa,"mom, i'm scared."
47628,Lisa,"gee, i never noticed that before."
50408,Lisa,"bart, this isn't a photograph. i'm not just gonna paint you into--"
51190,Lisa,hey!
45071,Lisa,i washed the dog today.
47514,Lisa,mom! dad! there's a ghost in the house!
43335,Lisa,yeah.
46924,Lisa,"i was framed! you believe me, don't you dad?"
41929,Lisa,"giddyup, dad."
47856,Lisa,yes. the clerk also gave me this bench warrant for dad's arrest.
46179,Lisa,why don't you just cook less?
52093,Lisa,botz.
48741,Lisa,maybe there's something in dad's backpack.
42105,Lisa,"but, mom, next week is volume four: copernicus through elephantiasis."
45313,Lisa,"mom, i need to get some sleep! i have a test tomorrow in birds suddenly appear. i mean, english."
46848,Lisa,"dad, i'm telling you, truman wins."
51710,Lisa,"oh no! king toot's is closed! dad, you're gonna have to take me to the... big box music store."
42735,Lisa,this is great! they're really gonna sell our doll.
43321,Lisa,it must be awful to be all alone in the world.
44832,Lisa,i've got some!
44949,Lisa,"so, there i am being nice to alex, and she takes all of my friends and ditches me."
45599,Lisa,"well, i guess that's it. come christmas eve, there'll be a funzo under every tree."
50386,Lisa,"wait, i know he's an unethical magician, and his tattoos are a inconsistent mix of hieroglyphics and cuneiforms. but he doesn't deserve to die."
47625,Lisa,swim toward san francisco!
41988,Lisa,"...three, two, one..."
52471,Lisa,wanna go to a concert tonight? sixty-eight percent of the original cher is playing.
50840,Lisa,"all right, broadway's too expensive, the museums are over-curated -- but shakespeare in the park is tonight, and the tickets are free!"
43956,Lisa,oh! the whole forest is blooming!
45376,Lisa,"oh, i think this really sucks."
50654,Lisa,"as i was saying, springface was used in ways i never expected."
44100,Lisa,"uh, mom?"
50726,Lisa,...you promised to help me write a haiku...
46119,Lisa,uh-oh. dad's having an antacid trip.
49724,Lisa,i'm a freakin' buddhist! a buddhist!
51908,Lisa,arrrgh!
50338,Lisa,initiate phase two.
44802,Lisa,"""bart's show."" if everybody knew what a phony bart was, he'd be off that show so fast... i've got it!"
49814,Lisa,"listen: ""april 20th, 1860. a week ago, i had no idea what the future would bring, which, i guess, is always true of everyone all the time. anyway, last saturday night, i went to colonel burns's ball..."""
52036,Lisa,ewwwww!
51135,Lisa,those are bedbugs!
50679,Lisa,"man, that company thinks every time it adds a wisecracking parrot to a story, they own it."
45116,Lisa,keep the change.
44296,Lisa,"no, i'm not!"
43953,Lisa,wildflowers! we don't have you in springfield!
43748,Lisa,i still don't understand why you get to stay home and watch mom work.
44972,Lisa,you're taking me! you got that?! and it's gonna be a magical evening!
52419,Lisa,"no! no! it wasn't me! i would never do anything like that. it was just one of those immature people who, instead of building themselves up --"
42922,Lisa,"it was an unusually warm february 14th, so the children walked home without jackets."
46763,Lisa,"dad, make him stop!"
51754,Lisa,it's called a knot.
45300,Lisa,lousy meat-eating scum.
43192,Lisa,wow. how many pulitzer prizes winners can do that?
41948,Lisa,is anything wrong?
49413,Lisa,i waaarned you.
52346,Lisa,the mouse is named itchy.
43643,Lisa,"i'm gonna ask people if they know their servants' last names, or, in the case of butlers, their first."
45381,Lisa,you.
43701,Lisa,"oh, dad, i'm really sorry. i know how much you wanted to be in the parade."
45093,Lisa,yes!
45876,Lisa,"forget it, dad. i guess i'm never gonna be your broadway baby."
50732,Lisa,"""stranded"" was a show about people marooned on a mysterious island that's riddled with religious and scientific paradoxes. it was huge! well, the first season and the last season."
50447,Lisa,it's real. i can show you!
42514,Lisa,"excuse me, but i think if we all do our fair share, we can keep this house clean."
43492,Lisa,there! is everybody happy now?!
43365,Lisa,"mom, was catching that guy the most incredibly exciting thing you've ever done?"
50417,Lisa,why would a popular fifth-grader like taffy be interested in a milhouse like milhouse?
48812,Lisa,the dance isn't till next week.
51191,Lisa,"i'm glad you're back, dad. it's hard to sleep with one un-kissed cheek."
42726,Lisa,"but you are malibu stacy, and as long as she has your name, you have a responsibility. i'd be mortified if someone ever made a lousy product with the simpson name on it."
49002,Lisa,this is so hard!
43100,Lisa,"dad, mom's getting worse. you have to take her to see a real psychiatrist. look how tense she is."
51952,Lisa,no. not really.
47689,Lisa,i can't believe my mom would cheat.
45775,Lisa,are you insane?
45642,Lisa,"bart, you were supposed to scour the pans!"
47019,Lisa,"dad, you do care!"
42444,Lisa,april first used to be the pagan new year.
46913,Lisa,"dad, you've had eight years to get to know me. it's too late."
52059,Lisa,the cannon. the cannon. the cannon. the cannon.
42249,Lisa,"bart, please. don't you remember that snowball i died four years ago tonight? run over by the mayor's beer swilling brother, clovis."
47773,Lisa,"you're in big trouble, mister. i'm bleeding!"
45578,Lisa,"the word is ""irony."""
42721,Lisa,excuse me. miss lovell? i'd like to talk to you about malibu stacy.
46513,Lisa,could this be the end of our series... of events?
44418,Lisa,"look, mama!"
51299,Lisa,how do you know my name?
49303,Lisa,how do we catch her without hurting her?
44435,Lisa,i'm happy for you.
49673,Lisa,did you girls make miss hoover sick?
49106,Lisa,that doesn't sound like your kind of movie.
46522,Lisa,"here, have one of my fudge-stuffed toaster pies."
44872,Lisa,"uh-huh. um, listen, i'm kind of lost. do you think you could give me a lift downtown?"
49311,Lisa,"oh, i miss them."
43047,Lisa,"hey milhouse, knock him down if he's in your way! jimbo! jimbo! go for the face! look! ralph wiggum lost his shin guard! hack the bone! hack the bone!"
51280,Lisa,"actually, i've been hit by the unfair labor practices bug."
46479,Lisa,i just came down for a glass of water.
44197,Lisa,"bart, if you don't want to have a babysitter, maybe you should stop being such a baby."
43460,Lisa,awwww.
42941,Lisa,dad! remember how you said that going to itchy and scratchy land would be too damned expensive?
48145,Lisa,this election is out of control. someone terrible could win!
47074,Lisa,"okay, jupiter should be somewhere around here..."
45173,Lisa,"what a beautiful night... fireflies, full moon..."
51002,Lisa,"...but, bart, i do know this: you will not do better than mary spuckler, so don't ignore her for a stupid video game!"
46605,Lisa,"what are you laughing at, dad?"
43070,Lisa,no.
49515,Lisa,mom! mom! we know where dad is!
51045,Lisa,confident... vassar sticker on the windshield... could it be... do i detect... enthusiasm?!
45678,Lisa,"how can you believe all this mumbo-jumbo? the bucket came off dad's head because the bright lights heated it, causing the metal to expand."
47043,Lisa,you said you were gonna get rid of the airplanes over our house. and now they're worse than ever.
49991,Lisa,"now, let's scoot together."
43324,Lisa,"wow, you've had some career. although the moral seems to be that a lifetime of jazz leaves you sad and lonely."
48405,Lisa,"evolution is widely acknowledged as scientific fact. it's even accepted by prominent conservatives, like george will and the late pope john paul!"
45538,Lisa,no thanks. i'm still finishing my thistles.
48692,Lisa,what happened to the ref?
46339,Lisa,"well, i've been cutting the felt kinda crooked."
45326,Lisa,"hmm, well, actually, it looks like we're in for forty years of wandering the desert."
51960,Lisa,i was just playing the blues... ...dad.
44554,Lisa,wow! / your own billboard! / check it out!
45826,Lisa,"oh, no! we came during spring break!"
43770,Lisa,okay. time for truth or dare. you go first.
46258,Lisa,are we insane yet? are we insane yet? are we insane yet?
51018,Lisa,i get it. middle child. never do what i want.
43348,Lisa,"mom, i want to honor bleeding gums' memory, but i don't know where to start."
44564,Lisa,"hey, why don't we walk over to grampa's and cheer up the old folks? that'll make us feel better."
49647,Lisa,cows eating cows?! that's an abomination!
50605,Lisa,they self-reference each other.
43887,Lisa,"that's a hermit crab. when she outgrows her old shell, she finds a new one that's a better fit."
45148,Lisa,"besides, nothing's too good for a wonderful, generous man like you."
43424,Lisa,no i don't!
44572,Lisa,why you little...
52401,Lisa,"mom, these are really good. while i know first-hand how fragile young talent is, i'd love to hear the particulars of how your gift was squashed."
46294,Lisa,sorry. i was rushing because i'm in the wrong school. can you believe that?
43776,Lisa,okay. i like...
43767,Lisa,"zagnut bar, mr. smithers? razzles? skittles? whatchamacallit? twizzlers?"
51565,Lisa,what if i just taught you how to whistle?
51713,Lisa,it's so cool to have another musician in the family!
48206,Lisa,"that's quite a tale, grampa."
44838,Lisa,"bart, did you glue those on?"
45486,Lisa,hm. what's the english equivalent for ? i'd say... transcendent.
50174,Lisa,cloisters academy?! that bus could pick me up any day of the week!
45534,Lisa,are we really gonna live here and grow crops?
42946,Lisa,mom! dad! bart's dead!
43985,Lisa,"mom, calm down. the party's not for another three hours."
51552,Lisa,"beans, beans. we'll do beans."
49801,Lisa,"""dearest diary, today i am the happiest girl in springfield--"""
46695,Lisa,mine tastes like dog fur.
43315,Lisa,it's been a long time.
47097,Lisa,concert in golden gate park.
44677,Lisa,"actually, we can't take a bath anyway. the water heater is broken."
50265,Lisa,"your four eyes saw a lot today, milhouse. what's the skinny?"
50175,Lisa,"lord buddha, i know i'm not supposed to want stuff, but c'mon."
49266,Lisa,"""last clue: ""loses on purpose"". hmmm... ""diets!"" oh, will shortz, you clever rascal."
45344,Lisa,"good work, dad."
48629,Lisa,"bart, that's a blowhole!"
51593,Lisa,i'm gonna tell every psychiatrist i ever go to what you did.
48163,Lisa,"oh, hey milhouse. i think bart's upstairs."
42319,Lisa,we feel neither highs nor lows.
49383,Lisa,"it's a special place, but i need to live in the real world."
45187,Lisa,and guess who's been practicing medicine without a license...
47152,Lisa,"actually, frank lloyd wright endured a lot of harsh criticism."
42453,Lisa,is a coma painful?
47616,Lisa,i'd like to say something about the current climate of repression and fear.
50243,Lisa,"see? every time we get a tree, mom disappears!"
50795,Lisa,"please, i've had enough attention for one day!"
41845,Lisa,a role model in my very own home. how convenient.
50923,Lisa,you did that to help me out!
51673,Lisa,assemblywoman lombard! you got my emails!
42137,Lisa,no. it's two weeks since you got that subliminal weight loss tape. let's get you on the scale.
51546,Lisa,is kobayashi the number one... um... uh...
47738,Lisa,chloe is amazing -- even her serving bowl smells glamorous.
44887,Lisa,i guess...
51021,Lisa,milhouse?
42000,Lisa,"hey, the new sign is really working."
51483,Lisa,i just wish the grey one had the brown one's personality!
51230,Lisa,...so we hitched us a ride on a three-hump gumbamel!
51122,Lisa,"hush, sweet boy. let me get lost in the blue of your eyebrows."
48411,Lisa,i have an issue i'd like to raise!
43634,Lisa,you know how a horse goes like this? mom? like this? mom?
50034,Lisa,tomatoes? what kind of artists are you?
51749,Lisa,"i win, i think."
45411,Lisa,"please stay calm, everyone."
48093,Lisa,i think i'll be okay by myself.
45591,Lisa,you people took advantage of trusting schoolchildren!
51249,Lisa,maybe the best way to keep students from cheating is to trust them not to cheat.
44910,Lisa,wow! this is the best anniversary ever.
50557,Lisa,"there, finished. now if i win just two more games of online boggle, i'll be ready to start writing."
51431,Lisa,miss hoover?
42759,Lisa,"he's hungry. here you go, stampy. eat it slow. it has to last for..."
50506,Lisa,"bart, isn't that awfully similar to the cootie patch you did last year?"
43533,Lisa,no.
42059,Lisa,maybe we should write her another letter. one that says good-bye but lets her feel loved.
43363,Lisa,one more time!
46739,Lisa,what are you doing?
47072,Lisa,what happened?
43521,Lisa,"mom, dad -- martin died at school today!"
45954,Lisa,mom!
44031,Lisa,"i know it's a change, but it really highlights your sweet and sensitive side."
50978,Lisa,"so, how's the studying going?"
47920,Lisa,what is it that they have that keeps snowball coming back to their house?
49906,Lisa,"but dad, it defeats the purpose if you're powering our windmill with the electricity from flanders."
45494,Lisa,but what if someone bad tells me to...
45327,Lisa,"uh, more or less. hey, is that manna?"
50802,Lisa,"well, it worked once."
44316,Lisa,"oh, i can't get the smell of slurry out of my clothes! i was a fool to help that horrible old man!"
45453,Lisa,"oh sorry, dad, we didn't know."
43446,Lisa,what? how could you do that? your soul is the most valuable part of you!
49239,Lisa,cruciverbalists from far and wide have gathered here for a no-holds-barred test of skill.
51134,Lisa,"all right, get comfy."
49747,Lisa,it's still on / in my head / it will be there till i'm dead...
46673,Lisa,wait! what about maggie's memories? surely the innocent soul of a child will redeem mankind.
44499,Lisa,"my attorney, lionel hutz, calls your attention to municipal code 147-c: ""protection of antiquities and fossils."""
46564,Lisa,"well, if you don't feel the way greta does, you've got to tell her before she gets hurt."
52342,Lisa,pony ride!
50584,Lisa,does anybody want my opinion?
50996,Lisa,"princeton, b.a., oxford, m.a. -- i smell a rhodes."
52522,Lisa,"ignore, ignore, ignore... ooh, martin prince is now ""marcia princess?"" no, i've got to find zia."
42029,Lisa,"if i still love you, dallas. if i don't, buffalo."
47159,Lisa,"yeah, don't listen to him mr. duff the seventh. we took this dog in and loved him, and that makes him ours."
50712,Lisa,"yo, mysterious pranksters, it's time for dinner."
52301,Lisa,"dad, are you sure this isn't stealing?"
43270,Lisa,what's santa's little helper doing to that dog?
48123,Lisa,mid-june?
50419,Lisa,hmm...
45695,Lisa,"ah, it's good to be home."
46675,Lisa,"as head of the student activities committee, i have an idea."
51732,Lisa,this is us.
50273,Lisa,fine. just get in here.
50808,Lisa,"don't ""monster"" me."
42333,Lisa,but the ride only takes a minute.
42972,Lisa,"when he got out, he married aunt selma and tried to murder her."
48333,Lisa,seventy-four.
44956,Lisa,"yeah, it's great. we have pony rides, sing-alongs, apple-bobbing, apple-picking, apple everything."
41793,Lisa,"no, really, what?"
41844,Lisa,"bart, you're not laughing. too subtle?"
41713,Lisa,i don't have any banana.
45825,Lisa,mom! bart's sitting next to me!

50567,Lisa,"i was raised in a traveling circus. my mother was a lady ringmaster and my father was a lion barber. i wrote my first story with clown lipstick on a flattened popcorn box. it was featured in the new yorker's ""best forty under four"" issue."

47407,Lisa,"mom, i can't find anything on sacagawea. just a couple books on ron santo."
